It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape  
And that I've been waking up alone  
Just me and the tv and a sinking feeling  
That you ain't ever coming home  
  
But today,  
The tears ain't gonna hit the floor  
Cause the boat's in the bay  
And it's calling my name  
So I'm heading on out the door  
  
Cause the sun's too bright,  
The sky's too blue  
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
When I turned the ignition  
I knew I'd be missing  
The feel of the wind on my face  
I was stuck in a habit  
  
Wondering what happened  
Two days of taking all the blame  
Got a drink, or two,  
That's as fool proof as what it will be  
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl  
Kind of making eyes at me  
  
Cause the sun's too bright,  
The sky's too blue  
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
Yeah, the music's too good,  
My friends are all out  
And they're all too high to be bringing them down  
If they ask about you  
I've got nothing to say  
I'll save it for a rainy day  
  
They'll be plenty of time for ones and why's  
And how'd I let you get away  
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head  
Is just gonna have to wait  
  
Cause the sun's too bright,  
The sky's too blue  
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
Yeah, the music's too good,  
My friends are all out  
And they're all too high to be bringing them down  
If they ask about you  
I've got nothing to say  
I'll save it for a rainy day  
  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
Save it for a rainy day
