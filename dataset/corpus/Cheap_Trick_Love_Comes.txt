Love comes 'round just in time  
Something that's hard to find  
Oh, no one knows what i've been goin' through  
Same old song, how does it go?  
Same old line, is it all we know?  
And love comes 'round  
In time to rescue me  
  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Just in time  
Love comes to save my heart (save my heart)  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Love comes to save my heart (love comes 'round)  
  
Love comes 'round just in time  
Something that's hard to find  
Oh kiss me now  
You know i want you to  
  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Just in time  
Love comes to save my heart (save my heart)  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Yes it does  
Love comes to save my heart (love comes 'round)  
  
Sometimes it slips on in slowly  
Sometimes it makes itself lonely  
Under the cover of darkness  
Sometimes it feels oh so heartless  
Oh love! (love comes around)  
  
Save my heart  
Love comes around (love comes around)  
(love comes around) yes it does  
Love comes to save my heart (save my heart)  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Love comes to save my heart (love comes 'round)  
Love comes around  
Love comes to save my heart
