How did I drink in here, playing the same song  
Eating potato skins  
There's nowhere to go  
We're still in Ohio  
Mountain dew  
  
Drinking Coca-Cola, eating cheeseburgers  
Where the french fries are  
Hungry for my life and putrefactive  
Mountain dew  
  
Every time, I drank it all at once  
At the restaurant  
That's my name  
I could make it after all  
Even if I drank again  
  
Every night I slept  
My face don't wanna turn red  
All I want to do  
I thank my friends to meet  
That I had to dream  
Mountain dew  
  
Every time, I drank it all at once  
At the restaurant  
That's my name  
I could make it after all  
Even if I drank again  
  
How did I drink in here, playing the same song  
Not another thing  
I think I'm grown up  
Making pizza crust  
Mountain dew  
Mountain dew
