[Cornelius:]  
It only takes a moment  
For your eyes to meet and then  
Your heart knows in a moment  
You will never be alone again  
I held her for an instant  
But my arms felt sure and strong  
It only takes a moment  
To be loved a whole life long...  
Clerk:  
I missed a few words back there, Mr. Hackl.  
Right after 'it only'...  
  
[All in docket:]  
...Takes a moment!  
But his arms felt sure and strong  
It only takes a moment  
  
[Mrs. Molloy:]  
He held me for an instant  
But his arms felt safe and strong  
It only takes a moment  
To be loved a whole life long  
  
[Cornelius:]  
And that is all  
That love's about  
  
[Mrs. Molloy:]  
And we'll recall when time runs out  
  
[Both:]  
That it only took a moment  
To be loved a whole life long!
