We're the Pet Shop Boys  
Suburbia's a slipstream  
To a memory  
Of a time when you were  
Close to me  
I pretend  
I'm there again  
I close my eyes and see you  
Better than before  
Then I feel you touch me  
And it's 1984  
I know what you will say  
Before you start  
In my heart  
  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
  
Every thought's a fashion  
Or a crime  
And every boy is just  
A waste of time  
But I pretend  
It was different then  
Maybe it's a habit  
Maybe it's a sin  
But I find out  
When I try it on  
It crawls beneath my skin  
Once it gets inside me  
It won't go  
Now I know  
  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
  
Rent  
Shopping  
Being boring  
It's alright  
It's a sin  
I'm not scared  
In denial  
I want a dog  
I want a lover  
Can you forgive her?  
Do I have to?  
What have I? What have I?  
What have I done to deserve this?  
  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
We're the Pet Shop Boys
