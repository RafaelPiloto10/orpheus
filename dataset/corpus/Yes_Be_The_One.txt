Never underestimate the loving  
How we intertwine our very soul  
How we fill each other's spaces to lose control  
When you're talking, be the children  
Who stand on solid ground  
Never underestimate the giving that will bring you around  
  
I'll be there, to bring this love in the morning  
I'll be there, to bring you the stars at night  
I'll be there, just waiting to hear you singing  
  
Never underestimate a giver  
The gift of love will surely be  
When you're asking for the secrets to set you free  
When you're talking to the friendship  
That love of higher self  
This gift of love is the answer to all your doubts  
  
Be the one, giving in to love  
Never let the good in life desert you  
Be the one, giving in to love  
Never let the fools destroy your dreams  
Be the one, giving in to love  
I can dream myself every minute  
So how did we become, masters of limitation?  
  
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there  
To make it right for you  
  
Giving in, giving in to love  
It's the balance of this everyday feeling  
Giving in, giving in to love  
Without love our dreams become illusion  
Giving in, giving in to love  
I can hear you singing every minute  
So you can sing the song, and see the truth  
  
So we worked all around amidst the glory of life  
Any fire of the flame would be made  
Should the famine of change to disguise everyone  
Who cannot see the soul of truth ready made  
But all because we're changing now  
As the prophets of doom speak their mind  
It's a long, long way from where mankind began  
It's a long, long way humankind  
  
So we dance down on nature as we try to repeat  
All our efforts as one sent today  
Taking back instead of giving, taking back more or less  
Taking back a sense of being afraid  
So all this necessary changes now, as the will to help all man  
And the children of the crucified will better off, better dead  
  
But all this senseless killing, and all these chains and lies  
I want to know right now, I want to know right now  
I want to know where we come from  
For it's a long, long way from where the system began  
It's a long, long way humankind  
It's a long, long way from where the system began  
It's a long, long way humankind, yea  
  
Giving in, giving in to love  
I can see and feel the truth every minute  
Giving in, giving in to love  
Be the one to rescue you, rescue you  
Giving in, giving in to love  
There's no way that you can live without it  
So we can become, masters of our invention  
  
Giving in, giving in to love  
I can see and feel the truth every minute  
Giving in, giving in to love  
Be the one to rescue you, rescue you  
Giving in, giving in to love  
There's no way that you can live without it  
So we can become, masters of our invention  
  
Never underestimate the power  
Never underestimate the power
