Mad Professor Blyth is working on his pet invention  
To dematerialise himself into the fourth dimension  
He's got his mind set on illusion  
To find the secrets of diffusion  
Conclusion: he disappeared  
  
Tried it on his cat one grey night when it was foggy  
Never got it back Oh what happened to his Moggy  
He's got his mind set on illusion  
To find the secrets of diffusion  
Conclusion: he's disappeared  
  
All the kids around about his neighbourhood  
Used to laugh at him and call him names  
Silly old bat freaky four-eyes  
Sort of things they used to shout  
He can't hear them now  
  
He's disappeared  
Colleagues at the lab  
They all thought that he was crazy  
Don't know where he's at  
His formulas to them are hazy  
  
He had his mind set on illusion  
He found the secrets of diffusion  
Conclusion: he's disappeared
