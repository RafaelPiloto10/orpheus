There once was an Indian brave by the name of Yellow Hand  
He fell in love with a maiden know as White Sands  
They vowed their love would last forever more  
Then came the day that they had waited for.  
  
Yellow Hand brought her a golden feather  
White Sands said a prayer for good weather  
The ceremonial dance grew loud and strong  
Then Yellow Hand began their wedding song.  
  
Oooooh Oooooh Oooh Ooooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
Tonight, tonight, We will be one  
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun  
Oh White Sands, come hold my lonely hand.  
  
Then they left the warmth of the raging fire  
And rode into the hills climbing higher  
And suddenly the snow came swirling down  
They were lost the trail could not be found.  
  
Oooooh Oooooh Oooh Ooooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
Tonight, tonight We will be one  
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun  
Oh White Sands, Come hold my lonely hand.  
  
They never returned from Paradise  
They went to their places in the sky  
And the old ones still say when the snowflakes fly  
If you'll listen close you'll hear him cry:  
  
Oooooh Oooooh Oooh Ooooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
Tonight, tonight We will be one  
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun  
Oh White Sands, Come hold my lonely hand
