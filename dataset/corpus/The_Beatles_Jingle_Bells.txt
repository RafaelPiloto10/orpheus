Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh  
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way  
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!  
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!  
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh  
  
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride  
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side  
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot  
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
A day or two ago, the story I must tell  
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell  
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh  
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young  
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song  
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed  
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead  
  
[Chorus:]
