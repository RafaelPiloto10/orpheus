State of life, may I live, may I love  
Coming out the sky, I name me a name  
Coming out silver word for what it is  
It is very nature of the sound, the game  
  
Shablamidi, shablamida  
Shablamidi, shablamida  
Shablamidi, shablamida  
  
Shablimidi, shablamida  
Shablimidi, shablamida  
Shablimidi, shablamida  
  
Shot to the soul the flame of oroladian  
Essence of the word  
The state of independence  
  
Sounds like a signal from you  
Bring me to meet your sound  
And I will bring you to my heart  
  
Love, like a signal you call  
Touching my body, my soul  
Bring to me, you to meet me here  
  
Home, be the temple of your heart  
Home, be the body of your love  
Just like holy water to my lips  
(Hey, hey)  
  
Yes, I do know how I survive  
Yes, I do know why I'm alive  
To love and be with you  
Day by day by day by day  
  
Time, time again, it is said  
We will hear, we will see  
See it all in his wisdom hear  
  
His truth will abound the land  
This truth will abound the land  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
  
Say, yeah-e-yay, yeah-e-yo  
Yeah-e-yay, yeah-e-yo  
Be the sound of higher love today  
Yeah-e-yeah (hey, hey)  
  
Time, time again, it is said  
We will hear, we will see  
See it all in his wisdom hear  
  
His truth will abound the land  
This truth will abound the land  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be
