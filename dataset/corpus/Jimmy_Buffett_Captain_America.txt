Can you tell me where I might find my friend and companion  
Now he looks a little different from anything you've seen  
He likes to beat the bass drum for justice and salvation  
He's got the brains of einstein and the brawn of mister clean  
He's a lightnin' flash who'll make the dash from one coast to the other  
To stop a crime or lend a dime or help his aging mother  
Captain america we love you, captain america you're grand  
Oh spiro agnew eat your heart out captain america's our man  
Now he wears a mask his clothes are weird and some folks call him hokie  
But he is hip he just can't dig the okie from muskogie  
Captain will help anyone a friend or a stranger  
Now number one without a gun he's bypassed the lone ranger  
He's a do do good who loves apple pie and kisses little babies  
He'll guard you against everything from atom bombs to rabies  
Captain america we love you, captain america you're grand  
Oh spiro agnew eat your heart out captain america's our man  
Can you tell me where I might find my friend and companion  
He looks a little different from anything you've seen  
He likes to beat the bass drum for justice and salvation  
He's got the brains of einstein and the bod of mister clean  
He's a lightnin' flash who'll make the dash from one coast to the other  
To stop a crime or lend a dime or help his aging mother  
Captain america we love you, captain america you're grand  
Oh spiro agnew eat your heart out captain america's our man  
Captain america's our man
