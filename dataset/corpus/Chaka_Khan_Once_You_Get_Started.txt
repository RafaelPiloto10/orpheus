Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop  
You can't stop you just can't stop  
When you get down y'all  
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no  
Everybody party hearty  
To get back in the groove  
I like the way you do it .. way you do it  
I like the way you move  
It's a good thing  
Hear a funky sound  
Everybody let's get on down  
You gon do it like you never done before  
Hey .. hey  
I just want you to know that  
Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop  
You can't stop you just can't stop  
When you get down y'all  
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no  
Everybody party hearty  
To get right in the groove  
I love the way you do it .. way you do it  
I like the way you move  
It's the new thing  
When ya know that ya getting' on down, yeah  
Everybody come on y'all and get down with me  
You can do it like you never done before, yeah  
Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop  
You can't stop you just can't stop  
When you get down y'all  
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no  
Now that ya got down  
We just wanna say  
If you dig the funky, funky music  
Come on and move it this way  
Come on and move, come on and groove (repeat to end)
