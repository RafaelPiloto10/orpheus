Hey, come this May,  
We'll be running in the sun again, your time will come.  
You're just a young broken heart.  
Been out sleepin' in the yard, how could you be so dumb?  
  
[CHORUS:]  
All we losers stand in line just waiting for our time.  
Broken angel take that plane and finger paint the sky,  
'Til everything shines,  
Everything shines,  
Everything shines,  
Everything shines.  
Hey broken clock,  
Hhaven't heard your old tick tocking man for much too long,  
And lonely jukebox,  
Iin the corner of the nightclub, man, I need your song  
(I need your song)  
  
[CHORUS]
