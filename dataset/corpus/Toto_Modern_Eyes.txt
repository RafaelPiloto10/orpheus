She know you bad  
You don't sing songs of love  
She treats you right, she treats you like a web of love  
You know who's of the heart, her notions of societies  
You belong to know and just like our sophiaties  
(Chorus:)  
Modern eyes  
Modern eyes, to see what you want to see  
Modern eyes  
Modern eyes, she'll paint you with the modern eyes  
What you look for in people is not hard to recognize  
Black man, white man, short man  
They're all the same in size  
You breath the air, you feel the sea and the sand and the skies  
When nighttime comes you blind men with modern eyes  
(Repeat chorus)  
She'll paint you with the hupskin on  
She'll paint you with the fire in your eyes  
She'll paint you with the modern eyes  
(Repeat chorus)
