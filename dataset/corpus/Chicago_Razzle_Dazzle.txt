It's all show business kid  
These trials, the whole world, show business  
But kid, you're workin' with a star, the biggest  
  
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it  
And the reaction will be passionate  
  
Give 'em the old hocus pocus  
Bead and feather 'em  
How can they see with sequins in their eyes?  
What if your hinges all are rusting?  
What if, in fact, you're just disgusting?  
  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
And they'll never catch wise  
  
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
Back since the days of old Methuselah  
Everyone loves the big bamboozler  
  
Give 'em the old three ring circus  
Stun and stagger 'em  
When you're in trouble, go into your dance  
Though you are stiffer than a girder  
They let you get away with murder  
  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
And you've got a romance  
  
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
Give 'em an act that's unassailable  
They'll wait a year 'till you're available  
  
Give 'em the old, double whammy  
Daze and dizzy 'em  
Show 'em the first rate sorcerer you are  
Long as you keep 'em way off balance  
How can they spot, you got no talents?  
  
Razzle dazzle 'em, razzle dazzle 'em  
And they'll make you a star
