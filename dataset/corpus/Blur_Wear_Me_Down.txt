Every time I come here  
I'm not sure what to say  
I know it should be easy  
But it never seems that way  
  
You, you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
So why, why do you bore me  
Until my heart is still?  
  
[Chorus]  
You, you wear me down  
My defenses are gone now  
And I can't fight  
You, you wear me down  
My defenses are gone now  
And I can't fight  
  
I can't say I love you easily  
But you wouldn't want me to  
So I'd rather just say nothing  
And leave it up to you  
  
Then it's easy to forget  
You're just as small as me  
Then it's easy to forget  
You're just as foolish as me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You, you make me feel  
Like no one ever will  
So why, why do you bore me  
Until my heart is still?  
  
[Chorus]
