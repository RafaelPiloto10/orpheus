Oh you know that I've come back and we've tried it all over  
But each time my dear, it was worse than before  
Now my heart is broke, it's sad and it's sore  
So never again will I knock on your door  
  
Oh you know that I love you no other will do  
Please tell me darlin' why can't you be true  
But now you are gone, it's over and so  
Never again will I knock on your door  
  
Someday you'll be so lonely and blue  
Then you will know just how much I love you  
But now you are gone, it's over and so  
Never again will I knock on your door  
  
Many a night I've cried over you  
Hoping and prayin' some day you'd be true  
But now you are gone, it's over I know  
So never again will I knock on your door  
  
Oh you know that I love you no other will do  
Please tell me darlin' why can't you be true  
But now you are gone, it's over and so  
Never again will I knock on your door
