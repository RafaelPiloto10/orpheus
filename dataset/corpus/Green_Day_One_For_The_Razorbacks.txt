Juliet's trying to find out what she wants,  
But she don't know  
Experience has got her down  
Look this direction, I know it's not perfection,  
It's just me  
I want to bring you up again now!  
  
I'm losing what's left of my dignity  
A small price to I'll pay to see that you're happy  
Forget all the disappointments you have faced  
Open up your worried world and let me in  
  
Juliet's crying, cause now she's realizing,  
Love can be, filled with pain and distrust.  
I know I am crazy, and a bit lazy  
But I will try to bring you up again some how!
