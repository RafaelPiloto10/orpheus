Heroes are hard to find  
  
I'm dancing, to the music  
Of a simple melody  
And i wonder are you thinking  
Of a single memory  
And i know when i see them swaying  
I can hear myself say  
  
Come a little bit closer  
(come a little bit closer)  
Cause i remember the time  
When you held me in your arms  
(come a little bit closer)  
And you wanted to be mine  
Everything good, everything gold  
And now all that's left is a sweet memory  
  
If you love me, let me know  
Why don't you show me which way to go  
Please don't leave me all alone  
Cause i can't make it on my own  
And i know when i see them swaying  
I can hear myself say  
  
Come a little bit closer  
(come a little bit closer)  
Cause i remember the time  
When you held me in your arms  
(come a little bit closer)  
And you wanted to be mine  
I might but wrong but that's where i belong  
Why are you just a sweet memory  
  
Come a little bit closer  
(come a little bit closer)  
Cause i remember the time  
When you held me in your arms  
(come a little bit closer)  
And you wanted to be mine  
Everything good, everything gold  
Why are you just a sweet memory  
  
(come a little bit closer)  
(come a little bit closer)  
(come a little closer)  
(come a little closer)
