That some day you'll be crawling, crawling back to me.  
Oh, but I was wrong.  
'Cause love is much too strong.  
  
So, all you got to do is-uh  
Just let me know and I'll (ah, come back) come running back.

And I'll (ah, come back) come running back.  
As fast as I can, baby. (Straight to you)
