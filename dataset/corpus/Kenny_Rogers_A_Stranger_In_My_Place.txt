I see the town  
Where we were born,  
I see the place  
We were raised,  
  
I see all the things you wanted  
That I never gave.  
I see sadness,  
I see sorrow,  
  
I see pain in your face,  
But I just can't see  
A stranger in my place.  
  
I can see now where we quarrelled,  
I can see now I was wrong,  
I can see where you might weaken  
  
When I wasn't strong.  
I see memories of a love gone bad  
That time cannot erase,  
But I just can't see a stranger in my place.  
  
No one seems to know you quite like I do,  
No one knows the thigs that make you cry.  
Looking back it seems  
I never showed you,  
  
And now I lay alone and wonder why.  
I can see now  
Where you might grow tired of dreams  
That don't come true,  
  
I can see where I have fallen short  
Of the things I promised you.  
I can see mow through my tear filled eyes no love on your face,  
I must get used to seein' strangers in my place.
