Why don't you ever listen?  
It's you I'm talking to  
This time it's your decision  
We're into something new  
I know that I'm sinking  
Oh any fool can see  
Time that I was thinking  
Of no-one else but me  
  
Change your mind  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Change your mind  
No-one ever plays the game game game  
Change your mind  
Give up what you can't defend  
Change your mind  
Think it up and start again 'gain 'gain  
  
Why can't you reconsider  
Listen if you care  
Take familiar giver  
Reject me if you dare  
Give me what I'm asking  
And save it all for me  
Love that's everlasting  
That's how it's meant to be  
  
Change your mind  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Change your mind  
No-one ever plays the game game game  
Change your mind  
Give up what you can't defend  
Change your mind  
Think it up and start again 'gain 'gain  
  
Change your mind  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Change your mind  
No-one ever plays the game game game  
Change your mind  
Give up what you can't defend  
Change your mind  
Think it up and start again 'gain 'gain
