Oh, I woke up this morning  
A long before the dawn  
I stumbled to the kitchen  
And put some coffee on  
The house was deathly quiet  
I knew something was wrong  
Then suddenly it dawned on me  
The cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
When waking up and findin' out  
She's never comin' home  
And the note that said it's over  
Lord, it chills me to the bone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
Oh, I sat and cried for hours  
And I tried to clear my head  
I even went and laid back down  
On her side of the bed  
Her perfume lingered on the sheets  
Our love once laid upon  
Her memory's destroying me  
In the cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
When waking up and findin' out  
She's never comin' home  
And the note that said it's over  
Lord, it chills me to the bone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
When waking up and findin' out  
She's never comin' home  
And the note that said it's over  
Lord, it chills me to the bone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone
