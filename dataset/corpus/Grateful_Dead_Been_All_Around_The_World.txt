Up on the Blue Ridge Mountains, there I'll take my stand  
Up on the Blue Ridge Mountains, there I'll take my stand  
A rifle on my shoulder, six shooter in my hand  
Oh Lord, I been all around this world  
  
Lulu, my Lulu come and open the door  
Lulu, my Lulu come and open the door  
Before I have to walk in with my old forty-four  
Oh Lord, I been all around this world  
  
Mama and Papa, little sister makes three  
Mama and Papa, little sister makes three  
They're comin' in the mornin' that's the last you'll see of me  
Oh Lord, I been all around this world  
  
Hang me, oh, hang me, so I'll be dead and gone  
Hang me, oh, hang me, so I'll be dead and gone  
I wouldn't mind your hangin', boys but you wait in jail so long  
Oh Lord, I been all around this world  
  
Up on the Blue Ridge Mountains, there I'll take my stand  
Up on the Blue Ridge Mountains, there I'll take my stand  
A rifle on my shoulder, six shooter in my hand  
Oh Lord, I been all around this world
