There I stood with the sun in my eyes  
Dust on my face  
And mouth parched and dry  
Memories are racing  
Flashing scenes through my mind  
I know what's ahead  
Today would be a good day to die  
  
Once I thought I had a golden heart  
Once I thought my dreams would never shatter  
Now I stand here  
Jaded and cold  
Epitaph being carved on my tombstone  
  
I would die for you - would you die with me?  
No, you can't deny  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?  
Blaze across the sky  
  
Sun is going down  
And there's no tomorrow  
Sun is going down  
Going down on me  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Dance with the devil  
Sun is going down  
For the lonely hearted  
Sun is going down  
In a blink of an eye  
Sun is going down  
On the departed  
Laugh at the devil  
  
I would die for you - would you die with me?  
Caught in a fight  
I was drawn again  
I never thought I'd be betrayed  
By my best friend  
He lost his life as he went for mine  
If this is the end  
I want to die with you  
  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?  
Blaze across the sky  
  
Sun is going down  
Going down on me  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Dance with the devil  
Sun is going down  
For the lonely hearted  
Sun is going down  
In a blink of an eye  
Sun is going down  
On the departed  
Laugh at the devil  
  
I would die for you - would you die with me?  
No, you can't deny  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?  
Blaze across the sky  
  
Sun is going down  
Going down on me  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Dance with the devil  
Sun is going down  
For the lonely hearted  
Sun is going down  
In a blink of an eye  
Sun is going down  
On the departed  
Laugh at the devil  
  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Sun is going down  
Sun is going down  
Sun is going down  
...  
  
I would die for you - would you die with me?  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?
