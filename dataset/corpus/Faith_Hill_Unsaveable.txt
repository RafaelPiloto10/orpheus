Love  
So cruel  
Yeah that's all that I got from you  
Tell me what in the world could I do  
But leave  
After all that you've done to me  
Now it's so easy to say I'm over you  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause Baby I cried a little too hard  
A little too long  
What I thought was right  
Was way too wrong  
And too far gone  
I can't bring back the love  
There just ain't enough  
Available  
Impossible  
Unsaveable  
  
Here  
You come  
Tryin' to make up for what you've done  
It's too late to say you're sorry now  
Now it's your turn  
For you can't cross that bridge you burned  
You're on you own when will you learn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love  
There's someone out there for me  
Who thinks I'm beautiful  
I've got to go  
  
[Chorus]
