I was happy with the fear  
Every moon was new  
I was searching for myself  
When I found an angel  
There in the clouds, I flew  
Now it seems like forever  
Since I said that I've never  
Find a love whose aim was true  
But I found that love  
And I found myself in you  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I'm ready to touch somebody  
I'm ready to love someone  
I'm ready to listen to my heart and let you in  
I'm ready to touch somebody  
I'm ready to love someone  
I'm ready to finally feel something real in me  
  
I was running off the runway  
Too scared to land  
There was stardust in my eyes  
When I crashed into something I've never felt before (whoa)  
I survived the dive  
Now I'm finally alive  
Cause I'm right here in your arms  
And it's time that I live and its time that I give you more  
  
Cause, I'm ready to touch somebody  
I'm ready to love someone  
I'm ready to listen to my heart and let you in  
Now, I'm ready to touch somebody  
I'm ready to love someone  
I'm ready to finally feel something real in me  
  
This was meant to be  
Cause you were sent to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm ready to finally feel something real in me  
  
I'm Ready
