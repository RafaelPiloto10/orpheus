I think it was me it must have been me  
I guess I did something wrong  
I tried too hard  
Wanted too much  
I guess that's why it's gone  
  
I lost my pride, I fought and cried  
I felt like a little kid  
What's wrong with me?  
Still can't believe  
I did the things I did  
  
I couldn't change him  
He was gonna break my heart  
I saw it coming  
Yeah I knew it from the start  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you love (when you love)  
When you love someone like that, when you give what you can't take back  
When you love (when you love)  
With all your heart and soul, it's so hard to let it go  
When you love someone like that, when you love someone like that  
  
Girl it ain't right, it just ain't right  
Don't tell yourself that it was you  
You followed your heart,you gave it your best  
There's nothing more you can do  
  
Guys like him are like the wind  
And you know it's just too bad  
They blow in and out again and never know what they had  
  
Girl I can tell ya  
He'll do the same to someone else it ain't about you  
So don't be so hard on yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh we've all loved and lost  
It's happened to us all  
I hear what you're saying but I feel like the only one  
You might feel right but you're not  
You're alright (I'm alright)  
You're OK (I'm OK)  
You're gonna make it anyway (both)  
  
When you love (when you love)  
With all your heart and soul, it's so hard to let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're alright (I'm alright)  
You're OK (I'm OK)  
When you love someone like that... When you love
