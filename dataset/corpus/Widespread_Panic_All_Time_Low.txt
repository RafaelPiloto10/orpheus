Black heart sun rides the sky  
Now your eyes are running dry  
Oh, like the space around me  
I take my spot in time  
  
Who knows who is both your best friend and brother  
When everyone's deserted you  
Who'd shoot first and ask questions later  
If anybody's messed with you  
Pretty soon we'll all be tumblin' like a barrel  
Thrown from the top of the waterfall, well  
I'm drowning in piranhas in the river  
Man, what a drag, man  
  
Black heart sun rides the sky  
Now your wells are runnin' dry  
Like the space around me  
I take my spot in time  
  
Who knows who is both your best friend and brother  
When everyone's deserted you  
Who'd shoot first and ask questions later  
If anybody's messed with you  
Pretty soon we'll all be tumblin' like a barrel  
Thrown from the top of the waterfall, well  
I'm drowning in piranhas in the river  
Man, what a drag!  
Man, what a drag!  
Man, what a drag!  
  
I was talkin' to my teacher  
Said I didn't have a clue  
I think my principles are reachin'  
An all time low  
  
I saw my lady in the streetlight  
She was walkin' with her man  
They were headed for the fire  
That was burnin' in the sand  
I think my principles are reachin'  
An all time low  
  
I think my principles are reachin'  
An all time, all time low  
  
All time low  
All time low  
All time low  
All time low
