Suzanne takes you down  
To her place near the river  
You can hear the boats go by  
You can spend the night beside her  
And you know she's half crazy  
But that's why you want to be there  
And she feeds you tea and oranges  
That come all the way from China  
And just when you mean to tell her  
That you have no love to give her  
Then she gets you on her wavelength  
And she lets the river answer  
That you've always been her lover  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with her  
And you want to travel blind  
And you know she will trust you  
For you've touched her perfect body  
With your mind  
  
Now Jesus was a sailor  
When he walked upon the water  
And he spent a long time watching  
From his lonely wooden tower  
And when he knew for certain  
Only drowning men could see him  
He said  
All men shall be sailors then  
Until the sea shall free them  
But he himself was broken  
Long before the sky's would open  
Forsaken, almost human  
He sank beneath your wisdom  
Like a stone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Suzanne takes your hand  
And she leads you to the river  
She's wearing rags and feathers  
From Salvation Army counters  
And the sun pours down like honey  
On our Lady of the Harbor  
And she shows you where to look  
Among the garbage and the flowers  
There are heroes in the seaweed  
There are children in the morning  
They are leaning out for love  
They will lean that way forever  
While Suzanne holds the mirror  
  
[Chorus]
