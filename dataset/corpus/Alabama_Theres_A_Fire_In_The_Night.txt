Running scared  
Wonderin' what I'm doing so far from home  
Pretending not to care  
That I was so alone  
Then my eyes met hers  
And without one word  
I could tell what was gonna happen  
I could feel it in my bones  
  
By the dark of the moon  
There's a fire in the night  
She took me to her room  
Ah you know it felt so right  
It keeps growing higher  
The flame of desire  
By the dark of the moon  
Ah there's a fire in the night  
  
Well she told me  
She didn't often do this kind of thing  
She said please hold me  
Hold me tight so I don't have to think  
Oh her gentle touch  
Really moved me so much  
The flames of love swept over us  
Like a burning light  
  
By the dark of the moon  
There's a fire in the night  
She took me to her room  
Ah you know it felt so right  
It keeps growing higher  
The flame of desire  
By the dark of the moon  
Mm there's a fire in the night  
(Fire in the night)  
  
By the dark of the moon  
There's a fire in the night  
She took me to her room  
Ah you know it felt so right  
It keeps growing higher  
The flame of desire  
By the dark of the moon  
Oh there's a fire in the night  
  
There's a fire in the night  
We started a fire  
Oh  
  
There's a fire in the night  
Oh I'm on fire
