How can I show you?  
I take back what I told you.  
'Cause something happens when I hold you,  
And that makes everything all right.  
  
And oh... oh... I need you tonight.  
I just need you tonight.  
I wrote all I can write.  
I just need you tonight.  
  
In need you tonight.  
  
Secrets I keep here.  
Buried so very deep here.  
If only somehow you could sleep here,  
you'd make everything all right.
