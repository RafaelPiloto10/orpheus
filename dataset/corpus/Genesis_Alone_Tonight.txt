There's nothing here that I can understand  
And no one cares I'm a lonely man  
I touch your face and I don't know why  
I call your name but you're going by  
Now I'm alone again  
  
I have no name for each and every day  
Until the year is done and fades away  
There's a time in between the two  
The old years gone but it's not the new  
And I  
  
I know that I'll be all  
Alone again, alone again tonight, oh I'm  
Alone again, alone again tonight, oh I'm  
Alone again, it seems to me that every time I try to change  
Say that you'll, say that you'll  
Help me reach the other side  
  
When the morning comes, the sun is out  
And warms me up again  
What a funny world it is for me  
And all I'll ever be  
  
It's not enough, it's not enough  
This feeling I'm feeling inside  
Oh I know it, I know tonight that I'll be  
  
On my own again, alone again tonight  
Oh I'm alone again, alone again tonight Oh I'm alone again, it  
seems to me that every time I try to change  
Say that you'll, say that you'll  
Help me reach the other side  
  
Help me please 'cause I know I'm gonna be  
On my own again, alone again tonight  
Oh I'm alone again, alone again tonight Oh I'm alone again, it  
seems to me that every time I try to change  
Say that you'll, say that you'll  
Help me reach the other side
