Been a long time  
Since I've seen your face  
You've been on my mind  
Like a dream I can't erase  
Time is up now baby  
It's time for me to come home to you  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
Comin' home to you  
Been a long time  
Since last time we made love  
All the things we used to do baby  
All the things that made me fall in love  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
Comin' home to you  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you baby  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you baby  
Too long I've been walking around wondering  
Comin' home to you son  
Comin' home girl  
I've been missing you  
I've been missing you  
Yeah, on the road to heaven
