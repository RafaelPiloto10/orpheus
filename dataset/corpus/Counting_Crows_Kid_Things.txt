What's there that makes you want to be lonely?  
What's there to keep you sitting at home?  
He'd always say no, no, no  
As if he wanted you to be hungry  
Well, the same things you're missing  
Could get you into something else  
Better leave when to stay  
Is only nothing but being alone  
What I wanted you to know is kid things  
Seemed like nothing at all  
Kid things make it better than it was  
Kid things seemed like nothing at all  
But kid things make it better than it was  
Hey, what you got that makes you want to be lonely?  
Hey, what you got that makes it a better way to be?  
She said no, no, no  
I can't get any love and it's a Sunday  
I said oh, yeah  
What makes you think I wanted it that way?  
'Cause one or two more smiles from you  
And I don't need anything else  
What I wanted you to know is kid things  
Seemed like nothing at all  
Kid things make it better than it was  
We're just kids  
We spend all night on the phone  
It's a kid thing  
But I sleep better when I'm not alone  
What I want right now is just some more  
Gimme more, hey what you think  
Is you're not getting any younger  
What I know is that you're not really very old  
I know you wanna say no, no, no  
It feels much better in the summer  
Well, if it isn't warm where you're sittin'  
Then kitten come on in out of the cold  
'Cause all I know is when I'm with you  
Well, I don't need anything else  
What I wanted you to know is kid things  
Seemed like nothing at all  
And kid things make it better than it was  
We're just kids  
We spend all night on the phone  
It's a kid thing  
So I sleep better when I'm not alone  
Kid things seemed like nothing at all  
Kid things make it better than it was  
We're just kids, just like driving a car  
It's a kid thing and the further out  
The closer in you are
