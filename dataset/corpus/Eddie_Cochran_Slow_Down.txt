Well you're a fast movin' woman, I'm a slow movin' guy  
Yeah I like to crawl baby, you like to fly  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
I gotta admit that you got a lotta class  
I said you better watch out which Cadillac you pass  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
'Cause one of these nights, when you speed around town  
You gonna pass me baby and I'll turn my damper down  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
(Let's rock it!)  
  
You got a full house motor and it runs real good  
Yeah, fine upholstery and a packed-out hood  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
You're the motorvatest gal that I've ever seen  
Baby you better slow down or I'm gonna flee the scene  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
Slow down baby you' re way ahead of me
