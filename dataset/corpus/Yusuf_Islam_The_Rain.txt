Everybody's thinking about the rain [Repeat: x2]  
Wonder if the sun is gonna come again  
Oh  
  
Things are looking bad  
Everybody in the world in the world's looking so sad  
Everybody's thinking about the storm [Repeat: x2]  
Wonder where all the good weather's gone  
Oh  
  
Things are looking bad  
Everybody in the world in the world's looking so sad  
Tell me if i got to build a boat to carry us to sea  
Tell me what the shape of it will be  
Tell me if it's gonna be a home for every kind of beast  
Tell me who the lucky ones would be  
Tell me if you gotta build a world  
What that world would be  
If we're gonna build it well enough for thee  
Tell me if it's gonna be a home for all humanity  
Will it be believers with me  
  
Oh  
  
Everybody's thinking about the flood [Repeat: x2]  
Wonder if the water's gonna turn to blood  
Oh  
  
Things are looking bad  
Everybody in the world in the world's looking so sad  
Everybody's thinking about the rain [Repeat: x2]
