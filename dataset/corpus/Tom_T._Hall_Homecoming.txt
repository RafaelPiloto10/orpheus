I guess I should've written, dad  
To let you know that I was coming home  
I've been gone so many years  
I didn't realize you had a phone  
  
I saw your cattle coming in,  
Boy they're looking mighty fat and slick  
I saw fred at the service station  
Told me that his wife is awful sick  
  
You heard my record on the radio  
Oh, well it's just another song  
But I've got a hit recorded  
And it'll be out on the market 'fore too long  
  
I got this ring in mexico  
No, it didn't cost me quite a bunch  
When you're in the business that I'm in  
The people call it puttin' up a front  
  
I know I've lost a little weight  
I guess I am looking kind of pale  
If you didn't know me better, dad  
You'd think that I'd just gotten out of jail  
  
No, we don't ever call them beer joints  
Night clubs are the places that I work  
You meet a lot of people there, but no,  
There ain't much chance of gettin' hurt  
  
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there with you all when momma passed away  
I was on the road and when they came and told me it was just too late  
  
I drove by the grave to see her, boy,  
That really is a pretty stone  
I'm glad that fred and jan are here,  
It's better than you being here alone  
  
Well I knew you's gonna ask me  
Who the lady is that's sleeping in the car  
That's just a girl who works for me  
And, man, she plays a pretty mean guitar  
  
We worked in San Antone last night,  
She didn't even have the time to dress  
She drove me down from nashville and  
To tell the truth I guess she needs the rest  
  
Well, dad, I gotta go,  
We got a dance to work in cartersville tonight  
Let me take your number down,  
I'll call you, and I promise you I'll write  
  
Now you be good and don't be chasin'  
All those pretty women that you know  
And by the way if you see barbara walker  
Tell her that I said "hello."
