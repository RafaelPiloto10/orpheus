You call me the mean man  
You point your finger at me  
Having problems with authority  
In every major city  
  
And it's so easy for you  
The majority, the majority  
And there's no peace for you  
The majority  
  
Your white housewives  
And your money-sucking friends  
Don't need you to be I'll be me to the end  
  
And it's so easy for you  
The majority, the majority  
And there's no peace for you  
  
You got to think about your children  
Fuck bureaucracy  
Take the weight off your shoulders  
We're not the public enemy  
Can't you see, can't you see  
  
You call me the mean man  
I say you call me the mean man  
  
And it's so easy for you  
The majority, the majority  
And there's no peace for you  
  
Your white housewives  
And your money-sucking friends  
Don't need your to be  
Cause I'll be me to the end  
  
Got to think about the children  
Think think about the children  
  
You got to think about the children
