You're older, you're haunted,  
You're ahead of your time.  
In corners of acres of blocks of  
Straight lines.  
Blurringly, hourly we cross some  
Great divides  
Some heritage moments and some  
Melodious minds...  
A voice above the engine and the  
Jet stream combined  
'it's time sir the time sir  
Do you have the time?'  
As the moon groomed the airplane in a  
Benevolent way  
Again with the myth that's neither here,  
Neither there  
Again with the myth from up  
Up high in the air  
Above it all, I love you all  
Oh how could this be the end  
Satan backhands our nose and our chin  
The wings tell the tailfins  
'it's freak turbulence'  
  
Just then the Captain assures us  
We will land  
'I'll have you on the ground  
In 25 minutes or less."  
'or less', did he say 'less'? Unless what?  
We're not on time?  
Or less he said 'or less Jet stream  
And engine combine  
Unless he said 'Or less' as if a joke might  
Just keep us flying  
Benevolent way  
  
As the moon groomed the airplane with its'  
Benevolent rays
