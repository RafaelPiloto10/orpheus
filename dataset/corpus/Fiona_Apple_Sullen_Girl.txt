Days like this,  
I don't know what to do with myself  
All day-and all night  
I wander the halls along the walls  
And under my breath  
I say to myself  
I need fuel-to take flight  
  
And there's to much going on  
But it's calm under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion  
  
Is that why they call me a sullen girl-sullen girl  
They don't know  
I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea  
But he washed me ashore  
And he took my pearl  
And left an empty shell of me  
  
And there's too much going on  
But it's calm under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion  
Under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion  
It's calm under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion
