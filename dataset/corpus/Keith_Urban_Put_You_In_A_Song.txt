Well here you come again and you're lookin' so fine  
You don't notice me but it's alright  
I'm just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday  
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words it's true  
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you  
I wanna put you in a melody, I gotta set you to a groove  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive  
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I love this girl oh  
If I could press play, repeat, how happy I'd be  
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me  
You'd be right where you belong  
I wanna put you in a song, oh oh oh  
  
Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes  
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight  
It'd be so easy I'll just write it from my heart  
'Cause I gotta tell the world what you mean to me  
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be  
Stuck in my head all day  
'Cause you're already there anyway, yes you are  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive  
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I love this girl  
If I could press play, repeat, how happy I'd be  
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me  
You'd be right where you belong  
I wanna put you in a song  
  
And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah  
And when they see you on the street they'll say  
Hey ain't you the girl in that song  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive  
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I'm in love with this girl  
Yeah if I could press play, rewind a couple million times  
Imagine for a moment that you're all mine  
Every night I'd drive you home  
If I could put you in a  
Let me put you in a song  
Let me put you in a song  
Oh a pretty little song about you baby
