[Verse:]  
Yeah, Ain't nothin but to do it, nigga that's true  
A quarter milli and a Buick, nigga guess who?  
It came to me like the dream that I once had  
Niggas said I couldn't do it, then I bust through  
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs  
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew  
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on  
See now it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you  
Clearly, now hear me  
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me  
Cut me deep and know it hurts severely  
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely  
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli  
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly
