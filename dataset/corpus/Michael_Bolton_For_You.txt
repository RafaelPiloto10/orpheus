Well it hurt enough  
When you told me you were leaving  
Did you have to go  
And break this heart in two  
By writing me a letter  
I must have read a thousand times  
Saying you'll be back  
When I'm ready to spend  
My life with you  
  
And I'm not ready to settle down  
But for you, maybe I would  
But for you, maybe I could  
So I find myself alone  
By the beach where many nights we stood  
And I think about this life  
I really do live  
But it's hard to change  
A man like me  
Who knows what he wants  
And he knows what he sees  
  
  
And someone like you  
Will take all the love I've got to give  
And I'm not ready to settle down  
But for you maybe I would  
But for you maybe I could  
  
  
So a part of me says, boy  
You're talkin' like a fool  
When you've given all you've got  
To give what they have  
And it's hard to change  
A man like me  
Who knows what he wants  
And he knows what he sees  
  
  
But a love like this  
May never come again I know  
And I'm not ready to settle down  
But for you maybe I would  
But for you maybe I could  
For you maybe, maybe, maybe I would  
Maybe, maybe for you  
Maybe I would  
Maybe I could
