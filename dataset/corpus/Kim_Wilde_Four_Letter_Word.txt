I tell ya  
It's hell yeah  
When love says goodbye it's a four letter word  
Because your heart knows  
When love goes  
The feeling is bad - it's the pits of the world  
It's sad but true  
When nothing you can do, can bring it back  
  
Standing in the rain  
She starts to cry  
Is it all a game  
She wonders why  
Why it had to start  
Why should it end, and take her apart  
  
Because she shows it  
She knows it  
But what can she do, it's a four letter word  
Because it shakes you  
It breaks you  
And when it's the end, it's the worst thing you heard  
It's over now  
And nothing you can do can bring it back  
  
Calling out his name  
She starts to cry  
Guys are all the same  
She wants to die  
Hide away the tears  
No-one will see, and no-one must hear  
But oh  
  
How can the love that she has be profain  
And how can something that's so beautiful  
Just Jeckyl and Hyde around  
It's so sad...  
  
I tell ya  
It's hell yeah  
When love says goodbye  
It's a four letter word  
Because your heart knows  
When love goes  
The feeling is bad  
it's the worst in the world  
It's sad but true  
When nothing you can do, can get it back  
  
Standing in the rain  
She starts to cry  
Shouting out is name  
Four letter words
