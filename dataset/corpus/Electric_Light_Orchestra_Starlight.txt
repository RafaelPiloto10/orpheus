Starlight, I hear you callin' out to me.  
Sweet love rollin' across my mind again.  
I want you, yes, I do, I need you, yes, I do.  
And then you run.  
  
You gotta stop foolin' around,  
Keep your feet on the ground, little girl,  
And starlight will shine all around, little girl.  
  
Starlight, your eyes are lookin' out so far away.  
Constellation in the sky is smiling down on me, I wonder, wonder why.  
I can feel you're so real, I can see you're so near  
And the you run.  
  
You gotta stop foolin' around,  
Keep your feet on the ground, little girl,  
And starlight will shine all around, little girl.  
You had me all the summer long, little girl.  
  
Moonglow, come light the way up to my window.  
As you roll across the night don't tell noby that I told you so.  
I want you, yes, I do, I need you, yes, I do.  
And then you run.  
  
You gotta stop foolin' around,  
Keep your feet on the ground, little girl,  
And starlight will shine all around, little girl.  
You had me all the summer long, little girl.  
  
[Repeat and fade...]  
Starlight, your eyes are lookin' down on me so far away.
