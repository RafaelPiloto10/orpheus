Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
It's making me feel mad  
Something happened, you don't hear about  
Oh, please that never did before  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
It's making me feel mad, oh  
I never saw this on tv  
I never read it in no book  
Ahh  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Hey, baby, something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
It's making me feel mad  
I thought I knew a lot of things  
But I don't know a thing, oh, oh, oh  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
The things I hear and see  
Don't seem the same  
The things I touch and feel  
Are forever changed  
I've never felt this way before  
And I hope I never do again  
Something happened  
I don't know why or when  
Oh, something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo  
Something happened  
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo  
Something happened  
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo  
Something happened  
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
