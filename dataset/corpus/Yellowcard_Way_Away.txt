I think I'm breaking out  
I'm gonna leave you now  
There's nothing for me here it's all the same  
And even though I know  
That everything might go  
Go downhill from here I'm not afraid  
  
Way away away from here I'll be  
Way away away so you can see  
How it feels to be alone and not believe  
Anything  
  
You can't stop me now  
You can't hold me down  
You can't keep me here I'm on my way  
I made it this far now  
And I'm not burning out  
No matter what you say I'm not afraid  
  
Way away away from here I'll be  
Way away away so you can see  
How it feels to be alone and not believe  
Anything  
  
Letting out the noise inside of me  
Every window pane is shattering  
Cutting up my words before I speak  
This is how it feels to not believe  
  
Way away away from here I'll be  
Way away away so you can see  
How it feels to be alone and not believe  
Anything
