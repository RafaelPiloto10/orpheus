Suddenly there's a shadow on a nation  
Suddenly it's a changing situation  
Fear is on the face of every tiger as the jungle grows  
Suddenly people running never walking  
Nobody wants to know, nobody's talking  
But rushing through the air  
I feel the wind of change about to blow  
  
Chorus:  
Watch out tonight, the dogs are down in action city  
There out tonight, there's trouble down in action city  
  
Watching the police running from the station  
Suddenly flashing lights and confrotation  
The devil walks the streets  
Just as the flames of hell begin to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a brave new world, It's a brave new world  
Such a brave new world  
Well I don't know where it's going  
But it's heading for some changes I know  
  
People are wondering why there's such confusion  
There is a face of youth with disillusion  
Don't look for the reasons  
They were sprayed on every wall I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a brave new world, It's a brave new world  
Such a brave new world  
Well I don't know where it's going  
But it's heading for some changes I know
