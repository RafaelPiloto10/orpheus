You petrify me, a-baby, ooh, satisfy me, a-baby  
But don't defy me, a-baby  
Cause I'm mighty, mighty mean when I'm mad  
You tantalize me, a-baby, you hypnotize me, a-baby  
But don't surprise me, a-baby  
Cause I'm mighty, mighty mean when I'm mad  
Don't want my lovin' from another girl  
Cause you mean more to me than this whole wide world  
I need your lovin' and I need it bad  
Watch out a-baby if you make me mad  
So hug and kiss a-me, a-baby  
Act like you missed me, a-baby  
But don't resist me, a-baby  
Cause I'm mighty, mighty mean when I'm mad
