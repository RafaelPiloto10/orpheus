WE SUMMON THE SONS OF ANU,  
SPIRITS OF LIVING FIRE!!!  
  
In the night we gather for the slaying of the beast  
The chosen kings of fire summoned by the priests  
Lord give me strength to crush my enemies  
Their pain and their suffering will be music to my ears  
  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - wash away my pain, wash away my fate  
Let me rise up born again  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - blood runs from the sky, I'm the Lord of flies  
On the wings of hate I rise  
  
Soon it will be over abd we'll gather for the feast  
Hear the weeping of their woman as they grovel at our feet  
The gods have shown their favor, my victory is known  
Your gods have proven false, your death is mine to own  
  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - wash away my pain, wash away my tears  
Let me rise up born again  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - give power to my call, devouring their flesh  
Purify as all - RAIN OF FIRE  
  
Like a comet from hell  
devouring their flesh  
  
Trample to dust in the fire of lust  
With fire we slay all who stand in our way  
A covenant bound in the world underground  
We slash and we strike see your head on a spike  
  
Once free and so brave, now your people are slaves, oh...  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - the sons of Anu rise, the fields of blood are mine  
On a burning horse I ride  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - ravager of towns our covenant is bound  
In your kingdom underground  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - rape our enemies, burn their village bright  
In a golden wall of light  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - blood runs from the sky, the veils of death divide  
And the crucified arise - RAIN OF FIRE!!!
