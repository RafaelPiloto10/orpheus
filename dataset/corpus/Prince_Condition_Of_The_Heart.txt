There was a girl in Paris whom he sent a letter 2  
Hoping she would answer back now wasn't that a foolhardy notion  
On the part of a sometimes lonely musician?  
Acting out a whim is only good 4 a condition of the heart  
  
There was a dame from London who insisted that he love her  
Then left him 4 a real prince from Arabia  
Now isn't that a shame  
That sometimes money buys you everything and nothing?  
Love - it only seems 2 buy a terminal condition of the heart  
  
Oh - thinking about you, driving me crazy  
Oh - my friends all say it's just a phase, but?  
Oh - every day is a yellow day  
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard  
  
There was a woman from the ghetto  
Who made funny faces just like Clara Bow  
How was I 2 know that she would wear the same cologne as you  
And giggle the same giggle that you do?  
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool with a condition of the heart  
  
Oh - thinking about you, driving me crazy  
Oh - my friends all say it's just a phase, but?  
Oh - every single day is a yellow day  
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard  
  
(There was a girl in Paris whom he sent a letter 2)  
There was a girl? Whom he sent a letter 2  
(Hoping she would answer back)  
She never answered back and now  
(Wasn't that a foolhardy notion?)  
He's got a condition of the heart
