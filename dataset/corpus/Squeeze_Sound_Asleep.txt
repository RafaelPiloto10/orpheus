Tonight there's wind  
Tonight there's rain  
Tonight I sleep with myself again  
I punch the pillow into a mound  
With this frustration that I have found  
Today I hoped  
Today I heard  
There's still no contact  
Still no word  
I want to hear the front door slam  
I want you back to hold my hand  
Tonight there's hope you'll comfort me  
All I can do is wait and see  
But my eyes begin to close  
As footsteps softly creep  
To find me sound asleep  
  
Tonight there's pain  
Tonight there's fear  
Tonight it's cold now you're not here  
The sound of tyres out in the wet  
That's as close to you as I can get  
No turning handle on our front door  
The more I hate you I want you more
