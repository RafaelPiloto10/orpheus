My age you cannot me certain  
This spell cannot be broken  
Visions of eternal youth  
We share one face together  
Associates forever  
Only you know the truth  
  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Whose the master of them all?  
Mirror Mirror split in two  
Look at me, who are you?  
  
I swim in my reflection  
Mirror answer my question  
Tell me what I want to hear  
I see a perfect creature  
Contracted human feature  
I'll drown you with your vanity  
  
Mirror Mirror on the wall  
Whose the sickest of them all  
Mirror Mirror split in two  
Look at me - who are you?  
  
No, my life is beautiful  
I said, my life is beautiful  
  
Mirror Mirror on the wall  
Whose the sickest one of all  
Mirror mirror split in two  
Look at me - Who are you  
Mirror Mirror on the wall  
Whose the master of them all  
Mirror Mirror split in two  
Look at me - who are you?
