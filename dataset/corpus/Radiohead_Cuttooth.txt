I will lead a wallpaper life  
Or run away to the foreign legion  
I will lead a wallpaper life  
Or run away to the foreign legion  
  
And as the tanks roll into town  
As the tanks roll into town  
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you  
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you  
  
As the tanks roll into town  
As the tanks roll into town  
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you  
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you  
  
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied  
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive  
  
Run until your lungs are sore  
Until you cannot feel it any more  
Run until your lungs are sore  
Until you find an open door  
  
I build you up to pull you down  
Tie you to your feet, and watch you drown  
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you  
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you  
I build you up to pull you down  
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell  
  
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied  
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive  
  
I'll find another skin to wear  
I'll find another skin to wear
