Imagine sailing solo around the world  
Only to find you've missed a continent out  
And as your happy turns choppy and tidal wave swirls  
You're wondering why there's no one about  
  
At least Captain Scott actually stood on the spot  
Where he planned to put up Union Jack  
And though Captain Cook cursed the map that he took  
He got near enough for native's attack  
  
That's how it feels trying to navigate you  
Even with compass and infinite time  
And just when I think I've found some part that's new  
I find a flag already up that's not mine  
  
Circling you is journey minus view  
Exploration without reason or reward  
'Cause when I get near, you use an arrow or spear  
To prevent my heart ever being shored  
  
The earth ain't flat but it's a simple doormat  
Compared to your unclimbable self  
The desolate terrain, you have to cross to your brain  
Just one of your slippery shelves  
  
That's how it feels trying to navigate you  
Even with compass and infinite time  
And just when I think I've found some part that's new  
I find a flag already up that's not mine  
  
And if I ever get close, I'll need a banner or post  
To hang it from, first there or not  
So voyage may uncover a sister or brother  
And a friendship that Colombus forgot
