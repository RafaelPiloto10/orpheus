And I was lost for words  
In your arms  
Attempting to make sense  
Of my aching heart  
If I could just be  
Everything and everyone to you  
This life would just be so easy  
  
Not enough time for all  
That I want for you  
Not enough time for every kiss  
And every touch and all the nights  
I wanna be inside you  
  
We will make time stop  
For the two of us  
Make time stop  
And listen for our sighs  
  
Not enough time for all  
That I want for you  
Not enough time for every kiss  
And every touch and all the nights  
I wanna be inside you  
  
In our fight against the end  
Making love we are immortal  
We are the last two left on earth  
And I was lost for words  
In your arms  
Attempting to make sense of  
My aching heart  
If I could just be everything  
And everyone to you  
  
Not enough time for all  
That I want for you  
Not enough time for every kiss  
Not enough time for all my love  
Not enough time for every touch  
  
Not enough time for all  
That I want for you  
Not enough time for every kiss  
And every touch and all the nights  
I wanna be inside you
