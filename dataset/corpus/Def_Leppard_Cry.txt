Here comes the flood  
Can you feel the love  
Washin' over you  
Like a tidal wave inside of you  
  
Here comes the night  
Can you see the light  
Shinin' like the sun  
You want to hide  
But it's got you on the run  
  
Every word you say  
Is takin' your breath away  
  
Cry, the demons that you hide  
Screamin' through the night  
They won't forget you  
  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Need, the circus you gotta feed  
The wound that never heals  
  
It don't let go  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
  
She's here again  
Your only friend  
Watchin' over you  
She never takes her eyes away from you  
She's wide awake  
  
And she lies in wait  
Your chosen bride  
A mother, a lover  
The kick inside  
  
Every single day  
It's takin' your breath away  
  
Cry, the demons that you hide  
Screamin' through the night  
They won't forget you  
  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Need, the circus you gotta feed  
  
The wound that never heals  
It don't let go  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
  
It's been so long since I come undone  
I'm slippin' in to my second skin  
  
Cry, the demons that you hide  
Screamin' through the night  
They won't forget you  
  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Need, the circus you gotta feed  
The wound that never heals  
  
It don't let go  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down
