Tinker, you better place another bet  
The rich up in the castle haven't finished eating yet  
They'll throw you a bone or a spat-out stone  
But knowing them that's all you'll get  
Tailor, you better close another shop  
No-one wants your quality, make do with what you've got  
They'll let you survive  
The'll let you get by  
But knowing them, they'll let you rot  
  
You better be doubtful  
You better beware  
You better not shout now  
You better not care  
  
Tinker, you better buy another boot  
Those "Pocock Continental" are finally showing through  
We'll get you a pair  
From a second-hand fair  
They'll only have 'a two'  
  
Sailor, you better sink a few more ships  
Admiral loony Nelson cannot find his game of risk  
We'll lose a few lives  
A couple of tribes  
But knowing him he'll like his lips  
  
You better be doubtful  
You better beware  
You better not shout now  
You better not care  
  
From Queen Wilkinds to Queen Victoria  
We've had a promising side  
From King Callaghan to Bonny Prince Francis  
We've paid up and we've cried  
Princess Gower and Princess Ferguson  
We've looked a hard nut to crack  
But we're weak at the.........Back!
