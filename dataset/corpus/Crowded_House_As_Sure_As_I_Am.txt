Make your decision now  
Rely on no help from above  
Living is luxury  
I want everything you throw out  
I'll do anything you want to  
  
Please let me go with you  
I'll wear the smile on your face  
Big, black and beautiful  
I want it, everything you throw out  
There must be something you can do with out  
'Cause I am as sure as I am  
  
I couldn't care less  
For what might go wrong  
And I'm as happy as sin  
In a fear shaken world  
  
I pity the rhino  
Down there it's becoming extinct  
Killed for a love potion  
Sad thing looking like a dead flower  
I want it, everything that you throw out  
'Cause I am as sure as I am  
  
I couldn't care less  
For what might go wrong  
And I'm as happy as sin  
In a fear shaken world  
  
Don't want to be there  
Don't want to be spared  
I'll wear the smile on your face  
I am as sure as I am  
  
I couldn't care less  
For what might go wrong  
And I'm as happy as sin  
In a fear shaken world, world,  
Couldn't care less
