Seems like forever and time left to spare  
When I look out the window  
And still you're not there  
You're a long time gone  
Such a long time gone  
  
Tearing down memories bitter and sweet  
Smashing away 'til it's all obsolete  
You're a long time gone, long time gone  
Such a long time gone, long time gone  
You're a long time gone  
  
Do I wonder why  
Every day that I  
Think about you still  
And I always will  
  
Did so much for me  
Now I think I see  
This I do believe  
Feels more like a dream  
  
Looked at the weeds in the broken concrete  
Before the bulldozers waltzed in and killed the old street  
You're a long time gone, long time gone  
Such a long time gone, long time gone  
  
Door steps that shone in a bright summer sky  
Lay shattered and wasted since our last goodbye  
You're a long time gone, long time gone  
Such a long time gone, long time gone  
You're a long time gone  
  
Do I wonder why  
Every day that I  
Think about you still  
And I always will  
  
You're a long time gone  
  
Did so much for me  
Now I think I see  
This I do believe  
Feels more like a dream  
  
You're a long time gone  
  
Do I wonder why  
You're a long time gone  
You never did  
I never said goodbye  
You're a long time gone
