I got a gal who's always late  
Anytime we have a date  
But I love her, yes I love her  
  
Mmm, he's gonna walk up to my gate  
And see if he can get it straight  
Cause he wants her, he's gonna ask her  
  
Is you is or is you ain't my baby  
The way you're actin' lately makes me doubt  
You's is still my baby, baby  
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out  
  
A woman is a creature that has always been strange  
Just when you're sure of one, you find she's gone and made a change  
  
Is you is or is you ain't my baby  
Maybe baby's found somebody new  
Or is my baby still my baby true  
  
Is you or is you ain't my baby, baby  
Baby boy, the way you're actin' lately makes me doubt  
See here, who's been cuttin' me  
You's is still my baby, baby  
Baby boy, it seems my flame in your heart's done gone out  
Oh, blackout  
  
A woman is a creature that has always been strange  
Just when you're sure of one, you find she's gone and made a change  
And took my change  
  
Is you is or is you ain't my baby  
Maybe baby's found somebody new  
Maybe baby's found somebody  
Is my baby still my baby true
