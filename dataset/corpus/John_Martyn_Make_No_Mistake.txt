If I can't be a happy man, I won't be no one at all  
If I can't be just who I am, I won't let you come to  
call  
I was all right before I walked through the door  
I was all right outside, but inside I had to cry.  
  
Low today and high tomorrow, I see that it's real  
One man's meat's another man's sorrow, do you know how  
it feels  
To be dead drunk on the floor  
To get up and ask for more?  
To be lying in the dark crying.  
  
If I can't be a peaceful man, I will be who I can  
If I can't get everything I want, I'll just get what I  
can  
I was alright before I walked out the door  
I was alright inside  
  
But outside I had to look again, again, again  
  
A love  
Love again  
A love supreme, divine  
Anyway that you want it to be  
Love Its love, its love  
Love! Love! Love!  
A love supreme, a love supreme  
A love supreme, a love supreme  
  
Make no mistake,  
Make no mistake, its love  
Make no mistake, its love  
Make no mistake, its love  
  
Divine it's love, it's fine, its wine, its time, its  
love  
Love! Love! Love  
Make no mistake, its love  
Make no mistake, its love  
  
Make no mistake, its love  
It's love It's love love
