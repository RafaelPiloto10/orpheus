Went down to Coddingtown to buy for lucky dog.  
Moved on up to sono-co to clear my head of smog.  
People round town they all line up to buy them chevrolets.  
But me I talked to the mopar man, been talkin' now for days.  
  
I went down to Coddingtown, it seemed the thing to do.  
You can get it all down there, from tennis balls to glue.  
Standin' up in the old smoke shop, met a girl named honey pie.  
If you shamble long enough, you wanna' go, you gotta' go.  
  
Bring me on back.  
  
Lordy, lordy, Coddingtown, that's the place to be.  
Lordy, lordy, Coddingtown, that's the place for me.  
  
I went down to Coddingtown and met old Santy Claus  
Beanie boy got a hold of that beard, nearly yanked it from his jaws  
I stepped on up to the pizza man and gobbled down some filth.  
I shambled round now too damn long I wanna' go, I gotta' go.  
  
Bring me on back.  
  
Lordy, lordy, Coddingtown, that's the place to be.  
Lordy, lordy, Coddingtown, that's the place for me.
