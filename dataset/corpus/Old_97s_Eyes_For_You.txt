I've got eyes for you  
And I keep them in a jar up in my room  
When you walk in they open wide  
Lids are gone, no place to hide  
I've got eyes for you  
I've got eyes for you  
I've got lips for you  
Some of what they say just might be true  
Well it's a scary thought I must confess  
You're an ice cream cone in a mini-dress  
I've got lips for you  
I've got lips for you  
Oh, well I think I'm going crazy  
I'm feeling pretty good, this isn't love  
It's just I think my body likes you  
More than any body should, your body likes me too  
That's why I've only got eyes for you  
I've got a nose for you  
And the way you smell I wish that I had two  
Ah well you always smell a bit like gin  
You're gonna make me take to drinkin' again  
I've got a nose for you  
I've got a nose for you  
Oh, well I think I'm going crazy  
I'm feeling pretty good, this isn't love  
It's just I think my body likes you  
More than any body should, your body likes me too  
That's why I've only got eyes for you  
I've got eyes for you  
And I keep them in a jar up in my room  
When you walk in they open wide  
Lids are gone, no place to hide  
I've got eyes for you  
I've got eyes for you  
I've got eyes for you  
I've got eyes for you
