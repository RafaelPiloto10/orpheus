Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much  
And I don't give a damn anyway  
You always seem to be stepping in shit  
And all you really do is complain  
Hitch a ride, tell 'em all you like  
Small minds tend to think a like  
  
Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much  
And I don't give a fuck anyway  
  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go  
  
Cut the crap 'cause you're screaming in my ear  
And you're taking up all of the space  
You're really testing my patience again  
And I'd rather get punched in the face  
You're getting on my every last nerve  
Everything you've said I've already heard  
  
I'm sick to death of your every last breath  
And I don't give a fuck anyway  
  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go  
  
Always fuck fuckin' with my head now  
Always fuck fuckin' with my head now  
Always fuck fuckin' with my head now  
Always fucking with my head and I gotta let it go!  
  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go  
Gotta let me go, gotta let it go
