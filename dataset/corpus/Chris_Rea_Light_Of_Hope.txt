This is the garden that I know  
Ten thousand summers wait me here  
You lead and I will follow  
Your heart is mine tomorrow  
Into your womb I fade away  
  
And while she laughs  
Your pride is turning into snow  
And melting on the face of this light of hope  
Shine on, light of hope  
Light of hope  
  
And while she laughs  
Your pride is turning into snow  
And dancing on the graves of what  
You thought you used to know  
And in this garden I will burn my callous robes  
And forever love my darling  
Light of hope
