Take me across the water 'cause I need some place to hide.  
I done the rancher's daughter and I sure did hurt his pride.  
  
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah  
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah.  
  
Well, there's a hundred miles of desert  
Lies between his hide and mine.  
I don't need no food, no water, Lord,  
'cause I'm running out of time.  
  
Fightin', killin',  
Wine and women gonna put me to my grave.  
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin'.  
Nothing left to save  
But my life.  
  
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah  
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah.  
  
Stood on a ridge and stunned religion  
Thinking the world was mine.  
I made my break and a big mistake,  
Stealing when I should have been buying.  
  
All that fightin', killin',  
Wine and women gonna put me to an early grave.  
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin',  
Nothing left to save
