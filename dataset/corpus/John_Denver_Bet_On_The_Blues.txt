Five hundred will buy you a stack  
Bet it on the red or the black and you lose  
Bet on the blues  
You tell me you are a gambling man  
Try to beat the house if you can and you lose  
Bet on the blues  
If you're looking to get an inside slant  
If you're looking for something so good you can't refuse  
Bet on the blues  
Find a man who thinks he's over the hump  
And I'm here to tell you he's a kind of a chump, you can use  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Lucky old sun is shining today  
Even money says you'll be paying some dues  
Bet on the blues  
You say you found your lady fair  
Eight to five says she's wearing her traveling shoes  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues, bet on the blues  
Five hundred will buy you a stack  
Bet it all on the red or the black and you lose  
Bet on the blues  
If you're looking to get an inside slant  
If you're looking for something so good, you can't refuse  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
You better, bet on the blues
