To me  
Coming from you  
Friend is a four letter word  
End is the only part of the word  
That I heard  
Call me morbid or absurd  
But  
  
To me  
Coming from you  
Friend is a four letter word  
To me  
Coming from you  
Friend is a four letter word  
End is the only part of the word  
That I heard  
Call me morbid or absurd  
But  
  
To me  
Coming from you  
Friend is a four letter word  
When I go fishing  
for the words  
I am wishing you would say to me,  
I am really only praying that  
The words you'll soon be saying  
Might betray  
  
The way you feel about me  
But to me,  
Coming from you,  
Friend is a four letter word
