Hope you didn't burn too many bridges  
On your way back to haunt my heart  
Cause it's safe behind these stones and ridges  
You know how us healin' victims are  
I take comfort where I find it  
In the neon and the crowds  
I guess someone like me designed it  
This place where old flames aren't allowed  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a border you can cross  
There's a wall that you can climb  
The space is drawn too wide  
Between your world and mine  
You're already broke my heart  
(And) I won? let you break my mind  
As far as your memory goes  
That's where I draw the line  
  
I'll bet this isn't how you planned it  
I've picked myself up off the ground  
These legs are shakin' but they?e standin'  
And I won? let you knock me down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's where I draw the line
