Out of the ruins  
Out from the wreckage  
Can't make the same mistake this time  
We are the children  
The last generation  
We are the ones they left behind  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it  
Living under the fear till nothing else remains  
  
We don't need another hero  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
Looking for something we can rely on  
There's got to be something better out there  
Love and compassion, their day is coming  
All else are castles built in the air  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it  
Living under the fear till nothing else remains  
All the children say  
  
We don't need another hero  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
What do we do with our lives  
We leave only a mark  
Will our story shine like a life  
Or end in the dark  
Give it all or nothing
