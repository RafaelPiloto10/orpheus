[Miley Cyrus]  
Broke a record on the day I dropped my video  
I got three thick girls in my video  
Pop a molly and you know you know you'll never stop  
You think I'm turnt up, wait until my album drops  
Versace, versace versace I wear that vintage versace  
Fashion week you can find me in New York posing for the paparazzi  
And I'm all white like french montana  
Oh shit there goes Hannah Montana  
Acting like a little southern girl  
Now twerking like I grew up in atlanta  
  
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

Bitch, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'  
  
Ridin around with that work, strapped up with that Nina  
Got Two bad bitches with me, molly and Aquafina  
Money don't mean nothing, niggas don't feel you when they see you  
My whole 'hood love me, but now a nigga wanna touch me

I'm ridin' round with that work, Max lost trial I'm hurt  
I'll ride through Mott Haven, I'll ride through Castle Hill  
You know that Coupe half a million, fuck how niggas feel  
Cause I ain't really worried 'bout nothin', my niggas ain't worried 'bout
