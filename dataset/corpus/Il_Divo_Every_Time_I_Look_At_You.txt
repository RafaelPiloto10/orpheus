I used to think that I was strong  
I realize now I was wrong  
Cause every time I see your face  
My mind becomes an empty space  
And with you lying next to me  
Feels like I can hardly breathe  
  
I close my eyes  
The moment I surrender to you  
Let love be blind  
Innocent and tenderly true  
So lead me through tonight  
But please turn out the light  
Cause I'm lost every time I look at you  
  
And in the morning when you go  
Wake me gently so I'll know  
That loving you was not a dream  
And whisper softly what it means to be with me  
Then every moment we're apart  
Will be a lifetime to my heart  
  
I close my eyes  
The moment I surrender to you  
Let love be blind  
Innocent and tenderly true  
So lead me through tonight  
But please, please turn out the light  
Cause I'm lost every time I look at you  
Lost every time I look at You
