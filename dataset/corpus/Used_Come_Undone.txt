Opened up my failure  
When you refused to go insane.  
I felt you get excited  
When I whispered all the things you love to hate.  
  
Like you're the one who kills.  
Could kill me with a drug, your weapon.  
Let's pretend there's  
Nothing wrong with my direction.  
  
Hate me,  
I'll be your, your loaded gun.  
Burn me  
Waiting to come undone.  
  
I'll set it up inside you,  
To watch you burn.  
Hate me,  
I'll be the, I'll be the end that you deserve.  
  
Open lacerations,  
A slower cut to feel your pain.  
Heat the blood to boiling  
As it passes from your lips into your brain.  
  
'Cause you're the one who kills.  
Could kill me with a drug, your weapon.  
Let's pretend that  
I'm not dead, it's in your head.  
  
Hate me,  
I'll be your, your loaded gun.  
Burn me  
Waiting to come undone.  
  
I'll set it up inside you,  
To watch you burn.  
Hate me,  
I'll be the, I'll be the end that you deserve.  
I'll be the end that you deserve.  
  
I can turn you on like fire.  
Set fire deep inside you.  
Eat you alive and watch you  
Come and let me up the sonisphere!  
  
I'll be your  
I'll be your  
I'll be your  
I'll be the end that you deserve.  
I'll be the end that you deserve.  
  
Hate me,  
I'll be your, your loaded gun.  
Burn me  
Waiting to come undone  
  
I'll set it up inside you,  
To watch you burn.  
Hate me,  
I'll be the, I'll be the end that you deserve.  
I'll be the end that you deserve.
