He was sick of his clock stopping  
Wind it up, that girls stayed sleeping next to him  
  
Watch stops, the batteries run down  
He started his broken sentence, "no alarms..."  
  
The watch stops, the batteries run down,  
He started his broken sentence, "no alarms and no surprises..."  
  
He was sick of her excuses  
To not take off her dress when bleedin' in the bathroom  
  
He was sick of his clock stopping, wind it up  
No alarms and no surprises...  
No alarms and no surprises...  
No alarms and no surprises, please
