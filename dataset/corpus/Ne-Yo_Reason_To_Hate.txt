And the way I'm living is great  
Only thing that I can do, every day contend you  
Give them haters reason to hate

Give them haters a reason  
'Cause you know I love  
Give them haters a reason

T-Raw straight from a dice game  
Came up roll a Rolls Royce, seats like ten  
Now we pop champagne for all the suffering and pain  
Used to stay in when it rain now I go out and make it rain  
No shame, I can pay a year's rent with one chain  
Still with the same niggas courtside Laker game  
I just took advantage, you just took for granted  
Mansion by Nicki crib, everything rented  
Damn new case stand in the last king living  
Bread over bed Stunna said we the business  
No realer for sure, show me love when you see a nigga  
Sipping slow mo in the motion picture

And the way I'm living is great  
Only thing that I can do, every day contend you  
Give them haters reason to hate

God damn, I'm the man  
And I ain't tryina piss nobody off but I'm just saying  
My new car, custom painted  
In the club everybody show me love like I'm Raymond  
Paparazzi taking pictures 'cause we famous  
Money long, what I'm smoking on is dangerous  
Oh, you can use some new arrangements  
In the back I'm tryina move you up to A-list  
And they know I'm reppin' Taylor to the grave  
Catch me working on some slave shit  
For the chains whips  
Your favorite rapper on your playlist  
Got rich when they were drunk then they find we ain't gonna smoke  
  
I don't know about you, I'm doing what I do  
And the way I'm living is great  
Only thing that I can do, every day contend you  
Give them haters reason to hate

Always keep them haters fed up  
Give 'em a reason to hate
