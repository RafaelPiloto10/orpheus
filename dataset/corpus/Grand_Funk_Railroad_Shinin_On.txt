We are winners and losers, bed fellow choosers,  
Put here to pass by the times.  
We are space-age sailors, all had our failures,  
Now everybody gonna' shine.  
  
Keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin' on.  
  
See the fire within them burnin',  
Touch the fire make me feel so fine.  
Keep the fire within you livin'  
Everybody gonna' shine, shine, shine.  
  
Keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin', shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin' on.  
  
Shinin' on.  
Shinin' on.  
  
What?  
Well, alright.  
  
Keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin', shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin' on.  
  
Keep it shinin' on, shinin' on, shinin' on.  
  
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on.  
Keep it shinin', keep it shinin', keep it shinin' on.  
(and so on, in rounds)
