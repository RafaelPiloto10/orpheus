Let's take your car and to amusement parks USA  
At Palisades in Salisbury park the roller coasters are flyin  
At Euclid Beach on the flying turns I'll bet you can't keep her smilin'  
Buy your girl a cotton candy while you're down on the ground  
Then take her on the Twirl-A-Way and spin her around  
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day  
  
The parachutes at Riverview Park will shake us up all day  
And Disneyland and p.o.p. is worth a trip to L.A.  
Watchin' girls in the air can really get you bad  
And I'll bet the laughin' lady makes you laugh like mad  
Let's pick up our friends and do amusement parks USA  
  
Hurry, hurry, hurry folks step right up to the beach boy circus.  
The best little show in town.  
Hurry, hurry, hurry, it's only a dime folks, one thin dime, just one tenth of
a dollar.  
Come on in and see Stella the snake dancer (is it real?)  
She walks, she talks, she wiggles on her belly like a snake.  
(she looks like a fake to me) (let's go see her) (it costs too much)  
Hurry, hurry, hurry folks, come on and see Stella.  
She shimmies, she shakes  
  
You'll crash and burn in the bumper cars at Jersey's Steel Pier  
You'll crack 'em up when you stand in front of all the crazy mirrors  
At first you'll be a chicken at the jackhammer ride  
But you'll do it with a girl sittin' right by your side  
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day
