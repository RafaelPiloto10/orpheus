I?ll take your side and I?ll take you into town  
And there you'll search around  
You hope she must be waiting now  
Found what you need don't push her too far  
Don't ever let her see you down  
I hope she's waiting now  
It?s not that she has been around  
Too long to never try  
Too long to never try  
For every corner there's a way out  
And every day that you lose  
There's a pay out, there's a pay out  
And if she cries you know it will be fine  
With things now on your side don't frown  
She is waiting now  
But if she sings, then she's taken all you bring  
To her you mean all things you smile  
She's waiting now  
It?s not that she has been around  
Too long to never try  
Too long to never try  
For every corner there's a way out  
And every day that you lose  
There's a pay out, there's a pay out  
But don't you think the time will come  
When you'll get in her way  
Or she?ll bring you down the same  
For every corner there's a way out  
And every day that you lose  
There's a pay out  
For every corner there's a way out  
And every day that you lose  
There's a pay out, there's a pay out  
There's a pay out
