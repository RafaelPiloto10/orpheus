Alone, alone with a sky of romance above  
Alone, alone on a night that was meant for love  
There must be someone waiting  
Who feels the way I do  
Who ever you are, are you, are you  
Alone, alone on this night that we two could share  
Alone, alone with your kiss that could make me care  
And when you come I'll promise to be your very own  
Alone, alone with a heart meant for you alone, alone  
  
Alone, alone with a sky of romance above  
Alone, alone on a night that was meant for love  
There must be someone waiting  
Who feels the way I do  
Who ever you are, are you, are you  
Alone, alone on this night that we two could share  
Alone, alone with your kiss that could make me care  
And when you come I'll promise to be your very own
