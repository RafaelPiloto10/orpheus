So fine, so fine the web you spin,  
I come too close and I'm caught again!  
In the web of wild design,  
I do not know what fate is mine!  
All the day sit and spin,  
Spin your web and you draw me in.  
Spin, spin, spin, spin!  
  
And my daddy said when I was young,  
"Beware the web of love, my son,  
To be in love is to be insane,  
Make an old man groan, a young man pain! "  
All the day, sit and spin,  
Spin your web and you draw me in.  
Spin, spin, spin, spin!  
  
Then I did go and the time did fly,  
Many a true love passed me by.  
And then you came like a blinding storm,  
I landed in your web so warm,  
Spin your web and you draw me in.  
Spin, spin, spin, spin!  
  
So fine, so fine the web you spin,  
I come too close and I'm caught again!  
In the web of wild desire,  
And I cannot control the fire!  
All the day sit and spin,  
You spin your web and you draw me in.
