I'm half a sinner, and I'm half a saint  
It's hard to tell by the company I keep  
That I'm tryin' to live in a state of grace  
It's risky business, it's the queen of hearts  
That's the way it is, there's no holds barred  
But if your dream comes true, there's something to sing about  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you  
Don't lie, I don't want to lose  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose your love  
Sweet satisfaction, wrapped in the arms of a warm embrace  
No fascination could ever take your place  
Light up the shadows  
Brick by brick the walls come down  
Who can judge your magic love  
So mystically profound  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you  
Don't lie, I don't want to lose  
Blue eyes, I don't want to cry  
Don't cry, I don't want to lose  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose your love  
Ooh, I need you  
You know I need you so much  
Ooh, I need  
I can't resist your warm touch  
Eyes, blue eyes  
How many times must the words be spoken  
Eyes, blue eyes  
How many times must the heart be broken tonight  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you  
Don't lie, I don't want to lose  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose your love  
Sweet satisfaction, wrapped in the arms of a warm embrace  
No fascination could ever take your place  
Light up the shadows  
Brick by brick the walls come down  
Who can judge your magic love  
So mystically profound  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you  
Don't lie, I don't want to lose  
Blue eyes, I don't want to cry  
Don't cry, I don't want to lose  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose your love  
Ooh, I need you  
You know I need you so much  
Ooh, I need  
I can't resist your warm touch  
Eyes, blue eyes  
How many times must the words be spoken  
Eyes, blue eyes  
How many times must the heart be broken tonight  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you  
Don't lie  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you  
Don't lie  
Blue eyes, I don't want to lose you  
Don't lie  
I don't want to lose  
Blue eyes, I don't want to cry  
Don't cry
