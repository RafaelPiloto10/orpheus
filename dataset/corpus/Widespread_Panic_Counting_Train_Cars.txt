Remember watching children play  
Ring-around-the roses  
Tiny electrons circling in neutral ground  
So much gravity, in gravity  
  
Boys in bars, they stir their drinks  
Clockwise while the ladies dance  
Bodies and thoughts constantly in motion  
Oh, what a time to think of mom  
Counting train cars  
  
This is a place called paradise  
Make the fist that holds the paintbrush  
Take your open hand and roll the dice  
The trains will pass and the pups will rush  
  
Walk outside, stare down the sky  
Stars are fixed and so am I  
Grand illusions constantly in motion  
Oh what a time for gravity, counting train cars  
  
Another day in paradise  
Counting train cars  
Another day of gravity  
Counting train cars
