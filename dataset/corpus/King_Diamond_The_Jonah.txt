"After 7 years on a dusty shelf  
The book seemed unreal  
For 7 years in an ancient rhyme  
The fate of a girl was sealed"  
  
In the attic I was searching by the moonlight  
What would I find  
Old and grey from dust I felt it staring back  
Oh that book  
  
Yellow pages caught my eyes, so unreal  
Through the dust of time  
In an ancient rhyme the truth had been sealed  
On a broken shelf it would all be revealed  
It had been there for years  
And no one ever knew  
  
Now break the spell and free the girl  
From the candle of fate  
Look at the flame and say the rhyme  
The end is near, no more pain, ah you're free  
  
As the candle melts away the spirit of the candle girl  
Emerges from the flame, she doesn't seem the same  
With a smile on her face she starts to speak  
"Hear my story:"
