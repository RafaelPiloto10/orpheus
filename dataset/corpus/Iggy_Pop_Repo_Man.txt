I was riding on a concrete slab  
Down a river of a useless land  
It was such a beautiful day  
I heard a witch doctor say  
Ill turn you into a toadstool  
  
I'm looking for the joke with a microscope  
  
A muscle twitch, an auto it swerves  
You want to speak you lose your nerve  
Infinity throws you a curve  
Dumps you in shit you don't deserve  
  
As life roars by you in a blur  
Leaves you murmuring a dirty word  
  
A page out of a comic book  
A chicken hanging on a hook  
A reverie, a babbling brook  
A sermonette, a TV. cook  
  
Shaking my hand at your fake head  
A suicide, a certain look  
  
A microphone, a blues guitar  
Piques a feeling near and far  
Stupidity a mental scar  
Cruel cruelty, oh cruelty  
Harboring no inspiration  
An alcoholic at the bar  
Every insult goes to far  
  
I was pissing on the desert sands,  
When the desert whispered to me,  
It said, isn't this a shame?  
Things will never be the same...  
I've learned this gets me so edgy  
  
Now I'm looking for the joke with a microscope  
  
I was a teenaged dinosaur  
Stoned and obsolete  
I didn't get fucked and I didn't get kissed  
I got so fucking pissed  
  
Using my head for an ashtray  
  
Now I tell you who I am  
I'm a repo man  
And I'm looking for the joke  
Yeah I'm looking for the joke  
I'm looking for the joke  
Looking for the joke  
Looking for the joke  
Looking for the joke with a microscope  
I been looking for the repo repo repo repo man  
Looking for the repo repo repo repo man  
Looking for the repo man  
Looking for the repo man  
Looking for the repo man  
Looking for the repo man...
