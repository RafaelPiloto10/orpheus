Here it comes  
Once again  
Irrational  
I give in  
Paranoia  
Expands within  
Little voices start to begin  
  
Everyone's out to take your joy away  
Constantly scheming to keep us at bay  
Everyone's plotting and they are just taking  
You must make it stop  
Make them pay  
  
Sometimes I just take things  
Way too far  
Irrational feeling  
I just try too hard 'cause  
What goes up, must come down  
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause  
Sometimes I just take things way too far  
  
Reality is surreal  
Wretchedness is all I feel  
Now its really just a way  
God, I hear the voices say  
  
Everyone's out to take your joy away  
Constantly scheming to keep us at bay  
Everyone's plotting and they are just taking  
You must make it stop  
Make them pay  
  
Sometimes I just take things  
Way Too Far  
Irrational feeling  
I just try too hard 'cause  
What goes up, must come down  
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause  
Sometimes I just take things Way Too Far  
  
Woohoo! Woohoo! Woohoo! Woohoo!  
  
Sometimes I just take things  
Way too far  
Irrational feeling  
I just try too hard 'cause  
What goes up, must come down  
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause  
Sometimes I just take things way too far
