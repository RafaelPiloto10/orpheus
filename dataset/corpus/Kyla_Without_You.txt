It feels like a lifetime,  
A thousand days have passed by  
Since I held you close to me  
If I could see that smile from my friend  
I know that I could live again  
I need you here with me  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven knows what to say  
Even though for right now  
You're so far away  
I hope and I pray  
Somewhere in your heart I'll always stay  
Girl, lately  
My sun doesn't shine without you  
Never noticed  
What it feels like to be without you  
Feels like I took my last step  
And my last breath and my life ended  
Had to say just what I was feeling, girl  
'Cause my sun doesn't shine,  
Sun doesn't shine without you  
  
This is more for me than for you  
Girl, I finally see there's no substitute  
For what we have  
Do you know how much I love you'  
And what we've shared  
I can't forget  
Girl, a love like yours  
I'll never let just slip away  
Just promise me that you'll stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have you ever seen a flower that never blooms  
See a starless night without the moon  
Well that's me without you  
So come back and turn my night into day  
'Cause lately,  
My sun doesn't shine without you  
  
'Cause my sun doesn't shine,  
Sun doesn't shine without  
You
