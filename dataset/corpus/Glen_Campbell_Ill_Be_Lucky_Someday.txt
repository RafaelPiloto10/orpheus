Feeling low feeling blue  
All the troubles come my way  
But I just won't worry  
I'll be lucky someday.  
  
My money's gone, ain't got no friends  
More debts than I can face  
But I just won't worry  
I'll be lucky someday.  
  
Let it rain, oh, let it pour  
'Cause it just can't get worst no way  
And I know maybe soon  
My luck will change someday.  
  
The gal I love done said goodbye  
She went on her marryin' way  
But I just won't worry  
I'll be lucky someday.  
  
I'll be lucky someday  
Maybe I'll get lucky someday
