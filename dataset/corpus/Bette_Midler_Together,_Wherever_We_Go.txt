Wherever we go, whatever we do  
We're gonna go through it together  
We may not go far, but sure as a star  
Wherever we are, it's together  
Wherever I go, I know he goes  
Wherever I go, I know she goes  
No fits, no fights, no feuds and no egos  
Amigos, together!  
Through thick and through thin, all out or all in  
And whether it's win, place or show  
With you for me and me for you  
We'll muddle through whatever we do  
Together, wherever we go  
Wherever we go, whatever we do  
We're gonna go through it together  
Wherever we sleep, if prices are steep  
We'll always sleep cheaper together  
Whatever the boat I row, you row, a duo  
Whatever the row I hoe, you hoe, a trio  
And any I. O. U., I owe you, oh's?  
Who, me-oh? No, you-oh  
No, we-oh, together!  
We all take the bow, including the cow  
Though business is lousy and slow  
With Herbie's vim, Louise's verve  
Now all we need is someone with nerve  
Together, together, wherever, wherever  
Together, wherever, together, wherever we go  
We go in a group, we tour in a troupe  
We land in the soup, but we know  
The things we do, we do by threes, a perfect team  
No, this way, Louise!  
Together, together, wherever, wherever  
Together, wherever we go!
