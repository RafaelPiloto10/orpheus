I've been burning my bridges  
For too many years,  
Drowning the sorrow  
Of too many tears  
Women and whiskey  
Are my only friends,  
One gives me strength,  
One just pretends  
  
I've been waiting my whole life  
For things to work out right,  
But, those lonely days turn into lonely nights  
Yes, it do  
  
I've heard all the wisdom  
Of prophets and seers,  
It don't soothe my passion  
And it don't ease my fears  
Burned by love  
And blinded by snow,  
Bad luck and trouble  
Are with me wherever I go  
  
I've been waiting my whole life  
For things to work out right,  
But those lonely days turn into lonely nights  
Lonely days, lonely nights,  
Lonely days, lonely nights  
  
Lonely days, lonely nights,  
Someday babe, it's gonna be alright  
Lonely days, lonely nights,  
Someday babe, it's gonna be alright for me, for me  
  
Lonely days, lonely nights,  
Someday babe, it's gonna be alright
