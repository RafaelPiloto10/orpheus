[Verse 1:]  
I never felt it coming, but you love in a supernatural way  
Now you got me running, babe I? M running and I can? T get away  
And I feel like I lost control of my very soul, yes I did  
Does it mean that much to you And all the things we? Ve been through  
What? S a poor boy to do  
And I just wanna let you know that I love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I? M face to face in the mirror  
And I see what love has done  
Let me tell you my thoughts and my visions  
Old Habits,
