She's sun and rain, she's fire and ice  
A little crazy but it's nice  
And when she gets mad, you best leave her alone  
'Cause she'll rage just like a river  
Then she'll beg you to forgive her  
She's every woman that I've ever known  
  
She's so New York and then L.A.  
And every town along the way  
She's every place that I've never been  
She's making love on rainy nights  
She's a stroll through Christmas lights  
And she's everything I want to do again  
  
It needs no explanation  
'Cause it all makes perfect sense  
When it comes down to temptation  
She's on both sides of the fence  
  
No it needs no explanation  
'Cause it all makes perfect sense  
When it comes down to temptation  
She's on both sides of the fence  
  
She's anything but typical  
She's so unpredictable  
Oh but even at her worst she ain't that bad  
She's as real as real can be  
And she's every fantasy  
Lord she's every lover that I've ever had  
And she's every lover that I've never had
