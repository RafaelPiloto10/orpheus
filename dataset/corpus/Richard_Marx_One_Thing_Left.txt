My life is one big smile  
As I cross off the things on my list  
The splendor goes on for miles  
I don't know what could be left to wish  
I'm just living the dream  
I do all right if you know what I mean  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I've closed the door  
And locked it tight  
And turned off every single light  
Another perfect day is all but through  
Now me getting over you  
Is the one thing left to do  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
The whole world has gone insane  
The paper says so every day  
And I can always feel the rain  
Even when the sun's in the way  
Yeah just living the dream  
I wish my eyes could forget what they've seen  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've closed the door  
And locked it tight  
And turned off every single light  
And walked away just like you asked me to  
Now me getting over you  
Is the one thing left to do  
Yeah I know that it's me who's not well  
But there's no one but you I can tell  
  
[Chorus:]  
As I close the door  
And lock it tight  
And turn off every single light  
And walk away just like you asked me to  
But me getting over you  
Is the one thing left to do  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Is the one thing left to do
