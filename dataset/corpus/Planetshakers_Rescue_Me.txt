When I'm alone the world is such a different place  
Sometimes its hard to keep the smile upon my face  
It seems like I try so hard and still I let you down  
Its taken so long but now there's one thing that I've found  
  
When everything starts crashing down  
When all I know falls to the ground  
When darkness comes and I can't see  
You're always there to rescue me  
  
Just when I think that I've got it figured out  
You open my eyes and let me see that there's no doubt  
But you've got it all within the power of your hand  
It seems like the more I know the less I understand  
  
When everything starts crashing down  
When all I know falls to the ground  
When darkness comes and I can't see  
You're always there to rescue me  
When all my strength has turned to fear  
When I wonder if you're near  
When I don't know how to break free  
You're always there to rescue me  
  
I wonder if Ill make it through this darkest night  
I need to know your strength in me gonna win this fight  
I'm reaching out wont you take my hand show me to the light  
I know you're by my side  
  
It seems like I try so hard and still I let you down  
Its taken so long but now there's one thing that I've found  
  
When everything starts crashing down  
When all I know falls to the ground  
When darkness comes and I can't see  
You're always there to rescue me  
When all my strength has turned to fear  
When I wonder if you're near  
When I don't know how to break free  
You're always there to rescue me  
You're always there to rescue me  
You're always there to rescue me  
You're always there to rescue me  
You're always there to rescue me
