Yet another early morning and you walk in like it's nothing  
Hold up, hold up, hold up  
Ain't donuts ain't no coffee  
See ya, know ya see me calling and calling  
I should crack ya right in ya forehead  
  
Let me take a breathe (Let me take a breathe)  
And regain my composure  
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)  
If you f'd up it's over.  
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone  
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong  
So just scoo do do doot baby  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a wrap for you baby (It's a wrap)  
It's a wrap for you boy (It's a wrap)  
Oh baby  
  
If I ever misrepresented my self-image  
Then I'm sorry  
I was oh so acquiescent  
But I learn my lesson  
Boy you sorry  
Buh buh buh  
All out in the open  
Don't make me go call Maury Povich  
  
Let me take a breathe (Let me take a breathe)  
And regain my composure  
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)  
If you f'd up it's over.  
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone  
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong  
So just scoo do do doot baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Put all of your shit in the elevator  
It's going down like a denominator  
Trying to keep holding on, holding on  
Boy let me go  
You go wake my neighbors, get away from my door  
That was your last shot you ain't coming back  
It's the martini I mean it baby  
It's wrap  
  
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone  
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong (you dead wrong)  
So just scoo do do doot baby  
Boy I ain't playing a game.  
I told you, I told you  
If you f'd up one more time it's over (It's wrap)  
So get out of my face it's over  
Been sitting here all night leave me alone.  
Since one o'clock A.M. been drinking patron  
Let the credits role, it's a wrap
