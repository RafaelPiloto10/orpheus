Born in 1963  
In the shadow of Kennedy  
I'm still a kid when the levee breaks  
Man, oh man, that's all it takes  
  
And I'm on my way  
  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son, you're on your own  
But all I know is what I feel, and it can't be wrong  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
It's just not done  
  
Back in black and I'm 17  
I've been told, son, let it be  
I got these lines upon my face now  
A room at the heartbreak hotel  
Yeah yeah  
  
Oh well, oh well  
Ah yeah  
  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son, you're on your own  
All I know is what I feel, and it can't be wrong  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
It's just not done  
  
Oh well, oh well  
Alright  
  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son, you're on your own  
But all I know is what I feel, and it can't be wrong  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
It's just not done
