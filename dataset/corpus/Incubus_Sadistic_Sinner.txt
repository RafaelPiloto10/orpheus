Alone in my house  
Full of hate and fear  
Your death is near  
My passion for killing will take you to death  
I slay a victim I torture his wife  
They die by my knife  
I'm coming for you  
So take your last breath  
The more I kill, the more the need grows  
I dislodge the eyes and hack off the nose  
[CHORUS]  
I'm a sadistic sinner  
I will slash you at will  
It is the devil inside me  
Who makes me wanna kill  
Evil  
And you will die by my hand  
Killer  
And I'll make you understand  
Possessed  
Just like the knife in my hand  
Killer  
He taunts my soul and he twists my mind  
The blood of my victims is all they can find  
I dismember the body as its blood is being sprayed  
I gaze in splendor at the mess I have made  
Cold is the blade  
I carry in rage  
They live in fear  
My passion for killing will take you to death  
My soul is a demon that no one can save  
I spread my disease  
I'm coming for you  
So take your last breath  
The more I kill, the more the need grows  
I dislodge the eyes and hack off the nose  
[CHORUS]  
I'm a sadistic sinner  
I will slash you at will  
It is the devil inside me  
Who makes me wanna kill  
I'm  
Sadistic  
Sinner  
I'll kill you slow, I'll kill you fast  
I'm coming for you, I'll kick your ass.
