Gush, gush, gush,  
Tell me when, gush  
Make the pussy just gush  
Make the pussy just gush  
Make the pussy just gush  
Make it, just gush  
Make it, just gush  
I make the pussy just gush  
I make it, just gush  
  
I'm imagining things  
Do you wanna try?  
Take off your halo and wings  
Girl, I can make her fly  
  
I don't know, what's come over me  
My momma didn't raise me that way  
You lit a fire, from inside of me  
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl  
Light that ass on fire  
  
I could be the guy to treat you  
To a nice movie, feed you  
But I don't wanna mislead you  
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty, girl  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? C'mon let's go  
  
Girl the world's watchin'  
From sunset to midnight  
They're tryna catch a glimpse (intimacy)  
Of you and I  
  
I don't know, I don' know what's come over me  
My momma didn't raise me that way  
You lit a fire, from inside of me  
That'll light your seat ablaze, girl  
Ha I light that ass on fire  
  
I could be the guy to treat you  
To a nice movie, feed you  
But I don't wanna mislead you  
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty, girl  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? C'mon let's go  
  
I don't know, what's come over me  
My momma didn't raise me that way  
You lit a fire, from inside of me  
That'd leave those panties in flames, girl  
I light that ass on fire  
  
I could be the guy to treat you  
To a nice movie, feed you  
But I don't wanna mislead you  
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty, girl  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? C'mon let's go  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? C'mon let's go  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on  
Light that ass on fire  
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? C'mon let's go
