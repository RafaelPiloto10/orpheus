Maybe he's right  
Maybe there is something a matter with me  
I just don't see how a world  
That makes it wonderful things  
Could be bad  
  
Look at this stuff  
Isn't it neat  
Wouldn't you think my collections complete?  
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl  
The girl who has everything  
  
Look at this trove  
Treasures untold  
How many wonders can one cavern hold?  
Looking around here you'd think  
Sure, she's got everything  
  
I've got gadgets and gizmos a plenty  
I've got who's, it's, and what's it's galore  
You want a Thing-A-Mabobs?  
I've got twenty  
But who cares?  
No big deal  
I want more!  
  
I wanna be where the people are  
I wanna see wanna see them dancing  
Walking around on those  
What do you call them?  
Oh, feet!  
  
Flippen your fins you don't get to far  
Legs are required for jumpin, dancin  
Strolling along down the  
What's that word again? Street  
  
Up where they walk  
Up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wanderin free  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
What would I give  
If I could live outta these waters  
What would I pay to spend a day  
Warm on the sand  
  
Betcha on land they understand  
Bet they don't reprimend their daughters  
Bright young women  
Sick of swimming  
Ready to stand  
  
And ready to know what the people know  
Ask them my questions and get some answers  
What's a fire and why does it  
What's the word... Burn  
  
When's it my turn  
Wouldn't I love  
Love to explore  
That shore up above  
  
Out of the Sea  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world
