The waves are poundin' on the sand tonight  
I want to take your hand and make it feel so right  
I know I'm ready and I'll never be like this again  
And the sky is trembling and the moon is pale  
We're on the edge of forever and we're never gonna fail  
I know you're ready and we're runnin' on the back of the wind  
  
[Chorus]  
And my body is burnin' like a naked wire  
I want to turn on the juice, I want to fall in the fire  
I'm gonna drown in the ocean in a bottomless sea  
I'm gonna give you what I'm hopin' you'll be givin' to me  
And when the waves are poundin' on the sand tonight  
I want to take your hand and make it good and make it right  
Now the sky is trembling and the moon is pale  
We're on the edge of forever and we're never gonna fail  
  
How hard, how hard, how hard do I gotta try (I want all of your love)  
Surf's up (I need it so bad), surf's up (I need it so bad)  
Surf's up and so am I (I gotta give you some love)  
Surf's up and so am I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Surf's up and so am I, surf's up and so am I
