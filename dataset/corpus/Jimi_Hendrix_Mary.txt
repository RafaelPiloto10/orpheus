After all the Jacks are in their boxes  
And the CLOWNS HAVE ALL gone to bed  
You can hear happiness STAGGERING on down the street  
Footprints dressed in red  
And the wind whispers Mary  
  
A broom is drearly sweeping  
Of the broken pieces of yesterdays life  
Somewhere a queen is weeping  
Somewhere a king has no wife  
And the wind it cries Mary  
  
THE TRAFFIC lights they a turn blue tomorrow  
And shine the emptiness down on my bed  
The tiny island sags down the street  
Cause the life that lives is dead  
And the wind screams Mary.  
  
Will the wind every remember  
The names it has blown in the past  
And with this crush it's old age and it's wisdom  
It whisper no this will be the last  
And the wind cries Mary.
