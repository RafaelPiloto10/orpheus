So it's over,  
This time I know it's gone  
Salt water tasted it too long  
I only know I'm wrong  
Now I know it's gone  
  
Up in flames, up in flames  
Up in flames we have slowly gone  
  
So it's over,  
This time you're flying on  
This time I know no song  
Can stop it slowly burn  
Can stop it slowly gone  
  
Up in flames, up in flames  
Up in flames we have slowly gone  
  
Up in flames, up in flames  
Up in flames we have slowly gone  
Oh, we have slowly gone  
Can we pour some water on?
