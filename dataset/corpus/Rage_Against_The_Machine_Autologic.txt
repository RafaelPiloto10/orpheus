C'mon!  
Go... Go... Go... Ugh..  
Go... Go... Go... Go...  
Drop the A-you-T-O-L-O-G-I-C  
Drop the A-you-T-O-L-O-G-I-C  
Hey!  
Drop the A-you-T-O-L-O-G-I-C  
C'mon  
Drop auto logic  
You thought you could get wit'  
Me and Tommy hittin' man  
Cold dropped a smash hit  
Angry as a battery  
Back in the funk  
''cause I'm not frontin'  
Commin' upon the stage I'll say ya somethin'  
Clear as a project  
The style is hectic  
Guess I'm left with  
A system sceptic  
The truths I'm droppin'  
From the pulpit I'm yellin'  
Inspired by gunshots from a township rebellion  
Word is a rough mix  
Sign of justice  
The rhyme is allowed ''cause you can't philabust this  
Style I'll catch ya  
I'll catch ya the rapture  
Ya murdered my level head  
Ya know that I have to...  
  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Stop before you take a wrong turn  
Stop before you step up on the stage and get burned  
Stop and just listen  
I'm dismissing competition with decisions  
So I guess you'll have to listen and learn  
  
Creative  
So what ya gonna do?  
Ain't no fading  
So what ya gonna do?  
Grab the microphone and say a check one two  
The kid's solo  
Unafraid of any crew  
''cause I'm the type of mother with the maddest  
Status  
Statue or poll  
Paid in full  
No bull never dull  
Always in control  
Taking no shit like I was Manute Boll  
Ugh... Huh... Huh  
  
(speaking)  
Awww ya...  
It goes a just like that... Ya...  
Now break it down...  
  
Auto logic  
On auto pilot  
Silence equals death  
And death equals silence  
The crew that doesn't choose to speak their mind  
Is a crew that looses power over time  
And now that ya finally woke up  
Yo wish your mother fuckin' ass would have spoke up  
Voices in full  
The balled of the bullet  
The mic is a trigger and I pull it  
Droppin' and smashin'  
Thrashin' and bashin' the set  
Mentally and spiritually correct  
Back!... And ya know it's a treat  
''cause every time I step ya know I won't forget ta...  
  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Auto logic (go... Go... Go... Go...)  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
  
Auto logic (go... Go... Go... Go...)  
Yo I got to drop the logic  
Drop auto logic  
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic  
C'mon!
