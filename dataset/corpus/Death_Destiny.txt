Time is a thing we must accept  
The unexpected I sometimes fear.  
Just when I feel there's no excuse for what happens,  
Things fall into place  
I know there is no way to avoid the pain that we must go through  
to find the other half that is true  
Destiny is what we all seek  
Destiny was waiting for you and me  
  
I believe behind confusion awaits the truth for us  
Past the obstacles we face  
I value our life and trust  
Years of questioning why things happen the way they do in life  
Wishing that I could turn back time,  
So we could join our souls  
I know there is no way to avoid the pain that we must go through  
to find the other half that is true  
Destiny is what we all seek  
Destiny was waiting for you and me
