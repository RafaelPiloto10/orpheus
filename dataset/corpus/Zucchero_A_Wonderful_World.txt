I tell ya brother, man shit happens  
By the way, howzit with you?  
Check out the kid, finger on the button  
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful world, huh  
  
Got no desire, uh, to desire  
Hey Jack, ain't that a trip?  
And you Madam, standing here for hire  
Oh yeah, where's your wonderful world?  
  
Refrain:  
I'll be leaving in the morning  
Far away from you  
yes I'm taking that step  
I'm gonna jump inthe blue  
Falling,ending my depression  
It's calling, oh my obsession  
  
There might be days, when I think it's better  
Hey Babe, like you to want me to be  
Pull the chain, down goes the water  
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful world  
  
Refrain 2x  
  
Agiant step in the blue  
  
Refrain  
  
Falling, ending my depression  
It's coming, I can feel the vibration  
Falling, ending my depression  
It's calling, give me wings  
Give me the liberation  
I been lonely Lord  
A final jump in the blue  
Oh no oh no  
A giant step in the blue  
Oh no oh no  
A final jump in the blue
