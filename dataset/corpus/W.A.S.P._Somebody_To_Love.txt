When the truth is found to be lies  
You know the joy within you dies  
  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You Better find someone to love  
  
Find somebody to love  
Find somebody to love  
Find somebody to love  
When the dawn is rose, they are dead  
Yes and you're mine, you're so full of red  
  
Your eyes, I say you eyes may look like his  
Yeah, but in you head, baby  
I'm afraid you don't know where it is  
  
Tears are running  
Running along down your breast  
And your friends baby  
They treat you like a guest
