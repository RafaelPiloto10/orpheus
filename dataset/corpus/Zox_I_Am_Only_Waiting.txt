Every day is an endless dream  
Of traffic lights and gasoline,  
Watching as the world passes me by.  
All my friends have gone away,  
Leaving empty strangers in their place.  
The empty fills me up sometimes.  
  
I am only waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
I am only waiting for someone.  
I've got these words that I've been saving  
For a song that I can't start,  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
  
Every night's the same to me,  
Alcohol and scripted scenes, and looking  
For some answers I won't find.  
A hundred different shades of gray,  
A million miles and nothing seems to change.  
I ain't changed in such a long time.  
  
I am only waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
I am only waiting for someone.  
I've got these words that I've been saving  
For a song that I can't start,  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
  
I am only waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
I am only waiting for someone.  
I've got these words that I've been saving  
For a song that I can't start,  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.
