You're looking at me  
Like I must be mad  
But I've been through all this before  
You'll kick and kick until I'm down  
So don't think you're  
Comin' past my door, oh no  
  
You think that love is such a pain  
So the more it hurts  
The more you laugh  
Just take it and  
Shake it up and down  
Till you think you've had enough  
But you won't get enough of my love  
  
If you want to carry on  
In the same old way  
Treating everyone like a piece of dirt  
Just take it and  
Break it and throw it away  
There won't be anyone left to hurt  
  
North, South, East and West  
Wherever you go  
You'll find the same  
And the only way you'll ever learn  
Is to realize that you're to blame
