Are. Sambora  
  
Theres a danger of getting so close to you  
There comes a time  
When the walls fade away  
And when love turns to bitter blue  
Sometimes it feels like its so hard to stay  
Last night we went to bed angry  
We didint mean what we said  
Seems we never get past forgiveness  
We try to hide, we never learn  
To swallow our pride.  
On the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hate  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
When youre misunderstood  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
Baby life has no guarantee  
Never knowing where loves gonna lead  
Even through youre a part of me  
We have to deal with our pain separately  
Sometimes we both feel like victims  
With no easy way out not, no, no  
Somehow we stand by each other  
When were desperate, and drowning in  
The shadows of doubt.  
On the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hate  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
The times we share the tenderness  
Are the times that keep us alive  
You get in my face, you rough me up  
But baby you know  
can't hurt me nough, to give you up  
And make me let go  
Make me let got oh no, no.  
When youre on the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hare  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
When youre misunderstood  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
Downside of love  
Loves just a long, long road baby  
Yes theres a down side of love  
Stand by my side baby  
When youre on the downside of love  
No, no, no  
Downside of love  
cause its a long, long road baby  
Downside of love.
