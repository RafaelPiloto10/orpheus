Once I was a sentimental thing  
Throw my heart away each spring  
Now a spring romance  
Hasn't got a chance  
Promised my first dance to winter  
All I've got to show's a splinter  
For my little fling  
  
Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse  
That never left the post  
I lay in my room  
Starring up at the ceiling  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Morning kiss wakes trees and flower  
And to them my life  
To drink a toast I walk in the park  
Just to kill those lonely hours  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
All afternoon  
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune  
This is love this is it  
Heard it before  
And I know the score  
And I decide that love is a bore  
Love seem sure around the new year  
Now it's April  
  
Love is just a ghost  
Spring arrived on time  
But what became of you, dear  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Spring is here  
There's no mistaken  
Robins build their nest from coast to coast  
My heart tries the same  
So they won't hear it breaking  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
College boys are riding somewhere  
Tender passion there it grows  
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Love came my way  
I'm holding the last  
We had our day  
Now that's all in the past  
Spring came along  
A season of song  
For love's sweet promise  
But something went wrong  
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic  
Sulfur and molasses was the dose  
Didn't help me a bit  
My condition must be chronic  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
All alone, the party's over  
Winter was a gracious host  
But when you keep praying  
For snow to hide the clover  
Spring can really hang you up the most
