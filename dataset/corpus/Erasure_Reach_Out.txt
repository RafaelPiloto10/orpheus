Don't walk away  
I need you more than words can say  
I feel for you, this everlasting flame  
My everlasting flame  
  
I will wash away your tears  
Through the pain and through the sorrow  
Better days are still to come  
If you would only turn around and  
  
[Chorus]  
Reach out and touch me  
Reach out and hold me  
Reach out and touch me!  
  
You feel the rain  
I feel the tear drops run down my face  
You hide your fear in everlasting shame  
My everlasting flame  
  
We have wasted so much time  
So you're saying now it's over  
Better days are still to come  
Don't turn your back on me now, darling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will wash away your tears  
Through the pain and through the sorrow  
Better days are still to come  
If you would only turn around and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't walk away from me now darling  
I need you now much more than ever  
Don't you walk away from me my darling  
  
Don't walk away from me now darling  
(Reach out and touch me)  
I need you now much more than ever  
(Reach out and hold me)  
Don't you walk away from me my darling  
(Reach out and touch me!)
