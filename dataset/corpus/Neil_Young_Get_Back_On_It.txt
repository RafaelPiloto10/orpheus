Think I'll get back on the highway  
I hope I'll see you soon  
Get back on it, get back on it  
Think I'll get back on the highway  
I hope I'll see you soon  
Get back on it, get back on it  
I may be late in comin' though  
I got some things I gotta do  
  
Don't let me see your tail lights  
I pull a heavy load  
Get back on it, get back on it  
Don't let me see your tail lights  
I pull a heavy load  
Get back on it, get back on it  
There ain't no way to stop it though  
Oh, it might explode.  
  
It's too late for General Custer  
Too late for Robert E. Lee  
Get back on it, get back on it  
It's too late for General Custer  
Too late for Robert E. Lee  
Get back on it, get back on it  
But I'll get back on the highway  
Before it's too late for me  
Get back on it, get back on it.  
  
Think I'll get back on the highway  
I hope I'll see you soon  
Get back on it, get back on it  
Think I'll get back on the highway  
I hope I'll see you soon  
Get back on it, get back on it  
I may be late in comin' though  
I got some things I gotta do.
