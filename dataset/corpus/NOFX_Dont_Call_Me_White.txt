Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
The connotations wearing my nerves thin  
Could it be semantics generating the mess we're in?  
  
I understand that language breeds stereotype  
But what's the explanation for the malice, for the spite?  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
I wasn't brought here, I was born  
Circumcised, categorized, allegiance sworn  
Does this mean I have to take such shit  
For being fair skinned? No!  
  
I ain't a part of no conspiracy, I'm just you're average joe  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Represents everything I hate  
The soap shoved in the mouth to cleanse the mind  
The vast majority of sheep  
  
A buttoned collar, starched and bleached  
Constricting veins, the blood flow to the brain slows  
They're so fuckin ordinary white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Oh, we're better off this way?  
Oh, say what you're gonna say  
  
So go ahead and label me an asshole  
'cause I can  
Accept responsibility for what I've done  
But not for who I am  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white
