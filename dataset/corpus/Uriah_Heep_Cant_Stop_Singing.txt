I can't stop singing  
I can't see the end  
Just a new beginning  
As long as I keep on trying  
I'll survive just fine  
Free to take my time  
  
Ridin' the moon in the midnight sky  
I can see through  
The man who lies with eyes  
And the real thing that's wrong is  
He has no song to lean on  
So I'll take my time  
Just to give you my rhyme  
To try to be sure and open the door  
'Cause there's much more to life  
Than a day and a night to dream on  
  
Now I ain't confessin'  
To same kind of blessin'  
I'm trying to say  
Why I'm happy today  
I'm not preachin', teachin',  
Makin' some speech in dedication  
'Cause it's no good me sayin'  
Where the blame should be layin'  
For with that kind of reason  
It comes out the same  
With an ear to the ground  
Each day I found inspiration
