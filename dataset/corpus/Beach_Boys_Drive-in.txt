Every time I have a date there's only one place to go  
That's to the drive in  
It's such a groovy place to talk and maybe watch a show  
Down at the drive in  
  
Forget about the plot, it'll do very well  
But make sure you see enough so you're prepared to tell  
About the drive in  
I love the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)  
  
If the windows get fogged you'll have to take a breath  
Down at the drive in  
Or the cat dressed in white will scare you both to death  
Down at the drive in  
  
A big buttered popcorn and an extra large coke  
A few chili dogs and man I'm goin' broke  
Down at the drive in  
Yeah at the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)  
  
Don't sneak your buddies in the trunk 'cause they might get caught  
By the drive in  
And they'd look kinda stupid gettin' chased through the lot  
Around the drive in  
  
If you say you watch the movie you're a couple o' liars  
And "remember only you can prevent forest fires"  
Down at the drive in  
  
I love the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)  
Down at the drive in  
  
I love the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)  
Down at the drive in  
  
I love the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)
