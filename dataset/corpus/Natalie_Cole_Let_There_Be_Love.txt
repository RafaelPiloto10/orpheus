Let there be you, let there be me  
Let there be oysters under the sea  
Let there be wind, occasional rain  
Chili Con Carne, and sparkling champagne  
  
Let there be birds to sing in the trees  
Someone to bless me whenever I sneeze  
Let there be Cuckoos, a lark and a dove  
But first of all, please  
Let there be love  
  
Let there be birds to sing in the trees  
I need someone to bless me whenever I sneeze  
Let there be Cuckoos, Cuckoos  
A lark and a dove  
But first of all, please  
Let there be love  
  
Oh let there be love ya'll  
Ooh we gotta have some, really gotta have some  
We need love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love  
Say we need a little bit of love, little bit, little bit of love  
  
Really need a little bit
