Hey man you know I'm really okay  
The gun in my hand will tell you the same  
But when I'm in my car  
Don't give me no crap  
  
'Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap  
When I go driving I stay in my lane  
But getting cut off makes me insane  
I open the glove box  
  
Reach inside  
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride  
I guess I got a bad habit  
And it ain't goin' away Yeah  
  
Well they say the road's a dangerous place  
If you flip me off I'm the danger you'll face  
You drive on my ass  
You're foot's on the gas  
  
And your next breath is your last  
Drivers are rude  
Such attitudes  
But when I show my piece  
  
Complaints cease  
Something's odd  
I feel like I'm God  
You stupid dumb shit god damn mother fucker  
  
I open the glove box  
Reach inside  
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride
