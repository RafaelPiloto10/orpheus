Well, hello there  
My it's been a long, long time  
How 'm I doin'  
Oh, I guess I'm doing fine  
It's been so long now, but it seems like  
It was only yesterday  
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away  
  
How's your new love  
I hope he's doing fine  
Heard you told him  
That you'd love him 'til the end of time  
Now that's the same thing, that you told me  
Seems like just the other day  
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away  
  
Gotta go now  
I guess I'll see you around  
Don't know when though  
Never know when I'll be back in town  
But just remember what I tell you  
In time, you're going to pay  
And it's surprising how time slips away
