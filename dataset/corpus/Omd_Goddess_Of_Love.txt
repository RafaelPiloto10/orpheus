Goddess of love  
Goddess of love  
She never slows down  
And she can't get enough  
The goddess of love  
The goddess of love  
She's holding her heart to the stars above  
  
She can't afford dreams  
And her clothes are old  
She can't afford hope  
Wouldn't be so bold  
But she's holding his heart  
And she won't let go again  
  
She's a femme fatal  
Well that's what they say  
But she knows he couldn't love her  
Any other way  
Cause she's holding him now  
And she won't let go again  
Yes, she's holding him now  
And she won't let go again  
  
Goddess of love  
Goddess of love  
She never slows down  
And she can't get enough  
The goddess of love  
The goddess of love  
She's holding her heart to the stars above  
  
She never slows down  
And she doesn't play straight  
Just cruising around in her own sweet way  
But she's taking her time  
And he's gonna get fooled again  
She learned about life  
Til she wished shew were dead  
So she treats that guy like a hole in the head  
Can you see him now  
He'll never get lucky again

She looks just great and she never slows down  
And she's holding his heart and she won't let go again

Oh, she's holding his heart and she won't let go again  
Yes, she's holding his heart and she won't let go again
