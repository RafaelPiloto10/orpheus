The sun comes up  
The breakfast show  
Can't you see me running  
It's crazy don't you know?  
(Don't you know? Don't you know?)  
  
The moon is high  
I'm working through the night  
Will somebody tell me  
Where do all the hours go?  
(I don't know - I don't know.)  
  
It don't stop  
No, it's never gonna stop  
Why do I have to wear so many things on my head?  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
One day I'm a lover  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
All because I'm driven  
To be the very best for you.  
  
The water is hot  
(So hot)  
The phone don't stop  
(Hello, good-bye)  
So how do I manage  
To hold on to my sanity?  
(I don't know, baby, I don't know)  
  
The red dress on  
Time for having fun  
(Time for having fun)  
But can I really be  
The girl you think you see in me?  
  
The spirit is willing  
But the flesh is weak  
Why do I have to wear so many things on my head?  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
(One day I'm a mother)  
One day I'm a lover  
(One day I'm a lover)  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
(Working for a livin')  
All because I'm driven  
(All because I'm driven)  
To be the very best for you.  
  
Hats!  
One day I'm a mother  
(One day I'm a mother)  
One day I'm a lover  
(One day I'm a lover)  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
All because I'm driven  
To be the very best for you.  
  
This may be a dream come true  
This may be poetry in motion  
This may be a dream come true  
But when it all comes down  
It's an awful lot to do.  
  
Hats!  
It don't stop  
No it's never gonna stop  
Why do I have to wear things on my head?  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
(One day I'm a mother)  
One day I'm a lover  
(One day I'm a lover)  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
(Working for a livin')  
All because I'm driven  
(All because I'm driven)  
To be the very best for you.  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
(One day I'm a mother)  
One day I'm a lover  
(One day I'm a lover)  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
All because I'm driven  
To be the very best,  
Very best (Nah, Nah, Nah).  
  
Hats!  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
(Working for a livin')  
All because I'm driven  
(All because I'm driven)  
To be the very best  
  
It don't stop  
No, it's never gonna stop  
Why do I have to wear?  
Why to I have to wear?  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
One day I'm a lover  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
All because I'm driven  
To be the very best for you.
