I opened my eyes,  
Barely alive, without you.  
Feeling no pain, I'm not the same without you.  
  
Save me! Save me!  
Watching you watching  
Me from afar, I'm... drowning. Feeling as though  
We've been here before. Know what I mean?  
  
There's a river in your eyes and I'm swept away  
Breaking inside out, promising to stay  
Together again, a lifetime stranded apart  
  
Save me! Save me!  
Watching you watching  
Me from afar, I'm... reeling. Feeling as though  
We've been here before. Know what I mean?  
  
But your river calls to me and I'm swept away.  
Breaking inside out, promising to stay  
Together again, a lifetime stranded apart  
  
Save me! Save me!
