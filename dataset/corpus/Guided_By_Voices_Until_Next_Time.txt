I'm of to work again  
There goes Mario Andreddy  
She's a real believer  
In getting there first everytime  
  
The first shall be the last  
And the last shall be the first  
Until next time  
  
Well, you're unbelievable  
In the mystic air  
Was it just not in your cause  
It seems so unfair!  
  
So line 'em up  
Shine 'em up and get them prepared  
You're the next generation  
  
The first shall be the last  
And the last shall be the first  
Until next time
