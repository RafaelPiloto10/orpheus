(new perceptions)  
You say her love has gone forever  
And something has  
Gone from your soul  
It's left you so cold  
Though you wish  
You had the answer  
The question is always untold  
Always on hold  
What's in the mirror  
What do you see  
It's a logical progression  
When you think that  
You lost all that time  
It's all in your mind  
What's in the mirror  
What do you see  
Lay down now and close your eyes  
It's only just begun  
'cause mind and body  
Flow in perpetual motion  
Set free all your memories  
They're tearing you apart  
'cause you know that  
Love is the only direction  
That reputation that you live by  
Says something about what's inside  
Nowhere to hide  
There is no amount of heartache  
That could ever  
Wash over this burning  
Forever learning  
Look in the mirror  
Will you do it all again  
You got time on your side  
You know you'll find  
The truth within you  
You got time on your side  
As the seconds tick away  
Love is waiting for you  
You got time on your side  
You say her love has gone forever  
And the image has left you so cold  
Still in your soul  
There's no way  
You're gonna turn back  
You'll never wash over this burning  
Forever learning  
Look in the mirror  
Will you do it all again  
Lay down now and close your eyes  
It's only just begun  
'cause mind and body  
Flow in perpetual motion  
You got time on your side  
As the seconds tick away  
Love is waiting for you
