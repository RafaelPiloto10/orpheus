Day after day  
Miles and miles of railroad track  
Night after night  
Hummin' of the wheels  
Their hummin' seems to say  
He'll follow you someday  
But someday seems a million miles away  
Wish I could turn around  
And run back home again  
I've had no mercy  
Since the blues got on this train  
  
Day after day  
Make a dollar, need it twice  
Night after night  
Lie awake and dream  
Of days of auld lang syne  
Moonlight through the pine  
And linen table cloths all stained with wine  
Wish I could turn around  
And run back home again  
I've been so empty  
Since I caught that eastbound train  
  
Day after day  
Watch the hands move 'round the clock  
Night after night  
Searching for my soul  
So this must be my fate  
To sit and weep and wait  
And pray my darlin' comes before too late  
Wish I could turn around  
And run back home again  
I've been so lonely  
Since I caught that eastbound train
