[Neil Young cover]  
  
Colors on the street  
Red, white and blue  
People shufflin' their feet  
People sleepin' in their shoes  
But there's a warnin' sign  
On the road ahead  
There's a lot of people sayin'  
We'd be better off dead  
Don't feel like Satan,  
But I am to them  
So I try to forget it,  
Any way I can.  
  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world.  
  
I see a woman in the night  
With a baby in her hand  
Under an old street light  
Near a garbage can  
Now she puts the kid away,  
And she's gone to get a hit  
She hates her life,  
And what she's done to it  
There's one more kid  
That will never go to school  
Never get to fall in love,  
Never get to be cool.  
  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world.  
  
We got a thousand points of light  
For the homeless man  
We got a kinder, gentler,  
Machine gun hand  
We got department stores  
And toilet paper  
Got styrofoam boxes  
For the ozone layer  
Got a man of the people,  
Says keep hope alive  
Got fuel to burn,  
Got roads to drive.  
  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world.
