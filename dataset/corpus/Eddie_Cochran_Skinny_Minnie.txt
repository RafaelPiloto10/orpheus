Well I got a girl they call Skinnie Minnie  
She may be skinny but she's got plenty  
The kind of lovin' that I desire  
The kind of love that sets my soul on fire  
Skinnie Minnie, man that gal can love  
She's long and lean like a stringbean  
She don't look good in blue jeans  
Her hair hangs down like a rag mop  
She makes my heart go flippedy-flop  
She can't cook, she ain't much on looks  
The things she knows, she didn't read in books  
Skinnie Minnie, man that gal can love  
  
When me and Minnie walk down the street  
All the boys stop and stare  
But if they knew just what I do  
You bet your life they'd love her too  
Well, when I kiss her out in the dark  
I tear the thing up, there's so much spark  
Skinnie Minnie, man that gal can love
