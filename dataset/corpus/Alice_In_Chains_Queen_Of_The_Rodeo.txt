My daddy was a trucker  
Left home when I was three  
He fell for some dude in Austin  
Then it was mom and me  
She always wanted a daughter  
Well look at what she got  
A'hit me, beat me, a faggot I ain't  
But a real man they say I'm not  
I'm the queen, queen of the rodeo  
Queen, queen of the rodeo  
So cowboy, if you're lookin for lovin'  
I ain't no queer, go fuck a steer  
"I think there's one over there"  
I drink too much, I smoke too much  
I'm a human waste  
I buy a lot of cheap alcohol  
But I'll tell ya honey, I really hate the taste  
I dressed in drag, they call me a fag  
But boy, I really don't care  
Cause last night I met your girlfriend, sucker  
And I hope ya like to share, cause she did  
I'm the queen, queen of the rodeo  
Queen, queen of the rodeo  
So cowboy, if you're lookin to fight  
I ain't no wimp, I scratch and bite  
"And I'm gonna kick your ass too"  
Queen, queen of the rodeo  
Fuck You!  
Queen, queen of the rodeo  
Queen, queen of the rodeo
