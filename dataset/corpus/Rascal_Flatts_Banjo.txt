When I lose my smile  
When my thoughts get jumbled  
When the air and b.s. get too thick  
Can't take a breath without getting sick  
I've had enough with this concrete jungle  
I drop my truck in drive  
I pick up my baby  
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey  
We exit off that old highway  
Sometimes you gotta go beyond the pavement  
  
[Chorus]  
You gotta go deep  
Way on back  
Cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
You gotta get lost  
Way on out  
Crickets and frogs  
Yeah you're gettin' close now  
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go  
'Til you hear a banjo, ah there it is  
  
It ain't on no map  
And I'm glad it isn't  
Leave the phone and the GPS,  
Those satellites ain't found it yet,  
Got our own little piece of heaven hidden  
  
You gotta go deep  
Way on back  
Cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
You gotta get lost  
Way on out  
Crickets and frogs  
Yeah you're gettin' close now  
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go, and you go and you go, go, go, go  
'Til you hear that banjo, yeah woo  
  
You gotta go deep  
Way on back  
Cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
Hell you gotta get lost  
Way on out  
Yeah crickets and frogs  
Hey you're gettin' close now  
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go, and you go and you go, and you go, and you go, and you go, woo oo  
'Til you hear that banjo, kick it  
  
Gotta go deep  
A way on back  
Yeah cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
Four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go, and you go, and you go  
'Til you hear that, 'til you hear that, 'til you hear that banjo  
  
That's nice  
Let's go  
Kick that thing into four wheel drive  
Let's go  
'Til you hear that  
  
Until you hear that banjo  
Until you hear that banjo
