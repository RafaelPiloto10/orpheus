Do I feel alright?  
I'll go anywhere you say you want to to take me  
Save me, run away-ay-ay, steal away-ay-ay  
'Cause I feel alright  
I'll do anything you say you want to make me  
Take me, far away-ay-ay, run away-ay-ay  
  
We've been up all night  
Tryin' to avoid a situation  
Hold me, let me feel your way  
'Cause I want to stay  
Let them all start talkin'  
We won't give ourselves away  
  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness  
  
Do you feel alright?  
An' can you see me when you're lookin' in your mirror  
Crazy, try to find a way, so your heart don't pay  
Run away-ay-ay  
Don't you give yourself away  
  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness  
Our love leads to madness
