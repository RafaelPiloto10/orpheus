Take good care it's a tightrope ride  
Neon city is on the dreamers' side  
Prime time losers going underground  
They take you up and they shake you down.  
  
Can't see nowhere  
Don't know, and I don't care  
'Cause here comes another midtown tunnel vision.  
  
Sidewalk cruiser in stiletto heels  
Frozen heart, eyes of steel  
Wrap your body around my soul  
Electric love is gonna take its' toll.  
  
Can't see nowhere  
Don't know and I don't care  
That girl is the mother of my midtown tunnel vision.  
  
Sunset skyline night turns to day  
Down on the street you could fade away  
No second chances in this here wasted life  
It'll cut you down like a switchblade knife.  
  
Can't see nowhere  
Don't know and I just don't care  
'Cause here comes another midtown tunnel vision.
