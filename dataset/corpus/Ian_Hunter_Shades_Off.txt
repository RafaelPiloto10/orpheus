Where do you go when you've somewhere to run  
But the time isn't right and there's things to be done  
And you're trapped half-way up, you don't want to go back  
So you keep going on - compromising the lack  
  
And you see the green fields as you travel on by  
And you look at the things you'd forgotten to try  
And you wish you were young and you wish you were old  
For the songs always sung and the stories been told  
  
And you thought you were different but what did it mean  
For you tricked yourself trying - life's still unseen  
As it is, as it was, as it always will be  
Will you find out at all what it is to be free  
  
See it never was easy to live with a head  
So I kept to the back room and I live there instead  
What comes from the front-room is only for "Friends"  
I have a bay window but that's where it ends  
  
And it's here I see pictures and my madness is clear  
And there's no longer logic so therefore no fear  
And I'm almost dead with uncontrollable light  
Sometimes when I've written a song - it's alright...
