One more sad tomorrow  
And I'm not very good  
At hiding my sorrow  
It's not the same without you  
So alone and so afraid  
I thought we had it made  
What about us  
What about the way  
We were so in love  
When we were together  
I thought you'd never leave  
Now I know this time you're gone, forever  
[Chorus:]  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you all apart  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why  
One more night without you  
I'm just trying to pretend  
That you're coming back again  
You know I never meant to doubt you (Oh no..)  
We were young and we were free  
Now I can't believe this could happen to me  
What about us  
What about the way  
We were so in love  
When we were together  
I thought you'd never leave  
Now I know this time you're gone, forever  
[Chorus:]  
[Bridge:]  
Tell me who will I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Oh babe I don't want you to go  
Tell me who can I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Baby please don't leave me  
Can't you see you must believe me  
[Chorus:]  
What
