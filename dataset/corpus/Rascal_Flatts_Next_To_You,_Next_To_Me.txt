Next to you, next to me  
Next to you, next to me  
Next to you, next to me  
Baby, next to you, next to me  
  
Ridin' down the road in my pick-up truck  
Ya' better be ready 'cause I'm pickin' you up  
With a full moon shinin' and a little bit a' luck  
We'll run outta gas and maybe get stuck  
  
We can get lost, baby, I don't care  
I ain't worried as long as you're there  
Ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
  
Barbecue chicken in aluminum foil  
Just enough money for my gas and oil  
Who needs your shrimp and your caviar?  
I'd sooner have you just the way you are  
  
Rich people got their money to hold  
Mansion on the hill with diamonds and gold  
Can't compare as far as I can see  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
Ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
  
Radio playin' our favorite song  
Well, I'll change the station if the news comes on  
The signal ain't comin' in too strong  
Make our own music, honey, all night long  
  
If the Good Lord's willin' when we're old and gray  
The kids are grown up and moved away  
We'll be rockin' there side by side  
With a barbeque chicken and the TV guide  
  
Well, there ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
Ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
Ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
  
Next to you, next to me  
Next to you, next to me  
Next to you, next to me  
As long as you're next to me, baby  
  
Next to you, oh sittin' next to me  
I'd sooner have you just the way you are  
Aw, there ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
  
And if the Good Lord's willin' when we're old and gray  
The kids are grown up and moved away  
We'll be rockin' there side by side  
With a barbecue chicken and the TV guide  
Oh, yeah  
There ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me
