I know you have reservations  
And you're just along for the ride  
But I see a slight hesitation  
What are you trying to hide  
  
Don't be afraid to bare your soul  
Nothing you say could be too bold  
I'm growing old  
  
If you don't want my love  
Tell me now cause I'll survive  
If you don't want my love  
I'm sure that somebody does tonight  
  
You make a grown man quiver  
It might be hard to believe  
But it's time to stand and deliver  
You've just been playing with me  
  
I don't want to blow my only chance  
But you've got to show me where you stand  
Or drop my hand  
  
If you don't want my love  
Tell me now cause I'll survive  
If you don't want my love  
It won't be the end of my life  
  
If you don't want my love  
Tell me now cause I'll survive  
If you don't want my love  
I'm sure that somebody does tonight  
  
I don't want to blow my only chance  
But you've got to show me where you stand  
Or drop my hand  
  
If you don't want my love  
Tell me now cause I'll survive  
If you don't want my love  
It won't be the end of my life
