I stood out with my brother  
On a tree lined avenue  
I see the sweetest little creature  
Coming into my view  
And I say to myself, I say man I'm gonna get me some  
Of that bright little angel  
That shines like the morning sun  
Well my brother steps in, faster that light  
And he sweet talks this angel, clean out of sight  
  
I say hey you, you with that look in your eye  
Hey you, you with that look in your eye  
  
Well she moves like a river  
From her head down to her toes  
It's less a way of walking  
More a total flow  
And I say to myself, I wonder  
I wonder if she knows  
What she's doing to me and my brother  
From our heads down to our toes  
Well he's up there on the corner now  
He's playing up that Romeo like only he know how  
  
I say hey you, you with that look in your eye  
Hey you, you with that look in your eye  
Hey you, you that make the stars shine  
Hey you, you with that look in your eye
