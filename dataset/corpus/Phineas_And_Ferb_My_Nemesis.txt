My neme, neme, oooo... My neme, neme, neme.  
My neme, neme, oooo... My neme, neme, neme.  
  
I used to sit alone doin' evil all day,  
But now I think there's someone gonna get on my way, yeah,  
There's someone in my life that does'nt want me to exist,  
  
My neme, neme, oooo... My neme, neme, neme  
And I feel fine cause I've got a nemesis.  
My neme, neme, oooo... My neme, neme, neme(x2)  
  
And I hate him, and he hates me,  
What a wonderful animosities,  
Besides his hat he wears no clothes,  
Now I have someone to oppose...  
  
Cause I've got a nemesis!
