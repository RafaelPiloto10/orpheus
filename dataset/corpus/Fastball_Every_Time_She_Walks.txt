Listen in...  
Listen...  
Listen in...  
Listen...  
Listen in to the sound  
All the day stops  
Chords keep ringing  
Can't believe what I've found  
I'm shellshocked  
Finding out  
When I hear her coming 'round  
I drop everything  
When I hear her coming 'round  
Yeah  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Daylight  
It's alright  
Even when she's gone  
'cause it won't be long  
I know everything is different  
'Cause everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Everything is turned around  
And nothing looks the same to me  
She is music when she walks  
She's playing me a melody  
Everything is turned around  
And nothing looks the same to me  
Listen in...  
Listen...  
Listen in to the sound  
All the day stops  
Chords keep ringing  
Got my feet on the ground  
I'm not losing, losing  
When I hear her coming 'round  
I drop everything  
When I hear her coming 'round  
Yeah  
'Cause everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
I can feel the ground  
Movin' underneath  
And I don't remember how it ever was before  
Everytime she walks  
Everytime she speaks  
It's like the world is turning just for me  
It's like the world is turning just for me
