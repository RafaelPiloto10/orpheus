Where the road runs down but the butternut grove  
To old Bill Skinner's stream  
Do tell at the noonday bell  
It's time for a summertime dream  
In a lunch pail town in a one horse way  
You can live like a king and queen  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
Birds in all creation will be twitterin' in the trees  
And down below's a pond I know  
You can swim in it if you please  
And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down  
You can see what chivalry means  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
On a trip on down to wonderland  
In love among the flowers  
Where time gets lost with no straw boss  
Tallyin' up the hours  
Where the road runs down by the butternut grove  
To old Bill Skinner's stream  
Do tell at the noonday bell  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
Birds in all creation will be twitterin' in the trees  
And down below's a pond I know  
You can swim in it if you please  
And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down  
You can see what chivalry means  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream
