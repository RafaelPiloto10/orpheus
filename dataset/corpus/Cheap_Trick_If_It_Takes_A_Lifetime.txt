If you think my name  
What gives you the right  
Couldn't take the place  
To be with you tonight  
When I fall asleep  
And I dream all night  
No matter where I go  
Can't you see  
What you're doing to me  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
I'll wait for you  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
I'll wait for you  
Get closer  
Closer to me  
Got stories I can't speak  
Got secrets I can't keep  
Can't hide what you're doing to me  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
I'll wait for you  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
I'll wait for you  
I've had better days  
But I'd never wait so long  
When I fall asleep  
And I dream all night  
No matter where I go  
Can't you see  
What you're doing to me  
Sleep awake  
All day all night  
I dream of you  
But I can't believe its true  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
I'll wait for you  
All I want to do  
Is just be with you  
If it takes a lifetime  
I'll wait for you  
I've had better days  
But I'd never wait so long
