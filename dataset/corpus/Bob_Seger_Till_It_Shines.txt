Take away my inhibitions  
Take away my solitude  
Fire me up with your resistance  
Put me in the mood  
Storm the walls around this prison  
Leave the inmates  
Free the guards  
Deal me up another future  
From some brand new deck of cards  
Take the chip off of my shoulder  
Smooth out all the lines  
Take me out among the rustling pines  
Till it shines  
  
Like an echo down a canyon  
Never coming back as clear  
Lately I just judge the distance  
Not the words I hear  
I've been too long on these islands  
I've been far too long alone  
I've been too long without summer  
In this winter home  
Still if we can make the effort  
If we take the time  
Maybe we can leave this much behind  
Till it shines  
  
See the rich man lost and lonely  
Watch him as he dines  
Sitting there just testing all the wines  
Till it shines
