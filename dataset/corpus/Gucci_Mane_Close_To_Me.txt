[Intro]  
It's Gwop, it's Gwoop  
Can't nobody hurt you  
The ones close to ya  
[?]  
It's Gucci, legend  
  
[Hook]  
I know some killas that'll kill ya  
You'll get killed if you get close to me  
I did some thangs, so I gotta keep em close to me  
(I keep my shit close, man, it's Gwop)  
  
[Verse 1]  
I know some niggas that'll killa if you get close to me  
I know some killas and I gotta keep em close to me  
If you a snitch then I don't need ya standin' close to me  
On my own shooters, so I keep my pistol close to me  
Don't force me, nigga, like you saw, the whole world I be smokin' weed  
I dunno you, nigga, you dunno me, nigga  
So don't come close to me  
I had a girl one time, we break up I tell that bitch to leave  
I don't need no nigga, I don't need no bitch  
Just try to get close to me  
Get away, nigga, you standin' too close  
Back up a couple feet  
I dunno you, nigga, you dunno me, nigga  
But you're standin' too close to me  
These niggas be hoes, and a friend of mine fold  
Cuz he ain't on go fo' me  
I love my friends but gotta keep my enemies close to me  
Close call, man, I swear it was a close race  
Close catch, girl, I'mma shoot ya in yo damn face  
I got so much money, bet that close the damn case  
A nigga try me, cold day in hell he get away  
I drop a cool 20, make ya neck break  
They say that Gucci hot headed, that what the vets say  
Realest one, unexpected, that's how my jets play  
And on legit, but still unwind, I got ten brick plays  
She say I'm close to crazy, that what that bitch say  
I say I'm close to very wealthy, like my wrist say  
And I'm a multimillionaire, that's what my dick say  
Six chains on one, ya came in, I'm doin' my thang Slick Rick way  
Ya tryna get close to me, but I don't want no girlfriend
