I'd like to reach out to you  
And learn just how do you do  
So we can still relate  
I'd like to open my mind  
  
So you can come in and find  
How we communicate  
There's a chemical reaction  
And it's causing an attraction  
  
From you to me  
I am not one for convention  
But I have a good intention  
For you from me  
  
Rain is falling and a thunderbolt is crashing through my head  
And there's people and pain all around me  
Someone is calling and electric sparks are everywhere I tread  
My life, it seems, is a sequence of dreams  
And there's people and pain all around me  
  
I'm going down in a black elevator  
'Cause the big masturbator's got his eye on me  
I'm going down 'cause my brain is on fire  
And my soul is a liar 'cause I tried to be free  
Tried to be free, tried to be free...  
  
Freedom in your mind you can have when you dead  
Freedom in your life just depends on your head  
Freedom in your heart can alas never be  
'Cause no one on this earth has been born to be free  
Born to be free, born to me free...  
  
All of my life I have tried to be free  
All of my life I have learned all I see  
All of my life I have searched for a clue  
All of my life I have tried to be true  
Tried to be true, tried to be true...
