Tell me, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you?  
Ooh, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you?  
Now, you have a little calf, hoo hoo, and your milk is turnin' blue  
Oh, your calf is hungry, I believe he needs a suck  
Now, your calf is hungry, I believe he needs a suck  
But your milk is turnin' blue, hoo hoo, I believe he's outta luck  
Now, I feel like milkin' and my cow won't come  
I feel like churnin' it and my milk won't turn  
I'm cryin', please, please, don't do me wrong  
If you see my milk cow, baby, now how, please, drive her home  
But my milkcow been ramblin', hoo hee, for miles around  
But my milkcow been ramblin', hoo hoo, for miles around  
Well, now how can you suck on some other man's bull cow?  
Hoo hoo, in this strange man's town
