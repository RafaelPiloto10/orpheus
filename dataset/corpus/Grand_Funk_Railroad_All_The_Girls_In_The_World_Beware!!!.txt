I got tarter on my teeth, but I don't care.  
I got dark brown stains, in my underwear.  
I'm a crumb and a bum, I'm a slouch and a louse.  
A crazy man who don't give a damn about his self.  
  
Chorus  
All the girls in the world beware!!!  
All the girls in the world beware!!!  
All the girls in the world beware!!!  
All the girls in the world beware!!!  
  
I'm the crazy man.  
I'm the crazy man.  
I'm the craa... Zzy man.  
  
I ain't naive, I got a line or two.  
I'd even make one up, just to lay on you.  
I'm rude and I'm shrewd, I'm fat and I'm bad.  
I'm a man who don't give a damn 'bout who he is.

I'm the crazy man.

All the girls beware.  
All the girls beware.
