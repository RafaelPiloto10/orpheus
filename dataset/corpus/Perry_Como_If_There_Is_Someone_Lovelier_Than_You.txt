If there is someone lovelier than you  
Then I am blind, a man without a mind  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
  
But no, I'm not blind, my eyes have traveled everywhere  
In hopes that I might find, a creature half so fair  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
By all that's beautiful, such beauty can't be true!  
  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
By all that's beautiful, such beauty can't be true!
