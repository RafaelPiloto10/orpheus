Oh, baby, I don't know why  
But somehow I always seem to  
Get tangled up in my pride  
But oh, baby, we're not that blind  
Deep down inside you know  
This love's worth one more try  
Don't push it all aside  
  
'Cause I want to be good for you  
I didn't mean to be bad  
But darling I'm still the best  
That you ever had  
Just give me a chance  
To let me show you how much  
I want to give you my love touch  
Love touch  
  
Why can't I climb your walls  
And find somewhere to hide  
Can't I knock down your door  
And drag myself inside  
I'll light your candles baby  
And maybe I'll light your life  
I want to feel the breathless end  
You come to every night  
This ever changing love  
Is pushing me too far  
I feel the need to reach you  
Right now wherever you are  
These empty arms are getting stronger  
  
Every day  
Believe me baby  
They won't let you get away  
No, they won't let you get away  
  
'Cause I want to be good for you  
I didn't mean to be bad  
But darlin I'm still the best  
That you ever had  
Just give me a chance  
To let me show you how much  
I want to give you my love touch  
Love touch  
  
You know it don't matter  
Who's right who's wrong  
Think we're gonna find out  
If the love is strong  
Just give me a chance  
To win back your trust  
I want to give you my love touch  
Love touch  
(Oh you're gonna get a, oh you're gonna get a big love touch)
