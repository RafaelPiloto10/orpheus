Tell me, what do people do  
When there ain't nothin' to do?  
When there's nobody else around to do  
Nothin' with or to  
Have you ever been in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine  
And the trucks keep a rollin' by  
And you just can't get to sleep  
Even though there's nothin' on your mind?  
  
Tell me what do people say  
When there ain't nothin' to say?  
When there's nobody else around to help you pass the time of day  
Have you ever stared at the ceiling  
Till you thought you'd lose your mind  
Looked for a wall that you could climb  
Still you just can't get to sleep  
Even tho' there's nothin' on your mind?  
  
Have you ever been stuck in a small town motel  
Lookin' all around but there ain't nothin' to see  
In a never endin' mind bendin', troublin' position  
Sayin' why did it happen to me?  
  
Tell me, what do people do  
When there ain't nothin' to do?  
When there's nobody else around to do  
Nothin' with or to  
Have you ever been in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine  
And the trucks keep a rollin' by  
And you just can't get to sleep  
Even though there's nothin' on your mind?  
  
Tell me, what do people do  
When there ain't nothin' to do?  
When there's nobody else around to do  
Nothin' with or to  
Hope you never in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine  
And the trucks keep a rollin' by  
Till you just can't get to sleep  
Even though there's nothin' on your mind?
