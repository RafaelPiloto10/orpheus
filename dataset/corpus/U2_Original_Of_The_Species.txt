Baby slow down  
The end is not as fun as the start  
Please stay a child somewhere in your heart  
  
I'll give you everything you want  
Except the thing that you want  
You are the first one of your kind  
  
And you feel like no-one before  
You steal right under my door  
And I kneel 'cause I want you some more  
I want the lot of what you got  
And I want nothing that you're not  
  
Everywhere you go you shout it  
You don't have to be shy about it  
  
Some things you shouldn't get too good at  
Like smiling, crying and celebrity  
Some people got way too much confidence baby  
  
I'll give you everything you want  
Except the thing that you want  
You are the first one of your kind  
  
And you feel like no-one before  
You steal right under my door  
I kneel 'cause I want you some more  
I want the lot of what you got  
And I want nothing that you're not  
  
Everywhere you go you shout it  
You don't have to be shy about it, no  
And you'll never be alone  
Come on now show your soul  
You've been keeping your love under control  
  
Everywhere you go you shout it  
You don't have to be shy about it  
Everywhere you go you shout it  
Oh my my  
  
And you feel like no-one before  
You steal right under my door  
I kneel 'cause I want you some more  
I want you some more, I want you some more...
