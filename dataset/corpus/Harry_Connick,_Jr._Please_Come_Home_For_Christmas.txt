Bells will be ringing  
The glad, glad news  
Oh, what a Christmas  
To end the blues  
My baby's gone  
I have no friends  
To wish me greetings  
Ooh, once again  
  
Choirs  
Will be singing  
Silent Night  
Christmas carols  
By candlelight  
Please come home  
For Christmas  
Please come home  
For Christmas  
If not for Christmas  
By New Year's night  
  
Friends and relations  
Send salutations  
Sure as the stars  
Shine above  
This is Christmas  
Yeah, Christmas my dear  
The time of year  
To be with the one  
You love  
  
So won't you tell me  
You'll never more roam  
Christmas and New Years  
Will find you home  
Please come home  
For Christmas  
Please come home  
For Christmas  
If not for Christmas  
By New Year's night  
  
There'll be  
No more sorrow  
No grief and pain  
And I'll be happy  
Happy once again
