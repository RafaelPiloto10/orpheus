I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why, I just do  
I don't know why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why, you just do  
  
You never seem to want my romancing  
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
I don't know why, why I love you like I do  
I don't know why, I just do  
  
I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why, I just do  
I don't know why, why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why but you do  
  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Why the only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why, I just do
