When you're weary, feeling small  
When tears are in your eyes  
I'll dry them all  
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough  
And friends just can't be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Sail on, silver girl, sail on by  
Your time has come to shine  
All your dreams are on their way  
See how they shine....  
Ooooh, and if you ever need a friend  
I'm sailing right behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind.......
