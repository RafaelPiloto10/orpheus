Manowar Manowar living on the road  
When we're in town speakers explode  
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud  
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd  
  
They want to keep us down  
But they can't last  
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass  
Gonna keep on burnin'  
We always will  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
  
We like it hard, we like it fast  
We got the biggest amps, man they blast  
True metal people want to rock not pose  
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes  
  
They want to keep us down  
But they can't last  
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass  
Gonna keep on burnin'  
We always will  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
  
We're the kings of metal commin' to town  
When we light up, have the roof nailed down  
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud  
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down  
  
They want to keep us down  
But they can't last  
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass  
Gonna keep on burnin'  
We always will  
Other bands play Manowar kill
