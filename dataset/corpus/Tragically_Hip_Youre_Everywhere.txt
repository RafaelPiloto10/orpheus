You are everywhere, within and without  
Where it don't matter what we used to do now  
Where I feed my people when I get behind the plow  
When I write the tiger hangin' on by his eyebrows  
Somehow where the gang in me is bein' all that it can be  
Somehow part hope is a plan and part vigilante streak  
When I reel my Irish in, when I sleep on the train  
In straight lines through shadows, you're there  
Where the future lies under no moon at night  
At the ballroom hangin' out, you're there  
You are there when I stop writing things down  
And when I forget about who I am now  
Forget about who's kissin' her, who's behind my plow  
Now it's time to drown all of that poetry out  
Somehow where democracy is how we all learn to sleep  
With ourselves drawing to ourselves everything we can carry  
When I reel my Irish in, when I sleep in the rain  
In straight lines through shadows, you're there  
Where the future lies under no moon at night  
At the ballroom hangin' out, you're there  
There's no escaping  
This dream we're dancing  
With no distractions  
When I reel my Irish in, when I sleep on the plane  
In straight lines through shadows, you're there  
Where the future lies under no moon at night  
At the ballroom hangin', you're there  
You're everywhere, you're there  
You're everywhere, you're there  
You're everywhere, you're there  
You're everywhere, you're there
