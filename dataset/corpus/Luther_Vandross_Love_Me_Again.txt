What are we saying?  
For what are we praying?  
Using the words we both wanna hear  
  
What are we doing?  
The whole thing is proving  
We're feeling the same way we always did  
  
So, here we go once again  
It's just like back when  
I clearly remember the way we were then  
So come back and love me again  
  
I was the one who adored you  
And I waited all this time for you  
But, you can't tell love what to do  
It's so hard but it's true  
You used to love me completely  
And I'd really love you to need me  
So darling, tell me you can find the way  
Find a way to love me, again  
  
I've heard the stories of hearts that get broken  
But, if we take it slowly, it won't have to be  
One step at a time heart, too fast and it all'll fall apart  
I know we're survivors, but I'll speak for me  
  
Even as strong as I am  
I don't think I can  
Lost outside the world  
I don't know just where I stand  
So hurry back girl, and love the boy again  
  
I was the one who adored you  
And I'd wait a million years for you  
But, you can't tell love where to go  
This is one thing that we know  
You used to love me completely  
And I'd really love you to need me  
So darling, tell me you can find the way  
Find a way to love me again  
  
Find any way that you can, love me again  
Just think it over and then, love me again
