Night lights, those blues-in-the-night lights  
Are no longer bright lights since I'm without you  
Sweet dreams, oh where did they fly to?  
You're gone and who can I cry to?  
  
Those night lights remind me of bright eyes  
And beautiful white lies too good to be true  
As I go on my way with all my heart I pray  
That those night lights will lead me to you  
  
Those night lights remind me of bright eyes  
And beautiful white lies too good to be true  
As I go on my way with all my heart I pray  
That those night lights will lead me to you
