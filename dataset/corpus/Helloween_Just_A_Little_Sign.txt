Here I stand alone again  
Hundreds all around  
Didn't come here to make a friend  
But to listen to the sound  
Something's growing in my pants  
As she looks into my eyes  
Now I smile the whole damn night  
But my dream acts cold as ice  
  
It's time for just a little sign  
It's time, make believe the world is mine  
It's time for just a little sign  
It's time, make believe the world is mine  
Just a little sign  
  
Shouldn't I dare to talk to her  
But what is it I would say  
Surely I'd look like a clown  
For my smiles freeze on my face  
  
It's time for just a little sign  
It's time, make believe the world is mine  
It's time for just a little sign  
It's time, make believe the world is mine  
Just a little sign
