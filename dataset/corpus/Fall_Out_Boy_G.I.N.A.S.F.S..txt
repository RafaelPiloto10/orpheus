I've loved everything about you that hurts, so  
Let me see your moves,  
Let me see your moves  
Lips pressed this close to mine,  
True Blue  
  
But the prince of any failing empire knows that  
Everybody wants, everybody wants  
To drive on through the night  
If it's a drive back home  
  
Things aren't the same anymore  
Some nights, they get so bad  
You almost pick up the phone  
  
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns  
I sleep with your old shirts  
And walk through this house in your shoes,  
You know it's strange  
It's a strange way of saying,  
I'm supposed to love you  
I'm supposed to love you  
  
I've already given up on myself twice  
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm  
Threw caution to the wind  
But I've got a lousy arm  
  
And I've traced your shadows on the wall  
Now I kiss them whenever I'm down  
Whenever I'm down  
Figured on not figuring myself out  
  
Things aren't the same anymore  
Some nights, they get so bad  
I almost pick up the phone  
  
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns  
I sleep with your old shirts  
And walk through this house in your shoes,  
You know it's strange  
It's a strange way of saying  
That I know I'm supposed to love you  
I'm supposed to love you  
  
Born under a bad sign, but you saved my life  
That night on the roof of your hotel  
"Cross my heart and hope to die  
Splintered from the headboard in my eye"  
Photo-proofed kisses I remembered so well  
  
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns  
I sleep with your old shirts  
And walk through this house in your shoes,  
You know it's strange  
It's a strange way of saying  
That I know I'm supposed to love you  
I'm supposed to love you  
  
Now press repeat
