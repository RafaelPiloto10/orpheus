Everyday when I look in the mirror  
I try to see where my soul's at now  
Happy day is it further or nearer?  
On the way, will I find it somehow?  
  
Yesterday's gone  
Love lead me on, oh  
I won't ask why  
  
Roll away it's only time and the river  
Roll away to the endless sea  
Roll away it could all change tomorrow  
This is life in it's glory  
And the river runs free  
Roll away  
  
My dreams build the walls of the city  
Broken hearts tear them all down  
It ain't always easy and pretty  
It's just the world turning around  
Give us this day  
Give us this night, oh  
It'll be all right  
  
Roll away it's only time and the river  
Roll away to the endless sea  
Roll away it could all change tomorrow  
This is life in it's glory  
And the river runs free  
Oh, roll away  
  
Everyday when I look in the mirror  
I try to see where my soul's at now  
  
Roll away it's only time and the river  
Roll away to the endless sea  
Roll away it could all change tomorrow  
This is life in it's glory  
And the river runs free  
  
Roll away it's only time and the river  
Roll away to the endless sea  
Roll away it could all change tomorrow  
This is life in it's glory  
And the river runs free  
Roll away, ahh, oh  
Ahh, ha, ho
