Straight ahead  
  
Hello my friends  
So happy to see you again  
I was so alone  
All by myself I just couldn't make it  
  
Have you heard baby  
With the wind blown round  
Have you heard baby  
A whole lot a people comin' right on down  
Communication, yeah, is comin' on strong  
I don't give damn baby  
If your hair is short or long  
I said get outta your grave ha  
Oh everybody is dancin' in the street  
Hey  
Do what you know  
Don't be slow  
You got to practice what you preach  
Yeah ha  
Cause it's time for you and me  
Come to face reality  
Forget about the past baby  
Things ain't what they used to be  
Keep on strait ahead  
Keep on strait ahead  
Strait ahead baby  
Strait ahead baby  
Whoo  
  
We got to stand side by side  
We got to stand together and organize  
Send power to the people, that's what their screamin'  
Freedom of the soul  
Pass it on, pass it on, to the young and the old  
You gotta tell the truth and the truth yeah  
They're gonna need a whole lot of lives  
Because one of these days baby  
They'll be runnin' things  
So when ya give 'em love you better give it right  
Woman and child and man and wife  
The best love to have is the love of life  
That's about all baby  
  
Hello, my friends

Now I've been all by myself  
I don't think I could make it alone  
I don't think I could make it alone
