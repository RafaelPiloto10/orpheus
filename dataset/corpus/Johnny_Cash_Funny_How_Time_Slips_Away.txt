Well, hello there  
  
My, it's been a long, long, long time  
How am I doin'? Oh, I guess that I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now but it seems now  
That it was only yesterday  
  
G, ain't it funny how time slips away  
  
And how's your new love, well, I hope that he's doin' fine  
And I heard you told him that you'd love him til' the end of time  
Now that's the same thing that you told me  
And it seems like only yesterday  
  
G, ain't it funny how time just slips away  
  
Oh, I've got to go now, thank you, and I guess I'll see you around  
But I don't know when though  
'Cause I never know when I'll be back in town  
But remember what I tell you that in time you're gonna pay  
  
And it's surprising how time just slips away  
G, ain't it funny how time just slips away
