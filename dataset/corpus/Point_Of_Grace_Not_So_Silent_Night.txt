Do you hear what I hear  
On this Christmas day  
Echoes from a stable long ago  
Word of God, now bundled  
In a manger lined with hay  
Baby with a message, born to grow  
  
Hear the sound  
Of chains now broken  
Love came down  
God has spoken  
Songs of hope  
Ringing through the sky  
On this not so silent night  
  
Oh, to be an angel  
On a midnight clear  
Joining in a chorus of unending joy  
Tell it on the mountain  
  
Heaven has drawn near  
Hand of God with fingers of a baby boy  
  
Hear the bells  
Resound with glory  
Hear them tell  
The age-old story  
Songs of hope  
Ringing through the sky  
On this not so silent night  
  
Voice of God  
In a newborn cry  
A Father calls  
Through a gift of life
