Wake up man it's late but not too late,  
It's six o'clock like everyday!  
  
Get your things run and forget the rain,  
Take power pills don't miss your train!  
  
And you'd like to be another  
A different guy and a better lover  
For your love, for your life check your way.  
And you like the rock 'n' roller  
A different life and whiskey Cola  
But don't be low keep your own style  
And catch your train!  
  
Don't be lazy man and work off your ass,  
He's the boss you've gotta do what he says!  
  
Catch your train, run and forget those ways,  
Keep it cool it's not too late!  
  
And you'd like to be another  
A different guy and a better lover  
For your love, for your life check your way.  
And you like the rock 'n' roller  
A different life and whiskey Cola  
But don't be low keep your own style  
And catch your train!
