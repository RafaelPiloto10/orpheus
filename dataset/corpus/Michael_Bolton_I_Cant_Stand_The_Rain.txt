I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Because he's not here with me  
  
Hey, window pain  
Do you remember  
How sweet it used to be?  
When we were together  
Everything was so grand  
Now that we're parted  
There's one sound  
That I just can't stand  
  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I can't stand the rain
