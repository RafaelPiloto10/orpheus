When I'm talkin' nothing's getting through  
If I'm sreaming it's never clear to you  
Can you hear me, am I wasting my time?  
Am I working in a one man band?  
When I'm lookin' straight into your eyes  
Is there anyone home? You're tellin' me lies  
Listen to me, are you wasting my time?  
It's lonely in a one man band  
Lonely in a one man band  
Words out of line, don't ever hurt you  
Forever crying trying to turn you around  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
One man band  
Anticipating what you're gonna do  
Still waiting for a sign from you  
Come together, are we wasting our time?  
And I'll always be a one man band  
I'll always be a one man band  
It's lonely in a one man band  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh
