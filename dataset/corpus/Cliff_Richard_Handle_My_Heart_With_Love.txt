Your sweet embrace, your hand in mine  
So close together  
How many times I've made you mine  
Is this forever?  
Promises and dreams we've shared  
Do you remember?  
Oh, here we are, so near and yet so far  
From each other  
Chorus:  
Handle my heart with love  
Don't let me hope in vain  
Only your touch can save my heart  
From breaking again  
So handle my heart with love  
Stay and you'll ease my pain  
Only your touch can save my heart  
From breaking again  
Your gentle smile, your tender touch  
So captivating  
No other love has meant this much  
And I'll go on waiting  
One day in your arms I'll hear  
This is forever  
I know it's there, though right now it's hard to care  
For each other  
Repeat chorus  
Don't make us part  
Please don't brake my heart again
