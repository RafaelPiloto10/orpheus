The chamber was in confusion - all the voices shouting loud.  
I could only just hear, a voice quite near say, "Please help me through the
crowd:"  
I said if I helped her thru' she could help me too, but I could see that she
wholly blind.  
But from her pale face and her pale skin, a moonlight shined.  
  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna lead you right.  
  
When I'd led her through the people, the angry noise began to grow.  
She said, "Let me feel the way the breezes blow, and I'll show you where to
go."  
So I followed her into a big round cave, she said, "They're coming for you,
now don't be afraid."  
Then she sat me down on a cold stone throne, carved in jade.  
  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna lead you right.  
  
She leaves me in my darkness,  
I have to face, face my fear,  
And the darkness closes in on me,  
I can hear a whirring sound growing near.  
I can see the corner of the tunnel,  
Lit up by whatever's coming here.  
Two golden globes float into the room  
And a blaze of white light fills the air.
