I can't remember when  
He looked at me and cried  
Said something broke inside of you  
Were my best friend  
Whatever come our way  
You know I'm your gal 'till the e-e-end  
  
When I finally go away  
I know you'll look for me one day  
  
When you let love down  
Oh you let love down  
I don't have to remind you  
But you know that I'm around  
When you let love down  
Oh you let me down  
Get a little love down  
Let it down oh oh  
  
I can't remember when  
You put your hands on mine  
But couldn't play in time when we  
We're not together  
Just sing a little song  
Blueberry kisses foreve-e-er  
  
When I finally go away  
I know you'll look for me one day  
  
Oh yeah it's so sad  
  
When you let love down  
Oh you let love down  
I don't have to remind you  
But you know that I'm around  
When you let love down  
Oh you let me down  
Get a little love down  
Let it down oh oh  
  
Oh oh  
Don't let me down  
Oh don't let me down  
Oh oh  
  
When you let love down  
Oh you let love down  
I don't have to remind you  
But you know that I'm around  
When you let love down  
Oh you let me down  
Don't let me down  
Let it down  
Can't let love down  
Let it down  
Won't let love down  
Let it down
