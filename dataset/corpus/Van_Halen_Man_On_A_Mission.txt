I got a one track mind, my blinders up  
Now all I gotta do is get up, go out an' get her  
Got the first step down, I know what I want  
All seven senses tryin' to deliver  
My baby, let me fill you up inside (up inside)  
Spread your wings an' open wide (open wide)  
So hot, so hot, so hot  
I'm a man on a mission, straight ahead  
Let's talk, more action, with no distractions  
I'm all conditioned, is it alright  
Go for the action, with no distractions  
You get every inch, play splat an' bone  
And it's all wrapped up in a tight little bundle  
I got an open mind, do anything  
I am aware the ball might roll or tumble  
So right down to the bottom of the top (ooh ooh)  
I'm gonna get it all in one big pot (one big pot)  
Yeah, she got, she got me hot  
Uh, I'm a man on a mission, straight ahead  
Let's talk, more action, with no distractions  
I'm all conditioned, I'm far off red  
Let's talk, more action, with no distractions  
Oh yeah, uh, I got no expectations, so get on in the way  
Only thing that's on my mind - ah, she's forgotten my attention  
What you take's the real kind - aw!  
(Solo)  
Uh! Ah! Come on, she got, she got, ah!  
Man on a mission, straight ahead  
No talk, more action, I got no distractions  
I'm all conditioned, what I say  
A man on a mission, up ahead  
Ah yeah, whew, my kinda action, aw, uh  
No distractions, I got no distractions  
No distractions, ah, no distractions, I'm on a mission, whew, aw
