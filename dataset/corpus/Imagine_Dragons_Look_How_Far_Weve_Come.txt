[Intro]  
  
[Verse 1]  
Take me on a whim  
It's not the sun that provides us  
It's not the moon that divides us  
  
[Verse 2]  
I can barely swim  
And the current's coming in  
And the current's coming in again  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Stand up when you hear your name  
'Cus I think that we're the same  
We've got the same old hands  
We've made the same old plans  
  
Bail out to the yellow raft  
It's got a hole but we can last  
We'll watch until it fades away  
  
[Chorus]  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
[Verse 3]  
I've been painted gin  
It's not the colour I came in  
It's not the shirt that I stayin' in  
  
[Verse 4]  
Hang me on a limb  
And the current's coming in  
And the current's coming in again  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Stand up when you hear your name  
'Cus I think that we're the same  
We've got the same old hands  
We've made the same old plans  
  
Bail out to the yellow raft  
It's got a hole but we can last  
We'll watch until it fades away  
  
[Chorus]  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
[Bridge]  
Stop right there  
I've got a hole inside my chest  
And 'til it fills up  
I won't be satisfied  
  
Stop right there  
I've got a hole inside my chest  
And 'til it fills up  
I won't be satisfied  
  
Stop right there  
I've got a hole inside my chest  
And 'til it fills up  
  
[Chorus]  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
It's time to take it over  
Step out into the sun  
  
It's time to take it over  
And look how far we've come  
  
We've come...
