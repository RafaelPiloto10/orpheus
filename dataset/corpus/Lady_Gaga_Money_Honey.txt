That's M O N E Y, so sexy, I  
  
Damn, I love the Jag, the jet and the mansion  
Oh yeah  
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands  
Oh yeah  
  
It's good to live expensive you know it  
But my knees get weak, intensive  
  
When you give me k-kisses  
That's money, honey  
When I'm your lover and your mistress  
That's money, honey  
  
When you touch me it's so delicious  
That's money, honey  
Baby, when you tear me to pieces  
That's money, honey  
  
That's M O N E Y, so sexy, I  
That's money, honey  
  
Damn, I'd love a boat by the beach on the west coast  
Oh yeah  
And I'd enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast  
Oh yeah  
  
It's good to live expensive you know it  
But my knees get weak, intensive  
  
When you give me k-kisses  
That's money, honey  
When I'm your lover and your mistress  
That's money, honey  
  
When you touch me it's so delicious  
That's money, honey  
Baby, when you tear me to pieces  
That's money, honey  
  
You know I appreciate the finer things  
But it's not what makes me happiest, baby  
(I can do without it, babe)  
Your tender loving's more than I can handle  
Never burn out this candle, baby, baby  
  
K-k-kisses  
That's money, honey  
When I'm your lover and your mistress  
That's money, honey  
  
When you touch me it's so delicious  
That's money, honey  
Baby, when you tear me to pieces  
That's money, honey  
  
When you give me k-kisses  
That's money, honey
