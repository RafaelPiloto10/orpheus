I asked her for a smile  
She couldn't I don't know why  
Could it be that it's all over  
Such a short love affair  
I feel it's so unfair  
But what can I do  
To keep this love oh so true  
  
The feelings can't be gone  
We've only just begun  
Now why must we end it?  
I feel we should go on  
Cause I could feel the fire's warmth  
The sparks of love  
That keep it shining on...  
  
I'll be standing here  
Even though it's through  
I have this space in my heart for you  
I don't know how I'll fake it  
And I doubt if I can make it  
And if get to realize  
Just turn and look into my eyes  
Cause then you'd come know  
That it was me after all....  
  
You know we still have time  
It's not too late to change your mind  
Why must we end it?  
I feel we should go on  
Cause I could feel the fire's warmth  
The sparks of love  
That keep it shining on...  
  
I'll be standing here  
Even though it's through  
I have this space in my heart for you  
I don't know how I'll fake it  
And I doubt if I can make it  
And if get to realize  
Just turn and look into my eyes  
Cause then you'd come know  
That it was me after all....  
  
That it was me after all....  
  
I'll be standing here  
Even though it's through  
I have this space in my heart for you  
I don't know how I'll fake it  
And I doubt if I can make it  
And if get to realize  
Just turn and look into my eyes  
Cause then you'd come know  
That it was me after all....
