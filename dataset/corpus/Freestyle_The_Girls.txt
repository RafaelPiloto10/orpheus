Hey...  
  
I remember the day I found her  
You know it was just like magic  
The way things happened  
Oh, so natural  
  
She smiles so sweetly  
And I fell completely  
And the words from her lips  
Filled with such tenderness that I could not resist  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you know the girls so right for me  
Everything we do just comes so easily  
The girls so right for me...  
There in this lonely world I found the girl that's right for me  
  
Sunday morning  
The day is starting  
And we're wrap around each other  
Perfect lovers under the covers baby  
  
The way that my heart is beating  
This gotta be the real thing  
And it's hand and the glove  
Baby this kind of love  
I know that she still want  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
I thought that I have good love before  
Baby to you I feel it all  
And darling you should be something  
That day by day you keep that coming  
  
Don't you know the girls so right for me  
Everything we do just comes so easily  
The girls so right for me...  
There in this lonely world I found the girl that's right for me  
  
And the girl so right for me  
Yeah  
Everything we do...  
You know the girl...  
Hey...  
In this lonely world I found the girl so right for me  
  
[Repeat till fade]
