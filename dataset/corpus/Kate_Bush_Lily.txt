Oh thou, who givest sustenance to the universe  
From whom all things proceed  
To whom all things return  
Unveil to us the face of the true spiritual sun  
Hidden by a disk of golden light  
That we may know the truth  
And do our whole duty  
As we journey to thy sacred feet  
  
Well I said  
"Lily, Oh Lily I don't feel safe  
I feel that life has blown a great big hole through me"  
And she said  
"Child, you must protect yourself  
I'll show you how with fire"  
  
Gabriel before me  
Raphael behind me  
Michael to my right  
Uriel on my left side  
In the circle of fire  
  
I said  
"Lily, Oh Lily I'm so afraid  
I fear I am walking in the Veil of Darkness"  
And she said  
"Child, take what I say  
With a pinch of salt  
And protect yourself with fire"  
  
Gabriel before me  
Raphael behind me  
Michael to my right  
Uriel on my left side  
In the circle of fire
