Hey mama, when you leave  
Don't leave a thing behind  
I don't want nothin'  
I can't use nothin'  
  
Take care into the hall  
And if you see my friends  
Tell them I'm fine  
Not using nothin'  
  
Almost burned out my eyes  
Threw my ears down to the floor  
I didn't see nothin'  
I didn't hear nothin'  
  
I stood there like a block of stone  
Knowin' all I had to know  
And nothin' more  
Man, that's nothin'  
  
As brothers our troubles are  
Locked in each others arms  
And you better pray  
They never find you  
  
Your back ain't strong enough  
For burdens doublefold  
They'd crush you down  
Down into nothin'  
  
Being born is going blind  
And buying down a thousand times  
To echoes strung  
On pure temptation  
  
Sorrow and solitude  
These are the precious things  
And the only words  
That are worth rememberin'
