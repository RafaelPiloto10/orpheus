When life seems full of clouds and rain  
I am filled with an awkward pain  
Who soothes my aching, thumping brain?  
Nobody  
  
When winder comes with snow and sleet  
I'm so tired  
with cold feet  
Who says, "Here's two bits, Nina  
Go and eat?"  
Nobody  
  
I ain't don't nothing  
To nobody  
I ain't never got nothing  
From from nobody  
No time  
And until I get me something  
Yes, from somebody sometime,  
Well, I don't intend to do nothing  
For nobody  
No time  
  
Then winter comes all cold and clear  
My friends they see me coming near  
Who says, "Come on in, child, and have a beer?"  
No-body  
  
When all day long things go amiss  
I go on find some bliss  
Who hands to me a golden kiss?  
Nobody  
  
I ain't ever done nothing  
To no-body  
I ain't ever got nothing  
From no-body no time  
And until I get me something  
From somebody somebody  
I don't intend to do nothing  
For nobody  
Nobody no time, no time  
Nobody no time
