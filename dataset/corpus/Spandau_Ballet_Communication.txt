Communication always leaves me in incomplete  
The grass is greener, but it's grown beneath my feet  
Love inspiration is a message on a wing  
But I have left it in the words you'll never sing  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here, I'm left here  
Telex or tell me but it's always second-hand  
I'm incognito but no rendezvous been planned  
Dictate or relate I could send it to your home  
"Return to sender" I could sing it down the phone  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here, I'm left here, I, I, I  
Dictate, relate  
Dictate, relate  
I'm sitting and waiting by the telephone  
Waiting for the bell to ring  
Short change fumble, 'Dial a heart' trouble  
And I ain't got time for searching through the rubble, oh no  
Well no  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here, I'm left here, I, I, I  
I'm left here  
I'm left here  
I'm left here  
...
