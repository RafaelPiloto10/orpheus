So you think your schooling's phony  
I guess it's hard not to agree  
You say it all depends on money  
And who is in your family tree  
  
Right, you're bloody well right  
You know you got a right to say  
Right, you're bloody well right  
You know you got a right to say  
  
Ha-ha you're bloody well right  
You know you're right to say  
Yeah-yeah you're bloody well right  
You know you're right to say  
Me, I don't care anyway!  
  
Write your problems down in detail  
Take them to a higher place  
You've had your cry, no, I should say wail  
In the meantime hush your face  
Right, quite right, you're bloody well right  
  
Right, you're bloody well right  
You know you got a right to say  
Right, you're bloody well right  
You know you got a right to say
