Lose it?  
Lose it?  
I don't even know the first thing  
About what they're feeling  
What am I afraid of?  
Don't know what I'm made of  
Can I go on  
Not knowing?  
  
Feeling?  
Feeling?  
Something tells me  
That it's more than I can deal with  
Though I never knew the song  
Some words still catch on  
Like caring and sharing  
Being together no matter  
  
Can I go on  
Not knowing?  
Don't know what I'm made of  
Why am I afraid of feeling?  
Feeling?  
If I dare to take a chance  
Would someone lead me?
