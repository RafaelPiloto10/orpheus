Waitin' for the night to fade  
Here on a foreign shore  
And all I've done is run away  
Like too many nights before  
  
Its taken far too long  
To make my world my own  
I'm gonna try  
'Cause this time round  
I've made my mind up  
  
[Chorus]  
If I think about leavin'  
I'm gonna do it right, alright  
'N if I'm thinkon' about holdin' on  
I'm gonna do it right  
  
Never been known to lie to me  
Ain't gonna start in now  
I've never been one for hide and seek  
So what's all this endless doubt about  
  
I know just what I'll do  
I've got to make my move  
'N I'll be fine  
'Cause this time round  
I've made my mind up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't matter what you do  
Just get to doin'  
It'll come to you  
  
No more maybe  
No more baby  
No more "save me"  
  
And if I want to live my life  
I gotta get it up to do it right  
And if I want to feel alright  
Gotta shed a little light on me tonight  
  
Oh, hold on, hold on  
  
[Chorus: x2]
