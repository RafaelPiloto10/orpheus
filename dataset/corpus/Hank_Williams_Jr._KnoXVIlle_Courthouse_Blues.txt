I'm sittin' in Knoxville Courthouse  
Ain't got a thing to do  
I don't wanna go to the movies  
Couldn't if I wanted to, I'm on trial for lovin' you  
  
Now this all started in a honky tonk  
Just the other side of town  
A girl come in took a stool by me  
Ordered gin and drank it down  
  
She lit up a cigarette and turned around  
Well, she said my name is Jeannie  
And asked me what was mine  
I answered Hank and I walked  
To the jukebox droppin' a dime  
  
I looked at her short dress low neck line  
Well, we danced for five or ten minutes  
And I held her close to me  
  
Kissed her lips and squeezed her hips  
And judged about twenty-three  
Whispered in my ears, I said, "Yes siree"  
  
Now the scene is a little motel  
Out on the state highway  
And there's a room for two  
Love is about to take place  
  
And a state trooper breaks down the door  
Shines a flash light in my face  
I said, "What the hell is this"  
And another man and woman come in  
  
And the girl I'm with starts cryin' and screamin'  
And she runs over to them  
Said, "Thank God you're here  
He tried to hurt me mama"  
  
I said now you don't mean  
The cop says, "Son the girl is seventeen"  
So that's why I'm in Knoxville courthouse  
And the judge passed sentence on me  
  
And it's ten long years for statutory rape  
In the state penitentiary  
Lord, I can't believe this is happened to me  
  
So when next time you give a girl the eye  
She gives you that certain smile  
Just remember under that woman's breast  
May beat the heart of a child  
  
Don't you let yourself be the one  
To help a mixed up kids go wild  
This story happened a lot that's true  
But you better hope and pray it never happens to you
