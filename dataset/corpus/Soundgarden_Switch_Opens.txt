Hey you slave, go hang your owners  
Draw your names among their ashes  
Lay your children on their thrones  
Gather 'round and fall right down  
  
Here at sundown nothing is when  
Everything is all right  
Switch opens  
Opening around and let's the garden rise  
Switch is on  
  
Hey, you patients  
Where's your surgeon  
Left with your  
Insides open  
Hung your hearts out  
On the table  
Gather 'round and fall right down  
  
Feel the air now  
Stumbling and wander in the moonshine  
Switch opens  
Nothing is when everything is all right  
Switch is on
