Well, I had myself a girlfriend  
For almost two whole years  
We had no secrets  
We had no fears  
There was nothing we wouldn't do  
When we were in the sack  
She'd even pop the zit on my back  
  
But one night I was out cheating  
After I drank a few  
She caught me red handed  
And said we're through  
Now she's got a new boyfriend  
It nearly gave me a heart attack  
  
'Cause who's gonna pop this zit on my back?  
Well I got a pimple and I don't know why  
It keeps growing in the same place  
I can't reach it with my left or right hand  
I wish it was on my face  
It's four days old  
And it hurts so bad  
But it's ready for a squeeze  
Won't somebody pop it for me please?  
I'll give you ten dollars  
  
If you're a girl in this lonely world  
And you're looking for a guy  
I'll never cheat again, I promise  
That's no lie  
There's only one thing I ask of you  
Could we name our first child Zak?  
Oh, one more thing  
Please pop this zit on my back  
  
I'm dying here!  
A pimple ay-hee  
A pop-a-doodly-doo  
Squirt heedly-hoo  
  
Well I'm sitting alone by the phone  
And no one seems to call  
I try to scrape my zit off on the kitchen wall  
Well that don't work, so I look around  
And find a big shiny thumb-tack  
Put it on the floor, lay down  
Pop the zit on my back
