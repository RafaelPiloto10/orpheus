I've been bitten by the Bug and I am coming down with oh-  
Something that can't be cured  
There ain't a doctor in this town who is more qualified than you,  
Yeah to be so adored  
  
So tell me what do you prescribe for the symptoms  
Heart beating faster and work is a disaster and  
I'm lovesick when you're not around  
To check me over  
Strong hands of healing  
I'm dancing on the ceiling  
  
Fever sure has got me good  
What you do when fever takes hold?  
I can't help but need this drug  
Don't you feel the fever like I do?  
(Feel the fever)  
  
I am ready for the news so tell me straight,  
Hey doctor just what do you diagnose?  
There ain't a surgeon like you any place in all the world  
So now, shall I remove my clothes?  
  
So tell me what do you advise for the symptoms  
Heart beating faster and work is a disaster and  
I'm lovesick when you're not around  
To check me over  
With strong hands of healing  
I'm dancing on the ceiling  
  
Fever sure has got me good  
What you do when fever takes hold?  
I can't help but need this drug  
Don't you feel the fever like I do?  
Fever sure has got me good  
What'cha do when fever takes hold?  
I can't help but need this drug  
Don't you feel the fever like I do?  
  
Ah  
Fever  
  
So tell me what do you perscribe for the symptoms  
Heart beating faster and work is a disaster and  
I'm lovesick when you're not around  
To check me over  
With strong hands of healing  
I'm dancing on the ceiling  
  
Fever sure has got me good  
What you do when fever takes hold?  
I can't help but need this drug  
Don't you feel the fever like I do?  
Fever fever
