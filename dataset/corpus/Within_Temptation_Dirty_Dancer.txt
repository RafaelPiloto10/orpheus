She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer  
  
'Nother day, 'nother night  
And she acting like she don't sleep  
She's a five when she drinks  
But she's a ten when she's on top of him  
  
She don't want love she just wanna touch  
She's a greedy girl to never get enough  
She don't wanna love she just wanna touch  
She's got all the moves that make you get it up  
  
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer  
Never ever lonely  
  
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer  
You'll never be her only  
  
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer  
Never ever lonely  
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer  
You'll never be her only  
  
It's a game that she plays  
She can win with her eyes closed  
It's insane how she tames  
She can turn you to an animal  
  
She don't want love she just wanna touch  
She's a greedy girl to never get enough  
She don't wanna love she just wanna touch  
She's got all the moves that make you give it up  
  
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer  
Never ever lonely  
  
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer  
You'll never be her only  
  
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer  
Never ever lonely  
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer  
You'll never be her only
