(Dell McCoury)  
Though the miles are between us  
I thought our love would strengthen  
As it has so many times before  
But something has happened  
I can see it in your eyes  
I can feel my world is crumblin'  
And the blues are at my door  
The last letter that you wrote was  
On a blue piece of paper  
That old feelin's back  
The clouds are movin' in  
The beginning of the end is near  
I feel your love has faded into darkness  
It seems I have no friend  
I feel the blues movin' in  
Oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad  
And broken-hearted  
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in  
Between the lines are mixed emotions  
And there's teardrops on the paper  
You said that's all I'll write today  
I'll cose for now old friend  
The last letter that you wrote was  
On a blue piece of paper  
That old feelin's back  
The clouds are movin' in  
My state of mind is desperate  
And this hole that I'm sinkin' in  
Gets deeper while I'm diggin' to get out  
Oh please give the right answer to the questions I'm askin'  
Tell me you still love me  
That would turn my world about  
The last letter that you wrote was  
On a blue piece of paper  
That old feelin's back  
The clouds are movin' in
