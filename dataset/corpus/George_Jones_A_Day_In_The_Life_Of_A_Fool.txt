Morning comes and I'm alone ...  
It's been a year since you've been gone  
But it seems like yesterday ,you said goodbye  
I'm finding ways to pass the time ,so I won't lose my mind  
  
But my every waking hour I think of you  
That's just a day in the life of a fool  
The one who's holding out for only you  
Knowing all along your love for me is true  
  
It's just a day in the life of a fool  
You would think I'd learn by now , to forget it all some how .  
But my favorite memories were made with you  
So every moment that I have , I live them in the past  
  
Even though there?s no way back to where we were  
That's just a day in the life of a fool  
The one who's holding out for only you  
Knowing all along your love for me is true  
  
It's just a day in the life of a fool  
It's just a day in the life of a fool
