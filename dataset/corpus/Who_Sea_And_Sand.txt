Here by the sea and sand  
Nothing ever goes as planned,  
I just couldn't face going home  
It was just a drag on my own.  
They finally threw me out  
My mother got drunk on stout,  
My dad couldn't stand on two feet,  
As he lectured about morality.  
Now I guess the families complete,  
With me hanging round on the street  
Or here on the beach.  
  
The girl I love  
Is a perfect dresser,  
Wears every fashion  
Gets it to the tee.  
Heavens above,  
I got to match her  
She knows just how  
She wants her man to be  
Leave it to me.  
  
My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked  
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck  
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat  
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet.  
  
I see her dancing  
Across the ballroom  
UV light making starshine  
Of her smile.  
I am the face,  
She has to know me,  
I'm dressed up better than anyone  
Within a mile.  
  
So how come the other tickets look much better?  
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter.  
How come the girls come on oh so cool  
Yet when you meet 'em, every one's a fool?  
  
Come sleep on the beach  
Keep within my reach  
I just want to die with you near  
I'm feeling so high with you here.  
I'm wet and I'm cold  
But thank God I ain't old  
I should have split home at fifteen  
Why didn't I ever say what I mean?  
There's a story that the grass is so green,  
What did I see?  
Where have I been?  
  
Nothing is planned, by the sea and the sand
