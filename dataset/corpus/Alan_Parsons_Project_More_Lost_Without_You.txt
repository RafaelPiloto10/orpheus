Featuring P.J. Olsson  
Written by Alan Parsons and P.J. Olsson  
  
There's not a day  
I don't think of your name  
The state that I'm in  
You're completely to blame  
No words left to say  
Turn my dreams all to grey  
And I'm more and more lost without you  
  
You're a storm in my head  
That really blew a new day  
A liquid design  
Is what you do to my mind  
No words left to say  
Cause my mind's gone away  
And I'm more and more lost without you  
  
More and more lost without you  
I was found but then I totally lost you  
Don't know a soul that could ever doubt you  
That's why I'm more and more lost without you  
  
More and more
