Fancy a big house  
Some kids and a horse  
I can not quite, but nearly  
Guarantee, a divorce  
I think that I love you  
I think that I do  
So go on mister, make Miss me Mrs you.  
  
I love you, I love you, I love you, I do  
I only make jokes to distract myself  
From the truth, from the truth.  
  
Fancy a fast car  
A bag full of loot  
I can nearly guarantee  
You'll end up with the boot  
  
I love you, I love you, I love you , I do  
I only make jokes to distract myself  
From the truth, from the truth.  
I love you, I love you, I love you , I do  
I only make jokes to distract myself  
From the truth, from the truth.
