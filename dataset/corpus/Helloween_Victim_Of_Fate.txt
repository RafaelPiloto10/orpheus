I was born in the rotten part of the town  
The biggest trap I had seen  
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to  
Evil is all around  
  
My mother's a bitch my father's a killer  
Gettin' paid for murder  
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day  
The only way to survive  
  
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me  
I'd much rather die in this bloody war  
  
Fly high touch the sky  
Never know the reason why it ends  
Victim of fate!  
  
I had to kill people to save my own life  
I don't want to go to hell  
I started at the bottom  
I'm headin' for the top  
  
I'll never return I'll never go back  
To that goddamn part of the town  
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid  
But this ain't the life I dreamt of  
  
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me  
I'd much rather die in this bloody war  
  
Fly high touch the sky  
Never know the reason why it ends  
Victim of fate!  
  
What now lonely man who's standing  
In the shadows of the streets  
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you  
You hide from the daylight living in darkness  
You got no friends you can trust nobody  
Except for yourself  
The only shade that's beside you  
Is the shade of Lucifer  
Laughing with a satanic smile  
And his friend Death sharpens his sickle  
You don't want to die, do you? But you will  
You will burn in hell!  
  
Fly high touch the sky  
Never know the reason why it ends  
Victim of fate!  
  
Fly high, touch the sky, you will die!
