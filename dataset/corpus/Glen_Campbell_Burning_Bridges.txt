Found some letters  
You wrote me this morning  
They told of a love we once knew  
Now they're gone  
I burnt them to ashes  
Don't want nothin' to remind me o-of you  
  
Burning bridges behind me  
It's too late to tur-urn back now-ow-ow  
Burning bridges behind me  
All I want is to forget you some how  
  
Sold the house  
We once planned together  
Said goodbye  
To friends we once knew  
Then I moved  
To a far away city  
Trying hard to forget abou-out you  
  
Burning bridges behind me  
It's too late to tur-urn back now-ow-ow  
Burning bridges behind me  
All I want is to forget you so-ome how
