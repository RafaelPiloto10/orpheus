The closer I get to my home Lord the more I want to be there  
There'll be a gatherin' of loved ones and friends Lord you know I want to be
there  
There'll be a mixture of teardrops and flowers crying and talking for hours  
Bout how wild that I was and if I'd listened to them I wouldn't be there  
  
Well there's old Charlie Toll they threw away the mold when they made him  
And Jimmy McCline it looks like the wine's finally laid him  
And Billie McRae that I could any day in a card game  
And Bessie McNeal but her tears are real I can see pain  
There's a mixture of teardrops...  
  
Lord thanks for ride I got a feeling inside that I know you  
And if you see your way you're welcome to stay 'cause I'm gonna need you  
There's be a mixture of teardrops....
