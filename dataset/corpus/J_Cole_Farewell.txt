Yeah, farewell  
Hey, farewell  
Alllmy n-ggas farewell  
Fayettenam  
  
Look, some n-ggas let there dirt out,  
Some n-ggas keep it in 'em  
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him  
And fame a part of history no longer known  
Done did a lot of dirt I'll bury with me when I'm gone  
When my story's told, how will they tell it?  
Will they say I was a giver or will they say I was selfish  
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint  
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon paint  
Wouldn't say that I'm a quitter that's one thing I know I aint aint  
Will they tarnish, will they taint?  
Glorify me, overthink, say they know me, say I'm great  
Say I'm phoney, I was fake  
Say the things about me they never told me to my face  
I was loved I was hated  
Just a n-gga with a dream  
I'm a liar I was honest, I was all of these things  
When I'm gone let em talk  
They discussing who I am  
When they bury me just know I was nothing but a man  
Wasn't nothin' but a man  
  
This for n-ggas climbin' heavens stairwell  
Yeah, hey farewell  
Yeh, hey farewell  
This for n-ggas climbin' heavens stairwell  
I pray you farewell  
I bid you farewell  
Yeah, ey, farewell  
Yeah, yeah  
  
If I should die Lord this here is my will  
Reincarnate a n-gga send me right back to the Ville  
Let me relive my younger days just once again  
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin  
Keeping demons buried in my closet  
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account  
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out  
Those were truly my best days  
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid  
Gradually turn into me stressin' how the hell to get paid  
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played  
Ok, I'm blowing up quickly  
I guess the flow is sickly  
But yet I can't forget my past and hope it won't forget me  
Got good grades but age can't stop strays so pray for me  
Pour liquor for my n-ggas but hey, don't wait for me  
Cause I'm trying to cheat death, she had to bury my ass  
You know the cliche "lifes a bitch" well I'm gon marry that ass  
And sign a pre-nup  
Think back to when we tore the skating rink up  
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club  
Gave mean mugs to n-ggas but we winked to all the girls  
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the World  
No way, came a long way from having mom chauffer  
It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure  
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back  
I swear I'm not gon change a thing  
I swear I'm not gon change a thing  
  
This for them n-ggas climbin' heavens stairwell  
Yeah, hey farewell  
I pray you n-ggas farewell  
This for n-ggas climbin' heavens stairwell  
Hey farewell, hey farewell  
Yeah, farewell  
Yeh
