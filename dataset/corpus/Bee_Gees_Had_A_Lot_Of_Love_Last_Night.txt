Ah, I had a lot of love last night  
Ah...  
Ah, I had a lot of love last night  
Ah..  
Ah...  
  
I've given all my love away and I've been left with none  
But can you say that I'm to blame for loving anyone  
I used to think that I was always older then my time  
We're all breaking promises , who will cry this time  
We're all breaking promises , who will cry this time  
  
Ah, I had a lot of love last night  
(had a lot a lot of love)  
Ah.....  
Ah , I had a lot of love last night  
(had a lot a lot of love)  
Ah...  
  
I'm casting all my dreams hereto , my fish have gone to sea  
And fate no longer has the faith to walk ahead of me  
I always used to think that I was better then my kind  
We're all breaking promises , who will cry this time  
We're all breaking promises , who will cry this time  
  
Ah , I had a lot of love last night (had a lot a lot of love)  
Ah , I had a lot of love last night
