There's a woman and she thinks I can do no wrong  
She's been waiting for me, all night long  
Still she forgives me, when I drag it home  
And tells me I belong  
For her this early morning song  
  
It's for Harry-why and the times that have go-one before  
We're still laughin' but I, I ain't that much fun no more  
Still he forgives me, in the mornin' light  
For keepin' him up to long  
For him this early morning song  
  
It's for all you cowboys, ridin' home alone  
It's for all you lovers, Tryin' to love a telephone  
It's for the children, And the hawk in the mornin' haze  
For the people that I, I don't see too much these days  
  
Will you forgive me, when we meet again  
For stayin' away so long  
I've just been out there in the dawn  
Singin' my early mornin' song  
  
So please forgive me, when we meet again  
For stayin' away so long  
I've just been out there in the dawn  
Singin' my early mornin' song
