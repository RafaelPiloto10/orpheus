And outside the wind is blowing  
Through the thoughts in my mind  
Thinking a feeling is growing  
But inside my heart I'm alone  
I have a heart, a heart for a woman  
I have a promise, of this I will swear  
And I have a love that wont be forgotten  
I have a life that's going nowhere  
I just wanna be with you  
Hold you like I used to do, time after time, yeah  
Give my heart and soul to you  
And only if you wanted to  
If only I could be with you  
  
I hear the wind whisper your name  
Taking my thoughts again far away  
Im dreaming of living a life full of love  
And you out there, calling my name, saying  
I just wanna be with you  
Hold you like I used to do, time after time, yeah  
Give my heart and soul to you  
And hoping that you feel it too  
If only I could be with you  
  
I walk the streets so all alone,  
Holding hands with a distant past  
And how longs it gonna last, could it be forever  
She cant hear me, she cant hear me  
If only (only)  
If only I could be with you  
  
Just a little time with you, yeah  
  
I just wanna be with you  
Hold you like I used to do, time after time, yeah  
Give my heart and give my soul to you  
And only if you wanted to  
If only I could be with you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Time after time, yeah  
Give my heart and soul to you  
And hoping that you feel it too  
If only I could be with you
