Refusing to be celebrated  
It's a monumental big screen kiss  
It's so deep it's meaningless

And that'll be it  
Just then the stripper stopped in a coughing fit  
She said sorry I can't go on with this

It was true cinema a clef  
You should see it before there's nothing left

Cause it's an instamatic  
  
Yeah that's awful close  
But that's not why

Just then the room became more dimly lit  
As the emcee carried on with it  
And now that I got you all strangely compelled

Close, but that's not why  
I'm so hard done by
