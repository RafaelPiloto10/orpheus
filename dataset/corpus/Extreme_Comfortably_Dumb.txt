I'm paralyzed  
Process information  
At the speed of light  
I'm frozen  
In motion  
Desensitized  
Over stimulated matter  
Over mind  
Knowing I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I must confess  
Highly educated  
In my ignorance  
Not stupid  
Still lucid  
Indifferent  
Watching a world  
Amuse itself to death  
I'm muted  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
What? When?  
Why? Where?  
How come?  
Who cares?  
Knock, knock  
Who's there?  
No one  
How come?  
Who cares?  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
Take me away  
So far away  
So far away  
Won't somebody  
Take me away  
Take  
Take it all away
