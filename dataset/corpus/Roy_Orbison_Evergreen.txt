Sometimes love will bloom in the springtime  
Then like flowers in summer it will grow  
And then fade away in the winter  
When the cold winds begin to blow  
  
But when it's evergreen, evergreen  
It will last through the summer and winter too  
When love is evergreen, evergreen  
Like my love for you  
  
So hold my hand and tell me  
You'll be mine through laughter or through tears  
Then let the whole world see, our love will be  
Evergreen through all the years  
  
For when it's evergreen, evergreen  
It will last through the summer and winter too  
When love is evergreen, evergreen  
Like my love for you
