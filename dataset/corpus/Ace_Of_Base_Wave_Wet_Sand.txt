You are as reliable as a painting  
In wave wet sand.  
Look in your eyes and I can't see a thing,  
That usually means attraction to me  
  
I've read all the books about love I could find,  
And I've found not one, no,  
Not one word about mine,  
'Cause you are reliable as a painting  
  
In wave wet sand  
You're coming and you're going:  
Like the water you never end.  
'Cause you are reliable as a painting  
  
In wave wet sand  
And I am just another piece of an island  
In reach for your hands  
feel my doubts when you are in my arms.  
  
Darling: If you know that it's love  
And not charm  
You must tell me so or go elsewhere to hunt.  
'Cause you are  
  
Your love  
I am just another piece of an island  
I can't close my ears when I hear that you call.  
I don't want to fear every tear that could fall  
  
I'll go on my own, and pass people with doubts.  
My goal is to find just a piece of your love.  
Your love is, your love is like the water  
  
You are like the water.  
You are like the water.  
You, you are my shore, and you know  
You are my shore.  
  
'Cause you are reliable like a painting  
I am just another piece of an island
