Oh my, my, my-  
In a dusty caravan  
Was a girl with a golden tan  
And she asked me if I was headed to the east  
I politely stepped a side and said I did not need a ride  
That I'd rather take my chances with the heat  
Well, when she turned and walked away  
I saw my big mistake  
There were jewels on her body oh-so-rare  
Had it been another day I just might have rode away  
With that woman riding off to God-knows-where  
So the years they came and went  
And found me living in a tent  
Far above a little marble stream  
And it may have been the light that shone out through the night  
That attracted the hand scratching on my screen  
When I cautiously looked out through the night  
There was no doubt  
That the owner of that hand was that girl  
So I bid her do come in  
And I'll open up a tin  
If you'll tell me 'bout your trip around the world  
Well, she said,"If you think back  
To the first time that we passed  
I'm sure you'll picture me in all my jewels  
It was shortly after then that I ran into another man  
And I asked him the same question I asked you  
But now he he didn't refuse  
And he took off of both his shoes  
And climbed aboard mu east-bound caravan  
In the twinkling of the night  
He knocked me off the side  
And left me there for dead upon the sand  
And I thought I was done  
Lying naked in the sun  
When much to my surprise, who should pass?  
But this old friend of yours  
He said he knew you from the wars  
And I told him that I thought you'd headed west  
Well, he said he should have known  
'Cause you like to be alone  
And that's the time I knew you were my one  
So I asked him for a ride  
Just to get here by your side  
And stay here above this stream  
Out of the sun"  
Well, we sat quite for a while  
And I began to smile  
Well it's strange but I don't care  
And some nights when I'm at rest  
I wonder if I'd said, "yes"  
Would she have come to me from God knows where  
Or would I have been the one to leave her lying in the sun  
And then ended up with only precious stones  
Or would the woman in my arms be giving me her charms  
If the answer that I gave her wasn't "no"
