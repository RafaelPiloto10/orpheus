Tell me Jesus, are you angry?  
One more sheep has just gone astray  
A hardening of hearts turning to stone  
Wandering off so far from home  
  
So many children losing time  
Walk in darkness looking for a sign  
Chasing their rainbows, future looks so bright  
Slowly we're losing sight of the light  
  
Who cares, who cares, who cares?  
Tell me who cares, who cares?  
  
Who cares, who cares, who cares?  
Tell me who cares, who cares?  
  
All alone out in the cold  
Can't look back, am I growing old?  
I chose a path and is this my fate?  
Am I finding out the truth too late?  
  
Who cares, who cares, who cares?  
Tell me who cares, who cares?  
  
Who cares, who cares, who cares?  
Tell me who cares, who cares?  
  
Here I am, a naked man  
Nothing to hide with empty hands  
Remember me, well I am the one  
Who lost his way your prodigal son?  
  
Can anybody, anybody?  
Anybody, any luck  
Anybody, any luck  
  
Am I ever gonna change?  
Will I always stay the same?  
I say one thing an' I do the other  
Same old song goes on forever  
Ever gonna change  
I just take it dead, I know  
My will is weak but my bless is strong  
Loose I seem to that yearn of gold
