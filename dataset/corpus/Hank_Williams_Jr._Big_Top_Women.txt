A is for apricot  
  
B is for blossom  
  
C is for cantelope  
  
D is for dog-gone awesome  
  
E is extremely blessed and endowed  
  
F is for fabulous  
  
That's what this song's all about  
  
Big top women sure do bounce around  
  
I love to see them walkin' up and down  
  
The steps of the courthouse make you go downtown  
  
I had to get some new tags  
  
My plates had done run out  
  
I had to get some new tags  
  
My plates had done run out  
  
And the tax assesor certainly left no doubt  
  
That the big top women sure do bounce around  
  
I love to see them walkin' up and down  
  
Ba-Ba-Boom Ba-Ba-Boom Ba-Ba-Boom  
  
Make you go down town  
  
I met this meter maid, Nadine  
  
She didn't carry no gun around  
  
But she was packin' some 38's  
  
Big tittie man get right down on the ground  
  
Now the big top women sure do bounce around  
  
I love to see them walkin' up and down  
  
Steps of the courthouse  
  
Make you wanna get a ticket and  
  
Go downtown  
  
I went downtown after work  
  
This joint called the hot house  
  
They had some big top women there  
  
And whoo, they then came out  
  
I said girl you sure look fine  
  
With your uniform gone  
  
She had hundred dollar bills  
  
Stuck in her thong  
  
Yea, big top women sure got it goin' on
