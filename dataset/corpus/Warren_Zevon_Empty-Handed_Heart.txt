All these empty places  
I try so hard to fill  
Will I find another love?  
I pray to God I will  
Girl, we had some good times  
But time does not stand still  
It's rolling like a rockslide down a hill  
  
I've met someone I care for  
I know she cares for me  
Will I fall in love again?  
It's a possibility  
Girl, we had some good times  
That time cannot undo  
No one will ever take the place of you  
  
Heart jinxed condition  
Never sure how I feel  
Trying to separate the real thing  
From the wishful thinking  
Sometimes I wonder  
If I'll make it without you  
I'm determined to  
I'll make my stand  
And if after all is said and done  
You only find one special one  
Then I've thrown down diamonds in the sand  
Then I've thrown down diamonds in the sand  
Then I've thrown down diamonds in the sand  
Then I've thrown down diamonds in the sand  
  
Remember when we used to watch the sun set in the sea  
You said you'd always be in love with me  
All through the night, we danced and sang  
Made love in the morning while the church bells rang  
  
Leave the fire behind you and start  
I'll be playing it by ear  
Left here with an empty-handed heart.
