Pumpin' the blood through the heart of New Orleans  
She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream  
She's just made out of flesh and bones  
  
But let me tell you little boy  
You better leave her alone  
Leroy Brown thought he was bad too  
'Till she left him floatin' in the old bayou  
  
She's the kind of girl  
She's built like a bomb  
She's the blackeyed blackeyed  
Blackeyed blond, get down!  
  
That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch  
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox  
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box  
  
But let me tell you little boy  
She'll clean your clock  
A slick and sly spy  
Stuck in the muck of the moat  
  
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat  
Double-o-dooms day for Mr. James Bond  
She's the blackeyed blackeyed  
Blackeyed blond, Get down!
