One, two, three, four  
Hey (eh) forever, hey (eh) forever  
  
It's you, and me  
Movin' at the speed of light into eternity (yeah)  
Tonight, is the night  
To join me in the middle of ecstasy  
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music around you (around you)  
  
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there  
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby  
We can go anywhere, go anywhere  
But first, it's your chance  
Take my hand, come with me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like I waited my whole life  
For this one night  
It's gon' be me you and the dance floor  
Cause we only got one night  
Double your pleasure, double you fun  
And dance forever ever ever  
Forever ever ever, forever ever ever, forever (forever)  
Ever ever ever, forever ever ever, forever ever ever  
Forever on the dance floor  
  
Feels like we're on another level  
Feels like our loves intertwine  
We can be two rebels  
Breakin' the rules  
Me and you, you and I  
All you gotta do is watch me  
Look what I can do with my feet, baby  
Feel the beat inside  
I'm drivin', you could take the front seat (front seat)  
Just need you to trust me (trust me)  
Girl girl girl, it's like now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a long way down  
We so high off the ground  
Sendin' for an angel to bring me your heart  
Girl where did you come from?  
Got me so undone  
Gazin' in your eyes got me sayin'  
What a beautiful lady  
No if's and's or maybes  
I'm releasin' my heart  
And its feelin' amazing  
There's no one else that matters  
You love me and I wont let you fall girl  
Let you fall girl  
Yeah, I wont let you fall  
Let you fall, let you fall, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah  
Forever ever ever ever, forever ever, oh
