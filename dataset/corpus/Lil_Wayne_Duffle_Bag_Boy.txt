[hook:]  
If I don't nothin' I'm a ball  
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall  
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy  
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy get money  
And I ain't ever ran from a nigga and I  
Damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin'  
Look honey I ain't never ran from a nigga and I  
Damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' get money  
  
The beat so hot the flow is so ice cold  
Walkin' to the Gucci store honey I'm home  
I am on my shit I need a pamper on me  
Toilet paper on the side for example homie  
I, get, money  
I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this and  
While you wishing on that fallin' star I'm in a foreign car  
Smoking out with the doors ajar  
Suede sun roof hangin' out the big top  
We leave the dealership head to the rim shop  
You niggas barely dressin' I got thousands piling  
That's that salad dressin' I'm on my thousand island  
Wildin' stylin' I be I get so much money its my i.d  
Don't try me and if I dont do nuthin' I'm a fuckin' ball  
And I ain't bout to start runnin' naw nigga naw  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't nothin' to a boss we ballin' when you see us  
We hear them haters callin' they too far off to see us  
Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game  
Class is now in session now try to stay focus mane  
Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough  
Would've could've should've wont do with us true enough  
Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin' new to us  
Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us  
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up  
Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'm a stack up  
Flows like a river the current is so rapid  
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens  
Next time you're yappin' make sure it be about that big money talk  
Let that lil' money walk call me what you want but don't call me for front  
Southside I got what you want come holla at me  
  
[Chorus: x2]
