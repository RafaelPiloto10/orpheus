A cry in the night I'm still hearing  
No my love is gone I must be dreaming  
Lost in the mist of passions strange  
Wiping the tears I recall the pain  
Of love and laughter, joy now slain  
When your world turns cold won't you call my name  
  
Come on  
Cry out in the dark  
I'll be by your side to give you warmth  
And light and shield you from the night  
Hold on, hold on, we'll fan the flames of love  
Together again, just you and I  
  
I watched the faces in the fire  
No emotion was ever there  
If this is truth then who's the liar?  
Your eyes are blind, they don't love you  
You're just an amusement, thought of with disdain  
But I'm still waiting, won't you call my name  
  
You say your heart is open to loves  
Call and you can't refuse it's refrain  
But you don't hear the real sirens song  
Echoing it's refrain, my love still remains so
