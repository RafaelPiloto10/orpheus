I am a sailor and you're my first mate  
We signed on together, we coupled our fate  
We hauled up our anchor determined not to fail  
For the heart's treasure together we set sail  
Withnomaps to guide us we steered our own course  
We rode out the storms when the winds were gale force  
We sat out the doldrums in patience and hope  
Working together we learned how to cope  
Life is an ocean, love is a boat  
In troubled waters it keeps us afloat  
When we started the voyage  
There was just me and you  
Now gathered around us we have our own crew  
Together we're in this relationship  
We've built it with care to last the whole trip  
Our true destination is not marked on any chart  
We're navigating for the shores of the heart  
Life is an ocean, love is a boat  
In troubled waters it keeps us afloat  
When we started the voyage  
There was just me and you  
Now gathered around us we have our own crew  
Life is an ocean, love is a boat  
In troubled waters it keeps us afloat  
When we started the voyage  
There was just me and you  
Now gathered around us we have our own crew
