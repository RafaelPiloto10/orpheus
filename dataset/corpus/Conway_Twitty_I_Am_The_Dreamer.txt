A kiss in the dark, a touch of your hand  
My arms are around you, my dream begins  
The only thing that's different than any other night  
Here we are together, my dream by my side.  
  
I am the dreamer, you are the dream  
You are the answer to my fantasy  
All that I have dreamed of now is complete  
I am the dreamer, you are the dream.  
  
I know now that I've been dreamin'  
I finally saw the light  
With my arms wide open  
I found the love that's right.  
  
You don't have to wake me  
For me to know it's real  
The love that I have dreamed of  
I can touch and feel.  
  
I am the dreamer, you are the dream  
You are the answer to my fantasy  
All that I have dreamed of, now is complete  
I am the dreamer, you are the dream.  
  
I am the dreamer, you are the dream  
You are the answer to my fantasy  
All that I have dreamed of, now is complete  
I am the dreamer, you are the dream...
