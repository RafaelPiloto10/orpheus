Everybody wanna be like me?  
Y'all can be like me?  
Look at my watch  
Look at my wrist  
Nothin' like ya man he ain't shinin' like this  
Nothin' like ya man he ain't grindin' like this  
And even if he was, he ain't fuckin with cause  
  
I came so far from the bottom couldn't even see the top  
Just as soon as a fill the trap I'm rippin' up every block  
I'ma good god fearin' man with a criminal mind state  
Ain't nobody gave a shit and that's why we grind weight  
My grandma off in the church while I'm in the refrigerator  
In search of the baking soda right next to the mashed potatoes  
She prayin' for better days I'm prayin' they take this water  
Realest and stun and ship put that day on my mothers daughter  
  
[Chorus]  
My ambitions as a hustla (i wont deny it, I wont deny it)  
My ambitions as a hustla (i wont deny it im a straight hustla, I wont deny it)
[Repeat: x3]  
  
Its Mr. Trap or die yeah yall remember me  
First album was a classic them critics weren't feelin' me  
Now as far as award shows we all know how that goes  
So whats all the doubt about because he ain't sellin' out  
Because he ain't givin' up because he don't give a fuck  
Because he ain't changin' up I guess he aint lean enough  
And just know I'm savin' up let you play with my sanity  
Gives a fuck what you think of me unless you feedin' my family  
Mother fuck all my enemies one time for my mini me's  
Listen to these niggas I bet you hear plenty me  
I'm who they pretend to be the one they pretend to do  
See me I'm a hustla I do what my hustlaz do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Might not just be the best just know I plan to be  
I refuse to let suckers win but thats just the man in me  
Look it could be the G in me these niggas ain't seein' me  
Unless they seein' me in traffic and somethin' topic and drastic  
I say I grind like there 10 of me swear to god theres just one of me  
Look I know I ain't there yet just know that I'm gonna be  
I couldn't wait to see the day I could change where my momma stay  
Put the b.s. behind me theres too much money in front of me  
  
[Chorus]
