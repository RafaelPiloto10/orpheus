All for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
There's no need to live on an island  
'Cause everyone here respects your opinion  
It all adds up to, it's your strength we need  
So get behind and push, if you don't want to lead  
'Cause it's all for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
I don't know your future plans  
But divided I'm sure you will not stand  
I said, ?All that to say there's an easier way  
If it's love that we share then there's no debt to pay?  
'Cause we are all down here under the sky  
Won't you try? Won't you try?  
We're all down here  
You're not alone  
You've been pushing and pulling and shoving  
Since the day you were born so let's try  
All for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
And a smile will appear on your face  
'Cause suddenly, suddenly the world is a beautiful place  
'Cause it's all for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
All for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
...
