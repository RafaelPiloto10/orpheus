Don't choose me because I am faithful.  
Don't choose me because I am kind.  
If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking.  
Take me for longing or leave me behind.  
  
I would be, for you, a fire in a rainbow,  
I would be, for you, an opening door.  
Time and hard lessons are one kind of wisdom.  
Try to forget them or love me no more.  
  
I'm not asking your heart to believe me.  
I'm not asking for promise or pledge.  
Whatever the answer, it's yes that's the question.  
I am the fool dancin' over the edge.  
  
Don't choose me because I am faithful.  
Don't choose me because I am kind.  
If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking.  
Take me for longing or leave me behind.
