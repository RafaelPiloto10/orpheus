I didn't want to see you  
Not when you're at your best  
And talk about the weather  
I couldn't pass the test  
  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Give you the wrong idea  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Just make a fool of me  
  
Then you turn away  
Then you turn away  
  
I couldn't help but call you  
I waited almost all the week  
I didn't want to hear you  
Laughing aloud at me  
  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Give you the wrong idea  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Just make a fool of me  
  
Then you turn away  
Then you turn away  
  
There's people saying that it's obvious  
That I'm wasting my time on you  
And people saying that it's obvious  
That I've fallen in love, it's not true  
  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Give you the wrong idea  
So many things I do  
So many things I say  
Just make a fool of me  
  
Then you turn away  
Then you turn away
