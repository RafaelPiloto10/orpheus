Candy came from LA California he was a picture of a perfect man  
His hair was styled and his silken suits were tailored  
He drove a red imported sports sedan  
Candy was a traveling playboy his heart was made of solid stone  
He would find them love 'em and then he'd leave 'em  
Candy lived upon a throne  
My baby fell just like he wanted Candy ruined our happy home  
Baby's gotta a sweet tooth for Candy but candy won't last long  
Well baby's gotta sweet tooth for Candy  
She's gonna find her taste is not so sweet  
She thinks she has found a real Jim Dandy  
We'll wait till she finds he's not for keeps  
[ steel ]  
Candy is a whole lot like him  
Candy's sweet but when it's gone it's gone  
It'll melt away then tell me who's the sucker  
Well that's when my baby will come home  
My baby fell just like he wanted Candy ruined our happy home  
Baby's gotta a sweet tooth for Candy oh Candy won't last long  
Yeah Candy you won't last long
