I'm gonna wait till the sun comes out and  
I'm gonna wait till you come and shout it  
Cherizar  
Cherizar no matter where you are  
Cherizar you'll always be my star  
Cherizar no matter what you are  
Cherizar I'll always be your darlin'  
I'm gonna wait till the sun comes out  
I'm gonna wait till you come and shout it  
We're gonna kiss till the moon is drunk and  
We're gonna love till noon has sunk it  
Cherizar your heart is lonely  
Though your first love not for me  
Cherizar  
Cherizar  
Cherizar no matter where you are  
Cherizar ....
