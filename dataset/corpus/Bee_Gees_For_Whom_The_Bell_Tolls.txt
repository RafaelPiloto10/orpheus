I stumble in the night  
Never really knew what it would've been like  
You're no longer there to break my fall  
The heartache over you  
I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through  
I never saw the signs  
You're the last to know when love is blind  
  
All the tears and the turbulent years  
When I would not wait for no-one  
Didn't stop and take a look at myself  
And see me losing you  
  
[Chorus:]  
When the lonely heart breaks  
It's the one that forsakes  
It's the dream that we stole  
And I'm missing you more  
Than the fire that will roar  
There's a hole in my soul  
For you it's goodbye  
For me it's to cry  
For whom the bell tolls  
  
Seen you in a magazine  
A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been  
Hanging on the arm of someone else  
I'm still in love with you  
Won't you come back to your little boy blue  
I've come to feel inside  
This precious love was never mine  
  
Now I know but a little too late  
That I could not live without you  
In the dark or the broad daylight  
I promise I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I know there'll be times like this  
When I couldn't reach out to no-one  
Am I never gonna find someone  
Who knows me like you do  
Are you leaving me a helpless child  
When it took so long to save me  
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea  
I'll follow you anywhere  
I promise I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]
