Avoir, adieu, goodnight  
I'm too wrong to get right  
But I can't wait forever  
I've always been alone  
A fool believes he's clever  
  
Don't you wanna go into the hollow?  
I won't go alone  
Aren't you gonna follow?  
  
I live behind my eyes  
Be sure to keep the surprise  
I break what I've, I've borrowed  
That's why I always go  
Alone into tomorrow  
  
Don't you wanna go into the hollow?  
I won't go alone  
Aren't you gonna follow?  
  
Into the hollow  
Into the hollow
