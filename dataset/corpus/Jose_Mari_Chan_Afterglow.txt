We're at the afterglow  
Of what we both do know  
Know as the spring of our youth.  
We've loved and shared the dawn  
And hoped that we'd go on  
'Cause even that dawn had to go.  
  
Love has to cry  
But need not die  
Heart has to sigh  
The test of time  
  
We go through days and through years  
Calloused by doubts, joys and fears,  
  
Love has to grow  
But need not go  
Heart has to know  
The test of time  
  
We're at the afterglow  
And though we both do know  
How far we are from the dawn  
That second golden dawn  
When love is true  
Still I'll wait  
I'll wait for second dawn and you  
  
Love's golden dawn and you.
