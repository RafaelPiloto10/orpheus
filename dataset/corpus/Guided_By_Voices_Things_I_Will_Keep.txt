Coded-ancient the crease  
Unlock the timers  
And strike the chimers  
In my sleep  
  
Grab the coat - steal the fleece  
From behind the curtain  
It will most certainly  
Bring peace  
  
To those with countless numbers  
No cold or hot  
Like things that I will keep  
And hide them in my sleep  
  
Coded ancient  
Oh brightness we shall see  
Loaded up and at night when  
We shall flee  
Not to tread through the  
Heavy life  
Sink in the dream  
On the right night  
You'll find her waiting  
  
Selling things for cheap  
The things that I will keep
