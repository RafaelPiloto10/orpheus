Six o'clock in the morning  
And I'm stepping through the streets  
The pavement's cold and empty  
Got the blues beneath my feet.  
Big old sun is rising up  
So elegant and thin  
Another day is over  
So a new day will begin  
And the word said hey  
It's a brand new day  
  
Oh baby baby baby  
I dreamed about you  
Please tell me tell me tell me  
What I've seen could not be true  
You have taken my existance  
You have filled it full of stones  
You have turned into a stranger  
Now I need to walk alone  
  
But I won't be sad  
But I won't be destroyed  
  
And the word said  
Hey it's a brand new day.
