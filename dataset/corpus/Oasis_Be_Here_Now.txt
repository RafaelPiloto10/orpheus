Wash your face in the morning sun  
Flash your pan at the song that I'm singing  
Touch down bass living on the run  
Make no sweat at the hole that you're digging  
Wrap up cold when it's warm outside  
Your shit jokes remind me of Digsy's  
Be my magic carpet ride  
Fly me down to capitol city in the sun  
Kicking up a storm from the day that I was born  
Sing a song for me one from let it be  
Open up yer eyes, get a grip on yerself inside  
  
So wash your face in the morning sun  
Flash your pan at the song that I'm singing  
Touch down bass living on the run  
Make no sweat at the hole that you're digging  
  
Kicking up a storm from the day that I was born  
Sing a song for me one from let it be  
Open up yer eyes, get a grip on yerself inside  
Inside  
Yeah, a grip inside  
Yeah, a grip inside  
You betcha! You betcha!  
  
So wrap up cold when it's warm outside  
Please sit down you make me fill giddy  
Be my magic carpet ride  
Fly me down to capitol city  
  
I've been kicking up a storm from the day that I was born  
Sing a song for me one from let it be  
Open up yer eyes get a grip on yerself inside  
get a grip inside  
get a grip inside  
get a grip inside  
get a grip inside  
You betcha!  
  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
