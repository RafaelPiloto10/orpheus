In the streets, the children screamed  
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed  
And not a word was spoken  
The church bells, all were broken  
The three men I admired most  
The Father, Son, and The Holy Ghost  
They took the last train for the coast  
The day the music died  
They were singing, "Bye, bye, Miss American Pie"  
I drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye  
Singing, "This'll be the day that I die, this'll be the day that I die"  
And the three men I admired most  
The Father, Son, and The Holy Ghost  
They took the last train for the coast  
The day the music died
