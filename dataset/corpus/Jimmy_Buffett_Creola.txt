Creola in my soul-a  
I loved what they were sayin'  
I loved what they were playin'  
Creola  
  
(CHORUS 1)  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin'  
Fall in love romancing the melody  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me  
  
I remember as a child all the happiness and smiles  
That flowed around my grandma's Sunday table  
While Auntie Mae was sayin' grace  
Papa T would sneak a taste  
And catch a funny look from my cousin Mabel  
  
Then daddy'd beat the drum  
The old folks start to hum  
Sing the only songs that we all know  
Ambiance so fine, dancin' drinkin' wine  
Sing about the lifestyle on the bayou  
  
(CHORUS 2)  
Creola in my soul-a  
I loved what they were sayin'  
I loved what they were playin'  
Creola  
  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin'  
Fall in love romancin' the melody  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me  
  
It's in the mood, it's in the blood  
It's in the food, it's in the mud  
It's a spicy kind of life  
Cre-o-la  
  
It's in the mood, it's in the blood  
It's in the food, it's in the mud  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me  
  
(INSTRUMENTAL 2 VERSES)  
  
Well the years have come and gone  
Still the old song lingers on  
I keep it in my heart with fond affection  
Like the family good luck charm  
That keeps away the harm  
Creola's always there for my protection  
  
(CHORUS 3)  
Creola, good for your soul-a  
I loved what they were sayin'  
I loved what they were playin'  
Creola  
  
Creola on my victrola  
Makes me feel like dancin'  
You fall in love ramancin' the melody  
Creola, Creola, Creola for me
