Come back and set me free  
Now from infinity  
Love is a mystery  
Distance is killing me  
  
Come back I need you now  
You are the love I found  
I feel above the ground  
You take me round and round  
  
Am I dreaming?  
What I feel tonight about you and I.  
Am I dreaming?  
I can feel your love when I hold you tight.  
  
I just wanna love you  
And you're the one  
I need you.  
And I just wanna give all my love I have.  
With my lips I'm feeling  
And then I say I mean it  
Cause you're the only one that I feel tonight.  
  
Come back and set me free  
Now from infinity  
Love is a mystery  
Distance is killing me  
  
Come back I need you now  
You are the love I found  
I feel above the ground  
You take me round and round.
