A worn out joke to keep the flies away  
Carried it this far  
Got the west side winds to keep it steady  
We bury the hatchets we find  
  
Could carry that heavy load  
If I really thought it would matter  
Farcical hair appears  
As a blind side, clean the slate  
  
Working in the halls of shame  
Lay it down in full view  
Lay it down  
What the hell were we thinking  
  
Before the fire burned out?  
I can't find you now  
And I didn't know you then  
Loneliness drinks the bitters  
  
Till the cold winds warm again  
It's a feel for the game  
Mouth open wide, screams and hollers  
Working in the halls of shame  
  
Lay it down in full view  
Lay it down  
I gambled once and won, never made a dollar  
And beauty fades to grey  
  
And I pray the very best will guard her  
And provide the way  
It's a telltale sign  
When it's chairs up, and time to go  
  
Working in the halls of shame  
Lay it down in full view  
Lay it down
