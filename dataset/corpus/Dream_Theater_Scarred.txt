To Rise, To Fall.  
To Hurt, To Hate.  
To Want, To Wait.  
To Heal, To Save.  
  
Can't hear it  
We fear it  
Awareness won't come near it  
  
Distractive  
Reactive  
Disguised in spite of time  
  
I never bared my emotion  
My passion always strong  
I never lost my devotion  
But somewhere fate went wrong  
  
Can't let them rape me again  
Your venom's not family here  
Won't let them fill me with  
Fatalistic remedies  
  
What if the rest of the world  
Was hopelessly blinded by fear?  
Where would my sanctity live?  
Suddenly nobody cares.  
  
It's never enough  
You're wasting your time  
Isn't there something I could say?  
You don't understand  
You're closing me out  
How can we live our lives this way?  
  
You tell me I'm wrong  
I'm risking my life  
Still, I have nothing in return  
I show you my hands  
You don't see the scars  
Maybe you'll leave me here to burn.  
  
What if the rest of the world  
Was hopelessly drowning in vain?  
Where would our self pity run?  
Suddenly everyone cares.  
  
Blood  
Heal me  
Fear  
Change me  
Belief will always save me  
Blood  
Swearing  
Fear  
Staring  
Conviction made aware  
  
Give up on misery  
Turn your back on dissent  
Leave their distrust behind  
Wash your hands of regret  
  
Do you feel you don't know me anymore?  
And do you feel I'm afraid of your love?  
And how come you don't want me asking?  
And how come my heart's not invited?  
You say you want everyone happy  
Well, we're not laughing.  
  
And how come you don't understand me?  
And how come I don't understand you?  
Thirty years say we're in this together  
So open your eyes.  
  
People in prayer for me  
Everyone there for me  
Sometimes I feel I should face this alone  
My soul exposed  
It calms me to know that I won't  
  
Blood  
Heal me  
Fear  
Change me  
Belief will always save me  
Blood  
Swearing  
Fear  
Staring  
Conviction made aware  
  
Give up on misery  
Turn your back on dissent  
Leave their distrust behind  
Wash your hands of regret  
  
Blood  
Heal me  
Fear  
Change me  
Belief will always save me  
Blood  
Swearing  
Fear  
Staring  
Conviction made aware  
  
Learning from misery  
Staring back at dissent  
Leaving distrust behind  
I'm inspired and content
