Out of your dreams  
And into his arms  
You long to fly  
  
You don't need egyptian smelling salts to tell you why  
Out of your dreams and into the hush  
Of falling shadows  
When the mist is low  
And stars are breaking through  
Then out of your dreams you'll go  
Into a dream come true  
  
Make up your mind, make up your mind laurie  
Laurie dear  
Make up your own, make up your own story, laurie dear  
  
Old pharaoh's daughter won't tell you, what do do  
But your heart, whatever it tells you will be true  
  
Out of my dreams and into his arms I long to fly  
I will come as evening comes into a waiting sky  
Then out of my dreams and into the hush  
Of falling shadows  
When the mist is low  
And starts are breaking through  
  
Then out of my dreams I'll go  
Into a dream with you
