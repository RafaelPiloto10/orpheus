She gave  
A round of applause  
Followed  
By a standing novation  
  
I feel so dumb right now  
Standing outside her house  
Trying to apologizing  
'Cause I told quite a few lies  
(Damn)  
And she found me out  
So now I'm saying sorry  
'Cause I am  
Though it's very clear to me  
That she don't give a damn  
Got me out her putting on a show  
Neighbors laughing at me  
I just want her to know  
Without her I can't be happy  
So I'm putting on a show  
I hope it's entertaining  
Don't say we're over now  
Please let me in the house  
  
She said  
"And the award  
For the best lie goes to you  
For making me believe  
That you could be faithful to me  
Let's hear your speech now"  
She gave a round of applause  
Followed by a standing novation  
  
Got me out here  
Putting on a show  
Neighbors laughing at me  
I just want her to know  
Without her I can't be happy  
So I'm putting on a show  
Hope it's entertaining  
Don't say we're over now  
Please let me in the house  
  
Baby, please  
Don't say we're over now
