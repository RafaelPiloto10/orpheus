Now maybe you're right and maybe you're wrong  
But I ain't gonna argue with you no more  
I've done it for too long.  
It was getting so good why then, where did it go?  
I can't think about it no more tell me if you know.  
You were loving me, I was loving you  
But now there ain't nothing but regretting  
Nothing, nothing but regretting everything we do.  
  
I put up with your lies like you put up with mine,  
But God knows we should have stopped somewhere,  
We could have taken the time,  
But time has turned, yes, some call it the end.  
So tell me, tell me did you really love me like a friend?  
You know you don't have to pretend,  
It's all over now It'll never happen again, no no no,  
It'll never happen again , it won't happen again  
Never, never, never, it'll never happen again  
No, no, no, no  
  
So maybe you're right, and maybe you're wrong  
But I ain't gonna argue with you no more  
I've done it for too long.  
It was getting so good why then, where did it go?  
I can't think about it no more tell me if you know.  
You were loving me, I was loving you  
But now there ain't nothing but regretting  
Nothing, nothing but regretting everything we do.
