I've gone through life white-knuckled  
In the moments that left me behind  
Refusing to heed the yield  
I penetrate the force fields in the blind  
They say I'll adjust  
God knows I must  
But I'm not sure how  
This natural selection picked me out to be  
A dark horse running in a fantasy  
  
(Flesh and bone)  
And I'm running out of time,  
(Flesh and bone)  
  
Somewhere outside that finish line  
I square up and break through the chains  
And I hit like a raging bull  
Anointed by the blood, I take the reins  
Cut from the cloth, of a flag that  
Bears the name of "Battle Born"  
They'll call me the contender  
They'll listen for the bell  
With my face flashing crimson from the fires of hell  
  
(What are you afraid of?)  
And what are you made of?  
(Flesh and bone)  
And I'm running out of time,  
(Flesh and bone)  
And what are you made of?  
(Flesh and bone)  
Man, I'm turning on a dime,  
(Flesh and bone)  
  
(This could decay)  
This could decay  
Like the valley below  
Defenses are down  
The stakes are high (scouting the crowd for a face of compassion)  
The fairytale end (to face off the journey that fathers no more)  
The staggering blow (you'll find the truth in the roots of desire)  
You lead with your chin(thinkin' with your corners, just a compass and the
sun)  
This could be real(thinkin' with your corners, just a)  
Simple  
  
And what are you made of?  
(Flesh and bone)  
And I'm running out of time  
(Flesh and bone)  
What are you made of?  
  
He faces forward,  
Trading in his blindness for the world of love,  
And time is raging, may it rage in vain,  
And you always had it, but you never knew,  
So boots and saddles, get on your feet,  
There's no surrender, cause there's no retreat,  
The bells are sounding, bring this match to an end,  
We are the descendants of giant men
