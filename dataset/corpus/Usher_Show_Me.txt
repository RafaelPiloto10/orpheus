How's life?  
Great  
Everybody's going through something  
They gotta get over it  
You can't go around  
Let's just enjoy the time  
  
The night is young, you know  
We've just begun  
Let's have some fun until the moon turns to the sun  
Look out the deejay's got this party jumping  
It's easy to let loose when you sipping something  
Relax, it's what you deserve  
There's no need to be reserved, no  
  
Show me what you're made of  
We'll be going, going all night, can you stay up  
Show me what you're made of  
We'll be going, going all night, can you stay up  
  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me, what you came here for  
  
Telling you can't control what you can't have  
You're here, to enjoy yourself  
But time, in the back of your mind  
Spinning what's left of it on the floor  
Have another round and just enjoy this party  
Put your fear aside, go head and grab somebody  
Ain't no limit, no such thing is too much  
And if you cause a line in the V-I  
I'm waiting on you to show me  
  
Show me what you're made of  
We'll be going, going all night, can you stay up  
Show me what you're made of  
We'll be going, going all night, can you stay up  
  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me, what you came here for  
  
If you find yourself not knowing what to do  
Just lift you hands up high and improvise  
And don't you worry about what they think of you  
All you can do is just live your life  
Whoa, now is the time  
Now is the time  
So come on show me what you're all about  
Right here, right now  
Yeah it's the perfect time and place  
  
Show me what you're made of  
We'll be going, going all night, can you stay up  
Show me what you're made of  
We'll be going, going all night, can you stay up  
  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me, what you came here for  
Show me
