Verse:  
For you, I'd climb the highest height  
I'd dive the deepest sea  
Search for more of you  
  
For you, I'd fall upon my knees  
Cry out night and day  
Search for more of you  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
And I would give my riches away  
They're nothing without you  
  
Chorus:  
Something to live for  
Something worth dying for  
Has taken my heart  
Someone to follow  
In good or in troubled times  
I'd give all I have  
  
Do Anything for you  
Anything for you
