Everybody's got to know  
If you wanna get up,  
You know you gotta get low  
Everybody all around  
If you wanna get up,  
You know you gotta get down  
Hey, what's up?  
Now do you wanna get goin'?  
I can see you movin' up just fine  
But when you're there,  
Don't you ever forget all who's been behind you all the time  
There's a need to play,  
There's a time to pray  
There ain't nothin' wrong why you should do it (this) everyday  
It's for everyone (out) to have some fun  
What we all need to know is that the only way to get up is to get down  
Everybody get down  
Everybody get down  
Get down  
Get down  
Get down  
You know the only way to get up is if you get down  
Everybody get down  
Everybody get down  
Hey there's nothing wrong if you wanna go on  
I know it's your desire, we wanna make it strong  
But when the going gets too rough and when you wanna give up  
There may be something that you know you gotta do  
There's a need to play,  
There's a time to pray  
There ain't nothin' wrong why you should do it(this)everyday  
It's for everyone (out) to have some fun  
What we all need to know is that the only way to get up is to get down  
Everybody get down  
Everybody get down  
Get down  
Get down  
Get down  
You know the only way to get up is if you get down  
Everybody get down  
Everybody get down  
Everybody's got to know if you wanna get up you gotta get low  
Everybody all around if you wanna get up you gotta first get down  
Don't just say it in your mind, say it loud let Him know  
Many times you find what you never thought of before  
More precios than silver, more precious than gold,  
More than
