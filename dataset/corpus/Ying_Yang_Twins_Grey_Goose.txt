y'all niggaz don't bump  
y'all can't blow out the trunk

[Chorus: Kaine - 2X]  
If you don't give a fuck  
Put yo middle fingaz up  
ain't no cool-aid in my cup  
Gimme that Grey Goose (that grey goose)  
[Verse 1: Kaine]  
This here for my alcoholics  
What's that drink grey goose they call it  
A big ol glass wit a bird on the bottle  
A nigga want to get more drunker so he swallow  
Back up, buy two coronas, you'll tell an ugly bitch in tha club you want her  
Gonna drink mo liquor than a drunk, get crunk  
Til a nigga breath smell like skunk (Hanh!!)  
[D-Roc]  
Drankin everyday like gasoline in the car, you can find me at the bar  
Or the liquor stoe, to get some mo grey goose so I can wet my throat  
Walk up in the store, grey goose right there  
How much that is, let me get that there  
Put yo middle finga up if you don't give a fuck  
Tilt yo head back, now finish the cup  
[Chorus]  
[D-Roc]  
285 sip 75, 75, south on 75 to the turnpike (x2)  
[Kaine]  
Take that trip to the bottom, bottom (x2)  
Just take that trip to the bottom, bottom  
Take that trip to the bottom, bottom  
[Verse 2: Kaine]  
Alcohol seepin outta your pores  
Smellin like a liquor bearer steady talkin to whores  
Say that nigga so drunk, he'll fuck the floor (fuck the floor) fuck the floor  
When the day start a liquor in tank  
That nigga can't get a bitch, its like he ready to fight  
But the goose got him loose so he don't give a fuck  
He just whip it to the bar to get another cup  
[D-Roc]  
I drink grey goose, call me the ugly duckling  
You ain't put in on this, you ain't drankin nothin  
I drink by my goddamn self  
Ima get drunk by my goddamn self  
Turn up the bottle, drink it cowboy style  
Sweatin like a motherfucker buck ass wild  
Put your middle finger up, if you don't give a fuck  
Tilt ya head back, now finish the cup  
[Chorus] - 2X  
[Verse 3: Kaine]  
G, gotta grab a bottle of that sheeit

E, everybody drunk then a motherfucker

[D-Roc]  
G, mean that ya gotta be grown  
O, ya gotta put a cup on y'all  
O, outrageously drunk  
S, see I got something in my cup  
E, everybody gettin fucked up  
[Kaine]  
But buddy on tha floor torn up  
Of that goose get ya loose, and known to fuck up a crew x2  
If you, If give a fuck now  
If you give a fuck, give a fuck now  
If you, give a fuck, give a fuck now  
[Chorus] - until fade
