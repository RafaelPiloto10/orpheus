The stars shine down on me only  
The moon is pale  
I search in vain  
For love on the lonely trail.  
  
I'm a blue ranger  
But my heart's in danger  
Would you bide awhile  
Or ride a mile along with me.  
  
On the lone prairie,  
Things were so contrary  
Love was in the air  
But none would share it's song with me.  
  
A moonlit trail  
A starlit sky above  
I cried a lonesome wail  
In search of love...
