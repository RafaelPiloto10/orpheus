Don't be ashamed of your age  
Don't let the years get you down  
That old gang you knew, they still think of you  
As all rounder in your old hometown  
Don't mind the gray in your hair  
Just think of all the fun you had puttin' it there  
And as for that old book of time, boy, you never skipped a page  
So don't be ashamed of your age  
Brother, don't be ashamed of your age  
And now listen Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown  
Don't let the years get you down  
'Cause life ain't begun, until you're forty, son  
That's when you really start to go uptown  
And don't wish that you were a lad  
While boy, you've lost the old girls they've ever had  
And what's more, you've graduated from that old sucker stage  
So don't be ashamed of your age  
Brother, don't be ashamed of your age
