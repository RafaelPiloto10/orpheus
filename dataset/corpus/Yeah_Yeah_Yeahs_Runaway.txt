I was feeling sad  
Can't help looking back  
Highways flew by  
Run, run, run away  
No sense of time  
Want you to stay  
Want keep you inside  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Run, run, run away  
Lost, lost, lost my mind  
Want you to stay  
Want you to be my prize  
  
I was feeling sad  
Can't help looking back  
Highways flew by  
Run, run, run away  
No sense of time  
Want you to stay  
Want keep you inside  
  
All along, not so strong without these open arms.  
Hold on tight.  
All along, not that strong without these open arms.  
Lie beside.  
All along, not so strong without these open arms.  
Ride beside.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
