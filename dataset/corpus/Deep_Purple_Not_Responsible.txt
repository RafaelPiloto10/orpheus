Found some money in an old black jacket  
I'm going out tonight, gonna find me a woman or two  
I don't know how long it'll last  
But I never regret the past  
When I wake up tomorrow, I'll be looking around for you  
I got no reason to be down at the station  
I got no ticket, but I'm gonna take a fucking ride  
Don't care where I go  
I never seem to know  
I never had a penny, but I never wondered why  
Oh no, I never wondered why  
  
If I'm cold I need some heat  
If I'm hungry then I eat  
I'm not responsible  
  
I woke up this morning and I couldn't find my shoes  
It's one long party and I haven't seen the sun for days  
I'd take you out tonight, but I'm just a little light  
So let's go out anyway, you'll be amazed  
  
I take my woman to the palace dancing  
I never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine  
So I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe  
You can pay the bill and while you're at it pick up mine  
Oh, no no, I don't mind  
  
If it rains I stay inside  
If I'm scared I run and hide  
I'm not responsible, oh no
