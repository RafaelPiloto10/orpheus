Hello, God?  
Are You out there?  
Can You hear me?  
Are You listenin' anymore?  
Hello, God?  
If we're still on speakin' terms  
Can You help me like before?  
I have questioned Your existence  
My resistance leaves me cold  
Can you help me go the distance?  
Hello God?  
Hello?  
Hello?  
  
This old world has gone to pieces  
Can we fix it?  
Is there time?  
Hate and violence just increases  
We're so selfish, cruel, and blind  
We fight and kill each other  
In Your name defending You  
Do You love some more than others?  
We're so lost and confused  
  
Hello, God?  
Are you out there?  
Can you hear us?  
Are you listenin' anymore?  
Hello, God?  
If we're still on speakin' terms  
Can You help us like before?  
Oh, the free will You have given  
We have made a mockery of  
This is no way to be livin'  
We're in great need of Your love  
Hello, God?  
  
(Hello hello)  
Hello, God?  
Can You grant us  
Love enough to make amends?  
(Hello, God)  
Is there still a chance  
That we could start again?  
Hello, God?  
We've learned our lesson  
Dear God, don't let us go  
(Hello, hello)  
More than ever  
Hello God?  
Hello?  
Hello?  
Hello, God?  
We really need You  
We can't make it without You  
(Hello, God)  
We beseech You  
In the name of all that's true  
Hello, God?  
Please forgive us  
For we know not what we do  
Hello, God?  
Give us one more chance  
To prove ourselves to You  
Hello, God?  
Hello, God?
