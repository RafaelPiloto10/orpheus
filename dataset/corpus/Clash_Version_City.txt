There is a train at Version City  
Waiting for the rhythm mail  
If you can jump then jump right now  
She can pull you through to better days  
  
Is that the train that the speak off  
The one I heard in my younger days  
All great bluesmen have rode her  
I'm jumping up gonna ride that train  
  
There's a lonely soul out on the crossroads  
He's waiting there in the pouring rain  
He's looking for that great ride yeh  
That'll take him to oh what's her name  
  
So I rode that train from Version City  
For ninety-nine an' one half days  
Never heard such rhythm sound  
It was in my soul which was on the train  
  
We went straight through Syndrum Inc.  
Up an' over the Acapella Pass  
Then Gibson Town and Fenderville  
All stations to the Mesa Boogie Ranch  
We saw that soul out on the cross roads  
Waitin' there in the pouring rain  
We called hey engine slow your rhythms  
See he wants to ride the version train  
  
We rode that train from Version City  
For ninety-nine and one half years  
I never seen such funky country  
While riding with the engineers  
  
Could not fill no application  
Before I rode this rhythm train  
Could not work at my station  
Before I rode the version train  
  
There is a train at Version City  
Waiting for the rhythm mail  
If you can jump then jump right now  
She can pull you through to better days
