The witches brew a pot of hate  
With lizard, but and man  
With a smile they laugh their spells  
Astir with wretched hand  
Calling demons baphomet  
And mephistopheles  
The tattered firyres cackle  
As their mortal victims bleed  
Don't burn the witch  
The ways of hell aren't wrong  
Don't burn the witch  
Let them brew their song  
The witches of the blackened arts  
Are cunning, cruel and mean  
Persecuted by religion  
God the man unseen  
Beastial malevolence  
Is chartered in their bones  
Leave the unreal house of God  
And burn in hell at home  
Eye of lizard  
Wing of bat  
Testicle of man  
Tongue of eagle  
Brain of rat  
Jesus Christ's left hand  
The witches make the voodoo doll  
A toy taboo in heaven  
They dance around the pentagram  
In search of rape by satan  
Leave the heart and blood of men  
In cauldrons laced in sin  
Add the arsenic, hemlock, pus  
Triumph takes the wings
