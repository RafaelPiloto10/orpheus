That's what you get for lovin' me that's what you get for lovin' me  
Everything we had is gone if you can see that's what you get for lovin' me  
Don't you shed a tear for me I ain't the love you thought I'd be  
I've had a hundred just like you but don't be blue  
I'll have a thousand before I'm through  
That's what you get for lovin' me...  
[ guitar ]  
There you go you're cryin' again you should have known how things would end  
But someday when your poor heart is on the mend I just might pass this way
again  
That's what you get for lovin' me...  
That's what you get for lovin' me
