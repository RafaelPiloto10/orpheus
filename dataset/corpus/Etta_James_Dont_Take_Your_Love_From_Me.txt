Tear a star from out the sky and the sky feels blue  
Tear a petal from the rose and the rose weeps too  
Take your heart away from mine and mine will surely break  
My life is yours to take, so please keep the spark awake  
  
Would you take the wings from birds so that they can't fly?  
Would you take the ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?  
All this, your heart won't let you do  
This is what I beg of you  
Don't take your love from me  
  
All this, your heart won't let you do  
This is what I beg of you  
Don't take your love from me  
Don't take your love from me
