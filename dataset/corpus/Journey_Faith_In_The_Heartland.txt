He goes to work in a brand new dawn  
With the early morning sunrise  
He's got his dream and he's holding on  
It's getting harder every day  
  
He loves a girl who speaks her mind  
Don't always look at life the same way  
Sharing truth that will heal in time  
  
They want to believe something real  
Still they're searching  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
  
Time moves on as the fading town  
And they struggle with the changes  
The stores have closed, friends have moved away  
Now it's hope that sees him through  
  
The kids have gone but they'll see them all  
At the Sunday congregation  
Sharing dreams truth will heal in time  
  
They want to believe something real  
Still they're searching  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
Ooh, it's words that divide them  
It's love that defines them  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
In our darkest hour, oh, we look to the sky  
With a silent prayer  
Believe that God's on our side  
In a land where freedom rings  
And where eagles fly  
Ooh yeah, yeah  
  
They want to believe something real  
Still they're searching  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
Yeah, it's words that divide them  
It's love that defines them  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
  
Oh, I just want to believe it  
  
Give me something to believe in  
We all need something to believe in  
In the heart tonight  
  
Got faith  
Got dreams  
Yeah, we're keeping the faith alive
