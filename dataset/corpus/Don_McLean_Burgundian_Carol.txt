The winter season of the year,  
When to this world our Lord was born,  
The ox and donkey, so they say,  
Did keep his holy presence warm.  
How many oxen and donkeys now  
If they were there when first he came,  
How many oxen and donkeys you know  
At such a time would do the same?  
  
And on that night it has been told  
These humble beasts so rough and rude,  
Throughout the noght of holy birth  
Drank no water, ate no food.  
How many oxen and donkeys now  
If they were there when first he came,  
How many oxen and donkeys you know  
At such a time would do the same?  
  
As soon as to these humble beasts  
Appeared our Lord, so mild and sweet,  
With joy they knelt before his Grace  
And gently kissed His tiny feet.  
How many oxen and donkeys now  
Dressed in ermine, silk and such,  
How many oxen and donkeys you know  
At such a time would do as much?
