[Hook]  
It's g-a-n-g-s-t-a  
That's how it be and it's gon' say (Y'all know whoooooooo)  
That's how it be when you see me  
That's how it be in NYC (Y'all know whoooooooo)  
If it's me it's got to be  
If it's me it's got to be  
G-a-n-g-s-t-a (Y'all know whoooooooo)  
  
[Verse One]  
I'm still living la vida loca  
Where hoes sell prices on weed or coke-a  
For the hustlers, for the customers, trust the buzz  
It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does (woo HAH!)  
They love me just because  
I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)  
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga  
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders  
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean  
They gold cups missing stones, turning green  
I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse Two]  
God was in a good mood, on the day he made me  
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me  
And I wouldn't change it for nothing  
I stay on point, that's ''cause I know the danger of stuntin'  
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'  
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta  
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'  
''cause we can tell by the body language you frontin'  
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag  
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag  
I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag  
You need some high heels and a handbag  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse Three]  
I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em  
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots  
Give me a .40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine  
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine  
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine  
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine  
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine  
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta  
Oh no thank ya, I earned my key  
My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee  
That's gangsta love, from the heart  
Yo I told y'all from the start  
And now (y'all know whoooooooo)  
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up  
Cali bringin' peeps and weed up  
I'm coming through with a bunch of girls that'll deep a seed up  
(It's a gangsta party)
