Shake it, shake it  
I can do this all night  
All those things you like  
That you hide as a kite  
Got the wind, shake it  
Let's get out of here come on  
Where's your car, take me on  
Up the stairs, Close the door  
  
And then my skirt came down  
Down, down, down  
And then my skirt came down  
Down, down, down  
  
Down, down, down  
And then my skirt came down  
  
Let's get out of here come on  
Let's get out of here come on  
Let's get out of here come on  
Let's get out of here come on  
Let's get out of here come on  
  
Tonight be my super novel take for anyone  
Tonight let me basket you a craze of desire  
Tonight I'm yours  
Tonight we're one  
  
And then my skirt came down  
Down, down, down  
And then my skirt came down  
Down, down, down  
  
Down, down, down  
And then my skirt came down  
  
Like the way I shake it  
Like the way I shake it  
Like the way I shake it  
Like the way I shake it  
Like the way I shake it  
Like the, like the, like the  
  
That's when my...  
And then my skirt came down  
  
Tonight be my super novel take for anyone  
Tonight let me basket you a craze of desire  
Tonight I'm yours  
Tonight we're one
