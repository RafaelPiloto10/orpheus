Give it up, give it up, you know what's on my mind  
Give it up, give it up, you've been wasting too much time  
You know I got what you want, c'mon, you're 'bout to blow my mind  
Give it up, give it up, you've been wasting too much time  
Give it, give it up, yeah, you know what's on my mind  
Yeah!  
  
Patiently I've waited, baby, waited just for you  
And I ain't gonna move an inch until you do what you're supposed to do  
You've got your thing together, I can dig it too  
And that's the very reason I'm stickin' here with you  
  
Give it, give it up, you know what I'm talking about (can you dig it?)  
Give it up, give it up, yeah, you make me shout  
Give it to me  
  
You may think you're lookin' cool but I know what's on your mind  
And if you want to get with me you gotta spend a little more time  
I ain't the kind of girl that falls, falls at the drop of a hat  
I can see right through your game, I just ain't goin' for that  
  
Give it up, give it up, baby, don't take so long  
It's right around the corner, get it and bring it on home  
Give it, give it up, yeah, you make me shout  
Give it up, give it up, you know that's what I'm talking about  
Give it up, give it up, you know what I'm talking about  
Wont' you give it, give it up, girl, oh, you make me shout  
Won't you give it up, give it up, girl, get it and bring it on home  
Give it up, give it up, girl, baby, don't take too long  
Don't take so long  
Hell, I'm stickin' right here
