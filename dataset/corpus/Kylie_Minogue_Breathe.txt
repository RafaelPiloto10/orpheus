Don't blame me just because I am bored,  
I'm needy I need to taste it all,  
Don't down me just because I am quiet,  
I'm thinking about it all.  
I'm helpless about the way of me,  
And I'm thinking,  
Thinking about it all,  
I'm sorting everything inside  
  
I'm looking into space,  
This time this void,  
I'm making my way  
Through the muddy minutes,  
The pull is in my muscle,  
The ache is in my bones,  
Its hard to be alone  
  
Breathe, breathe,  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
  
Breathe, breathe  
  
See through me when I put up a fight,  
I'd like you to see the things I hide,  
Go deeper than I will let you know,  
I'm frightened but I won't let it show,  
I'm helpless about the way of me,  
And I'm thinking,  
Thinking about it all,  
I'm sorting everything inside  
  
I'm looking into space,  
This time this void,  
I'm making my way  
Through the muddy minutes,  
The pull is in my muscle,  
The ache is in my bones,  
And it's hard to be alone  
  
Breathe, breathe,  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
  
Breathe, breathe  
  
Breathe, breathe,  
  
[Repeat: x12]  
It won't be long now
