He can't dance or sing  
He can't do anything  
But, what the hell?  
The kid's a looker  
Just add cash and stir  
And there you are  
Another nonsense non-star  
La la la da da da la la la...  
  
There's no pretense  
This kid is dense  
But, what the hell?  
The kid's a looker  
Just add cash and stir  
And the crass consumers line up  
Shoulder to shoulder  
La la la da da da la la la...  
  
Sometime through the night  
The kid she'd his life  
So very sad  
However do not call this number again  
We're busy molding the face  
Of the kid's replacement, yeah  
La la la da da da la la la...
