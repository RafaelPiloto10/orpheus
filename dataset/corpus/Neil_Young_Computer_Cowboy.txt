Well, his cattle each have numbers  
And they all eat in a line  
When he turns the floodlights  
On each night  
Of course the herd looks perfect!  
Computer Cowboy.  
  
Well, he rides  
The range 'til midnight  
And the wild coyotes yowl  
As he trots  
Beneath the floodlights  
And of course  
The rhythm is perfect!  
Computer Cowboy.

To the city just in time  
To bring another system down  
And leave your alias behind:
