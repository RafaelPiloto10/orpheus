Ah shit  
Y'all know what time it is (What time is it?)  
It's the return of the motha fuckin' ying yang twins  
And you know this is your boy Collipark  
And we back on the fifth L.P.  
We back in this biz baby, but this time we gonna do it a lil different  
For the first half of the album we gonna do it for the die hard ying yang
twins fans  
The ones that been with us from day one  
The second half of the album we gonna team up with my man Wyclef and my man
Jerry Wonder  
  
And do it a little different  
Make it a little musical for y'all  
So what you can do right now is sit back, grab you some gack, some patron,
fire you up a blunt  
And all you ladies that like to shake ya ass  
You already know its about to go down in this bitch  
It's the motha fuckin' chemically imbalanced L.P.  
So we free to do it like this  
Yo check it out
