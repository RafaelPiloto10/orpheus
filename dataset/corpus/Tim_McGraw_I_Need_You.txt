I wanna drink that shot of whiskey  
I wanna smoke that cigarette  
I wanna smell that sweet addiction on my breath  
I wanna ride 'cross West Virginia  
In the backseat of a Cadillac  
You know some cowboys like me go out like that  
So I need you  
  
Like a needle needs a vein  
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs the rain  
I need you  
Like a lighthouse on the coast  
Like the Father and the Son need the Holy Ghost  
I need you  
  
I wanna get lost in some corner booth  
A cantina in Mexico  
I wanna dance to the static of an AM radio  
I wanna wrap the moon around us  
And lay beside you skin on skin  
Make love till the sun comes up till sun goes down again  
'Cause I need you  
  
Like a needle needs a vein  
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs the rain  
I need you  
Like a lighthouse on the coast  
Like the Father and the Son need the Holy Ghost  
I need you  
  
Oh, I need you  
  
I wanna drink that shot of whiskey  
I wanna smoke that cigarette  
You know some cowboys like me go out like that  
So I need you  
Oh, I need you  
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you  
  
Ooo, I need you, I need you, I need you  
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, too
