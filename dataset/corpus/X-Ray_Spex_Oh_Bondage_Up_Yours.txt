Bind me tie me  
Chain me to the wall I want to be a slave  
To you all  
  
Oh bondage up yours, oh bondage no more [Repeat: x1]  
  
Chain-store chain-smoke  
I consume you all  
Chain-gang chain-mail  
I don't think at all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Thrash me crash me  
Beat me till I fall  
I want to be a victim  
For you all  
  
[Chorus]  
Thrash me crash me  
Beat me till I fall  
I want to be a victim  
For you all  
  
Bind me tie me  
Chain me to the wall I want to be a slave  
To you all
