I don't care if you don't  
I don't care if you don't  
I don't care if you don't care  
I don't care if you don't care  
I don't care if you don't care  
I don't care if you don't care  
I don't care  
Everyone's so full of shit  
Born and raised by hypocrites  
Hearts recycled but never saved  
From the cradle to the grave  
We are the kids of war and peace  
From Anaheim to the Middle East  
We are the stories and disciples of  
The Jesus of Suburbia  
Land of make believe  
And it don't believe in me  
Land of make believe  
And I don't believe  
And I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care
