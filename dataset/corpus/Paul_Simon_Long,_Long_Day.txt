It's been a long, long day  
I got some run-down shoes  
Ain't got no place to stay  
But any old place will be okay  
It's been a long, long day  
I sure been on this road  
Done nearly fourteen years  
Can't say my name's well known  
You don't see my face in rolling stone  
But I sure been on this road  
Slow motion  
Half a dollar bill  
Jukebox in the corner  
Shooting to kill  
And it's been a...  
It's been a long, long day  
I sure could use a friend  
Don't know what else to say  
I hate to abuse an old cliche  
But it's been a long, long day  
Its been a long, long day
