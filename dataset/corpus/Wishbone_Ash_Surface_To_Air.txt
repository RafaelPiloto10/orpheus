Surface, surface, surface,  
It's beginning to show.  
To air, to air, to air,  
To where you can go.  
Abrasion can wear you away.  
All you wanted was to go out and play.  
Time to fix this crack in the eagle  
Before she flies away.  
Smokin', smokin', smokin',  
Makin' cloudier skies.  
Today, today, see the stars.  
Two terrestrial minds stay shy.  
Monkey, monkey, wanna play around,  
But get confused when flames burn your hand.  
Got to fix this ache in the eagle  
So she can understand.  
Surface, surface, surface,  
It's beginning to rise.  
To air, to air, to air,  
To where you can realize  
Can scare you away.  
Who knows how much is too much to say?  
Try to fix this ache in the eagle  
Before she flies away, flies away.
