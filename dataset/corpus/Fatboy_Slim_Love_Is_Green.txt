When he told me that I ought to come back home,  
I tried.  
And when he told me that he was tired of being  
alone,  
I cried.  
Now all these years have passed,  
The music has always held my hand.  
We'll ride the back up train forever,  
With this saint-like man.  
  
He was the only one that I'd ever listen to,  
He was the only one.  
  
Now when my life's in doubt,  
There's always a reason to belong.  
And when my wife was gone,  
His music always made me strong.  
If there's a heaven where good music goes,  
I know it will be there.  
We know he loves, we know he sings, we know he  
tries,  
He cares
