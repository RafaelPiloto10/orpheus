Wait just A Minute  
Can Wait just A Minute?  
  
Here you are, with me  
And if you take my hand babe  
We can go to a place, you ain't never seen before  
  
Slow dance in the moonlight  
I'm just trying to set the mood right  
I'm just doing what a dude do  
Do it over and over and over  
  
Quick thing wanna run with me now  
Swift thing just come with me now  
Good steps go to the beat now  
Over and over and over  
  
It's just the way, that way, that way, that do it babe  
All I can say, that say, the say that I'm the it  
But I'd be lying babe  
  
Just wanna wait for a minute  
Wait for a minute  
  
[Tyga - Rap Vese]  
Hold up, I don't need no love  
I said that with a straight face, baby that's poker  
Feel a lil sober, got it mixed in my soda  
I clean up good, aropa, dopa  
Baby I'm the shit but that's a good odor  
I'm a young star but my money look Yoda  
Crib on the ocean, backyard boat shit  
You hating on the internet, I couldn't even notice  
Tickets no service, we at the top working  
Pop-pops is lurking, told her "don't get nervous"  
I don't swerve Suburbans, this a gold derby  
Ferarri's and horses, I snap like Torres  
No rug, I floor it, girl, come feel important  
I'm all about a dollar, babe, banks call me Georgi  
9-5 Rollie, 96 Kobe, tonight we gon' ball like Ginobili  
You know me, I'm just tryna...  
  
Slow dance in the moonlight  
I'm just trying to set the mood right  
I'm just doing what a dude do  
Do it over and over and over  
  
Quick thing wanna run with me now  
Swift thing just come with me now  
Good steps go to the beat now  
Over and over and over  
  
It's just the way, that way, that way, that do it babe  
All I can say, that say, the say that I'm the it  
But I'd be lying babe  
  
Just wanna wait for a minute  
Wait for a minute
