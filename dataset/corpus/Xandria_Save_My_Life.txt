My Soul feels empty  
I'm drowning in my tears  
It's pain I'm learning  
My Heart is aching  
Got poison in my veins  
In hell I'm burning  
  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Let these tears be our secret  
My You and I  
You and I  
Once we were so close  
Save my life  
  
It's all or nothing  
I'm asking you to give  
Let live or die  
Everything is better  
Than this silent lie  
Say that it's no lie!  
  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Let these tears be our secret  
You and I  
You and I  
Once we were so close  
Save my life  
  
I need you to save my life  
  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Let these tears be our secret  
You and I  
You and I  
Once we were so close  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Let me feel you breathing  
In your hands  
In your hands  
Is the heart of mine  
Save my life
