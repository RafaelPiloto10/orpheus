Havana moon, Havana moon  
Me all alone with jug of rum  
Me stand and wait for boat to come  
It's long the night, it's quiet the dock  
The boat she late since 12 o'clock  
Me watch the tide easin' in  
Is low the moon, but high the wind  
  
Havana moon, Havana moon  
Me all alone, me open the rum  
It's long the wait for boat to come  
American girl come back to me  
We'll sail away across the sea  
We'll dock in New York, the buildings high  
We'll find a home up in the sky  
  
Havana moon, Havana moon  
Me still alone, me sip on the rum  
Me wonder where the boat she come  
To bring me love, ow! Sweet little thing  
She rock and roll, she dance and sing  
She hold me tight, she touch me lips  
Me eyes they close, me heart she flip  
  
Havana moon, Havana moon  
But still alone, me drinkin' the rum  
Begin to think the boat no come  
American girl, she tell a lie  
She say till then, she mean goodbye  
  
Havana moon, Havana moon  
Me lay down alone, was good the rum  
Me fall asleep, the boat she come  
The girl she look till come the dawn  
She weep and cry, "Return for home"  
The whistle blow, me open me eyes  
Was bright the sun, was blue the sky  
Me grab me shoes, me jump and run  
Me see the boat head for horizon  
Havana moon, is gone the rum  
The boat she sail, me love she gone  
Havana moon, Havana moon
