I'm on the inside,  
I'm on your side,  
And each thought stings.  
  
I can? think straight.  
It? overflowing.  
It? overflowing.  
It? coming down.  
It? overflowing.  
It? sinking.  
It? overflowing.  
  
It? some savior,  
you fall into.  
And each love stings.  
I can? think straight.  
  
It? overflowing.  
It? overflowing.  
It? coming down.  
It? overflowing.  
I? sinking.  
It? overflowing.  
It? coming down.  
It? overflowing.  
It? sinking.  
It? overflowing.  
It? coming down.
