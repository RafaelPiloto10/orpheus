  
Come on mamma, put your good dress on  
The night is young and we're goin' downtown  
Where faces come and faces go  
It ain't very far you know  
  
Come on mamma, is it really that hard  
To lose yourself right where you are  
Till your money's gone and your mind is bent  
You couldn't say where midnight went  
  
Chorus:  
Winding pathways, blind-sided fools  
How could you let them get the best of you  
Stumblin' footfalls, someone calls your name  
Been calling you, stay just the same, just the same  
  
Come on mamma, let it fade away  
For good this time and gone we'll stay  
All the scenes are gonna pass on by  
I swear we'll leave it all behind  
  
[ Chorus ]
