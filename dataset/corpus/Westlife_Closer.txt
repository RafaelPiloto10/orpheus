Across the miles  
It's funny to me  
How far you are but now  
Near you seem to be  
I could talk all night  
Just to hear you breathe  
I could spend my life  
Just living this dream  
You're all I'll ever need  
  
You give me strength  
You give me hope  
You give me someone to love someone to hold  
When I'm in your arms  
I need you to know  
I've never been  
I've never been this close  
  
With all the lovers  
I used to know  
I kept my distance I never let go  
But in your arms I know I'm safe  
'Cause I've never been held  
And I've never been kissed in this way  
You're all I'll ever need  
You're all I'll ever need  
  
Close enough to see it's true  
Close enough to trust in you  
Closer now than any words can say  
  
And when, when I'm in your arms,  
I need you to know I've never been  
I've never been this close  
  
You give me strength  
You give me hope  
You give me someone to love someone to hold  
When I'm in your arms  
I need you to know  
I've never been  
I've never been  
I've never been  
I've never been this close
