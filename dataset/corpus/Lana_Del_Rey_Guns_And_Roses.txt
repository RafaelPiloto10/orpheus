Heavy metal love of mine, I should have learned to let you stay  
You didn't want me all the time, but you were worth it anyway  
  
Cause you were so much better  
Than the rest of them  
Out of all the others  
You were the honest man  
  
He loved guns and roses,  
Guns and roses  
He loved guns and roses,  
He loved guns  
And roses, roses, roses  
  
Motorcycle love divine  
I should have learned to let you play  
I wasn't the marrying kind  
I should have done it anyway  
We should have left Las Vegas and then began again  
To kill? Back to the promised land  
  
He loved guns and roses,  
Guns and roses  
He loved guns and roses,  
He loved guns  
And roses, roses, roses  
  
I can feel it coming in the island tonight  
...  
Turning tan in...  
I can see you bathing in the sun light  
You got game boy,  
Game boy, game boy  
You got game boy game boy,  
Game boy  
You got game  
  
He loved guns and roses,  
Guns and roses  
He loved guns and roses,  
He loved guns  
And roses, roses, roses  
  
Roses  
Roses  
Roses  
Roses  
Roses  
Roses
