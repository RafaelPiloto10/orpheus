At the edge of the moon there's a lonely man  
And he blows on his horn as strong as he can  
And the girl at the bar wipes the breath  
Of winter away with a smile of her face  
  
And a little black dog barks along with a loon  
Is this my appointment or did I come too soon  
Got a strange invitation for tea time  
'Twas given by somebody I can't recall  
  
It's the middle of the riddle, it's not very serious  
It's nothing but a big surprise  
And the president's horse is a rabbit of course  
That is living in a big boy's mind  
  
Living in a big boy's mind  
And I skate on a knife on a wire  
That is strung from this song to a distant shore  
And then I say  
  
Intuition is just another phase of chance  
While we're crawling through the old pyramid's floors  
(little pharaohs)  
And the little black dog, here it comes again  
  
It's a true companion in a foreign land  
On a quest for the valley of boojums  
And birthdays and phonecalls I cannot recall  
All of man shan't talk to the one at the helm  
  
And the man at the helm shall talk to no one  
Shall talk to no one at all  
(Rule 42)  
And a horse is a rabbit of course  
  
(yes, indeed)  
Yes, a horse is a rabbit of course
