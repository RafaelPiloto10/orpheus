Our love  
Our love's in danger  
If you don't hurry home  
I might  
Give it to a stranger  
I never wanted you to go  
I told you many times before  
I need your loving day to day  
I get so tired when you're far away  
You got me staring at the ceiling  
Better come quick  
You can't make it too soon  
I never want to do you wrong  
But you been gone away so long  
I don't know what you expect of me  
That's what I'm trying so hard to be  
Don't force me into another's arms  
Our love  
Our love  
Our love  
Get the picture, I'm here all alone  
Ain't you worried  
About your happy home  
What I'm thinking  
Makes me feels ashamed  
Tell me who's to blame  
Tell me what to do about the  
Strangers coming from everywhere  
Strangers calling my name  
Just don't know what to do about it
