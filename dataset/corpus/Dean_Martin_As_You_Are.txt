As you are my love  
As you are my love  
Say you'll always be  
Though the years go by  
  
My heart will ever sigh  
You're the love for me  
Dearest always be as you are to me  
You're my guiding star  
  
What you are to me my love you'll ever be  
Though you're near or far  
It's so clear to me  
Why you're so dear to me  
  
As you are as you are  
What you are to me my love you'll ever be  
Though you're near or far  
It's so clear to me  
  
Why you're so dear to me  
As you are  
As you are
