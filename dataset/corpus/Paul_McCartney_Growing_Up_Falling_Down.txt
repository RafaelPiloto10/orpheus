We were growing, time was going so fast  
Without knowing, we were growing up fast  
  
We were lying down, in the shade  
I remember the love we made  
  
We were lying down, on the bed  
I remember the tears we shared  
  
We were growing, time was going so fast, (Growing up)  
Without knowing, (Falling down) we were growing up fast (Growing up, Falling
down)  
(Growing up, Falling down)  
  
We were laughing to, we were so  
I remember the fun we had  
We were crying loud, with the pain  
We will never be here again  
  
Growing up, falling down
