Nothing left, no regrets  
No hard feelings wish you all the best  
No blame, no shame  
Just time to say it's over I guess  
We both agree it's the right thing  
The only thing left to do  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
Sometimes love don't work out  
No matter how hard you try  
Lord knows we didn't start out to say goodbye  
If it's a win-win situation  
Then why am I feelin' so blue  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
You take yours, I'll take mine  
We'll leave nothing but the memories behind  
Of a love, and a dream  
That just somehow faded with time  
You say you're goin' your way  
I'm goin' somewhere too  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
Sometimes love don't work out  
No matter how hard you try  
Lord knows we didn't start out to say goodbye  
If it's a win-win situation  
Then why am I feelin' so blue  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
If it's a win-win situation  
Then why am I feelin' so blue  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
If you win, and I win, we lose  
We lose
