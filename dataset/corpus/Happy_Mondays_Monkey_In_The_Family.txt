Its delicious the way your walking go easy on your toes  
There's a million and one different dances who do you know  
That knows there's a monkey in the family it was trained by Adam and eve it
was so  
  
Your great granddad and grandma and decided it wouldn't leave  
I had to make the grass more greener I had to make the sky more blue  
I had to put a stop to the jungle jive team so they don't do these with  
You when you grow up you'll moon stomp mi lady to moon stomp is in your blood  
You'll have to make a keen decision but you'll  
Know everything about love there's a monkey in the family swings  
Tree to tree it never stops to see how your doing  
It just has time to feed it's delightful  
The way your walking be steady on those feet stay away  
From the peppermint twist where the humpty humpey
