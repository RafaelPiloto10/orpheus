Riding down the freeway, I've got to stay free  
I need a little leeway and an angel to watch over me  
Don't give up on me  
Don't give up on me  
Cause I know I let you down girl  
Once, twice, or maybe three  
I fell into temptation  
Won't you tell me that you'll wait for me  
  
Don't give up on me  
Don't give up on me  
Don't give up on me  
Don't give up on me  
  
Riding down the freeway, I've got to stay free  
I need a little leeway and an angel to watch over me  
  
Don't give up on me  
Don't give up on me  
Don't give up on me  
Don't give up on me  
Don't give up on me, please  
Don't give up on me
