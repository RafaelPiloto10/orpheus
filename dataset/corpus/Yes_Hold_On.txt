Justice to the left of you  
Justice to the right  
Speak when you are spoken to  
Don't pretend you're right  
This life's not for living  
It's for fighting and for war  
No matter what the truth is  
Hold on to what is yours  
  
Jigsaw puzzle traitors  
Set to spill the beans  
Constitution screw up  
Shattering the dreams  
Blood flows in the desert  
Dark citadels burning too  
Watch! Look over your shoulder  
This one is strictly for you  
  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Wait maybe the answer's  
Looking for you  
  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Wait! Take you time  
Think it through  
Yes! I can make it through  
  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Sunshine shine on through  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Sunshine shine on you  
  
See it through  
  
Talk the simple smile  
Such platonic eye  
How they drown in incomplete capacity  
Strangest of them all  
When the feeling calls  
How we drown in stylistic audacity  
Charge the common ground  
Round and round and round  
We living in gravity  
  
Shake  
We shake so hard  
How we laugh so loud  
When we reach  
We believe in eternity  
  
I believe in eternity  
  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Wait  
Take your time Sunshine shine on through  
See it through  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Wait  
Maybe a chance Sunshine shine on through  
Is looking for you Sunshine shine on you  
  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on
