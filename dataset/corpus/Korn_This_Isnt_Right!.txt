I must look away  
I must find a way  
You know there is a line!  
Don't try to take what's mine!  
I feel it bottled up inside!  
This hate and all this pride!  
Can't you let me have some of it?  
  
Daddy, you're drinking your life away!  
Mummy please go away!  
Must that man stay?  
Can't he go away?  
Mum? Your fucked inside!  
Brought him to your life!  
Now you're his wife!  
This isn't right!  
  
Must I feel this way?  
Must I crawl inside?  
Get me out of here!  
Don't need him by my side!  
Don't tell me what to fucking do  
I'll fuck you up I promise you!  
Get the fuck out of my site!  
  
Daddy, you're drinking your life away!  
Mummy please go away!  
Must that man stay?  
Can't he go away?  
Mum? Your fucked inside!  
Brought him to your life!  
Now you're his wife!  
This isn't right!  
  
Get the fuck out of my face!  
I don't need you around this place!  
You worry me go away!  
Don't burry me, feel my hate?  
Just go away!  
Hey, my times gone for today!  
And your still here with me!?  
Ill fuck you up, leave!  
Just leave me alone!  
  
Alone (x3)  
  
Mummy? (x5)
