All I give  
Is all I got  
And all I am  
Ain't what I'm not  
And I ain't gonna lie or beg  
For your love  
I'm on a natural high  
  
When morning comes  
Take my hand  
To free your mind  
Come to my land  
But I ain't gonna lie or beg  
For your love  
I'm on a natural high  
  
And I don't require no service  
And I'll make sweet love to you  
Every day and night  
I live my life for you  
I'm on a natural high  
  
All I give  
Is all I got  
And all I am  
Ain't what I'm not  
And I ain't gonna lie or beg  
For your love  
I'm on a natural high
