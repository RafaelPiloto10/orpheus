Honestly I'm glad it's snowing  
It helps to keep our friends from knowing  
When they ask me why I'm sad  
It's easy to blame the weather  
  
It's funny how the blinding snow flakes  
Are right in time to hide my heartache  
Let them ask me why I'm sad  
It's easy to blame the weather  
  
When I think of the sun  
It scares me  
I wonder if I will pass  
And springtime, I hear  
Is early this year  
They'll see through me like glass  
  
I see no reason for this weather  
So let me be the first to make up  
If a reason must be had  
It's easy to blame the weather
