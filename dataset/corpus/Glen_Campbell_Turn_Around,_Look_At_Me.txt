There is someone walking behind you,  
Turn around, look at me.  
There is someone watching your footsteps,  
Turn around, look at me  
  
There is someone who really needs you,  
Here's my heart in my hand.  
Turn around, (turn around), look at me, (look at me,)  
Understand,understand,  
  
That there's someone who'll stand beside you.  
Turn around, look at me.  
And there's someone who'll love and guide you.  
Turn around, look at me.  
  
I've waited, but I'll wait forever for you to come to me.  
Look at someone (look at someone)  
Who really loves you, yeah, really loves you.  
Turn around, look at me.
