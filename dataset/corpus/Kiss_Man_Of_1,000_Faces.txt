I walk the streets by day, I never know quite what to say  
It doesn't matter anyway  
Man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, who's the man  
  
For years I've lived inside my dreams  
Somehow I've made them real, it seems  
I made my own rules, because I am a  
  
Man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, who's the man  
  
I can put on any face, you all know me, but it's no disgrace  
The king of night, he understands  
  
Man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, who's the man  
Who's the man of a 1000 faces, who's the man of a 1000 faces  
Who's the man of a 1000 faces, who's the man  
  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
I'm the man of a 1000 faces, I'm the man of a 1000 faces  
I'm the man of a 1000 faces, I'm the man  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man (to fade)
