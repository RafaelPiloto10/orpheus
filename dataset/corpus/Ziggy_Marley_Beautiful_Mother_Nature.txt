Beautiful Mother Nature  
She looked at me with a smile on her face  
Then she started to cry  
She said why did my children forsake me  
  
She felt like she was dying  
Oh ungrateful children  
When she was young she was beautiful and strong  
The more children se had the more things went wrong  
Now she's feeling old and cold  
And her heart doesn't feel love anymore  
  
Beautiful Mother Nature  
She sat me down and told me to sing her a song  
Maybe it would make her feel better  
Maybe her children would sing along  
  
And see the wrong we have done  
Make amends to mend her heart  
She still wouldn't hate none of her children  
No matter what cruel things they've done  
She'll always be there when her babies are crying  
She's a mother a mother you can depend on  
  
Beautiful Mother Nature  
She's hoping her children will love her again  
Like once she remember  
Before skyscrapers and chemical plants  
When she was all that we had  
Before they polluted her sacred land  
Now her tears are falling like acid rain  
And her voice sounds like earthquake  
  
I had to beg her Mother please don't leave  
Give another chance I'll take to the kids  
Beautiful Mother Nature  
She was my  
Beautiful Mother Nature  
Still is my  
Beautiful Mother Nature  
She is my  
Beautiful Mother Nature  
Still is my
