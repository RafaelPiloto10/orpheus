Love we all hope to find  
It'll come so easy or can take its time  
But I've never given up along the way  
  
One day you're gonna raise your blinds  
And every little dew drop is a treasured find, oh my  
When you say the things you have to say  
Wake up and the day is dawning  
It's another chance to change your mind  
Reaching for the stars around you  
I found you  
  
Let somebody know what you really love  
Show somebody just what you're made of  
Always in a rush, don't you see the sign?  
You can always take the time  
(Let somebody know)  
  
Just when you think you got it done  
In just a moment it can turn around, oh my  
When you're wishing for yesterday  
Wake up and the day is dawning  
It's another chance to change your mind  
Reaching for the stars around you  
I found you  
  
Let somebody know what you really love  
Show somebody just what you're made of  
Always in a rush, don't you see the sign?  
You can always take the time  
  
To let somebody know that you really care  
Let somebody see what you have to share  
Oh yeah  
It's a simple thing  
To let somebody know  
  
Always in a rush, don't you see the sign?  
You can always take the time  
Let somebody feel the tears that you cry  
Let them know the love is still alive, oh alive  
It's a simple thing  
  
To let somebody know (somebody)  
Let somebody know (somebody)  
Let somebody know, oh yeah (somebody)  
Somebody baby  
  
Let somebody know, oh yeah (somebody)  
You gotta let somebody know (somebody), somebody  
Let somebody know (somebody)
