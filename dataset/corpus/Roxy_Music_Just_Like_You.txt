Buttercup daisies  
And most anything  
They wither and fade  
After blossom in Spring  
Time conquers innocence  
Pride takes a fall  
In knowledge lies wisdom  
That's all  
  
Everything changes  
Weather blows hot or cold  
Through alchemy iron turns gold  
Quicksilver baby  
So hard to pin down  
Oh when are you coming around?  
Hopelessly grounded  
I walk through the streets  
Remembering how we spent time  
Hopefully yearning that someday we'll meet  
But when will we, how could we, why? Oh my!  
  
Fashion houses ladies  
Need plenty loose change  
When the latest creation  
Is last year's fab-rave  
Thought patterns hazy  
This auto-style age  
Will lady luck smile old and sage?  
She knows that,  
Never again, no, will I give up my heart  
To gamble with fate is my crime  
  
Nevertheless love, it's all here in my book  
I'd write it but don't have much time  
You see, I know it sounds crazy  
But what can I do?  
I've fallen head over heels, over you  
Chameleon color  
  
All phases of moon  
The shifting of planets  
And leopard spots too  
As destiny wills it  
So seasons will change  
Just like you
