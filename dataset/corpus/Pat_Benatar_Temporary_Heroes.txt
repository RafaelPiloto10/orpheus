I've seen all the downfalls  
Temporary Heroes (Whoa)  
Misguided direction  
Longing for perfection (Whoa)  
Love and pain  
Only for the foolish  
Once again  
Try to hide what's there inside  
I'm the same, Temporary Hero  
Who's to blame  
  
Rituals and movements  
Much too soon improvements  
Hide many scars)  
Others and ours  
Too late to discover  
This untainted love is  
Destined to be)  
A sad memory  
  
Love and pain  
Only for the foolish  
Once again  
Try to hide what's there inside  
I'm the same, Temporary Hero  
Who's to blame  
  
So you take your chances  
Watchful of the glances  
But don't turn away  
Though the wounds are healing  
Don't tell me the feelings the same  
  
Love and pain  
Only for the foolish  
Once again  
Try to hide what's there inside  
I'm the same, Temporary Hero  
Who's to blame
