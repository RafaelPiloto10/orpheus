While you were sleeping  
They came and took it all away  
The lanes and the meadows  
The places where you used to play  
  
It was an inside job  
By the well-connected  
Your little protest  
Summarily rejected  
  
It was an inside job  
Like it always is  
Chalk it up to business as usual  
  
While we are dreaming  
This little island disappears  
While you are looking the other way  
They'll take your right to own your own ideas  
  
And it's an inside job  
Favors collected  
Your trusted servants  
Have left you unprotected  
  
It was an inside job  
Like it always is  
Just chalk it up  
To business as usual  
  
You think that you're so smart  
But you don't have a fucking clue  
What those men up in the towers  
Are doing to me and you  
And they'll keep doin' it and doin' it  
And doin' it and doin' it  
And doin' it and doin' it  
And doin' it and doin' it  
Until we all wake up  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up  
  
I know what I've done wrong  
I am acquainted with the night  
I know how hard it is  
To always walk out in the light  
  
And it's an inside job  
To learn about forgiving  
It's an inside job  
To hang on to the joy of living  
  
They know the road by which you came  
They know your mother's maiden name  
And what you had for breakfast  
And what you've hidden in the mattress  
  
Insect politics  
Indifferent universe  
Bang your head against the wall  
But apathy is worse  
  
It's an inside job  
It's an inside job  
It's an inside job  
Yeh, yeah  
  
It's an inside job  
It's an inside job  
It's an inside job  
It's an inside job  
  
It's an inside job  
It's an inside job
