I know that I'm no saint.  
My head is in the clouds.  
They called you a mistake,  
But I still, I still say your name out loud.  
  
They called me a stupid girl,  
Just like my mom.  
Too many men passed through my arms.  
At seventeen I looked into your eyes,  
Knew I could never comfort your cries.  
Every April still reminds me of you.  
The child I never knew.  
My lullaby in blue.  
  
It all goes by so fast.  
How lovely you must be.  
Why you've reached the age at last  
That I was when your daddy lived with me.  
  
How I wish we could meet somewhere,  
Talk it through.  
There is so much I would say to you.  
There are others, I'm not alone.  
A younger brother you've never known,  
And a baby girl who so reminds me of you.  
The child I never knew.  
My lullaby in blue.  
  
As the years go by,  
Try not to think of us sadly.  
Believe it if you can,  
I want to see you so badly.  
On your birthday, Mama's thinking of you.  
The child I never knew.  
My lullaby in blue.  
My lullaby in blue.  
My lullaby
