In every corner of my memory  
There's no place you wouldn't be  
If anything, I wish I had  
Another dream with you  
Life was forever yesterday  
Nothing in the world could take  
Your love away, will I ever know  
That time will ease the pain  
For me someday  
  
She said I won't leave you, ever  
Just love me forever  
She said you can leave, but never  
Walk away  
  
Lights reflecting in the evening sun  
Back to the place where we were one  
Soul mates forever about to chase  
Rainbows in the dark  
Another day to destiny  
Come on and set me free  
When I close my eyes, I see your smile  
As I walk in the pouring rain  
I call your name  
  
She said I won't leave you, ever  
Just love me forever  
She said, we will be together, someday  
She said I won't leave you, ever  
Just love me forever  
She said, you can leave, but never  
Walk away  
  
I can see a million faces  
When I take a walk outside  
But I just never knew  
That I could go a million places  
And I'd see always, only you  
  
The loneliness crawls up on me  
Without you there's no me  
At any time or any place  
But time will ease the pain  
For me someday  
  
She said I won't leave you, ever  
Just love me forever  
She said, we will be together, someday  
She said, I will wait forever  
I won't leave you ever  
She said, you can leave, but never  
Ever walk away  
  
Don't walk away  
Oh no don't walk away  
I'll be waiting, always  
Until you'll wake up from this dream  
Someday
