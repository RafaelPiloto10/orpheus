Oooohh oooohhh  
  
  
Momma take this badge off of me  
I can't use it anymore  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Chorus:  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
  
  
Momma put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore  
That long black cloud is coming down  
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Chorus:  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
(yaaa yaaa)  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
  
  
Ooooooooooooohhhhhh
