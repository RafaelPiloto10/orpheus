You can always trust your inner feelings  
'Cause they always tell the truth  
Where did it get you, then your analyzing  
Just do what feels right for you

Throw your dice take your chance  
You will see it from the different angle  
And you too can join the dance

Don't you know it could come true

To open up your life for you

Make your choice don't be blind  
Open up your mind and don't be trivial  
There's a whole new world to find
