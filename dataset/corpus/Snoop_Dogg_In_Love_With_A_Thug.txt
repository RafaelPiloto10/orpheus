[Snoop Dogg]  
Yeah, this shit right here sound like a love song  
(she was in love)  
A gangsta love song, you feel me? Check it out  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
  
Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!  
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty  
Black female with chips, from the city?  
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends  
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends  
Good girl, why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)  
When I was a kid, growing up, I never had toys  
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)  
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up  
Shit, she'd take a nigga out  
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look  
Baby was my thing, nah, she was my low-low  
Bought my first Rolo, and then we took a photo together  
Man I hope this thing last forever  
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet  
She loving a nigga, steady buying me shit  
And don't say shit when I dip with my click  
And understand, when I'm down and out  
May need some help with some chips  
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't  
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk  
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world  
Buying me house shoes and khaki blues, California curls  
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me  
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie  
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug  
In love with a thug  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do  
I caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew  
That I gotta do and I'ma miss you Boo  
But I'ma write you every night and call you on the phone too  
What you gon' do? "You know I'm goin' stay true  
But I'ma go ahead to college like my father want me to"  
Well um, off to my cell with ya body on my mind  
And I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time  
I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short  
On another phone line, holla'n at my other hoe  
This bitch ain't saying shit, cause the bitch ain't shit  
Old fat gold-digging-ass county check receiving bitch  
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap  
Niggas watching Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)  
Never caught slipping, always on strap  
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfucking getback  
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby  
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy  
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college  
She getting a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge  
Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays  
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways  
She fell in love with the local G  
And now they both in the penitentiary, she didn't mention me  
  
[Chorus: x2]
