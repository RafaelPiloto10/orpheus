Everybody wants one  
Everybody's got one  
Everybody  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Everybody wants one  
Everybody's got one  
Everybody  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Is it you who's going to guide me  
Through this labyrinth of poems  
Is it you that's going to make me  
Gonna make me feel home  
And every time we live together  
We just die a bit more  
So why don't we just stop  
Oh let's just stop to adore  
Why  
Is it so hard  
To make the right choice
