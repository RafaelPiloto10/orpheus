And the meek shall inherit the earth...  
  
We've taken care of everything  
The words you read, the songs you sing  
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes  
It's one for all, all for one  
We work together, common sons  
Never need to wonder how or why  
  
We are the priests  
Of the Temples of Syrinx  
Our great computers  
Fill the hallowed halls  
We are the priests  
Of the Temples of Syrinx  
All the gifts of life  
Are held within our walls  
  
Look around this world we made  
Equality of stock in trade  
Come and join the brotherhood of man  
Oh what a nice contented world  
Let the banners be unfurled  
Hold the red star proudly high in hand  
  
We are the priests  
Of the Temples of Syrinx  
Our great computers  
Fill the hallowed halls  
We are the priests  
Of the Temples of Syrinx  
All the gifts of life  
Are held within our walls
