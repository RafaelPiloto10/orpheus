You're still the best per-erson  
I ever knew  
There were a thousand little things that I was always  
Just about to say to you  
But the now time, it grows shorter  
For the speeches  
Just let me leave you with the line  
It might help you pass the time  
Someti-ime  
  
You might as we-ell smile  
Ain't no tears gonna drown the rain  
Keeps on fallin'  
You might as we-ell smile  
Ain't no pain gonna change what still remai-ains  
You might as well regain, babe  
You're lost serenity, serenity  
And shine it on me  
Shine it on me-ee-ee  
  
I remember times when you he-eld me  
You'd free-eeze my spine  
We were lookin' in the mirror at the time  
I got confused and I thought your eyes were mine  
But now the time, it grows shorter  
For the secrets  
Just let me leave you with some truth  
Might help you hold on  
To your jewels sometimes  
  
You might as we-ell smile  
Ain't no tears gonna drown the rain  
Keeps on fallin'  
You might as we-ell smile  
  
Ain't no pain gonna change what still remai-ains  
You might as well maintain, babe  
Protect your sanity, your sanity-why  
And it shine it on me  
  
Shine it on me-ee-ee  
Shine it on me-ee-ee-ee  
Shine it o-on me...
