When the deal goin' down and you gonna take your chance  
There's always just a mystery that locks you in a trance  
No matter what the future brings you're booked, and lawd you're bound  
Be steppin' softly when you know the deal is goin' down  
When the deal go down and the noose is bein' tied  
ain't no gettin' round it, fade back and let it lie  
No matter what the future brings you're booked, and lawd you're bound  
Be steppin' softly when you know the deal is goin' down  
No matter what the future brings you're booked, and lawd you're bound  
Be steppin' softly when you know  
No matter what the future brings you're booked, and lawd you're bound  
Be steppin' softly when you know the deal is goin' down  
Goin' down  
Down, down  
I'm going down
