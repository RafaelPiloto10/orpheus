[Verse 1]  
You got in so late, it's Sunday morning  
Said that you were leaving, letting go of us  
Where did we go wrong?  
And now you say you're leaving California  
Gotta head back east and wanna leave tonight  
Pack your things and go  
  
[Pre-hook]  
But if you run away  
I won't be alright  
  
[Hook]  
Even if the sun crashes into us  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
[Verse 2]  
Pick up all the pieces, fight to hold on  
Put them back together, do it all for love  
Never let it go  
Cause I don't need a reason just to hold ya  
Wipe all of your tears and look you in the eyes  
Baby please don't go  
  
[Pre-hook]  
But if you run away  
I won't be alright  
  
[Hook]  
Even if the sun crashes into us  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
[Outro]  
Now you say you're leaving California
