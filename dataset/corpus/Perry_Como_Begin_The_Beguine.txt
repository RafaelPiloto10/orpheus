When they begin the beguine  
It brings back the sound of music so tender  
It brings back the night of tropical splendor  
It brings back a memory evergreen!  
  
I'm with you once more under the stars  
And down by the shore an orchestra's playin'  
Even the palms seems to be swayin'  
When they begin the beguine!  
  
To live it again is past all endeavor  
Except when that tune clutches my heart  
And there we are swearin' to love forever  
And promising never, never to part!  
  
What moments divine, what raptures serene  
'Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted...  
Now, when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted  
I know but too well what they mean!  
  
So, don't let them begin the beguine  
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember...  
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember  
When they begin the beguine!  
  
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play!  
'Till the stars that were there before return above you  
'Till you whisper to me once more, "Darling, I love you!"  
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in  
When they begin the beguine!  
When they begin, the beguine!
