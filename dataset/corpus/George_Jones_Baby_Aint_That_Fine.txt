I'm gonna be your baby  
And I'm gonna be your guy  
We're gonna cook some lovin'  
It's gonna sizzle and fry  
Baby, ain't that fine  
Baby, ain't that fine?  
  
I'm gonna give you lovin'  
And I'll say take your time  
We'll be rockin' and swingin'  
Higher than a Georgia pine  
Baby, ain't that fine  
Baby, ain't that fine?  
  
I get a little bitty tingle  
Up and down my spine  
My head gets dizzy  
Every time you say you're mine.  
  
The birds are gonna be singin',  
The bells are gonna chime  
We're gonna love each other  
And the sun is gonna shine  
Baby, ain't that fine  
Baby, ain't that fine?  
  
I get a little bitty tingle  
Up and down my spine  
My head gets dizzy  
Every time you say you're mine.  
  
The birds are gonna be singin',  
The bells are gonna chime  
We're gonna love each other  
And the sun is gonna shine  
Baby, ain't that fine  
Baby, ain't that fine?  
  
Baby, ain't that fine.  
Baby, ain't that fine?
