Exotic cars scream down the sunset of dreams  
On a hot sunny afternoon  
I'm in a hot dog stand  
With a strange love holding my hand  
And we're both playin' it real cool  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's the summer of love  
It's the summer of love, baby  
It's the summer of love  
Leastways, I'm hopin' it is  
  
So we talk about her favorite movie star or something  
She says, "Ya know, I've never done this before" (Yeah, sure)  
"I know it sounds strange, but I can't remember your name  
But I remember last night on the floor"  
And we both laughed like she told a joke or something  
She takes her neckerchief off and wraps it around my head  
And says, "Hey, you"  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
So we both walk along alone  
She says, "Hey, Mister, you sure make a strange kind of lover"  
And I say "yeah"  
I say "yeah"  
  
[Chorus:]  
Leastways, I'm thinkin' it just might be
