[Verse 1]  
Donely float got in the way  
You are the feel, and knew it anyway  
Take a chance, it wasn't what you know  
Take my hand, and don't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, ooh ooh  
You can do it,  
Don't break  
Yeah, you'll pull through it,  
You're safe!  
Yes, you can do it  
Don't break  
Yeah, you'll pull through it,  
You're safe  
  
[Verse 2]  
Tell her on how you feel,  
Give her every say she needs to hear  
Give your heart, and say come take it  
And she will see you're a good man  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, ooh ooh  
You can do it,  
Don't break  
Yeah, you'll pull through it,  
You're safe!  
Yes, you can do it  
Don't break  
Yeah, you'll pull through it,  
You're safe  
  
Yes, you can do it,  
Don't break  
Yeah, you'll pull through it,  
You're safe!
