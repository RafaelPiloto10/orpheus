Seen the troubles and the evils of this world  
I've seen the stretches between godliness and sin  
I've had the promise and confessions of true faith  
And the hypocrisy that always lies within  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
  
I've seen the products and the other world of waste  
I've seen the colour of corruption deep within  
I've seen them lose themselves in dignity and taste  
To see in black and white and through to black again  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
And they left it for you, everything for you  
I've seen the troubles and the evils of this world  
I've seen the ones who can succeed but always lose  
I've seen what's left of poor technology and work  
And watched them dying as they leave their ship of fools  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
And they left it for you, all of this for you
