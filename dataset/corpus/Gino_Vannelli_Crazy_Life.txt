It's a crazy life a hazy life  
A mixed up jumbled phasy life  
A crazy life for people who want to smile  
I just don't understand  
Why so hard to say hello before goodbye  
  
It's a coocoo life a lulu life  
A moody magic voodoo life  
A coocoo life for people who want to love  
I just don't understand why so green  
That it's been hang ups day to day  
I gotta pack up get away  
  
Cause it's a crazy life  
Yes it's a crazy life  
Crazy life  
  
It's a stupid life elusive life  
A lonely stuck secluded life  
A stupid life for people who want to fly too high  
I just don't understand why so blue  
What to do  
I'm gonna kiss my sky goodbye  
I'm gonna jump way down and die  
  
Cause it's a crazy life  
Yes it's a crazy life  
Crazy life
