We were so in love the day love started  
Who would think that we would soon be parted?  
I just can't believe it's true  
I make this appeal to you  
  
Can't we talk it over? Let's talk it over  
Before you tell me you're through  
Can't we sit together and figure whether  
This is the right thing to do  
  
I hate the thought of spending nights all alone  
Missing the thrill of nights that we've known  
Can't we talk it over before it's over  
Before you whisper goodbye forever, let's talk it over, dear  
  
I hate the thought of spending nights all alone
