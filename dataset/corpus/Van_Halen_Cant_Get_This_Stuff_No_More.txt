Got me a date with a supermodel. Ha ha ha  
I know, I know I figured "Fuck it"  
Dinner at the hotel, champagne bottle  
Steak and potatoes, a feather in a bucket  
  
Tell me what is it we're pretendin'?  
Not to know, and who needs proof?  
I don't need so much to remember  
No, no. That's how it is, when you tell the truth  
Woo!  
  
How many times does somebody lie  
'Til patience (Ahh-ahh-ahh) runs her course?  
Keep that in mind, when we say goodbye  
'Cuz you can't (Ahh-ahh-ahh) get this stuff no more  
  
That's the thing about self-improvement  
Don't get me wrong, I plan on gettin' some soon  
Outside the wire somethin's movin'  
The barn burnt down now I can see the moon  
  
A slice at a time, like a pizza pie  
You (Ahh-ahh-ahh) serve up the truth, don't want it anymore  
Keep that in mind, when we say goodbye  
'Cuz you can't (Ahh-ahh-ahh) get this stuff no more  
  
Woo!  
  
How many times does somebody lie  
'Fore (Ahh-ahh-ahh) patience runs her course?  
Keep that in mind when we say goodbye  
'Cuz you can't (Ahh-ahh-ahh) get this stuff no more  
  
(A slice at a time) Wha-oh yeah!  
  
Wha-oh! (Ahh-ahh-ahh) Can't get that stuff no more!  
Better keep that in mind! (Keep it in mind)  
When we say our goodbyes  
'Cuz you can't get this stuff no more-ah!  
  
Not this stuff baby
