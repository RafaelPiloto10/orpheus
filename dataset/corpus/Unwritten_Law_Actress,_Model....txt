Dear Mom  
I'm dating an actress  
And I'm just writing to let you know  
Why I'm so far from home  
  
I followed her to Stella Adler  
A method man was what she was after  
She musta seen them on TV  
  
Chorus:  
She's my  
Actress, model, dancer, whatever  
I've been watching you  
I've been wanting you  
Actress, model, dancer, whatever  
You're so over there  
You're so everywhere  
  
I met her over a cigarette  
And though I don't really know her yet  
I could see  
She sees something in me  
  
A thousand bucks won't pay the rent  
And I know where the money's spent  
But it shows, Lord  
'cause nothing's free  
  
Chorus  
  
She made a promise  
She'd never act with me now  
But I saw her move her lips  
They were reading scripts  
  
She made a promise  
She'd never act with me now  
And I saw her move her lips  
Line please  
Line please  
  
Dear Mom  
I'm dating an actress  
And I'm just writing to let you know  
Who...who  
  
Chorus  
  
Dear Mom  
I'm dating an actress  
Dear Mom  
I'm dating an actress  
Now, I'm an actor, too
