[Kanye West]  
Mr. West is in the buildin  
Swagga on a hundred thousand trillion  
Ay yo, I know I got it first  
I'm Christopher Columbus and y'all just the pilgrims  
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?  
[?] I pass the dressing  
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent  
So I guess we should address it huh?  
My swagga is Mcjagga  
Every time I breathe on the track, I asthma attack it  
Why he so mad for? Why he gotta have it?  
Cuz I slave my whole life, now I'm the master  
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa!  
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine?  
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa!  
Tryna get that koby number, one over jordon  
  
[Jay-Z]  
Gotta bop like this  
Can't wear skinny jeans  
Cuz my knots don't fit  
No one on the corner  
Gotta pocket like this  
So I rock Roc jeans  
Cuz my knots so thick  
You can learn how to dress  
Just by  
Jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Follow my steps  
It's the road to success  
Where the niggas think you thorough  
And the girls say yes  
But I can't teach you my swag  
You can pay for school  
But you can't buy class  
School of hard knocks  
I'm a grad  
All blue Yankee  
Is my graduation cap  
Hoooooooovvvvaaa  
Dipping different rovas [?]  
Wipping with the soda [?]  
Hoooooooovvvvaaa  
Could you even have any doubt  
After doutbt it was ova.  
  
[Lil' Wayne]  
No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Chuch!  
But I'm too clean for these boys  
I require what I desire  
I got stripes Adidas  
Mami scream papi no mas  
Run up in yo shit just me no moss  
Runnin this shit like I got four thighs  
No one has swagger like these 4 guys  
When it comes to styles I got several  
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal  
And my Ju-elz blue and yellow  
Type of shit that make em call you Carmelo  
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto  
Write yo name on the bullet make you feel special  
Ha! What the fuck you boys talking about?  
I know it's us cuz we the only thing you talk about!  
And I'm gone.. Bye  
  
[T. I.]  
You go see weezy for the wordplay,  
Jeezy for the bird play,  
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,  
All my verses picture perfect  
And they meant to serve a purpose,  
You aint living what you kicking and you worthless,  
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous,  
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,  
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, last thing I'm worried bout is
what another rapper do,  
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off blast off and have
outstanding qualities,  
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that,  
But spitting real life on hot beats... I'm the truth at,  
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary,  
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary,  
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad  
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag!
