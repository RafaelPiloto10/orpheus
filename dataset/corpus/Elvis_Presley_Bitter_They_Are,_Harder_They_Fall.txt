I told her to leave me alone  
That's what she's done, just what she's done  
And a house built for two, ain't a home  
When it's lived in by one, one lonely one  
  
And I can no longer hear footsteps, come right down the hall  
Here come the teardrops, bitter they are, harder they fall  
She caught me lying, then she caught a train  
And I caught a fever walking home in the rain  
Oh yeah!  
  
But it's over and I'm done  
She left me once and for all  
Here come the teardrops, bitter they are, harder they fall  
Here come the teardrops, bitter they are, harder they fall
