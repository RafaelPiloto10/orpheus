You keep on pushing, babe,  
Like I've never known before  
You know you drive me crazy, child,  
An' I just want to see you on the floor  
I want to superstitious woman  
An' she got a superstitious mind  
  
I can't see you, baby,  
I can't see you anymore, no more  
You keep on loving me  
Like I've never known before  
I want to superstitious woman  
With a superstitious, a superstitious mind, an' I don't mind, baby  
  
My heart is beating faster, babe,  
It's beating like a big bass drum  
You know you got me speeding, child,  
Faster than a bullet from a gun  
You're a superstitious woman  
An' I got a superstitious mind, an' I don't care  
  
So take me down slow an' easy,  
Make love to me slow an' easy  
I know that hard luck an' trouble  
Is coming my way,  
So rock me 'til I'm burned to the bone,  
Rock me 'til I'm burned to the bone  
  
I don't care about, oh,  
I don't care about love, no more  
The way you keep abusing me  
Oh, I can't take no more  
I want to woman  
She got a superstitious mind  
  
So take me down slow an' easy,  
Make love to me slow an' easy  
I know that hard luck an' trouble  
Is coming my way,  
So rock me 'til I'm burned to the bone,  
Rock me 'til I'm burned to the bone,  
Rock me 'til I'm burned  
  
So take me down slow an' easy,  
Make love to me slow an' easy  
Take me down slow an' easy,  
Rock me 'til I'm burned to the bone  
  
Take me down slow an' easy,  
Make love to me slow an' easy  
I know that hard luck an' trouble  
Is coming my way,  
So rock me 'til I'm burned to the bone.
