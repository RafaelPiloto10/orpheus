Two dollar tips and the lipstick cigarettes  
Get yourself a job with your fingertips  
Too many tickets for the backseat matinee  
Two hours later and you're looking for another face  
Don't ask for love  
Don't ask for pity  
Don't ask for me  
Welcome to the city  
  
Four hundred dollars bus a room in the city  
With a whole lot of people and a hole in the ceiling  
Freeze in the winter, die in the summer  
Seventeen kids next door without a mother  
Hey, if you see me coming up the stairs  
Please don't confuse me with someone who cares  
  
Welcome to the city, I'm glad you made it, baby  
I'm really  
  
You got some letter, it's a recommendation  
Your best friend's ex sent a copy to the station  
And he knows some agent through a distant relation  
An inside connection with a map and directions  
Ah, too bad you came  
Too bad you waited  
Too bad for you  
You're over-educated  
  
Welcome to the city, I'm glad you made it, baby  
I'm really glad  
  
Don't ask for love  
Don't ask for pity  
Don't ask for me  
Welcome to the city
