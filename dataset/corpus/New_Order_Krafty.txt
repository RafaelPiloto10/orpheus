Some people get up at the break of day  
Gotta go to work before it gets too late  
Sitting in a car and driving down the road  
It ain't the way it has to be  
  
But that's what you do to earn your daily wage  
That's the kind of world that we live in today  
Isn't where you want to be  
And isn't what you want to be  
  
Give me one more day (one more day)  
Give me another night (just another night)  
I need a second chance (second chance)  
This time I'll get it right (This time I'll get it right)  
  
I'll say one last time (one last time)  
I've got to let you know (I've got to let you know)  
I've got to change your mind (I've got to change your mind)  
I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)  
  
You've got to look at life the way it oughta be  
Looking at the stars from underneath the tree  
There's a world inside and a world out there  
With that TV you just don't care  
  
They've got violence, wars and killing too  
All shrunk down in a two-foot tube  
But out there the world is a beautiful place  
With mountains, lakes and the human race  
This is where I want to be  
And this is what I want to do  
  
Give me one more day (one more day)  
Give me another night (just another night)  
I need a second chance (second chance)  
This time I'll get it right (This time I'll get it right)  
  
I'll say one last time (one last time)  
I've got to let you know (I've got to let you know)  
I've got to change your mind (I've got to change your mind)  
I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)  
  
Just give me one more chance (one more chance)  
Give me another night (just another night)  
With just one more day (one more day)  
You know I'll get it right (You know I'll get it right)  
  
I'll say one last time (one last time)  
I've got to let you know (I've got to let you know)  
If I could change your mind (If I could change your mind)  
I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)
