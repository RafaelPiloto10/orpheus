As I was walking down the street one day  
A man came up to me and asked me what the time was that was  
On my watch, yeah  
And I said  
Does anybody really know what time it is  
I don't  
Does anybody really care  
Care  
If so I can't imagine why  
About time  
We've all got time enough to cry  
Oh no, no  
  
And I was walking down the street one day  
A pretty lady looked at me and said her diamond watch had  
Stopped cold dead  
And I said  
Does anybody really know what time it is  
I don't  
Does anybody really care  
Care  
If so I can't imagine why  
About time  
We've all got time enough to cry  
Oh no, no  
  
And I was walking down the street one day  
Being pushed and shoved by people trying to beat the clock,  
Oh, so I just don't know,  
I just don't know  
And I said, yes I said  
  
People runnin' everywhere  
Don't know the way to go  
Don't know where I am  
Can't see past the next step  
Don't have to think past the last mile  
Have no time to look around  
Just run around, run around and think why  
  
Does anybody really know what time it is  
I don't  
Does anybody really care  
Care  
If so I can't imagine why  
About time  
We've all got time enough to die  
Oh no, no
