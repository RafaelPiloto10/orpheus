In a messed up world  
Filled with mixed up people  
Searching for a happy time  
It makes me feel so good  
Just to have a situation  
Where you love me and I know that I'm...  
  
Chorus:  
I'm so satisfied  
I'm so satisfied  
Man don't you understand your love  
Made me smile again  
And I'm so satisfied  
  
Oh there are those who want the world  
While those who have it want to throw it away  
But of all the things there are, love's the most important  
So believe me baby when I say  
  
Chorus:  
I'm so satisfied  
I'm so satisfied  
Man don't you understand your love  
Made me smile again  
And I'm so satisfied
