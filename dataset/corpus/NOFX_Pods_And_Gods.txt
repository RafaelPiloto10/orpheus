Martian men are coming to Earth  
They're abducting all of the jerks  
Martian men are coming to Earth  
Martian men don't take me  
  
Pods are landing from outer space  
Pods are duplicating my face  
Pods are landing from outer space  
Pod thing leave me alone  
  
I don't know what conventions you go to  
I don't know what movies you've seen  
I don't want to hear explanations  
For unexplainable things  
  
It's not I don't believe in aliens  
It's just I really don't care  
I wouldn't mind some interplanetary friends  
Until they come and hang in my own atmosphere  
  
Holy ghost is coming to Earth  
Saving souls of all of the jerks  
The holy ghost is coming to Earth  
Savior men don't take me  
  
The number one son is flipping the tab  
Paying for sins and fun we all had  
The number one son is flipping the bill  
Let me chip in for the tip  
  
I don't understand why you beg for forgiveness  
Just before you do it again  
Is it more altruistic to worship  
Or actually help fellow man  
  
It's not I don't believe in Jesus Christ  
It's just I care about other things  
The world could certainly use some miracles  
Until then I'll put my faith in human beings
