Yeah this one goes out to all the ladies in the house  
  
I need two to stand by me when the chips are down and  
Stick around while I defend my crown and  
No sell-out, the chip is too rough and  
I'll blow your skin to sofa, leave your mind to be tough  
And I might seem rough but life is much rougher  
To see success sometimes you gotta suffer  
I need a woman that's stronger than material needs  
And isn't motivated by green  
Dry my tear-drops and feelin' my pain and  
Watchin' my back while I strive to maintain and  
Makin' love like a medicine doctor  
I knew that she was bad from the day that I clocked her  
  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
  
My enemies come and my break-bread's tough but  
You recognize game from your eyes and walkin'  
Baby ain't no way I'll let the vultures attack you  
So I'll teach you the game and tell you how to react to  
The conversation, sexy vibration  
Visual stimulation, slick persuasion  
Times are hard, I need a woman that rolls by God  
And the only man she loves is Todd  
But will you be around when the raindrops fallin'  
Or could it be you never loved me at all and  
I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent  
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement  
The reap reducer factor and  
The Queen of the Universe, not an actor and  
Standin' by her man till the end  
Not only as a lover but a friend  
  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby (yeah)  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
  
Man, do things get better?  
We can look back at the whole aerators  
Remember the times when they said I couldn't do it  
But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it and  
You held back when your loved jobs called in  
You had faith when they said they're not callin'  
You understood that what we had was good  
You stood by your man like a real queen should  
That's why now I got you livin' your dream as  
A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and  
As long as I live on this earth  
Anything you want is what your loyalty's worth  
  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
(I wanna send this one out to all the ladies in the house)  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your man  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby, (word)  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your man (peace)  
You got to stand by your baby  
You got to stand by your man  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your man  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
You got to stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your man
