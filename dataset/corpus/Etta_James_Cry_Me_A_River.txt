Now you say you love me  
But you cry the whole night through  
You can cry me a river  
Oh yes you're goin' to cry me a river  
'Cause I cried a river over you  
  
Now you say you're sorry for being so untrue  
You may cry a river  
You may cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
Yes I did child, yes I did my child  
  
You drove me nearly out of my head  
You stood by and never shed a tear  
But I remember every word that was said  
Oh yes, I remember, never fear  
  
You may cry me a river, c'mon now  
Cry me a river  
You may cry me a river  
I cried a river for you (Oh how I cried)  
  
You nearly drove me out of my own sweethead  
You stood by, you never shed a tear for me.  
I remember every crual word, everything that was said  
Yes I remember, never you fear  
  
You may cry me a river  
I cried a river for you  
Yes I cried a river for you  
  
Turn back the tide of life, I cried, salty water runnin' down  
I cried I love you  
I cried I love you  
I cried, I cried  
  
You may cry, oh, she may cry now, a river of tears  
A river of tears for you  
You may cry now, she may cry, oh, she may cry now  
You may cry, oh, she may cry now a river of tears  
A river of tears for you  
  
I cry you can cry me a river  
Lord loves a cheerful giver  
C'mon and cry me a river of tears  
C'mon now and cry me a river of tears  
C'mon now and cry me a river of tears  
C'mon now, c'mon down and cry me a river
