Should have never crossed your path  
Funny things you want the most  
Should soon be taken back  
Slap my own hands like a child  
Stealing from the candy store  
I think I've taken to your smile  
  
And I hunger for your laugh  
Do the craziest things like look around  
When I know youre nowhere near me  
Break my back on a song  
Though I know youre not there to hear  
  
Unanswered questions lying on the coffee table  
From a song I haven't finished since last summer  
Cause I never could decide how much was gin  
How much the sea  
Or other incidentals clouding what was really me  
  
Everything I am is bare feet and burning sand  
Waiting for the calm cool hand of the sea  
  
A madman of emotions waiting for the drug effect  
Of the reason and the intellect to comfort me  
  
Half the time I love you like you love the falls first breeze  
Then you seem as distant as the skeletons of trees  
Far away outside my window  
Where inside I think of you  
As if I thought hard enough Id know which way to turn  
And what to do  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
I'm quite sure Ill be alright  
We all live with some distraction  
Its just too bad  
Mine will hang around all day and night  
Like an uninvited guest  
You can't turn away try hard as you might  
Lord knows I've tried  
  
I might let it go and take a long long run  
Quit my job and join the coastline baking in the sun  
Then again I might just make big plans  
And leave them on the table  
Like the song I left unfinished  
And the words I am unable  
I will always be unable to express  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh
