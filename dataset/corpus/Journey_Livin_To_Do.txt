A message comes down... It's a warning  
It's not your time, oh no it ain't but it's coming  
Now what makes us think, we're here forever  
When life is gone, life is gone, before you know it's over  
  
A church in the rain...a sad congregation  
An old friend I knew  
When I look at the end...I understand now  
I got livin' to do...there's still livin' to do  
  
With every breath, comes deeper meaning  
I don't want to waste, I don't want to waste, one single minute  
Tears fall from the sky, angles are cryin'  
They cry for those...who don't know that they're dyin'  
  
I wait for the sun...a chance at a new day  
There's no time to lose  
When I look at the end...I understand now  
I got lovin' to do...there's still lovin' to do  
When I look at the end...I understand now  
I got lovin' to do...  
Whoa...  
There's still livin' to do
