Well stop look and listen there are ants that are gathered here  
With my hands raised to speak but you all won't hear no you all won't hear we
all won't hear  
Let me in your living door let me in knock knock I said is there  
Well it's me they're reaching in and I'm coming after you I'm coming after you
coming after you  
Well I'm tired yes I'm weary from my long journey but I'm not yet all ready to
rest  
For you can come along with me we go searching for rest yes  
Come on and search with me oh search with me woah search with me  
Come on and search with me wo woah come on and search with me aah
