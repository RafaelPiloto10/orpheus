I'm lost and confused  
I'm stuck in your favorite parade  
I'm choking, I feel strangled  
I can't get a feeling  
Is this a game?  
I'm begging  
But you won't please me  
How come I bleed for this illusion  
I've been falling for so long now  
Will I ever see that this isn't real?  
  
Then it all comes into the frame  
The struggle it just isn't worth it  
We think we are the originality  
We overdo it and become just the same  
  
I'm waiting for a break  
So for it seemed to be out of reach  
  
But today I'm god like  
Stay away cause its my time to play  
The revenge feel my wrath  
Stay away because I'm back  
I'll join the elite
