Well I thought I'd seen it all  
From beginning to the end  
Yeah I was the great pretender  
Always alone again  
  
Well a light came shining in  
When you took my breath away  
Now I know I've waited all my life  
To do what I feel today  
  
So tell me I'm dreaming  
(Oh whoa)  
'cause I can't hold back these tears I cry  
And you never looked more beautiful tonight  
(Oh whoa)  
So if I'm dreaming  
(Oh whoa)  
Don't wake me up I'm so alive  
Wish you could see what I see  
Through these eyes of mine  
  
Now we're standing face to face  
I can hear the words we're saying  
This is now and will be forever  
In this moment we could stay  
  
So tell me I'm dreaming  
(Oh whoa)  
'cause I can't hold back these tears I cry  
And you never looked more beautiful tonight  
(Oh whoa)  
So if I'm dreaming  
(Oh whoa)  
  
Don't wake me up I'm so alive  
Wish you could see what I see  
Through these eyes of mine  
  
Whoa whoa oh  
  
So don't wake me up  
Don't let me down  
My heart beats for love  
And love lifts me higher  
Right into the clouds  
I'm flying so high  
With tears in my eyes  
And I have never, ever felt this alive  
  
So tell me I'm dreaming  
(Oh whoa)  
'cause I can't hold back these tears I cry  
And you never looked more beautiful tonight  
(Oh whoa)  
So if I'm dreaming  
(Oh whoa)  
Don't wake me up I'm so alive  
Wish you could see what I see  
Through these eyes of mine  
  
So don't wake me up  
Don't let me down  
My heart beats for love  
And love lifts me higher  
Right into the clouds  
I'm flying so high  
With tears in my eyes  
And I have never, ever felt so alive
