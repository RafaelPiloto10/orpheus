I'll drive around with the trunk tied down  
With a bungee cord  
Because I hoped a curb and backed into her  
New boyfriends Ford  
  
And down the hall  
There's a hole in the wall that's hard to miss  
It's about the size and shape of  
my right busted fist  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything I own has got a dent  
It's cracked or scratched or rip or torn  
Banged up or slightly bent  
Why should my heart be any different  
Everything that I own has got a dent  
  
She used to say I'm a man that's way to hard on stuff  
She let me know, that, that also goes for our love  
I guess her hearts like that old dead gold fish that I forgot to feed  
And mind like that dirt bike that I wrapped around that tree  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Inside, hole in the back  
Big piece of junk, ready for the trash  
Better days gone  
Heart just keeps on beating anyways  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't find one thing that don't  
Everything that I own has got a dent  
Big old dent
