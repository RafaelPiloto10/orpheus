Stop me, oh, stop me  
Stop me if you think that you've  
Heard this one before  
Stop me, oh, stop me  
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before  
  
Nothing's changed  
I still love you, oh, I still love you  
... Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love  
  
I was delayed, I was way-laid  
An emergency stop  
I smelt the last ten seconds of life  
I crashed down on the crossbar  
And the pain was enough to make  
A shy, bald, buddhist reflect  
And plan a mass murder  
Who said lied I'd to her?  
  
Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never!  
Who said I'd lied because I never?  
I was detained, I was restrained  
And broke my spleen  
And broke my knee  
(And then he really layed into me)  
Friday night in out-patients  
Who said I'd lied to her?  
  
Oh, who said I'd lied? - Because I never, I never  
Who said I'd lied? - Because I never  
  
Oh, so I drank one  
It became four  
And when I fell on the floor...  
... I drank more  
  
Stop me, oh, stop me  
Stop me if you think that you've  
Heard this one before  
Stop me, oh, stop me  
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before  
  
Nothing's changed  
I still love you, oh, I still love you  
... Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love
