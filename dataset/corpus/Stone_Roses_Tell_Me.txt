You can't tell me  
You can't tell me  
You can't tell me anything  
I love only me  
I love only me  
I've got the answer to everything  
  
There's only me  
to suggest what I do  
I am the garage flower  
I don't need to stare  
'Cause I know everywhere  
Well there's a place for me anywhere  
  
Tell me tell me  
You tell me anything  
You can't tell  
You won't tell  
Me anything  
Anything  
  
I love only me  
I love only me  
I've got the answers to everything  
I don't need to stare  
'Cause I know everywhere  
Well there's a place for me anywhere  
  
Tell me tell me  
You tell me anything  
Tell me tell me  
You can't tell us anything  
You can't tell  
You won't tell  
Me anything  
Anything  
You can't  
  
I am the garage flower  
I am the garage flower
