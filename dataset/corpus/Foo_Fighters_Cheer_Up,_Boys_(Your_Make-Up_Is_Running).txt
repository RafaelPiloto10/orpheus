It was meant to be  
But all along it never meant a thing  
Never stopped to ask you why  
You didn't pass me by  
Did you see me in your life  
Flash before your eyes  
Was it just that I wasn't hard enough  
Hard enough for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Stop using my  
Confusion  
Wait, wait  
There's a world out there  
Don't you deny me  
Give me one last wish  
There's a world out there  
  
Elementary  
I solved them all  
All your mysteries  
Settle down and in good time  
We can solve all mine  
Tell me lies or tell me when  
Tear me up again  
And I will let you know  
When I've had enough  
Had enough of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know you've got your reasons  
Hey let's call it even  
Turn out all the lights and go to bed  
Still I get this feeling  
No one will believe me  
When I let these ghosts outside my head  
  
There's a world out there  
Don't you deny me  
Give me one last wish  
Don't you deny me  
  
There's a world out there  
Don't you deny me  
Give me one last wish  
There's a world out there
