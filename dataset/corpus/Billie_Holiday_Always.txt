I'll be loving you always  
With a love that's true always  
When the things you plan  
Need a helping hand will understand  
Always, always  
Days may not be fair always  
That's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour  
Not for just a day  
Not for just a year, but always  
  
I'll be loving you always  
With a love that's true always  
When the things you plan  
Need a helping hand will understand  
Always, always  
Days may not be fair always  
That's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour  
Not for just a day  
Not for just a year, but always
