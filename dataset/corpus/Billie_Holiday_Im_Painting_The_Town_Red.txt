A smile on my face  
A song on my lips  
Pretending is all I do  
I'm painting the town red  
To hide a heart that's blue  
  
I'm gay with the crowd  
I play with the crowd  
But oh, if they only knew  
I'm painting the town red  
To hide a heart that's blue  
Must I go on carrin' on?  
  
My merry song is just pretend  
Loving you so, wanting you so  
Where will it end, how will it end?  
  
A smile on my face  
A song on my lips  
But never forgetting you  
I'm painting the town red  
To hide a heart that's blue
