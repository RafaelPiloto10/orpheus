She is a wicked ride  
Yes she is  
She said I'm gonna make you climb right out yourself  
She said now break free  
You might have to give up your life  
But I was thinking  
I'd love to get inside you  
  
I drink your poison if you fill the cup  
You make me crazy, baby, don't let up  
But if I'm falling I don't wanna stop  
I'd give up everything to have your love  
I drink your poison if you fill the cup  
I'd drink your tears, don't you cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
She is a wicked high  
Yes she is  
She goes down so hard  
She might never come back  
She's gonna break free  
But she loves to laugh  
But I was thinking  
I'd love to get some of that  
  
I drink your poison if you fill the cup  
You make me crazy, baby, don't let up  
But if I'm falling I don't wanna stop  
I'd give up everything to have your love  
I drink your poison if you fill the cup  
I'd drink your tears, don't you cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
She's so  
She's gonna break free  
She's gonna laugh  
She's gonna break free  
Aww, she's gonna break free  
Aww, well that's alright by me  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I drink your poison if you fill the cup  
You make me crazy, baby, don't let up  
But if I'm falling I don't wanna stop  
I'd give up everything to have your love  
I drink your poison if you fill the cup  
I'd drink your tears, don't you cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
But the way she does me  
The she hates to love me  
If you fill the cup, I'll drink you up, baby  
  
I drink your poison if you fill the cup  
You make me crazy, baby, don't let up  
And if I'm falling I don't wanna stop  
I'd give up everything to have your love  
I drink your poison if you fill the cup  
I'd drink your tears  
  
Yes, I'm gonna rain  
She don't need me  
She don't need anything  
Aww yeah  
She gonna leave  
She gonna ride the soul, soul, soul, ride  
  
She gonna  
She'll ride the sunshine  
Aww, she gonna break free  
Gonna break out of here  
Gonna  
  
Aww yeah
