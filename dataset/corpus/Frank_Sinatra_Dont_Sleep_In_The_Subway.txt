You wander around on your own little cloud  
When you don't see the why or the wherefore  
You walk out on me when we both disagree  
Cause to reason is not what you care for  
I've heard it all a million times before  
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door  
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain  
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long  
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong  
Now you're beside me again  
  
You try to be smart, then you take it to heart  
Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated  
You don't realize that it's all compromise  
And the problems are so overrated  
Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show  
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go  
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain  
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long  
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong  
Now you're beside me again  
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'...
