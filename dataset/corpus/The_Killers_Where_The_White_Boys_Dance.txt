Take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
Take me to the place where they run and play.  
My baby is gone, you might have a chance.  
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
  
They hug in silence,  
As the sun sets.  
On their empty street,  
Their suspicions where they rise and hide.  
And then who sweeps them off she doesn't leave.  
She walks inside and  
Pours a strong one.  
Put her mind at ease.  
It's the calm before another storm.  
And the friendships from the whiskey to the keys.  
  
Take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
Take me to the place where they run and play.  
My baby is gone, you might have a chance.  
Just take me to the place where the white boys... dance.  
  
Her heart is racing.  
She phones a friend to say  
  
I'm in an awful place.  
That fools been messin' around on me  
I've seen it in his eyes and on his face  
Hold on a minute.  
You're talking crazy  
Don't be that jealous girl.  
Just tell him you need an hour or two.  
Cause we're going go and change somebodies world.  
  
Take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
Take me to the place where they run and play.  
My baby is gone, you might have a chance.  
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
  
It's the calm before another storm...  
It's the calm before another storm  
And the friendships from the whiskey to the keys.  
  
Take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
Take me to the place where they run and play.  
My baby is gone, you might have a chance.  
Just take me to the place where the white boys... dance.
