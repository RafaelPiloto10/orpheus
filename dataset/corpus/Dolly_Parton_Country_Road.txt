Saw you turnin' down main street  
In your big, black fancy car  
You were dressed up fit to kill  
With a pretty girl on your arm  
You spun around and you headed up town  
Where the neon lights all shine  
Left me choking in a cloud of dust  
You never pay me no mind  
Chorus:  
You're livin' in the fast lane  
I guess I'm just too slow  
I never wore silk or fancy furs  
Just plain ole calico  
I'll never be a fast lane lover  
And they're the only kind you take up town  
I am just a country road  
That you keep turnin' down  
If you ever hit a dead end street  
If it's love that you're looking for  
You can always turn around  
And beat a path right to my door  
Do I have to draw you a map  
You seem to know your way around  
So when you're tired of spinnin' your wheels  
Baby, we can go to town  
Repeat Chorus  
I'll never be a fast lane lover  
And they're the only kind you take up town  
I am just a country road  
That you keep turnin' down  
I am just a country road  
That you keep turnin' down  
Repeat Chorus
