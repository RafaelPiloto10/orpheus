Sick at heart and lonely, deep in dark despair  
When you want her only, tell me where is she where?  
And if she says to you, that she don't love me  
Just give her my message, tell her of my plea  
And I know, if I could have her back again, I would never make her sad  
I got a heart full of soul I got a heart full of soul  
She's been gone such a long time, longer than I can bear  
But if she says she wants me, tell her I'll be there  
  
And I know, if I could have her back again, I would never make her sad  
I got a heart full of soul I got a heart full of soul  
Sick at heart and lonely, deep in dark despair  
When you want her only, tell me where is she where?  
And if she says to you, that she don't love me  
Just give her my message, tell her of my plea  
And I know, if I could have her back again, I would never make her sad  
I got a heart full of soul I got a heart full of soul  
I got a heart full of soul!
