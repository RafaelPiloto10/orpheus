I want to tell you all a story about a Harper valley widowed wife  
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper valley junior high  
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play  
And she said, 'mom I got a note here from the Harper valley PTA'  
  
Well the note said: Mrs.Johnson you're wearing your dresses way too high  
And it's reported you've been drinking and runnin' around with men and going
wild  
And we do't believe you ought to be a bringing up your little girl this way  
And it was signed by the secretary Harper valley PTA  
  
Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon  
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the
room  
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I still can recall the words she had
to say  
She said, 'I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper valley PTA'  
  
'well there's Bobby Taylor sitting there and seven times he's asked me for a
date  
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away  
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town  
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled
completely down  
  
Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar
again  
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip
of gin  
And then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit  
Well this is just a little hatin' place and you're all Harper valley
hypocrites  
  
No I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way  
The day my momma socked it to the Harper valley PTA  
The day my momma socked it to the Harper valley PTA
