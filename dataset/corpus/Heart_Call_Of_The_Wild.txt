After midnight  
I call you  
Even though I know better  
I just got to  
The moon is full  
My heart is hot  
And you know what I'm longing to do  
With this aching I got  
  
The call of the wild  
Oh baby, can't you hear me calling  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
The call of the wild  
  
How can you ask me  
Why I'm pushing pushing  
When you know damn well  
What you do  
What you do to a woman  
I get so inspired  
Lying so close  
It's the flash and the flame and the lever  
I need the most  
  
The call of the wild  
Oh baby, can't you hear me calling  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
The call of the wild  
  
If I could chain you to me  
I'd do it in a minute  
My magic caravan  
Baby you'd be in it  
I'm hiding the prize and you're gonna win it  
You're gonna win it now  
  
The call of the wild  
Oh baby, can't you hear me calling  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
Oh  
Oh Baby  
Listen to me howling  
  
The call of the wild
