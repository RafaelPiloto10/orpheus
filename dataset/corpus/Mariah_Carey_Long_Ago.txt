Oahhh  
Yeah  
No  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Once upon a time  
You whispered softly in my ear  
Loving words and fairytales  
That I longed to hear  
I gave you my body and soul  
And you took control  
As you slowly swept me up  
And carried me away  
  
You told me pretty lies  
As I held onto you tight  
You knew how to get your way  
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace  
  
Long ago  
You used to want me  
(Now it's all so far away)  
Now it's all so far away  
But you still haunt me  
And take me back to yesterday  
  
Every now and then  
I drown in thoughts of yesterday  
And the fools' paradise that you blew away  
I feel you beside me again  
And remember when you came to my window  
On a dark and stormy day  
  
Baby, I need you now  
Tonight I'm crumbling down (down)  
Sinking in the memories  
Shadows of you keep washing over me  
  
Long ago  
You used to want me  
(Now it's all so far away)  
Now it's all so far away  
But you still haunt me  
And take me back to yesterday  
  
Long ago  
You used to want me  
(Now it's all so far away)  
Now it's all so far away  
But you still haunt me  
And take me back to yesterday  
  
(So long ago)  
(So long ago)  
(So long ago)  
(So long ago)  
(So long ago)  
(So long ago)  
(So long ago)  
  
Oh baby, I need you now  
'Cause tonight I'm crumbling down  
Sinking in the memories  
Shadows of you keep washing over me  
  
Long ago  
You used to want me  
(Now it's all so far away)  
Now it's all so far away  
But you still haunt me  
And take me back to yesterday  
  
And take me back to yesterday  
  
Long ago  
You used to want me  
(Now it's all so far away)  
Now it's all so far away  
But you still haunt me  
And take me back to yesterday  
  
Long ago  
You used to want me  
(Now it's all so far away)  
Now it's all so far away  
But you still haunt me  
And take me back to yesterday
