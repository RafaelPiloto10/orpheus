I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'  
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'  
Y'all work at ibm, hotels they be in  
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique, any street  
  
If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress  
  
Father is the black Bruce Wayne, only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains  
  
Tryna hand feed us tell the niggas to anty up  
We not off no more, pearlies in a show, fur  
So pick your auntie up, I gotta run to that pole
