Hey, Ms. Red Carpet  
She can autograph my pockets,  
Anytime, anyplace, anyway,  
I'll be looking at everybody else watchin'  
I don't wanna be obnoxious,  
But this girl worth the gossip,  
Take away the smile,  
The tattoos now, forever she very guard-less  
I imagine her topless  
She might set off my rocket  
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one  
On and poppin' she mad marketing  
Attitude like we arguing  
With her by my side bring glitter to my life  
I should twitter this girl is sparkling  
  
[Chorus]  
She ain't no rock star  
But she got groupies,  
She ain't no actress  
But she makes movies,  
And when she struts that thing around  
Everybody be breaking their neck like  
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl  
She ain't got riches but she got fashion,  
She ain't a model but camera's flashing  
And when she struts that thing around  
Everybody be breaking their neck like  
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl  
  
Hey, I wanna know her mamma's name,  
'Cause that where she get it from,  
They ain't never shot her with silicon,  
Shawty is her and her she's the real one  
Touch one, grab one, feel one,  
I wish she would'a told me that  
Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back,  
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass,  
She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags  
Like damn, can I be yo' police badge  
Pull it up, get a little cozy and  
Woman is sort'a like and oldie jam,  
Record some ssh,  
On a playboy cam,  
She ain't no actress  
The movie from my mattress  
Rock star, none of that practice  
But still she got fanatics  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh oh oh, look at her goo ooh ooh,  
I wanna know ooh ooh  
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl  
  
Ooh oh oh, look at her goo ooh ooh,  
I wanna know ooh ooh  
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl  
  
[Chorus]
