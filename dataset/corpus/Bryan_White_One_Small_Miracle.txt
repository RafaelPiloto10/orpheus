She's standing at the front door  
With a suitcase in her hand  
I'm staring down the hallway  
Frozen where I stand  
She says she doesn't love me anymore  
Oh Lord what can I do?  
It's gonna take a miracle to make us stay  
That's why I'm asking you  
  
So please don't you have a miracle just laying around  
One small miracle nobody needs  
Send it on down  
I'll never make it through this night  
Thinking she's with someone else  
Please don't you have just one small miracle left  
  
I know I haven't been a saint  
And asking you for anything takes nerve  
'Cause you've already blessed me with so much more in life than I deserve  
But if you can make a blind man see  
And change the water into wine  
Then surely you can keep her from tearing out this ol' heart of mine  
  
Please don't you have just one small miracle left
