I feel like a stranger in this home I share with you  
I can't understand this awful change you're going through  
But lately I've been watching you grow colder every day  
And I'd rather be gone than in your way  
I'd rather be gone than in your way I'd rather have someone else here in my
place  
And if I decide on leaving my world will end today  
But I'd rather be gone than in your way  
  
I'd rather be gone
