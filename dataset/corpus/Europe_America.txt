You'd think by now I've learned to fake it  
You'd think by now I'd find my peace  
And there's no risk for me worth taking  
You'd think that I'd go quietly  
But the journey's still on for my America  
  
You'd think by now I'd take the easy way  
And be content with what I've seen  
You'd think by now I'd get it in to my head  
I'm the same boy I have always been  
So the journey's still on for my America  
  
You'd think by now I'd be to jaded  
To feel what love can do  
You'd think by now that I've done everything I can  
In finally reaching you  
  
But the journey's still on for my America
