She's a quicksilver girl  
A lover of the world  
She spreads her wings  
And she's free  
She's a quicksilver girl  
A lover of the world  
She's seen every branch  
On the tree  
Ah, ah, quicksilver girl  
Ah, ah, quicksilver girl  
Ah, ah, quicksilver girl  
Ah, ah, quicksilver girl  
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh  
If you need a little lovin'  
She'll turn on the heat  
If you take a fall  
She'll put you back on your feet  
If you're all alone  
She's someone to meet  
If you need someone  
She's a quicksilver girl  
A lover of the world  
She spreads her wings  
And she's free
