I'm lost in imagination  
Still contemplate animation  
I just groove on your breathing  
I do it all for you  
  
You've got a problem witcha boyfriend  
He don't squeeze you right  
He got you facedown and waiting, baby  
Keep you waiting all night  
So do me a favour  
  
Won't you  
Move with me slowly  
Get too close to me  
Move with me slowly  
Just like we're meant to be  
Just like we're meant to be  
  
Hey say sister  
You're dreaming  
You got stars in your eyes  
A little conscious behavior  
Is gonna cut  
You down to size  
  
You hear me knocking  
So let me in  
When your blood runs cold  
And your love wears thin  
It's over passion  
It's under the skin  
If love ain't a miracle  
It sure ain't a sin  
So let me in  
  
Take me to the city  
Take me on my knees  
Take me anyway  
You find me baby  
I've got this love disease  
And there ain't nothin'  
I can do
