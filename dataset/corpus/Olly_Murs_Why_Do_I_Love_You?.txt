Your heart beat so near me  
But I can't break in  
How easy you control me  
Look at the state I'm in  
  
You got me jumping like I'm up and down  
I'm inside out again  
You keep me running 'til the sun goes down  
'Til the sun comes round again  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I care?  
I keep on chasing you  
I'm going nowhere  
Why can't I hate you?  
Why don't I dare?  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there ain't nothing there  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I care?  
I keep on chasing you  
I'm going nowhere  
Why can't I hate you?  
Why don't I dare?  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there ain't, there ain't nothing there  
There ain't nothing there  
There ain't nothing there  
There ain't nothing there  
  
You're cold, your heart  
I'm in too far  
I love you and I can't pretend  
But your heart beats so near me  
But I can't break in  
  
You got me jumping like I'm up and down  
I'm inside out again  
You keep me running 'til the sun goes down  
'Til the sun comes round again  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I care?  
I keep on chasing you  
I'm going nowhere  
Why can't I hate you?  
Why don't I dare?  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there ain't, there ain't nothing there  
There ain't nothing there  
  
Real hearts don't feel this pain  
Let it go, let it go  
Real hearts don't feel this strain  
Let it go, let it go  
Real hearts don't feel this way  
Let it go, let it go  
But this heart won't ever change  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I care?  
I keep on chasing you  
I'm going nowhere  
Why can't I hate you?  
Why don't I dare?  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there ain't, there ain't nothing there  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?
