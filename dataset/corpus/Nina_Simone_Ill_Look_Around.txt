I'll look around  
And when I've found me somebody who laughs like you  
I know somewhere spring must fill the air with sweetness  
Just as rare as a flower that you gave me to wear  
  
So I'll look around  
Sweetheart and when I've found me somebody  
Somebody who laughs like you  
I'll know this love that I've been dreaming of  
And it won't be the old love that I always knew  
  
Mmm who laughs like you  
I know somewhere spring must fill the air with sweetness  
Just as rare as a flower that you gave me to wear  
  
So I'll look around  
And when I've found me somebody who laughs like you  
I'll know this love that I've been dreaming of  
And it won't be the old love that I always knew
