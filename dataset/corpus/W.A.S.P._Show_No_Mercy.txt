I, I hear the mighty engines roar  
And I unleash the savage dogs of war  
Ooh, I'm the outlaw that rides  
  
White anglo saxon, a violent reaction  
Fire is my fuel, steel and iron rule  
  
Ride on wasteland  
A madman's badland  
Ride on wasteland  
And I will survive to show no mercy  
  
I can feel the cycles as they turn  
And I can smell the bodies as they burn  
Ooh, the city's on fire  
  
White anglo saxon, a violent reaction  
Fire is my fuel, steel and iron rule  
  
Ride on wasteland  
A madman's badland  
Ride on wasteland  
And I will survive to show no mercy  
  
Pain and hunger all across then thunder  
Life is for the biggest, it's survival of the fittest  
  
Ride on wasteland (show no mercy)  
A madman's badland (on you)  
Ride on wasteland (show no mercy)  
A madman's badland (on you, on you, on you)
