Woman he love you can't you see so help him and love him all you can  
And if you love him then love him for what he is not for what he should be  
Woman be proud of your man  
Walk with him not on him talk to him not about him  
Help him don't hurt him be proud of your man  
Laugh with him not at him look at him not through him  
Face him don't disgrace him be proud of your man  
  
Pull with him not against him see some good in the bad in him  
Be a sure him don't destroy him be proud of your man  
Be behind him not above him hold him don't control him  
Help him don't hurt him be proud of your man woman be proud of your man
