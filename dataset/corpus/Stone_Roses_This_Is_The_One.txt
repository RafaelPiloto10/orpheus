A girl consumed by fire  
We all know her desire  
From the plans that She has made  
I had her on a promise  
Immerse me in your splendor  
All the plans that I have made  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
I'd like to leave the country  
For a month of Sundays  
Burn the town where I was born  
If only she'd believe me  
Bellona belladonna  
Burn me out or bring me home  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
Oh this is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
So make a plan  
It might go wrong  
This is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
And this is the one  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
Ah this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
This is the one
