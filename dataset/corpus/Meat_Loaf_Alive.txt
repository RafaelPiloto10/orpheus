I'm still alive  
Must have been a miracle  
It's been a hell of ride  
Destination still unknown  
It's a fact of life,  
If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head  
You better walk the line or you'll be left for dead  
  
I'm a runaway train on broken track  
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time  
That's right  
I got away with it all and I'm still alive  
Let the end of the world come tumbling down  
I'll be the last man standing on the ground  
As long as I got blood rush trough my veins  
I'm still alive  
  
Lost in the night  
Feeling so invisible  
Oh, a dead man walking the wire  
I have broke the devils net  
That's made of fire  
And it's a long way down from the top of the world  
You better look around or you gonna get burned  
  
I'm a runaway train on broken track  
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time  
That's right  
I got away with it all and I'm still alive  
Let the end of the world come tumbling down  
I'll be the last man standing on the ground  
And as the dust wheels look in my eyes  
I'm still alive  
I'm still alive  
  
The darkest night ain't black enough  
To keep the morning light from shinin'  
The highest wall ain't tall enough  
To keep the smallest man from climbin'  
  
The more that you resist the tide  
The more it pulls you in  
The more you hang on for your life  
  
(I'm a runaway train on broken track)  
(I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time)  
(that's right)  
That's right  
I got away with it all and I'm still alive  
  
I'm a runaway train on broken track  
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time  
That's right  
I got away with it all and I'm still alive  
Let the end of the world come tumbling down  
I'll be the last man standing on the ground  
And if my saddle is all that survives  
I'm still alive  
I'm still alive
