Well now tell me, what in the world can be wrong?  
Well now tell me, what in the world can be wrong?  
Woke up this morning, trouble knocking at my door  
  
I wonder what's the trouble, great big troubles at my door  
I wonder what's the trouble, great big troublesat my door  
Yes, I'm going up to Macon, don't wanna be here no more  
  
I'd better forget it, let this trouble pass  
I'd better forget it, let this trouble pass  
Yes, I wonder sometimes how long my trouble's gonna last  
  
I said goodbye, goodbye baby, got to go  
I said goodbye, goodbye baby, got to go  
I ain't hangin' round here, worrying where there's trouble no more  
  
Trouble is knockin', trouble is knockin'  
Trouble is knockin', trouble is knockin'  
Trouble is knockin', can't be where it's at no more
