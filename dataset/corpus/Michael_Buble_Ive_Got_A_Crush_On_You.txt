I've got a crush on you, my sweetie pie  
All the day and night-time hear me sigh  
I never had the least notion that  
I could fall with so much emotion  
  
Could you coo, could you care  
For a cunning cottage that we could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
'cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you  
  
Ohh, Could you coo, baby, could you care  
For a cunning cottage  
We could share  
Now the world will pardon my mush  
'cause I have got a crush, ohh, you know I've got it bad for you
