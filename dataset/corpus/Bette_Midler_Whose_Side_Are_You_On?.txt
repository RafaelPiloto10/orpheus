Every time I touch you  
My heart skips a beat.  
Every time I kiss you  
I feel love from my head to my feet.  
Somethin' deep within me, baby,  
Sayin' you should be mine.  
Don't you know, baby, somewhere  
I got to, I got to draw the line?  
  
Tell me, baby, whose side are you on?  
Are you wih me, or am I all alone?  
Whoa, baby,  
Oh, where you been so long?  
Since I need you,  
Oh, won't you please come home?  
  
And every mornin' I wake up,  
Can't hide my tears.  
After all the lovin', baby,  
We've had through the years.  
It's a lonely season, baby,  
For you to leave, leave with no reason, babe.  
I just can't help believin'  
This time you're really, really, really leavin'.  
  
Whoa, baby, whose side are you on?  
Are you with me, or am I all alone?  
Whoa, baby,  
Oh, where you been, where ya,  
Where have you been so long?  
Since I need you, woo, come on home!  
  
Whoa, baby, whose side are you on?  
Since I need you, oh!  
Whoa, baby,  
Where you been, where you been,  
Where you been so damn long?  
Since I need you,  
Whoa, honey, honey, come home!
