I have spent nights with matches and knives,  
Leaning over ledges, only two flights up.  
Cutting my heart, burning my soul.  
Nothing left to hold,  
Nothing left but, blood and fire.  
  
You have spent nights, thinking of me  
Missing my arms, but you needed to leave.  
Leaving the cuts, leaving my burns,  
Hoping I'd learn.  
  
Blood and Fire  
Are too much for these restless arms to hold.  
And my nights of desire are calling me,  
Back to your fold.  
And I am calling you, calling you from 10,000 miles away  
Won't you wet my fire with your live, babe?  
  
I am looking for someone, who can take as much as I give,  
Give back as much as I need,  
And still have the will to live.  
I am intense, I am in need,  
I am in pain, I am in love.  
I feel forsaken, like to things I gave away.  
  
Blood and Fire  
Are too much for these restless arms to hold.  
And my nights of desire are calling me,  
Back to your fold.  
And I am calling you, calling you from 10,000 miles away  
Won't you wet my fire with your live, babe?  
  
I am intense, I am in need, I am in pain, I am in love.  
I am intense, I am in need, I am in pain, I am in love.  
I am intense, I am in need, I am in pain, I am in love.  
  
Blood and Fire  
Are too much for these restless arms to hold.  
And my nights of desire are calling me,  
Back to your fold.  
And I am calling you, calling you from 10,000 miles away  
Won't you wet my fire with your live, babe?
