Well, hello there!  
My, it's been a long, long time  
How am I doin'? Oh, I guess I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now, and it seems that it was only yesterday  
Gee! ain't it funny, how time slips away?  
  
How's your new love?  
I hope he's doin' fine  
Heard you told him that you'd love him 'till the end of time  
Now, that's the same thing,  
The same thing you told me, seems like just the other day  
Gee! ain't it funny, funny how time slips away?  
  
Just you remember, what I tell you  
That in time you're gonna pay  
And it's surprisin',  
Surprisin' how time slips away!
