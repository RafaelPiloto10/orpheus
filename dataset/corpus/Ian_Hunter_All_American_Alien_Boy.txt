I packed my bags - in the land of rags  
'Cause I don't believe in them dimmo drags  
Don't want to vote for the left wing - don't want to vote for the right  
I gotta have both-to make me fly  
  
Just a whitey from Blighty - heading out west  
Got my little green card an' my bulletproof vest  
Goin' to old tube city - where the buzz is the best  
On down the line (down the line) down the line (down the line)  
  
Well I was born (on the line) an' I was raised (on the line)  
I was schooled (on the line) an' I was fazed (on the line)  
An' I was used (on the line) an' I was dazed (on the line)  
Just had to split (off the line) 'cause I was crazed (off the line)  
  
An' I remember all the good times - me 'n Miller enjoyed  
Up and down the M1 in some luminous yo-yo toy  
But the future has to change - and to change I've got to destroy  
Oh look out Lennon here I come - land ahoy-hoy-hoy  
  
All American Alien Boy All American Alien Boy  
Don't look down put your feet on the ground don't drown in the big aquarium  
Don't walk slow - put on a big show - shove your meat down vegetarians  
Don't get slugged, get mugged, get bugged, or they'll sling you in the jug  
Shove you under some rug, give you some drug - pull out the plug and then...  
  
And they're telling me this hamburger's cheaper than the other  
An' this television's cheaper than the other  
And they're selling me hotdogs cheaper than the other  
An' these pizzas cheaper than the other  
And I don't understand all this - I'm just an All American Alien Boy  
  
An' they're telling me rifles are shot in Connecticut  
They're telling me pistols are shot in Westchester  
You can get a Saturday Night Special on Flatbush, on the Bowery, or the Bronx  
  
Or on 42nd Street - And I don't understand all this - being an All American
Alien Boy  
I've got sodium nitrate rotting in my guts  
My head's full of ulcers I got lungs full of butts  
My heart wants a transplant - it thinks that I'm nuts  
My luggage won't open - my eyes won't shut  
An' I'm beginning to dig all this - being an All American Alien Boy  
  
And your women are always right (alright)  
They always know so much more  
'Cause the women came from heaven  
An' the men came outta some store  
An' they don't know who they are and they don't know what they're for  
  
I'm an All American Alien Boy - look out Mary Tyler Moore  
All American Alien Boy  
  
Ten Bears, Two Bears, Standing Bear, Plenty Bear,  
Old Bear, Brave Bear, Hollow Horn Bear  
Silver Knife, Spotted Tail, Yellow Hand, Red Cloud,  
Red Fox, Red Horse, Black Kettle,  
White Ghost, White Bull, White Thunder, White Hog,  
Hold on a minute gotta frog in my throat  
Cochise, Alchise, Roman Nose, Geronimo - hold on a minute - more to go  
Sitting Bull, Tall Bull, Crazy Horse and Short Bull,  
Low Dog, Red Dog, Yellow Wolf, Low Wolf  
Loco, Victorio, Chato, Little Crow, Dead Eyes, Jak, Taza an' Colorow  
My mouth's exploding that's enough of this noise  
I guess we're all - All American Alien Boys.
