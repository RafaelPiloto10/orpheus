If you've ever been taken for money  
If you've ever gone down with your pride  
If you've ever stood up for a good friend and lost  
You know that the river is wide  
  
Like a painter who waits for the sunrise  
With a picture in both of his hands  
It's like part of your life is already begun  
With something that you don't understand  
  
But don't cry now  
Oh don't cry now  
Don't cry now  
No don't cry now  
  
When you're lying alone in the night time  
And your loneliness turns into fear  
With the words of your memory failing and falling  
You're drowning in a river of tears  
  
But don't cry now  
Oh don't cry now  
  
If you've ever thought much about freedom  
You might find yourself caught in some door  
With somebody you love more than (Incomprehensible to my ears)  
And you've been weeping but you don't know what for  
  
But don't cry now  
Oh don't cry now  
Don't cry now  
Oh don't cry now  
Don't cry now  
Woah don't cry now
