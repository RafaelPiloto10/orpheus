When I start movin', you see a blur.  
Get hooked on me baby, there ain't no cure.  
I've always been able to laugh at fate.  
Two brown eyes filled with hate.  
  
I'm the man who makes the street his home  
And my lean mean hearts is just as hard as stone.  
  
Oh, I'm my main man.  
Don't want nothing from no one.  
I'm my main man.  
Always ready for what ever's gonna happen.  
  
Spend my time in a cold jail cell, shootin' up poison  
And livin' in hell and I never care what people think,  
My history's written on me in tattooed ink.  
And still life goes on tracks on my arms,  
And the number thirteen is my good luck charm.  
  
Oh, I'm my main man.  
Don't want nothing from no one.  
I'm my main man.  
Always ready for what ever's gonna happen.  
  
What happens to me is my own affair.  
If you don't like me, I really don't care.  
Cause no one's been what I've been through,  
And I don't do what people want me to do.  
I'll fight you till the bitter end,  
And then I'll screw your little girl friend.  
  
Oh, I'm my main man.  
Don't want nothing from no one.  
I'm my main man.  
Always ready for what ever's gonna happen.
