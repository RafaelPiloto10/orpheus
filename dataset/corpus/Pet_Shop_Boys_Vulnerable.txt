You may think I'm strong  
And I can do no wrong  
But I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
I may be hard to take  
But you can call me fake  
'cause I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
I know the assumption  
Is that I'm tough  
With all my anger  
That's fair enough  
Even with friends  
I have to compete  
And try being me  
When you walk down the street  
  
It's not easy  
By the by  
Just surviving  
In the public  
Eye  
  
You may think I'm strong  
And I can do no wrong  
But I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
I may be hard to take  
But you can call me fake  
'cause I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
You know I can't ever  
Bear to seem weak  
Or have any doubts  
That's just my technique  
I put in the hours  
At least I don't shirk  
A little bravado  
Does much of the work  
  
I am no one's  
Stepping stone  
But I couldn't live life  
In private  
Alone  
  
You may think I'm strong  
And I can do no wrong  
But I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
I may be hard to take  
But you can call me fake  
'cause I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
At night  
I am lying awake  
Through the hours trying  
To calculate  
Am I good enough?  
Could I contrive?  
To keep this sham around  
Will I survive?  
  
I know you must sometimes  
Think I don't care  
Or even appreciate  
What we share  
  
Though I'm no one's  
Stepping stone  
The truth is I love you  
And I'd go crazy  
Alone  
  
You may think I'm strong  
And I can do no wrong  
But I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
I may be hard to take  
But you can call me fake  
'cause I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
So vulnerable without you
