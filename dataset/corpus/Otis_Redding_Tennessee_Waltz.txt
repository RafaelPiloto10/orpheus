I was dancing with my baby  
To that Tennessee Waltz  
When an old friend I happened  
Happened to see  
Well I didn't know I was going to see him  
I introduced him to my baby  
While, while they kept on playing  
That friend stole my sweetheart  
Away from me. yes he did  
I remember, yeah, that night  
Of that beautiful Tennessee Waltz  
Oh you know, you'll never know  
You'll never know just how much I've lost, ooh  
I lost my baby, my sweet baby  
While, while they kept on playing  
That beautiful Tenne- Tennessee Waltz  
Yeah yeah yeah now  
I remember, yeah, that night  
Of that beautiful Tennesse Waltz  
Oh you know, you know, you know  
Just how much I've lost  
Ooh honey, I lost too much, yeah  
I lost my baby, my sweet baby  
While, while they kept on playing  
That beautiful, wonderful  
That marvelous, yeah man that glorious  
That cotton pickin' Tenne-  
Tennessee Waltz  
I lost my baby, my my my my baby
