I used to live in a room full of mirrors  
All I could see was me  
Well I took my spirit  
And I crashed my mirrors  
Now the whole world is here for me to see  
I've got a whole world that's here for me to see  
Now I'm searching for my love to be  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Broken glass was falling in my brain  
Cuttin' and screamin' and crying in my head  
Broken glass was falling in my brain  
It used to fall on my dreams and cut me in my bed  
It used to fall on my dreams and cut me in my bed  
I said making love was strange in my bed  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah  
  
Love come shining o'er the mountain  
Love come shining o'er the sea  
Love will shine on my baby  
Then I'll know exactly who's for me  
Then I'll know exactly who's for me  
(in the meantime we still got alotta groovy time)  
Hey! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
