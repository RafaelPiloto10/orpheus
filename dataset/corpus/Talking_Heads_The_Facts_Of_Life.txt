Monkey see and monkey do  
Ma king babies, eating food  
Smelly things, pubic hair  
Words of love, in the air  
Sparks fly, shoo ting out  
Ma king sure that everything is working  
I can't turn you down  
We are programmed happy little children  
Matter over mind  
We can not resist so I won't fight it  
Love is a machine  
Love is a machine without a driver  
The facts of life  
The facts of life  
A masterpiece  
Biology  
Smokey water  
Air conditioned  
Boys 'n' girls  
And automation  
Chromosomes  
Designer jeans  
Chimpanzees  
And human beings  
Machines of love  
Machines of love  
Strong in body, strong in mind  
A love machine with the facts of life  
The facts of life  
The facts of life  
So much sex 'n' violence  
Must be a bad design  
We're stupid to be fighting  
Every night  
The monsters we create  
They welcome us aboard  
The best in advertising  
From coast to coast  
The girls and boys combine  
Like monkeys in the zoo  
The clouds have silver linings  
Looks pretty good  
People fall in love like in fairy tales  
I'm not sure I like, what they can do  
I'm afraid that God has no master plan  
He only takes -- what he can use  
Factory life, ice cream and pie  
Factory life  
Someday we'll live on Venus  
And men will walk on Mars  
But we will still be monkeys  
Down deep inside  
If chimpanzees are smart  
Then we will close our eyes  
And let our instincts guide us  
Oh oh oh oh no
