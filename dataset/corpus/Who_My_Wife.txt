My life's  
In jeopardy  
Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be  
I haven't been home since Friday night and now my wife  
Is comin' after me  
  
Give me police protection  
Gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one  
Give me a bodyguard  
A black belt judo expert  
With a machine gun!  
  
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane!  
When she catches up with me,  
Won't be no time to explain  
She thinks I've been with another woman  
And that's enough  
To send her half-insane!  
  
Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots, and take a long, long drive  
I may end up spendin' all my money,  
But I'll still be alive!  
  
All I did was have a bit too much to drink  
And I picked the wrong precinct  
Got picked up by the law and now I ain't got time to think  
  
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane!  
When she catches up with me,  
Won't be no time to explain  
She thinks I've been with another woman  
And that's enough  
To send her half-insane!  
  
Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots, and take a long, long drive  
I may end up spendin' all my money,  
But I'll still be alive!  
  
And I'm oh, so tired of running  
Gonna lay down on the floor  
I gotta rest some time  
So I can get to run some more  
Yeah!  
  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!  
She's comin'!
