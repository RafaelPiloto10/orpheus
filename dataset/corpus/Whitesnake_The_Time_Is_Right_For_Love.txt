When I saw you in the Garden  
Sweet lilac in your hair,  
The sunlight seemed to surround you  
And bless the morning air.  
I wondered what your name was  
And if you would dance with me,  
I heard you cry for mercy  
But, my eyes they could not see.  
  
'Cause the time is right for love,  
The time is right for love,  
You can pray to the Lord above  
But, the time is right for love.  
  
So much for all your sweet words,  
All that you said you would do.  
Remember all my love songs,  
They were promises to you.  
But, I don't hold it against you,  
I know you're not to blame  
So draw your circle around me  
And we'll put all your lovers to shame.  
  
'Cause the time is right for love,  
The time is right for love,  
You can pray to the Lord above  
But, the time is right for love.  
  
'Cause the time is right for love,  
The time is right for love,  
You can pray to the Lord above  
But, the time is right for love
