Instead of her hips  
When she talks she moves her mouth  
Instead of her lips  
  
And I've waited for her for so long  
I have waited for her for so long  
I've wondered if I could hang on  
I wonder if I could hang on  
  
Let me go she said  
Let me go she said  
Let me go and I will want you more  
Let me go, let me go  
Let me go and I will want you  
  
When she wants, she wants the sun  
Instead of the moon  
When she sees, she sees the stars  
Inside of her room  
  
And I've waited for her for so long  
I have waited for her for so long  
I've wondered if I could hang on  
I wonder if I could hang on  
  
Let me go she said  
Let me go she said  
Let me go and I will want you more  
Let me go she said let me go  
Let me go and I will want you  
Let me go she said  
Let me go she said  
Let me go she said let me go  
Let me go she said  
Let me go let me go  
Let me go let me go  
Let me go let me go  
Let let me go...
