What did I do to deserve such a fate  
I didn't really want to get  
Involved in this thing  
Someone handed me this gun and I  
I gave it everything  
Yeah, I gave it everything  
  
I came into this life  
Looked all around  
I saw just what I liked  
And took what I found  
Nothing came easy  
Nothing came free  
Nothing came all until they  
Came after me  
  
Yeah-hey, yeah  
  
I didn't really want to get  
Involved in this thing  
Someone handed me this gun and I  
I gave it everything  
Yeah, I gave it everything
