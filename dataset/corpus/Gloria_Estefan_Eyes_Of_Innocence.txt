When I look into your eyes  
I can see all your hopes and dreams  
I can feel your warm desires  
And I know you're wanting me  
You've got to use discretion  
I don't know if it's right  
To take away that look from you  
By loving you tonight  
  
I'm looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
I don't know if it's right to feel this way  
I'm looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
And I'm afraid of the way  
You look at me  
  
Something inside keeps telling me  
This is a love that cannot be  
And even though I should not stay  
Can't bring myself to walk away  
You're holding my affections  
I don't know if it's right  
To take away that look from you  
By loving you tonight  
  
I'm looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
I don't know if it's right to feel this way  
I'm looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
And I'm afraid of the way you  
Look at me  
I'm looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
I don't know if it's right to feel this way  
I'm looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
And I'm afraid of the way  
I'm afraid of the way  
I'm afraid of the way you look at me
