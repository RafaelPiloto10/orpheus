Girl, we've come a long, long way  
Too far for us to end this way  
Sometimes the cost of love is hard  
And we must pay this little give-and-take  
  
So don't you think if you and I  
Were just about and let our hearts decide  
Maybe it would all work out in time  
So won't you stay, please don't go away.  
  
Love, love is what we make it  
We can make it so much better if we try  
Love, love is what we make it  
So let?s make it real good this time.  
  
Is it too late to change your mind?  
Or has it gone to fall this time  
Won't you hold me just one more time  
Let's just say: "there's a chance for you and me".  
  
Love, love is what we make it
