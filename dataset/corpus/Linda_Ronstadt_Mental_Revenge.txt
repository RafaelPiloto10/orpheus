Well I hope that the friend that you've thrown yourself on  
Gets drunk and loses her job  
And every road that you travel on  
Is dusty rocky and hard  
  
I couldn't make you love me  
You only made me blue  
So all in all if the curtain should fall  
Then I hope that it falls on you  
  
And I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
  
Well I hope that the train from Caribou, Maine  
Runs over your new love affair  
You'll walk the floor from dawn to dawn  
And you'll tear out your peroxide hair  
  
I never was your woman  
Cause you were never true  
So all in all if the curtain should fall  
Then I hope that it falls on you  
  
And I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge
