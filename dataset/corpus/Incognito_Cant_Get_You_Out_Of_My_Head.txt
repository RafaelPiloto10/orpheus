It's one of those days, and I need some distraction  
I've gotta stop trying to be everything to everyone  
I wish that I could turn the tables  
'Cause this world's got me running round in circles  
  
"I guess it would make it easier"  
If I had someone to talk it over  
[No doubt, no doubt]  
"I guess it would make things easier"  
If you were here right now  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't get you out of my head  
Can't get you out of my head  
I can't get you out of my head  
Can't get you out of my head  
  
It's hard to believe, you've been gone so long  
And there I go again, am I wrong still holding on?  
Sometimes I feel unable  
To do the things that everyday people do  
  
"I guess it doesn't make it easier"  
That you still mean so much to me  
"I guess it doesn't make it easier"  
That I never did let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say time is the healer  
There is a season for everything  
For everything there is a reason  
Got to learn to let go  
  
I wish that I could turn the tables  
'Cause this world's got me running round in circles  
  
There I go again, am I wrong still holding on?
