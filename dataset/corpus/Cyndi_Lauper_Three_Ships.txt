[Chorus]  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
And what was on those ships all three  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
A little boy and our lady  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
Oh they sailed to Bethlehem  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
Oh they sailed to Bethlehem  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
Then let us all rejoice and sing  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
[Chorus]
