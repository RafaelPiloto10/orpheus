When the deep purple falls  
Over sleepy garden walls  
And the stars begin to flicker in the sky  
Through the mist of a memory  
You wander back to me  
Breathing my name with a sigh  
In the still of the night  
Once again I'll hold you tight  
Though you're gone your love lives on  
When moonlight beams  
And as long as my heart will beat  
Love we'll always meet  
Here in my deep purple dreams  
And as long as my heart will beat  
Love we'll always meet  
Here in my deep purple dreams
