[Chorus]  
I'm no stranger to shame  
I've got little to blame  
You sent for me and so I came  
I'll come runnin' when you call my name  
'cause I'm no stranger, I'm no stranger to shame  
I said I'm no stranger, I'm no stranger to shame  
  
I might stagger and I might sway  
I might stutter just a bit but that's OK  
I'm not walkin' too good that's true  
I got a broke ass limp that'll pull me though  
I might appear to be a pile of rags  
But I'm a stack of hundreds in a paper bag  
I've been around this world and back  
I made a million bucks and put it all on black  
  
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away  
It's not the first time, not the last  
You can leave me where I lay, because  
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away  
It's not the first time, not the last  
You can leave me where I lay, because  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been known to wake up in some dirty places  
The sun only shines on deserving faces  
The mind erases, forgets the stars  
See each and every city has corner bar  
That's where I am in a world so grim  
The lights are as bright as the day is dim  
See I'm priceless in a class of my own  
I used to stay out late but now I don't go home  
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away  
  
It's not the first time, not the last  
You can leave me where I lay, because  
How do you feel when the birds are chirpin'  
When your in bed and everybody is workin'  
Are you down with the non believers  
Make the slackers look like over achievers  
The dogs scratchin' on the door again  
The cat's out but he don't want to come in  
You got a bed and you got a floor  
But the couch is closer to your front door  
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away  
It's not the first time, not the last  
You can leave me where I lay, because  
  
[Chorus]
