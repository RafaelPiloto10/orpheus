Don't worry, everybody's got an angel  
Sooner or later somebody's gonna love you well  
There's no hurry  
So don't worry  
Cause you'll find the broken hearted  
Fallen- fallen- now don't you worry  
Cause everybody's got an angel.  
  
Don't worry, everybody's got an angel  
Sooner or later everybody's bound to tell  
There's no hurry  
So don't worry  
Cause you'll find the broken hearted  
Fallen- fallen- now don't you worry  
Cause everybody's got an angel.
