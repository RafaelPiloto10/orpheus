When I'm lost in the rain,  
In your eyes I know I'll find the light to light my way.  
And when I'm scared,  
And losing ground,  
  
When my world is going crazy,  
You can turn it all around.  
And when I'm down you're there - pushing me to the top.  
You're always there, giving me all you've got.  
  
For a shield from the storm,  
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you.  
For the strength to be strong,  
  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do, for everything that's true  
I turn to you.  
When I lose the will to win,  
  
I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again.  
I can do anything 'cause your love is so amazing,  
'Cause your love inspires me.  
And when I need a friend,  
  
You're always on my side giving me faith taking me through the night  
For a shield from the storm,  
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you.  
  
For the strength to be strong,  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do, for everything that's true  
I turn to you.  
  
For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain,  
For truth that will never change,  
For someone to lean on,  
For a heart I can rely on through anything,  
  
For that one who I can run to  
For a shield from the storm,  
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you  
  
For the strength to be strong,  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do, for everything that's true  
I turn to you.  
  
For a shield from the storm,  
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you.  
For the strength to be strong,  
  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do, for everything that's true  
I turn to you.  
I turn to you
