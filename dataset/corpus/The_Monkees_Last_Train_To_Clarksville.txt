Take the last train to Clarksville  
And I'll meet you at the station  
You can be there by 4:30  
'Cause I've made your reservation  
Don't be slow  
Oh no no no, oh no no no  
  
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning  
And I must see you again  
We'll have one more night together  
'Til the morning brings my train  
And I must go  
Oh no no no, oh no no no  
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home  
  
Take the last train to Clarksville  
I'll be waiting at the station  
We'll have time for coffee flavored kisses  
And a bit of conversation  
Oh no no no, oh no no no  
  
Take the last train to Clarksville  
Now I must hang up the phone  
I can't hear you in this  
Noisy railroad station all alone  
I'm feeling low  
Oh no no no, oh no no no  
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home  
  
Take the last train to Clarksville,  
And I'll meet you at the station,  
You can be here by four-thirty,  
'Cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow,  
Oh, no, no, no,  
Oh, no, no, no,  
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home.  
Take the last train to Clarksville,  
Take the last train to Clarksville,  
Take the last train to Clarksville,  
Take the last train to Clarksville.
