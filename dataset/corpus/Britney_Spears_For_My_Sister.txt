Just yesterday  
You were looking up to me  
And, You would ask me  
What I thought  
  
But now I'm sitting here  
All alone with my tears  
Lookin' at my life  
That I've bought  
  
Where did I go? (yeah)  
My eyes, they will show  
  
And little me  
Please forgive me  
I couldn't see  
You hurting inside  
... Little me...  
... Little me...  
No more into you  
Little me oh no  
No ways ii must confess oh no  
No ways ii must confess oh no
