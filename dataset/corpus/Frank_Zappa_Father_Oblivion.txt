(Get up on your feet and do the Funky Alfonzo)  
  
Father Vyvian O'Blivion  
Resplendent in his frock  
Was whipping up the batter  
For the pancakes of his flock  
He was looking rather bleary  
He forgot to watch the clock  
  
But the night before  
Behind the door  
A leprechaun had stroked it  
  
But the night before  
Behind the door  
A leprechaun had slowly stroked it  
He slowly stroked it  
  
But the night before  
Behind the door  
A leprechaun had stroked his spot  
He stroked his smock  
  
It set him off in such a frenzy  
He sang "Lock Around the Crock!"  
  
And he topped it off with a  
And he topped it off with a  
And he topped it off with a  
  
As he stumbled on his  
He was delighted as it stiffened  
And ripped right through his sock  
  
"Oh St. Alfonzo would be proud of me"  
He shouted down the block  
  
Dominus vobiscum  
Et cum spiritu tuo  
Won't you eat my sleazy pancakes  
Just for Saintly Alphonzo  
  
They're so light and fluffy white  
We'll raise a fortune by tonight  
They're so light and fluffy white  
We'll raise a fortune by tonight  
They're so light and fluffy brown  
They're the finest in the town  
They're so light and fluffy brown  
They're the finest in the town  
  
Good morning your highness  
Oo oo ooo  
I've brought you your snowshoes  
Oo oo ooo  
  
Good morning your highness  
Oo oo ooo  
I've brought you your snowshoes  
Oo oo ooo
