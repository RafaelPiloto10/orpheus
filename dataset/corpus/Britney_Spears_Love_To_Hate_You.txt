Love to hate you  
  
I'm doing fine  
I'm doing fine  
  
For seven months and fifteen days  
I've been telling you lies in different ways  
I know things will change  
But I don't know when  
You keep talking about us  
Like we still were friends  
  
I just hate the way you talk to me  
I just love to say what's bothering me  
  
I love to hate you  
I really love to hate you  
And nothing you do  
Will ever change my mind  
I'm doing fine  
Without you  
  
It wasn't meant to be like this  
All you gave her was one little innocent kiss  
I didn't believe  
She would turn to be  
The love of your life  
Just like me  
  
I just hate the way you talk to me  
I just love to say what you mean to me  
  
I love to hate you  
I really love to hate you  
And nothing you do  
Will ever change my mind  
I'm doing fine  
Without you  
  
I'm doing fine  
  
I love to hate you  
I really love to hate you  
And nothing you do  
Will ever change my mind  
I'm doing fine  
I love to hate you  
I really love to hate you  
And nothing you do  
Will ever change my mind  
I'm doing fine  
Without you
