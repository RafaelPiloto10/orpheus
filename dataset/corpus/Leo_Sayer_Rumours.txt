)  
I heard some things about you  
I can't believe it's true  
I heard the flame don't burn bright as it used to  
I heard some things about you  
I know they must be lies  
Don't turn your face away, baby  
When I need to see your eyes  
''cause I keep hearing rumors  
People telling me rumors  
I keep hearing those rumors  
Seems like everybody's my best friend  
Rumors, don't go believing rumors  
I swear it's only rumors  
Listen babe, I don't want our love to end  
(It's a shame - they talk, they talk, they talk)  
I heard some things about you  
Suspicion coming on  
I need some answers woman  
Don't tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong  
I heard some things about you  
The way you're treating me  
You give your love to someone else  
When it used to come to me  
Oh I've been hearing rumors  
Everybody's saying rumors  
I don't want to hear no rumors  
How come everybody wants to be my best friend  
I don't believe it no, oh  
(It's a shame - they talk  
They talk, they talk  
They talk, they talk  
They talk, they talk:)  
Now I've got so many friends  
I've never had before  
And you're the only friend I want  
I don't want no more  
All these rumors I hear  
I can't believe they're true  
And they're trying to tear me  
Oh no, they're trying to tear me away from you  
Rumors, I don't believe it babe  
Rumors  
They're just whispers in the wind  
They've got it all wrong  
Everybody's wants our love to end  
Rumors, I don't believe in those  
Rumors, lots of big rumors  
Rumors, it's only vicious rumors  
I don't want our love to end  
I don't want our love to end  
I don't want our love to end
