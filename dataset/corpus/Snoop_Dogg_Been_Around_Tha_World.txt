[Intro]  
Yeah, this record for my baby, my baby boo  
I know I'm always on the road, I'm always gone  
And you say I never make records for you no more  
Well this record is from me to you, baby  
Yeah, real talk  
  
[Chorus]  
Been around the world  
I've been into many places  
Seen some unfamiliar faces  
But baby, none of them compare to you  
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone  
  
[Verse 1]  
I seen everything twice  
Been around the world, I've seen every scene twice  
Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice  
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice  
I do it big, fuck the rumors  
Rich and infamous with the blue and grey Pumas  
Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami  
I did all that, I was voted my candy  
I'm sorta like Sammy  
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy  
Sippin' Chardinae, making deals with my hands free  
Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me  
Cause I own rap, and I'm coming for your day job  
Until then, I'm chilling at the day spa  
Relax my mind and just chill  
Cause without you, none of this is real  
Baby, you know I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
Yeah, but now I'm back across the water  
I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter  
Blowing sticky by the zips, and they can tell  
By my rag hanging, nigga, this is Crip, but I'm chilling  
It feels so good to get away  
Especially when your name is D-O-double-Gizzee  
Coast-to-coast jetting, man, I been doing that  
What you do, just start balling? I been around the track  
Hop in Peas with the bosses  
300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office  
Docking down in Manico, churching with my folks  
Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat  
My life is like a movie  
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me  
Then I relax and chill  
Cause without you, none of this is real  
Baby you know I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
Just for you baby  
Yeah, I'm on my way home right now  
I'm on my way right now  
I'm leaving the studio right now  
Soon as I get home tomorrow, I'ma go unplug it  
Matter of fact, I ain't even gonna bring it in the house  
See you in a minute...
