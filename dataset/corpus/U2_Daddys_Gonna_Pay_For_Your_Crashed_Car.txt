You're a precious stone  
You're out on your own  
You know everyone in the world  
But you feel alone  
Daddy won't let you weep  
Daddy won't let you ache  
Daddy gives you as much as you can take  
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
  
A little uptight  
You're a baby's fist  
Butterfly kisses up and down your wrist  
When you see daddy coming  
You're licking your lip  
Nails bitten down to the quick  
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
  
You've got a head full of traffic  
You're a siren's song  
You cry for mama  
And daddy's right along  
He gives you the keys to a flamin' car  
Daddy's with you wherever you are  
Daddy's a comfort  
Daddy's your best friend  
Daddy'll hold your hand right up to the end  
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
  
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday's  
Alright...
