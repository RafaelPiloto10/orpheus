You don't want to go there  
Let me lead you by the hand  
You don't want to be there  
Over the sea and down to land  
As I look into your eyes  
  
I pay no mind  
I found the way  
To get inside you  
I'd give you peace of mind  
Am I see you falling?  
Am I see you falling?  
Am I see you falling beautiful  
The same  
  
I don't see you falling,  
I don't see you falling,  
I don't see you falling beautiful  
Sometimes  
  
You don't want to go there  
Let me lead you by the hand  
You don't want to be there  
Over the sea and down to land  
As I look into your eyes  
I pay no mind  
I found the way  
To get inside you  
  
I'd give you peace of mind  
Am I see you falling?  
Am I see you falling?  
Am I see you falling beautiful  
The same  
I don't see you falling,  
I don't see you falling,  
I don't see you falling beautiful  
Sometimes  
  
Here and again  
And there you're  
Falling, falling, falling,  
Falling, falling, falling  
Am I see you falling?  
Am I see you falling?  
Am I see you falling beautiful  
The same  
  
I don't see you falling,  
I don't see you falling,  
I don't see you falling beautiful  
Sometimes  
  
Am I see you falling?  
Am I see you falling?  
Am I see you falling beautiful  
The same  
  
I don't see you falling,  
I don't see you falling,  
I don't see you falling beautiful  
Sometimes  
  
Falling, falling, free  
I don't see you falling,  
I don't see you falling,  
Corrupt, a plea for free will  
An irresponsible harass show  
It has been suggested  
That this is contradictory
