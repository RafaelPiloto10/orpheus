I know it's late and you're tired  
And we'd been talking for hours here  
You don't have to tell me  
  
I see that look in your eyes  
And I know soon we'll say our goodbyes oh yeah  
I feel it coming  
  
And I hear you take a deep breath  
And my hands are starting to sweat  
I don't want you to  
I don't want you to leave, yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stay here tonight  
Stay here tonight  
'Cause when your around me  
Everything's right, don't go  
Oh, don't leave me alone  
Stay here tonight  
Stay here tonight  
I wanna hold you in my arms  
Show you what thats like don't go  
I need you  
I need you  
  
You grab your coat and I'm dying  
But I know that you're still deciding, yeah  
There's no bodies moving  
Time stops and everything's quiet  
I'm begging on for my life in you  
You don't even see it  
  
And then you coming closer  
And baby it's not over  
Till I hear you say  
Till I hear you say  
Goodnight, oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Something about you saying is not  
Something about you makes me feel like I'm nobody  
  
Stay here tonight  
Stay here tonight  
Cause when you around me everything's right don't go  
Don't leave me alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stay with me tonight  
I need you  
Stay with me tonight  
I need you  
Stay with me tonight...
