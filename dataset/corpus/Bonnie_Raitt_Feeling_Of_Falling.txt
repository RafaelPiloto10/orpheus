Sometimes I miss that feelin' of fallin'  
Fallin' on over the ledge  
You know I miss that feelin' of fallin'  
Fallin' on over the ledge  
And when my mind it gets to worryin'  
And I just can't get no rest, oh baby oh  
That's when I call you up instead  
After midnight baby  
Sittin' here all alone  
I tried to call your number baby  
But you weren't at home  
I've been a good girl baby  
I'm through with all that mess  
But the way I'm feeling right now, darlin'  
You know it scares me half to death  
That I miss that feelin' of  
Fallin' on over the ledge  
The summer night in Texas, baby  
It's too hot and wet to sleep  
I heard you pull up in the distance  
You're comin' to give me relief  
We went screamin' down the highway, baby  
So much faster than we should  
You pulled me over in the moonlight, darlin'  
Man, I still can feel that hood  
And I miss that feelin'  
Oh, I wanna fall on over the ledge  
When that rain start fallin', I wanna call baby  
I wanna take a real good look at that ledge  
It ain't something you get over  
You might think you made it through  
You can turn your head and walk away, baby  
But it never takes its eyes off of you and  
It'll push your foot right through the floor board, baby  
Make you cut them streamers down and back  
You waste what's precious and you can't afford, baby  
It runs your life right off the track  
It'll keep you boilin' in that poison  
Only the truly twisted know so well  
You don't need drugs to show you heaven, baby  
'Cause there's plenty clean in hell  
I'd miss that feelin' of fallin'  
Oh, on over the ledge  
Yeah, the blues start callin'  
[Incomprehensible]  
Break it down  
[Incomprehensible] baby  
Oh baby I'm gonna crawl  
Crawl into your arm now  
Into your arm now
