[Intro]  
Oh, Heaven, heaven on Earth  
Oh, Heaven  
  
[Verse 1]  
The spirit of the Lord is upon me  
His anointing, is empowering  
The kingdom of the Lord is within me  
And He's calling me to the heavenly

Be seated in heavenly places  
Just like heaven, just like heaven on Earth  
To be walking in His favor and graces  
Just like heaven, just like heaven on Earth

Marching in the spirit of unity  
To our community, show His ability  
The will of the Lord for His children  
Is to demonstrate, perpetrate

Somethin's movin', somethin's changin'  
See His glory, feels like heaven on Earth  
  
There is lightening and thunder, miracles and wonders  
Sounds of many waters, heaven on Earth  
  
[Verse 3]  
Heaven is calling for you to come higher  
To see everything from a new point of view  
To be seated with Jesus in heavenly places  
From His perspective everything is made new
