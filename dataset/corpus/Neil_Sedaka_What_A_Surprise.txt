Do do do do do do do do, what a surprise  
Do do do do do do do do, what a surprise  
Ooh Ooh Ooh, what a surprise  
  
She stood there looking like she didn't care  
Looking right through me like I wasn't there  
Could've bowled me over when I realized  
She was cooking me breakfast what a surprise  
  
What a surprise baby, oh what a night  
Looking real good, she was moving just right  
I can't begin to describe all the charms  
I held in my arms what a surprise  
  
Oohh, oohh, she didn't say nothing, not a word  
Oohh, oohh, I knew she was telling me something  
Had to go back for a second helping  
  
Out of the blue and right into my heart  
I'm telling you, you can't keep us apart  
Lights up the sky like the stars in the night  
Who would have thunk it what a surprise  
  
Bridge  
  
What a surprise baby, oh what a night  
Looking real good she was moving just right  
Lights up the sky like the stars in the sky  
Who would have thunk it what a surprise  
  
Ad lib first line and fade
