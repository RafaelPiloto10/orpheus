In a little cafe just the other side of the border  
She was just sitting there givin' me looks that made my mouth water  
So I started walking her way  
She belonged to that man, Jose  
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave  
When I heard her say, yeah  
  
Come a little bit closer  
You're my kind of man  
So big and so strong  
Come a little bit closer  
I'm all alone  
And the night is so long  
  
So we started to dance  
In my arms, she felt so inviting  
That I just couldn't resist  
Just one little kiss so exciting  
Then I heard the guitar player say  
"Vamoose, Jose's on his way"  
Then I knew, yes I knew I should run  
But then I heard her say, yeah  
  
Come a little bit closer  
You're my kind of man  
So big and so strong  
Come a little bit closer  
I'm all alone  
And the night is so long  
  
Then the music stopped  
When I looked the cafe was empty  
Then I heard Jose say  
"Man you know you're in trouble plenty"  
So I dropped my drink from my hand  
And through the window I ran  
And as I rode away  
I could hear her say to Joscute, yeah  
  
Come a little bit closer  
You're my kind of man  
So big and so strong  
Come a little bit closer  
I'm all alone  
And the night is so long  
  
La la-la-la la-la  
La la-la-la la-la  
Ho ho la-la  
La la la-la
