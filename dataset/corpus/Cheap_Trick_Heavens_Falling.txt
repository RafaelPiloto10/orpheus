I will believe  
What I want to believe  
Nobody needs  
To do my thinkin' for me  
I know the score, I'm always out of line  
It's as if I was born in the wrong place in time  
And nobody understands just what's in my mind  
But when I face the light  
Somehow it all seems right  
(Don't) you know it feels like  
Heaven's falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
Speak your mind  
You know you've got the right  
You're not afraid  
You're goin' with me tonight  
Everybody stops, they whisper and stare  
"'Cause tonight we're free to do  
The things they wouldn't dare  
But they will never know  
The little secrets we share  
And when you squeeze my hand  
I know you understand  
(Don't) you know it feels like  
Heaven's falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
In a world only for lovers and fools  
Schemers and dreamers  
Who don't follow the rules  
We gotta run  
Our legs are still young  
We gotta run  
Until our heaven comes  
And when we face the light  
Somehow it all seems right  
(Don't) you know it feels like  
Heaven's falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
(don't) you know it feels like  
Heaven's falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
Heaven's falling, down on me  
Angels calling, calling me  
Angels calling, calling me  
Angels calling, calling me
