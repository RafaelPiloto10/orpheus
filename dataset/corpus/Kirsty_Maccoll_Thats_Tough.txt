Don't tell me the story of your life  
I've heard too much already  
You said you've got problems with your wife  
I'd say the problem's you  
'Cause you never grew up  
And you're running away  
But you're gonna get caught some day  
  
Tell me about it  
Oh, that's tough  
Tell me about it  
Oh, that's tough  
  
So don't tell me the story of your life  
I'd rather watch a movie  
Your Hollywood smile is not enough  
You're giving me the blues  
So when are you going to understand  
I'm not the woman to make you a man  
So if you've got a wife you can talk to you might  
Tell me about it  
Oh, that's tough  
Tell me about it  
Oh, that's tough  
  
I don't want to hear about the time  
You crashed your new Ferrari  
Don't try to impress me with your lies  
I've no respect for you  
'Cause you try to make out  
That you're somebody else  
But you'll never escape yourself  
So when are you going to understand  
I don't intend to be part of your plans  
You've got an obsession you'd like to call love  
Tell me about it  
Oh, that's tough  
Tell me about it  
Oh, that's tough  
  
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me  
That's tough  
I don't wanna hear you tell me  
That's tough  
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me  
That's tough  
So I don't want to hear you tell me that's tough  
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me  
That's tough  
That's tough  
So I don't want to hear you tell me that's tough  
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me  
That's tough  
Oh that's tough  
  
Tell me about it  
Oh, that's tough  
Tell me about it  
Oh, that's tough  
So I don't want to hear you tell me that's tough  
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me  
That's tough  
Oh that's tough
