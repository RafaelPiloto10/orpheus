All alone now  
Except for the memories  
Of what we had and what we knew  
Every time I try to leave it behind me  
I see something that reminds me of you  
Every night the dreams return to haunt me  
Your rosary wrapped around your throat  
I lie awake and sweat, afraid to fall asleep  
I see your face looking back at me, looking back at me  
  
And I raise my head and stare  
Into the eyes of a stranger  
I've always known that the mirror never lies  
People always turn away  
From the eyes of a stranger  
Afraid to know what  
Lies behind the stare  
  
Is this all that's left  
Of my life before me  
Straight jacket memories, sedative highs  
No happy ending like they've always promised  
There's got to be something left for me  
And I raise my head and stare  
Into the eyes of a stranger  
I've always known that the mirror never lies  
People always turn away  
From the eyes of a stranger  
Afraid to know what  
Lies behind the stare (Lies behind my stare)  
  
How many times must I live this tragedy  
How many more lies will they tell me  
All I want is the same as everyone  
Why am I here, and for how long  
  
And I raise my head and stare  
Into the eyes of a stranger  
I've always known that the mirror never lies  
People always turn away  
From the eyes of a stranger  
Afraid to know what  
Lies behind the stare
