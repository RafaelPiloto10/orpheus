[Chorus]  
It's all night  
And it's all right  
Til the sunlight  
This is how the beat goes on  
Big Will  
Tra-Knox  
So hot  
This is how the beat goes on  
Poppin'  
Rockin' n  
Stompin'  
This is how the beat goes on  
Big Will  
Tra- Knox  
So hot  
This is how the beat goes on  
  
It's the bizzi wizza  
Jizzi wizzil  
Bizon wizzay  
Wizzat fizzil  
  
Back again but with a couple of friends  
Thought my reign would end well now I'm rubbing it in  
I'm back yes yes yallin'  
Back again balling  
Out for a couple of years thought I had fallen  
You seen me with Denzel and Russel Crowe  
But yo the movies just a chick on the side I'm in love with the flow  
Time off to be an Oscar nominee now  
Back to the M-I-see to emcee now  
Rockin' the ol heads blazing the youth  
Only rapper had the president raising the roof  
Check the tape checkmate  
Its one mission  
Make your move  
Don't fight submission  
To dawn to dusk  
We on a truss  
Just don't miss the bus  
To jam on with us  
Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is  
How the  
Beat goes on and on and on and  
Me and Tra-Knox keep keeping it on an  
Jokers ain't stop until the morning  
  
So  
Every everybody come feel this  
This union this spirit  
Created from the soul oh yeah  
It's big will (who else)  
And Tra-Knox keeping it real  
Tearing up the club  
We got what you want  
So you cannot front  
Everybody get on the floor  
  
Yo we ain't stopping til the morning  
Me and Tra-Knox keep keeping it on an (keep keep on)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A hip hop superhero  
A ?  
Cape or a suit  
Hit the studio  
Every year or so  
And escape with the loot  
On my down time straight to the links  
I could pack a dance floor a movie theatre or truck from ?  
On Christmas, mom and wife douse em with ice  
AOL, search will smith thousands of sites  
And at the club, hands clapping toes tapping  
Sucker I'm the greatest thing ever happen to rapping (in Ali voice)  
Best shape of my life destined to show ya  
No scrapes or fender benders lead the game total  
Free don't move hip hop mogul  
Philly ain't happy I  
I be the guy to go  
The guy to go  
You know the go to go  
The mega man that got the whole crew like  
Damn will done did it again  
He done stepped up to the plate and he done hit it again  
Yo get them hands up  
Throw your hands up  
Wave em like you don't care  
You like the sound  
Then let me hear you say  
  
[Chorus]
