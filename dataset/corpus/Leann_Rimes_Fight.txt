Hush, Hush why don't you want to talk about it  
Bitch, Bitch you don't need to sugar coat it  
I don't want us to ever get to the point where we can't recover  
Break, Break we're allowed to have our moments  
Go on spell it out there's nothing wrong with being honest  
I can take it, go ahead let it out, lets get it over and done with  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't want to fight anymore  
Cause every minute that we fight is a moment that we could be loving  
Lay down with me tonight  
I don't want to fight  
  
We could start a war with both our tempers  
Tomorrow I bet you anything we won't remember  
Who was right, who was wrong, what we said but we'll regret what we've lost  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Were taking for granted how good that we have it  
Lets laugh til' we cry and get back to what matters  
Oh it matters  
  
[Chorus]
