Here I am believin' words again  
Here I am tryin' to find your love again  
Here I am down on my knees again  
Prayin' for a love  
That we used to know  
  
Both of us know  
How hard it is to love  
And let it go  
Both of us know  
How hard it is to go on living that way  
When so few understand what it means  
To fall in love  
And so few know how hard it is to live without it  
I must have been blind  
I must have been blind  
Lord, I must have been blind  
  
To hold something real  
And not believe it  
To live in her life  
And never trustin'  
To give all you know and never feel it  
To hold back each day  
Until it dies away  
  
Both of us know  
How hard it is to love  
And let it go  
Both of us know  
How hard it is to go on  
Living that way  
When so few undersand what it means  
To fall in love  
And so few know how hard it is to live without it  
I must have been blind  
I must have been blind  
Lord, I must have been blind
