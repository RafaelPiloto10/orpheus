As I'm going down and down  
I have dreamed a better place  
As the world turns round and round  
Sun is always in my fate.  
  
Sometimes you go away  
A million miles away  
Sometimes you don't know where  
Don't worry I'll be there.  
  
Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise  
Can you bring the sun in my way  
Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise  
Can you bring the sun in my life.  
  
Now I close my eyes again  
And I'm thinking to myself  
Will I ever love again  
Hope you'll be a better man  
  
Sometimes you go away  
A million miles away  
Sometimes you don't know where  
Don't worry I'll be there  
  
Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise  
Can you bring the sun in my way  
Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise  
Can you bring the sun in my life  
  
Sometimes you go away  
A million miles away  
Sometimes you don't know where  
Don't worry I'll be there  
  
Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise  
Can you bring the sun in my way  
Can you bring me sunrise can you bring me the sunrise  
Can you bring the sun in my life.
