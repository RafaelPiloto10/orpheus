Don't cut out my paper heart I ain't dyin' anyway  
Take a look at eye full towers Never trust them dirty liars  
Sippin' lemon yellow booze Ol' leadbelly sings the blues  
All dressed up on wedding day Keep on trippin' anyway  
  
I am I am I said I'm not myself I'm not dead and I'm not for sale  
So keep your bankroll lottery eat your salad day deathbed motorcade  
  
Fake the heat and scratch the itch Skinned up knees and salty lips  
I'll breathe your life vicks vapor life and when you binge I purge alike  
Let go it's harder holding on One more trip and I'll be gone  
  
So keep your head up Keep it on, just a whisper I'll be gone  
Take a breath and make it big It's the last you'll ever get  
Break you neck with diamond noose It's the last you'll ever choose  
  
I am I am I said I'm not myself I'm not dead and I'm not for sale  
Hold me closer, closer let me go Let me be just let me be  
I am I am I said I'm not myself I'm not dead and I'm not for sale  
So keep your bankroll lottery eat your salad day deathbed motorcade  
  
I am I am I said I'm not myself I'm not dead and I'm not for sale  
Hold me closer, closer let me go Let me be just let me be  
I am I am I said I'm not myself I'm not dead and I'm not for sale  
So keep your bankroll lottery eat your salad day deathbed motorcade
