Do you curse where you come from,  
Do you swear in the night  
Will it mean much to you  
If I treat you right.  
Do you like what you're doing,  
Would you do it some more  
Or will you stop once and wonder  
What you're doing it for.  
Hey slow Jane, make sense  
Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence.  
  
Do you feel like a remnant  
Of something that's past  
Do you find things are moving  
Just a little too fast.  
Do you hope to find new ways  
Of quenching your thirst,  
Do you hope to find new ways  
Of doing better than your worst.  
Hey slow Jane, let me prove  
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move.  
  
Do it for you,  
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.  
So try to be true,  
Even if it's only in your hazey way.  
  
Can you tell if you're moving  
With no mirror to see,  
If you're just riding a new man  
Looks a little like me.  
Is it all so confusing,  
Is it hard to believe  
When the winter is coming  
Can you sign up and leave.  
Hey slow Jane, live your lie  
Slow, slow jane, fly on by.
