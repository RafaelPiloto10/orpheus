[Verse 1:]  
I knew there was trouble  
So I left Detroit  
I left my old man  
For a plane full of boys  
For telling me that son of a bitch kept it home after dawn  
Always smelling like pig  
He took my share and sealed it in cave  
Probably would have killed me if I had stayed there  
But I had a scheme so cool and so clean  
I got me a ticket one way to Moline  
  
[Chorus:]  
Moline, Moline,  
How have you been?  
Been here before,  
But it must have been a dream  
Moline, you see,  
All rivers turn green  
The Mississippi rises and widens the sea  
Moline, it seems that this is for me  
My name is Nancy but here I'm Coleen  
Yeah, Moline  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Now I love paying ransom  
Life on my own,  
And nothings's better than [?]  
And fast as home  
And someday I'll die and look in our [?]  
I got my eyes in the [?] , that here in Moline  
The place with the chapel on 4th avenue and 12th street  
  
[Chorus:]  
Moline, Moline,  
How have you been?  
I probably been here before,  
But it must've been a dream  
Moline, you see  
All rivers turn green  
The Mississippi rises and widens the sea  
Moline, it seems that this is for me  
You call me Nancy and I live in Moline
