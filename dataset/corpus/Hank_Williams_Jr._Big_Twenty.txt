Move along big twenty, big twenty move along  
You've got a master and you've got a home  
Move along big twenty big twenty move along  
You've got the muscle and you've got the bone  
  
Went out on the Mojave with a twenty mule team  
Ten tons of borax and a muleskinners dream  
We'll soon be a-winin' and a-dinin' I know  
With a cute little filly in the town of Reno  
  
The Apaches are restless there's smoke in the sky  
But I'm too old for scalpin' and I'm too young to die  
But they'll soon be around us like ants on a hill  
Bringin' this muleskinner up for the kill  
(Here's where I can't remember much)  
  
My mules started runnin' bring big twenty down  
But we're still a-livin' so the story can be told  
How I traded that borax for Apache gold
