If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas  
Then everything I wished for has come true  
You're the single item on my list  
You're my one and only Christmas wish  
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there  
  
I know someone out there knows what I'm saying  
Baby you're a girl who's wishing just like me (yeah, yeah)  
There is one, and you know who you are  
My gift to you is all my heart  
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say  
  
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas  
Then everything I wished for has come true  
You're the single item on my list  
You're my one and only Christmas wish  
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there  
  
In the morning I know everybody's rushing  
To see what's underneath the Christmas tree  
Know what I mean, 'cause I don't find it there  
Underneath the mistletoe is where  
You make my holidays, so hear me when I say  
  
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas  
Then everything I wished for has come true  
You're the single item on my list  
You're my one and only Christmas wish  
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there  
  
Only you can make this, a merry merry Christmas  
There is one, and you know who you are  
My gift to you is all my heart  
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say  
  
You're the only thing I ever get for Christmas  
Everything I wished for has come true  
You're the single item on my list  
You're my one and only Christmas wish  
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there  
  
All I ever wanted was you, this Christmas  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I need you baby  
You're the single item on my list  
You're my one and only Christmas wish  
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, kiss me there  
  
I'll be waiting, kiss me there
