Goddamn you half-Japanese girls  
Do it to me every time  
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello  
And I'm jello, baby  
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me  
I'm the epitome of Public Enemy  
Why you want to go and do me like that?  
Come down on the street and dance with me  
  
I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting  
I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me  
  
I asked you to go to the Green Day concert  
You said you never heard of them  
How cool is that?  
So I went to your room and read your diary:  
"watching Grunge leg-drop New-Jack trough presstable..."  
And then my heart stopped:  
"Listening to Cio-Cio San fall in love all over again."  
  
How stupid is it? I can't talk about it  
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart  
How stupid is it? won't you gimme a minute  
Just come up to me and say "hello" to my heart  
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too  
And maybe you just don't know what to do  
Or maybe you're scared to say: "I'm falling for you"  
  
I wish I could get my head out of the sand  
'Cause I think we'd make a good team  
And you would keep my fingernails clean  
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize  
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes without shakin', and I ain't fakin'  
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon
