Just when I found myself  
Back against the wall  
You saved my life  
With a telephone call  
  
Far across the sea  
You thought of me  
I never thought I'd ever see  
The happy days you brought to me  
  
Lifesaver  
Lifesaver  
Lifesaver  
Lifesaver  
Lifesaver  
Lifesaver  
Hey lifesaver  
Lifesaver

You're a lifesaver honey  
I'm a lot braver too  
You're a lifesaver baby  
  
Do anything for you  
You're a lifesaver honey  
I'm a lot braver too  
You're a lifesaver baby  
  
I'd do anything for you  
You're a lifesaver honey  
You're a lifesaver honey  
  
I'm a lot braver too

You're a lifesaver baby
