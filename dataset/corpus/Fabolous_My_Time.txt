Yea  
  
Go hard today  
The past is the past you know  
Can't worry the past cause that yesterday  
It's a new day bro  
I'm a put it on the line cause it's my time  
My day gotta do it now  
Hey hey hey hey  
I gotta stay on my grind cause it's my time (hey)  
My time (hey) my time (hey)  
If your with me let me hear you say common  
Ma ma ma ma (dah dah dah dah dah)  
If your with me let me hear you say  
Ma ma ma ma (dah dah dah dah dah)  
It's my time  
  
Guess what time it is my my my time  
You can check your I phone better say it's I-time  
I don't even need a watch I don't even see a clock  
Soon as a I walk in it feel like me o'clock  
Give me a clock every time I check  
Singers don't measure up and try and blame the Pyrex  
Damn I'ma do it bigger than a 5-ex  
Can't ride with an L so I don't drive Lex  
Games so bickery so full of trickery  
Nursery rhyming hickory dickory  
Blowing that side the hood call it pickory  
Biggie puffy busta victory  
  
[Chorus]  
Go hard today  
Can't worry the past cause that yesterday  
I'm a put it on the line cause it's my time  
Hey hey hey hey  
I gotta stay on my grind cause it's my time (hey)  
My time (hey) my time (hey)  
If your with me let me hear you say (c'mon)  
Ma ma ma ma (dah dah dah dah dah)  
If your with me let me hear you say  
Ma ma ma ma (dah dah dah dah dah)  
It's my time  
  
My time is more like fly time  
Don't call to gettin' dressed call it in a sky time  
If you ain't a pilot you probably couldn't style it  
Unless you was a stewardess you wonder what to do with this  
First I take the time out then I put the time in  
Money ain't everything it's more about the timing  
So I got the water mark flawless diamonds  
In other words that's called perfect timing  
I feel like a favor I feel like a savor  
They clockin' my neck I feel like I'm flavor  
I go so hard  
Damn, street fi di di di damn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
O-Nine all mine, it's been a few years  
Now its me, bout time  
You know I've got committed with it since I've been up in the zone  
Sign the dotted line  
Now is on  
So y'all better check your wrist piece, why?  
Cause its time to make history, yeah  
Just hop up here in this hit streak  
Howda howda howda hell you gonna evict me?  
You know I'm here stay never cocky now  
With bottles we poppin' now  
No telling where we stopping now  
And I represent the chick a-g-o  
On the track with F-A-B-O  
You know we  
  
[Chorus]
