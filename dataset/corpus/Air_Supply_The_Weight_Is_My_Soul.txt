In the night when you're lonely and you can't find a word for how you feel  
There's a place that you know of where the lights are so low they're hardly
real,  
In a chair on the front veranda is a weight with a thought to set you free.  
The weight is my soul  
  
The weight is my soul, come to me.  
I can see through the streetlights where the evening air is turning round  
All I hear is the hangin' of the moon and the stars on the sky.  
In a chair on the front veranda is a weight with a thought to set you free.  
  
The weight is my soul  
The weight is my soul, come to me.  
Have you thought of the times when your heart and your mind are free  
Have you thought of the times when your heart and your mind are free  
  
In the night when you're lonely and you can't find a word for how you feel,  
There's a place that you know of where the lights are so low they're hardly
real,  
In a chair on the front veranda is a weight with a thought to set you free  
The weight is my soul  
  
The weight is my soul, come to me.
