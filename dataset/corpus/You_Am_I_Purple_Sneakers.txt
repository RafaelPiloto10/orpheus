Had a scratch only you could itch  
Underneath the Glebe Point Bridge  
And now every boy in a knitted vest  
Has got some precedent  
  
So we took a personality pill  
And something red to swill  
And now every fire has gone out  
in every heart that wanted to kill  
Let's call it a day  
  
Every thought that once had a sound  
We'll have to hide 'til no one is around  
'cause there ain't no room in the city today  
For explanations that you just can't say  
Found out what shame can mean  
In purple sneakers and grey jeans  
And every walked to a school that once made sense  
Sure felt like an accident  
Let's call it a day  
  
For every trouble you found  
There's a drink to lose it and drown  
But do you need somebody, to feel somebody?  
  
Every day that once had a sound  
We'll have to hide 'til no one is in town  
I don't hate I just feel better  
When no one else is around  
So we'll take a personality pill  
And something red to swill  
And now every fire has gone out  
i every heart that wanted to kill  
Let's call it a day  
  
For every trouble you found  
There's a drink to lose it and drown  
But do you need somebody, to feel somebody?  
  
You can shave a million ways  
To make damn sure that the twelve in you stays  
But do you need somebody, to feel somebody?
