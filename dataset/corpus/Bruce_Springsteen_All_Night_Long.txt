I was born saved in heaven  
It was nothing like the promised land  
Raised in a good christian house  
Underneath a good christian hand  
I was schooled down and dirty  
Signed a note back to town  
It was there that the workers slaved all week  
Waiting for payday to come around  
  
Break out, come on if you're coming  
Cause baby i just can't stay  
I want to take out the walls of this joint  
I want to blow this town away  
  
Now i ain't into fast livin'  
I ain't into dying young  
And i ain't looking to be forgiven  
For any of the stupid things that i've done  
  
For the ones who once had a notion  
A notion it was good to be alive  
Feel the spark, the rush of emotion  
I want to break out baby tonight  
  
I want to dream, that i got a place  
I want to scream in somebody's face  
Make it seem, get out of this muddy race  
All night long  
  
Well all little kings lose their thrones tonight  
All you little pretty things better learn to sleep alone tonight  
It was down in the cool dirty living  
With the man with the master plan  
Some girl who can beg forgiveness  
And a ticket to the promised land  
  
Down where they'll tear your guts out  
Making out what you're all about  
Making while we were blasting like a ??  
I want out i want out i want out  
  
Want out to the outside  
Well i'm a small fool  
I want to shout i'm bound for nothing  
I want to shout about something too  
  
For the ones who once had a notion  
It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive  
I feel the heat, the rush of devotion  
I want to tear out baby tonight  
  
I wanna do what ain't ever been done  
I wanna win what ain't ever been won  
I wanna lose blow it all away  
I wanna lose what i've always won  
Prove it all night long  
  
I wanna know that i got a place  
I wanna go where i can see your face  
I wanna rock the roof off this place  
I want you to know  
I wanna live
