Sing, Michael, sing-on the route of the nineteen bus  
Hear them sayin'  
How you get a rude and a reckless?  
Don't you be so crude and a feckless  
You been drinking brew for breakfast  
Rudie can't fail  
  
So we reply  
I know that my life make you nervous  
But I tell you that I can't live in service  
Like the doctor who was born for a purpose  
Rudie can't fail  
  
I went to the market to realize my soul  
'Cause what I need I just don't have  
First they curse, then they press me till I hurt  
We say Rudie can't fail  
  
We hear them sayin'  
Now first you must cure your temper  
Then you find a job in the paper  
You need someone for a savior  
Oh, Rudie can't fail  
  
We reply  
Now we get a rude and a reckless  
We been seen lookin' cool an' a speckless  
We been drinking brew for breakfast  
So Rudie can't fail  
  
Okay!  
So where you want to go today?  
Hey boss man!  
You're looking pretty smart  
In your chicken skin suit  
  
You think you're pretty hot  
In your pork pie hat  
But...Rudie can't fail  
Look out, look out...  
Sky juice!...ten cents a bottle!
