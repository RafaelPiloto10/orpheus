I'm a broken biscuit  
From the cookie jar  
I'm a total misfit  
In the puzzle that's so far  
Careful not to crush me  
In those hungry hands  
Careful not to rush me  
Into this fine romance  
  
[Chorus]  
I stand under the weight of your words  
Hoping you won't find me  
I'm terrified of everything I've heard,  
Don't swallow  
  
I'm a damaged dollar  
That no one wants to change  
I'm a bunch of flowers  
That need to be arranged  
Careful what you wish for  
Careful what you say  
I've lowered all my armor  
Risking the pain again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm standing on the edge of your words  
That is where you'll find me  
I'm paralyzed by all the things that hurt  
But I'm coming  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm standing on the edge of your words  
Standing on the edge of your words  
I'm paralyzed by all the things that hurt  
But I'm coming
