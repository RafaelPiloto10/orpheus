It was three o'clock in the afternoon, we were in a cafe  
You ordered what you usually do  
I looked in your eyes you looked down in that moment  
What you couldn't say, baby I already knew  
  
It's either you or me and I don't wanna be  
The one who makes believe for too long  
  
I don't wanna be the one this time  
I don't wanna watch us fall apart  
Gonna have to leave it all behind  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
No, I don't wanna watch us fade  
But how can we remain the way we are  
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
I gave all I had, everything I had needed you to give it back  
Tell me was that too much to ask  
Felt it on your lips, empty kisses, have a story all their own  
How I wish it wasn't so  
  
True love often dies and someone always tries  
To keep it alive for too long  
  
I don't wanna be the one this time  
I don't wanna watch us fall apart  
Gonna have to leave it all behind  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
No, I don't wanna watch us fade  
But how can we remain the way we are  
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
Lord, knows I've tried so hard standing in front of you  
Knowing that this is goodbye  
  
I don't wanna be the one this time  
I don't wanna watch us fall apart  
Gonna have to leave it all behind  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
I don't wanna let you go  
How can we remain the way we are  
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
I don't wanna be the one this time  
I don't wanna watch us fall apart  
Gonna have to leave it all behind  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
No, I don't wanna watch us fade  
But how can we remain the way we are  
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away  
Even if it breaks my heart  
  
Even if it breaks my heart, oh no  
Even if it breaks my heart  
I gotta walk away  
Yeah, yeah it's gonna break my heart
