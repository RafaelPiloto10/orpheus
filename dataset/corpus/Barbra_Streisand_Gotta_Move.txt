Gotta move, gotta get out  
Gotta leave this place, gotta find some place  
Some other place, some brand new place  
Some place where each face that I see  
Won't be staring back at me  
Telling me what to be and how to be it  
Some place where I can just be me  
Gotta move, got to get out  
  
Gotta leave this town, gotta find some town  
Some big new town, some bright new town  
Some new town with new places, new lives  
And most of all some new faces  
Gotta find a man, a new man  
  
A man who won't worry 'bout where I go  
A man who won't ask how I learned what I know  
A man who will know that you've gotta be free  
A man who will know when to just let me be  
Gotta move, gotta get out  
  
Gotta change my life, gotta find my life  
I'll find me a place in some new town and baby  
And when I find me that new place, then maybe ours,  
Gotta leave this town  
Gotta leave this place  
Gotta find a new man  
  
Gotta move!
