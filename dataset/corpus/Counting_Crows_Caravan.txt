And the caravan is on it's way  
I can hear the merry gypsies play  
Mama, Mama, oh will you never run away?  
She laughs playing with her radio  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
And the caravan has all my friends  
And they will stay with me until the end  
Gypsies robbing sleep in the road  
Tell me everything I need to know  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
Turn up your radio  
Let me hear your song  
Switch on your electric light  
So we can get down to what is really wrong  
Because I long just to hold you tight  
So that I can feel you  
Sweet lady, oh Mother Night  
I shall revere you  
Turn it up  
Turn it up  
Little bit higher radio  
Turn it up
