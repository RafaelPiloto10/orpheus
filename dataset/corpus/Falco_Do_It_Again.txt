In the mornin' you go gunnin'  
For the man who stole your water  
And you fire 'till he is done in  
But they catch you at the border  
And the mourners are all singin'  
As they drag you by your feet  
But the hangman isn't hangin'  
So they put you on the street  
  
[Chorus:]  
You go back, Jack  
Do it again  
Wheel' turnin' round and 'round  
You go back, Jack  
Do it again  
  
When you know she's no climber  
Then you find your only friend  
In a room with your two timer  
And you're sure you're near the end  
Then you love a little wild one  
And she brings you only sorrow  
And all the time you know she's smilin'  
You'll be the one on your knees tomorrow  
  
[Chorus:]  
Do gehst back, back  
Do it again  
Wheel's turnin' round and round  
Do gehst back, back  
Do it again  
  
Now your swear and kick and beg us  
That you're not a gambling man  
Then you find you're back in Vegas  
With a handle in your hand  
Your black cards can make you money  
So you hide them when you're able  
In the land of milk and honey  
You must put them on the table  
  
You go back, Jack  
Do it again  
Das Rad Umschliesst den Kreis  
Und do gehst back, back  
Do it again
