Oh, this is a story 'bout a guy named Al  
And he lived in a sewer with his hamster pal  
But the sanitation workers really didn't approve  
So he packed up his accordion and had to move  
  
To a city in Ohio where he lived in a tree  
And he worked in a nasal decongestant factory  
And he played on the company bowling team  
And every single night he had a strange, recurring dream  
  
Where he was wearing leiderhosen in a vat of sour cream  
But that's really not important to the story  
  
Well, the very next year he met a dental hygenist  
With a spatula tattoed on her arm (on her arm)  
But he didn't keep in touch, then he lost her number  
Then he got himself a job on a tater tot farm  
  
And he spent his life savings on a split-level cave  
20 miles below the surface of the Earth (of the Earth)  
And he really makes a mighty fine jelly bean and pickle sandwich  
For what it's worth  
  
Then one day Al was in the forest, trying to get a tan  
When he heard the tortured screaming of a funny little man  
He was caught in a bear trap and Al set him free  
And the guy that he rescued was as grateful as can be  
  
And it turns out he's a big-shot producer on TV  
So he gave Al a contract and what do you know?  
Now he's got his own very Weird Al Show!
