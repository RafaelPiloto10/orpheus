One day, I found a love  
Offering peace unto my soul  
I been so happy ever since that day  
Nothing but joy unspeakable  
  
And I know that it came from above  
And I'll let it show  
And I'll let it go  
Take it everywhere I go  
  
Day by day  
I'm going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part  
  
Sometimes, I feel so inspired  
And other times I just wanna give up  
That's when I feel Your presence  
Giving me confidence and trust  
  
And I know that it come from above  
And I'll let it show  
And I'll let go  
Take it everywhere I go  
  
Day by day  
I'm going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part  
  
I'm glad I found Your love  
(It's unconditional and it's unconditional)  
And I'll never let it go  
(Let it go, let it go)  
  
I know that it came from above  
And I'll let it show  
And I'll let it go  
Take it everywhere I go  
  
Day by day  
I'm going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part  
  
Day by day  
I'm going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part  
  
Day by day  
I'm going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part
