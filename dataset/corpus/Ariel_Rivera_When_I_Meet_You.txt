There I was an empty piece of a shell  
Just mindin' my own world  
Without even knowin'  
What love and life were all about  
  
Then you came...  
You brought me out of the shell  
You gave the world to me  
And before I knew  
There I was so in love with you  
  
You gave me a reason for my being  
And I love what I'm feelin'  
You gave me a meaning to my life  
Yes, I've gone beyond existing  
And it all began when I met you  
  
I love the touch of your hair  
And when I look in your eyes  
I just know, I know I'm on to something good  
And I'm sure my love for you will endure  
Your love will light up my world  
And take all my cares away  
With the aching part of me  
  
You gave me a reason for my being  
And I love what I'm feelin'  
You gave me a meaning to my life  
Yes, I've gone beyond existing  
And it all began when I met you  
  
You taught me how to love  
You showed me how tomorrow and today  
My life is diff'rent from the yesterday  
And you, you taught me how to love  
And darling I will always cherish you  
Today, tomorrow and forever...  
  
And I'm sure when evening comes around  
I know we'll be making love like never before  
My love, who could ask for more?  
  
You gave me a reason for my being  
And I love what I'm feelin'  
You gave me a meaning to my life  
Yes, I've gone beyond existing  
And it all began when I met you  
When I met you  
  
You gave me a reason for my being  
And I love what I'm feelin'  
You gave me a meaning to my life  
Yes, I've gone beyond existing  
And it all began when I met you  
When I met you...  
When I met you...
