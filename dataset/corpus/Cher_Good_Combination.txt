Baby don't you worry  
When things ain't going right  
Don't be in a hurry  
To run away when you're uptight  
Love is sweet if we stick together  
Solve our problems for forever  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause we got a good combination  
Yeah we got a good combination  
Can't you see you and me  
Got the key to be happy  
Yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah  
Yeah oh yeah  
  
Baby when you're crying  
I'll love your tears away  
And I will always be trying  
To keep you happy through the years  
As long as we just keep on kissing  
There's nothing in the world  
We won't be missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As long as we just keep on kissing  
There's nothing in the world  
We won't be missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah (We got a good combination)  
Yeah (We got a good combination)  
Yeah (We got a good combination)  
Yeah (We got a good combination)  
Yeah (We got a good combination)
