(recording of july 28 1966, san francisco)  
(spoken: this is an ol' little richard tune called 'oh my soul')  
  
Oh, my soul!  
Oh, my soul!  
  
Baby baby baby, give me all the love you've got  
Don't you know you've got the best love in the house  
I said love, I said love, oh, my soul!  
  
Baby baby baby love your daddy all night long  
Baby, baby, love you all night long  
Love you, I'm gonna kiss you, oh, my soul!  
  
Now baby baby, well you drive me crazy  
Oh, baby baby, well you drive me crazy  
I said love, I said love, oh, my soul!  
  
Baby baby, you drive me crazy  
Baby baby, ah you drive me crazy  
I said love, I said love...  
  
Baby baby, drive me crazy, love you all night long  
Oh, baby, love you, love you all night long  
I said baby, I said baby, oh, my soul!  
  
(spoken: thank you very much)
