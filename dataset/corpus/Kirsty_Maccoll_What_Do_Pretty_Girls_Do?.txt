She was a party girl, stayed up 'til the small hours  
Now she's embarrassing and everybody laughs  
At the girl with the face that could drive her baby wild  
Now wasn't she the child with everything?  
You should have seen her with her head held high  
Now what do pretty girls do?  
She used to be the apple of his eye  
Now what do pretty girls do?  
She went through such a lot and never even learned  
That even pretty girls can get their fingers burned  
She's got a cabin in a town upon the border  
She gets in trouble with the local law and order  
Everybody's happy when she isn't at the door  
She sends out invitations to everyone, they don't come  
And the phone ain't ringing for her now  
You should have seen her with her head held high  
Now what do pretty girls do?  
She used to be the same as me or you  
Now what do pretty girls do?  
Well they get older just like everybody else  
She never thought she'd have to take care of herself  
You should have seen her with her head held high  
Now what do pretty girls do?  
She used to be the apple of his eye  
Now what do pretty girls do?  
Collecting all the records and the posters  
Of the people that she knew and they knew  
That she'd get older just like everybody else  
She never thought she'd have to take care of herself
