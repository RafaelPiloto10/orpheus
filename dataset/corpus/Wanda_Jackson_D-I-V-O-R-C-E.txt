Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man  
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand  
Like T-O-why or maybe S-you-are-P-are-I-S-E  
The words we're hiding from him now tear the heart right out of me  
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today me and little J-O-E will be going
away  
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me  
I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E  
Watch him smile he thinks it's Christmas or his fifth birthday  
Cause he thinks see-you-S-T-O-D-why spells fun or play  
I spell out all the hurting words and turn my head when I speak  
But I can't spell away this hurt that's dripping down my cheeks  
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today...  
I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E
