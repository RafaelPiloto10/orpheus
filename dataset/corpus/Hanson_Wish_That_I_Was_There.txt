The sun has fallen  
Another day gone without you  
My heart keeps calling  
I seem to forget my lonely days  
It's more than a feeling  
It's something that can't be explained  
  
[Chorus]  
I wish that I was there1, I wish that I was there  
When you're not here, I wish that I was there  
I wish that I was there, I wish that I was there  
When you're not here, I wish that I was there  
  
You were falling  
Now I'm coming 'round again  
I was calling  
'Cause without you it's the end  
I just want to see you a little more  
I just want to be with you some more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you make me feel  
Won't you take me when you're not here?  
It's been raining here  
And I just want you to be near  
I just want to see you a little more  
I just want to dream of you some more  
I just want to see you a little more  
I just want to be with you some more  
  
[Chorus: x2]
