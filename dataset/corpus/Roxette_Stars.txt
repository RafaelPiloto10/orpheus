You keep on walkin' on the other side  
Other side, other side  
You keep on walkin' on the other side  
Other side, other side  
Wherever you go, I'm going with you  
Shouldn't you know I'm bound to follow  
Whatever you say, whatever you do  
I give you a clue, I'm gonna follow  
  
And the stars will show  
Where the waters flow  
Where the gardens grow  
That's where I'll meet you  
  
Why don't you let me, let me come along  
Na na na, na na na  
Why don't you open, make me come along  
Na na na, na na na  
Wherever you go, I'm going for you  
Oh, I was truly born to follow  
Like fire and wood and paper and glue  
Only a few were born to follow  
  
And the stars will show  
Where the waters flow  
Where the gardens grow  
That's where I'll meet you  
And the sun will glow  
Melting all the snow  
Knowing all I know  
That's where I'll meet you  
  
Stars will show  
Where the waters flow  
Where the gardens grow  
That's where I'll meet you  
And the sun will glow  
Melting all the snow  
Knowing all I know  
That's where I'll meet you  
  
And the stars will show  
Every breeze will blow  
Knowing all I know  
That's where I'll meet you
