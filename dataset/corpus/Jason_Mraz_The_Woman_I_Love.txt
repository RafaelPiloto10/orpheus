Maybe I annoy you with my choices  
Well, you annoy me sometimes too with your voice  
But that ain't enough for me  
To move out and move on  
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love  
  
We don't have to hurry  
You can take as long as you want  
I'm holdin' steady  
My heart's at home  
With my hand behind you  
I will catch you if you fall  
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love  
  
Sometimes the world can make you feel  
You're not welcome anymore  
And you beat yourself up  
You let yourself get mad  
And in those times when you stop lovin'  
That woman I adore  
You could relax  
Because, babe, I got your back  
I got you  
  
No, I don't wish to change you  
You got it under control  
You wake up each day different  
Another reason for me to keep holdin' on  
I'm not attached to any way you're showing up  
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love  
Yeah I'm gonna love you, oh yeah  
I'm gonna love you  
You're the woman I love
