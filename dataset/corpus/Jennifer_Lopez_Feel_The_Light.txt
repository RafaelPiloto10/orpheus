[Intro]  
Here I go  
Here I go  
Feel better now  
Feel better now  
  
Here I go  
Here I go  
It's better now  
Feel better now  
  
[Verse 1]  
Do you remember when we fell under  
Did you expect me to reason with thunder  
I still remember when time was frozen  
What seemed forever was just a moment  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Hurry up, hurry up  
There's no more waiting  
We're still worth saving  
  
[Chorus]  
Feel the light  
Shining in the dark of night  
Remember what we forgot  
I know it's a long shot  
But we're bringing it all back  
We're bringing it all back  
  
Feel the light  
Shining like the stars tonight  
Remember what we forgot  
I know it's a long shot  
But we're bringing it all back  
We're bringing it all back  
  
[Hook]  
Here I go  
Here I go  
Feel better now  
Feel better now  
  
Here I go  
Here I go  
It's better now  
Feel better now  
  
[Verse 2]  
I still remember when things were broken  
But put together, the cracks were closing  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Hurry up, hurry up  
There's no more waiting  
We're still worth saving  
  
[Chorus]  
Feel the light  
Shining in the dark of night  
Remember what we forgot  
I know it's a long shot  
But we're bringing it all back  
We're bringing it all back  
  
Feel the light  
Shining like the stars tonight  
Remember what we forgot  
I know it's a long shot  
But we're bringing it all back  
We're bringing it all back  
  
[Bridge]  
You and I can have it all tonight  
So let's bring it back to life  
Now we have another chance to fly  
Another chance to make it right  
  
[Chorus]  
Feel the light  
Shining in the dark of night  
Remember what we forgot  
I know it's a long shot  
  
Feel the light  
Shining like the stars tonight  
Remember what we forgot  
I know it's a long shot  
But we're bringing it all back  
We're bringing it all back  
  
[Outro]  
Here we go  
Here we go  
Feel better now  
Feel better now  
  
Here we go  
Here we go  
It's better now  
Feel better now
