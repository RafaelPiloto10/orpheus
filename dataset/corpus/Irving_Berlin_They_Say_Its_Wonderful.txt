They say that falling in love is wonderful  
It's wonderful, so they say  
And with a moon up above, it's wonderful  
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I know I never read it  
I only know they tell me that love is grand  
And  
  
The thing that's known as romance  
Is wonderful, wonderful, in every way  
So they say  
  
You leave your house some morning  
And without any warning  
You're stopping people, shouting that love is grand  
And  
  
To hold a girl in your arms  
Is wonderful, wonderful, in every way  
So they say
