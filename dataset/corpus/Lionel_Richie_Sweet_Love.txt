Show me a river that's so deep  
Show me a mountain so high  
I'll show you love that'll last forever  
Flying high, so high  
  
Ah, show me a place where dreams are for dreamers  
And all the things you wish come true, yeah  
I'd wish the world had all happy people  
Then there'd be no more wishing to do  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet love  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet love  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh  
  
Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,  
Sweet, sweet love  
  
Sun shines over the rainbow  
High on a hill  
Take a ride on a magic carpet  
And you know its for real  
  
The world is filled with all the lonely people  
Trying to find their way  
All they need is a hand to guide them  
To a brighter day  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet love (sweet, sweet love)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (well, well)  
Sweet love (sweet, sweet love)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, yeah  
Sweet love  
  
Sweet love that comes through the ages  
Reach out and touch my soul  
Gave my life so much meaning  
And everyone a heart of gold  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Sweet love (well, well, well)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (sweet, sweet, sweet love)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (sweet sweet, sweet sweet love)  
Ooo ooo  
  
Oh you needed love (ohh sweet love)  
Sweet, sweet love  
(Ohh ohh) Sweet love  
  
I know you're searchin'  
I know you're searchin', for a little love  
A little peace and understanding  
And I know it's been hard tryin' to find your way  
But you got to keep on searchin' harder day by day  
'Cause I want you, and you, you, you, you, you, you, you you and you  
To stand on up, yes sir  
Put a little love in your heart  
And little heart in your love  
Together we can make a way  
Listen to me  
Don't wonder to hard ah, of what I trying to say  
'Cause it's love, love's the only way  
  
Oh, nothin' but love  
Oh oh (Love)  
Sweet love (Sweet love, ow)  
Oh, oh, oh, (When you're down and out and you can't see your way)  
Sweet love (And you need a friend, well-ell-ell)  
  
Oh, oh, oh, (Just call on love, love)  
Sweet love (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
