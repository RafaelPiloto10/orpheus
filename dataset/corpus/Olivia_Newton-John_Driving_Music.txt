I'm a taxi driver on an all-nighter  
Don't want to fall asleep at the wheel  
Play me some feel  
4 AM business is slow  
I listen to my radio  
If no one flags me down, I turn up the sound  
Moving to the beat  
I cruise the empty streets  
Changing the gears  
Filling up my ears  
Help me stay awake  
Don't take a commercial break  
I need another fare  
So stay on the air  
Won't you play me some driving music  
Won't you play me some driving music  
I'm a daydreamer  
My speedometer says  
I'd better take it slow  
Or my speaker's gonna blow up  
Help me stay awake  
Don't take a commercial break  
I need another fare  
So stay on the air  
Won't you play me some driving music  
Won't you play me some driving music  
Please won't you play me my request  
I want to hear it one more time  
Just for luck  
Spin it again 'fore the sun comes up  
Seems like I'm always changing dials  
Station to station, mile after mile  
Won't you play me some driving music  
Won't you play me some driving music
