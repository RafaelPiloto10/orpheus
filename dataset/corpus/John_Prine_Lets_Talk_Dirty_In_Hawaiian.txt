Well, I packed my bags and bought myself a ticket  
For the land of the tall palm tree  
Aloha Old Milwaukee, Hello Waikiki  
I just stepped down from the airplane  
When I heard her say,  
"Waka waka nuka licka, waka waka nuka licka  
Would you like a lei? Eh?"  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian  
Whisper in my ear  
Kicka pooka mok a wa wahini  
Are the words I long to hear  
Lay your coconut on my tiki  
What the hecka mooka mooka dear  
Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian  
Say the words I long to hear  
  
It's a ukulele Honolulu sunset  
Listen to the grass skirts sway  
Drinking rum from a pineapple  
Out on Honolulu Bay  
The steel guitars all playing  
While she's talking with her hands  
Gimme gimme oka doka make a wish and wanta polka  
Words I understand Hey!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I boughta lota junka with my moolah  
And sent it to the folks back home  
I never had the chance to dance the hula  
Well, I guess I should have known  
When you start talking to the sweet wahini  
Walking in the pale moonlight  
Ohka noka whatta setta knocka-rocka-sis-boom-boccas  
Hope I said it right Oh!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian  
Say the words I long to hear  
Aloha
