For the last time  
I watched Old Man Took bait his hook  
And then throw his line  
Pick up his wine  
  
He's a friend of mine  
Known him all my life and his wife  
'Neath the swayin' pine  
And the clingin' vine  
Just before he left  
  
He said now young man  
Take good care don't let the bugs bite  
Please make sure to say a word at night  
For all your brothers feeling blue  
Blue, blue, blue  
All the time  
  
So I stayed awhile  
Took my tea alone, called it home  
Like a playing child  
Running wild  
  
Heard a bluejay call  
Said we got you now  
Hope you bow  
To the old man's word  
I'm sure you heard  
Just before he left  
  
He said now young man  
Take good care don't let the bugs bite  
Please make sure to say a word at night  
For all your brothers feeling blue  
Blue, blue, blue  
All the time  
  
Now young man  
Take good care don't let the bugs bite  
Please make sure to say a word at night  
For all your brothers feeling blue  
Feeling blue  
Feeling blue  
Feeling blue  
Feeling blue  
Feeling blue  
Feeling blue  
Feeling blue  
Feeling blue ..
