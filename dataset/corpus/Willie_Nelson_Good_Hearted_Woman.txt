A long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way  
And the good life he promised ain't what she's living today  
But she never complains of the bad times or the bad things he's done  
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come  
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man  
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand  
And through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world hand in
hand  
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man  
  
Now he likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends  
And when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again  
Though she don't understand him but she does the best that she can  
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man  
She's a good hearted woman...  
She's a good hearted woman...
