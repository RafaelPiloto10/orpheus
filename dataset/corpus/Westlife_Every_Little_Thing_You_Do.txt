Hello, let me know if you hear me  
Hello, if you want to be near, let me know  
And I'll never let you go  
  
Hey love,  
When you ask what I feel, I say love  
When you ask how I know, I say trust  
  
And if that's not enough'  
  
It's every little thing you do  
That makes me fall in love with you  
There isn't a way that I can show you  
Ever since I've come to know you  
It's every little thing you say  
That makes me want to feel this  
There's not a thing that I can point to  
'Cause it's every little thing you do  
  
Don't ask why,  
Let's just feel what we feel, 'cause sometimes,  
It's the secret that keeps it alive  
  
But if you need a reason why'  
  
It's every little thing you do  
That makes me fall in love with you  
There isn't a way that I can show you  
Ever since I've come to know you  
It's every little thing you say  
That makes me want to feel this  
There's not a thing that I can point to  
'Cause it's every little thing you do  
  
Is it your smile or your laugh or your heart?  
Does it really matter why I love you?  
Anywhere there a crowd, you stand out  
Can't you see why they can't ignore you?  
If you want to know  
Why I can't let go  
Let me explain to you  
That every little dream comes true with every little thing you do  
  
It's everything, everything you do  
That makes me fall in love with you  
It's everything, everything you say  
That makes me feel this way
