A round of applause, you got what you want  
Take a good look at what you give up  
Because I'm telling you  
A heart can't be unbroken, oh, oh  
  
And can you remember how I kiss you  
Recall the sweet taste in your mouth  
'Cause baby, the memory is all you get now  
And I'm moving, moving, moving on  
  
All that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
Does every morning make you happy?  
And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep?  
I hope you find it's easy to forget me, oh, oh  
  
I hope you don't feel anything when you see me  
I wonder if you're out there having fun  
I hope you get all that you really wanted  
'Cause I'm moving, moving, moving on  
  
Don't you see the light has changed  
And nothing looks the same  
Just shadows on the ground  
And if you listen carefully you'll hear the sound  
  
All that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
(All that you want)  
'Cause I didn't  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
('Cause I didn't)  
All that you want  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
('Cause I didn't)
