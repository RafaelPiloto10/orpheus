Love comes to everyone some are weak some strong  
I'm not strong today  
They've took her back, brought the curtain down  
What can I do now, I'm afraid to think about it.  
  
[Chorus]  
What a life, gets better as it goes along  
What a life, gets better as it goes along  
Been in love, been left standing till I said is that what I want,  
Oh no there's got to be another smile on my face  
I don't care about the money I make or what it can do  
I'm alive and that's what's important to me  
I don't need someone to tell me you'll get along, you'll get along  
Who to love who to watch over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's an old man been calling me for a long time  
I'm never able to get his face off my mind  
He always said to me take it easy take it easy  
And all the things you want will come easy, will come easy.  
What a life, what a life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He always said to me take it easy take it easy  
And all the things you want will come easy, will come easy  
What a life, what a life,  
  
[Chorus]
