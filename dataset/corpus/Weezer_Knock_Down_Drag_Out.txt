Any day now you'll call me up on the phone  
Say you love me more than you ever did before  
  
It's all that I can do right now  
To make it up to you somehow  
And meet you on the other side of home  
  
Take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war  
That we're waging on each other forever more  
  
It's all that I can do right now  
To make it up to you somehow  
And meet you on the other side of home  
Say you love me now
