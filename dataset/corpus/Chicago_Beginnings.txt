When I'm with you,  
It doesn't matter where we are,  
Or what we're doing,  
I'm with you that's all that matters  
  
Time passes much too quickly  
When we're together laughing  
I wish I could sing it to you. whoa-oh  
Wish I could sing it to you  
  
Woah  
Woah  
Mostly I'm silent  
Silent  
Try and think of the right words to say  
  
When I kiss you,  
I feel a thousand different feelings,  
A pletora of chills  
All over my body.  
And when I feel them,  
I quickly try to decide which one  
I should try to put into words, woah-oh  
Try to put into words  
Woah  
Woah  
Mostly I'm silent  
Silent  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
Silent  
  
Only the beginning  
Of what I want to feel forever  
Yes, only the beginning  
Only just the start  
I've got to get you into my life, mama  
Got to get you next to me  
Yes, only the beginning,  
Only just the start  
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey  
Oh, all right
