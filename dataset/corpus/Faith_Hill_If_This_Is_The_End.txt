Our love's the moon  
Our love's the kingdom come  
Our love's a flame  
Our love's His will be done  
  
Our love's a jewel,  
A diamond in the rough  
But you don't want it  
You don't want to take  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is the end  
I don't want to know  
This time  
If this is the end  
I don't want to go  
This time  
If this is the end  
  
Our love's true  
Our love's the rising sun  
Our love's in bloom  
Our love has just begun  
Our love is proof  
Of what was yet to come  
But you don't want it  
You don't want to take  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was so easy  
We were so young  
It's only natural to come undone  
At the end of this evening  
Before the rise of the sun  
You're coming with me  
You're coming with me, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to know  
I just want to bide my time  
If this is the end  
I don't want to go  
I just want you by my side  
If this is the end...
