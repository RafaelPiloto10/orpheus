It wasn't the valley of death, I was walking in  
It was the valley of confusion for many years  
Different religions, different beliefs  
Undermining my culture  
Looking down upon my tradition  
Making fun of my language  
Telling my children, they have no God  
Finally I can tell them about,  
Shembe is the way  
Chorus  
Oh SHEMBE thank you for showing us the way.  
Shembe nobunazaretha.  
Oh SHEMBE thank you for healing my people.  
Shembe nobunazaretha.  
Shemebe is the way.  
I hear them shoulting Amen,  
At the top of the mountain  
I hear them shouting Uyingcwele  
At the top of the mountain.  
No one will undermine my religion  
No one will undermine my culture anymore,  
Cause God sent him from above, to be with the people.  
Bring them back to what is their own  
Take them back to the ways Of our forefathers.  
Finally I can tell generations and generations  
That Shembe is the way  
Chorus  
Oh Shemebe THANK YOU FOR SHOWING US THE WAY.  
Shembe Nobunazaretha.
