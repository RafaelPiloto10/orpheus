We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,  
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.  
But we all return as we live wo learn,  
That we left our happiness behind.  
  
When they sing you "Look for the Silver Lining,"  
It is silver dollars they're looking for.  
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,  
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.  
  
The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,  
Back in your own back yard,  
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,  
Back in your own back yard.  
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,  
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,  
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,  
Back In Your Own Backyard.
