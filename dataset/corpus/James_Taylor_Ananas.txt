Je t'aime encore means I love you still,  
see'est pour toujours means I always will.  
Tu me manquais trop means I missed you much,  
Je fait ce qu'il faut means I'll do what I must.  
  
Me voici a ta fenetre tous les gens me voient ici.  
Here I am at your window darling  
For all your people to see me.  
  
Ananas laisse moi une fois laisse moi te voir,  
Let me one more time, Ananas.  
Ananas, I'm loping along, hoping you're home,  
Open up and let me on in.  
  
Maybe I rise and maybe I fall,  
Maybe you lie underneath it all,  
I ain't got nothing but for what you see,  
Even my own heart don't belong to me.  
Got your river running in my blood,  
Got your fire burning in my heart.  
You got me falling like a shooting star,  
Just like some tragic work of art.  
  
Ananas laisse moi une fois laisse moi te voir,  
Let me one more time, Ananas.  
Ananas, I'm loping along, hoping you're home,  
Open up and let me on in.  
Here I am at your window baby,  
For all your people to see.  
Howling like a dog in the moonlight,  
Won't you have pity on me?
