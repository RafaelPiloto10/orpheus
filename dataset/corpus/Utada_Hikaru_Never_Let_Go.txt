Let's hide the truth with the best lie  
Let's decieve the reality with the greatest dream  
Even though we're such a couple  
I don't want to lose you  
Say, why are you so uneasy?  
I don't want anything like a stable love  
Let's throw off our shoes together  
And run off barefooted  
-I'll never let go-  
Swimming in the apathy  
I've gone running in the doubts  
-I'll never let go-  
Let's throw off our shoes together  
And run off barefooted  
-I'll never let go-  
Even if your eyes are blinded by the sun  
Don't let go your hand  
-I'll never let go-  
Let's entrust our sadness to the gentle rain  
And recall happiness  
I can't see where we're going  
But I'm not afraid  
Where are our tomorrow selves?  
Let's throw off our shoes together  
And run off barefooted  
-I'll never let go-  
Swimming in the apathy  
I've gone running in the doubts  
-I'll never let go-  
Let's throw off our shoes together  
And run off barefooted  
-I'll never let go-  
Even if your eyes are blinded by the sun  
Don't let go your hand  
-I'll never let go-
