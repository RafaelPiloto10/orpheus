Well, flying across the desert in a TWA  
I saw a woman walking in the sand  
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay  
To meet a brown-eyed, handsome man  
Her destination was a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Way back in history, three thousand years  
In fact, ever since the world began  
There's been a whole lotta good women shedding tears  
Over a brown-eyed, handsome man  
A lot of trouble was a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Well, the Venus de Milo was a beautiful lass  
She had the world in the palm of her hand  
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match  
To win a brown-eyed, handsome man  
She fought, and won herself a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Well, a beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind  
Between a doctor and a lawyer man  
Her mother told her daughter  
Go out, and find yourself a brown-eyed, handsome man  
Just like your daddy was, a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Well, a two, three the count with nobody home  
He hit a high-flyer into the stand  
A-rounded third, he was a-heading for home  
It was a brown-eyed, handsome man that won the game  
It was a brown-eyed, handsome man  
It was a brown-eyed, handsome man
