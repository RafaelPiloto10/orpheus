The party's over  
Your time is up  
You've had your last pointless teardrop  
Washed down in that broken coffee cup  
This magic moment concludes when that cigarette ends  
Did you get what you wanted?  
Well I suppose that depends  
Well I suppose that depends  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you go, if you go  
Where passion is squandered and money is spent  
It's time, it's time  
It's time, it's time  
It's time, it's time, it's time  
  
You must see it's time that you went  
You must see it's time that you went  
Our brief acquaintance was such a mistake  
Now it seems more like a sentence  
Or something you always had to fake  
This magic moment concludes when they turn out the light  
It's not the days when you leave me  
But all I fear are the nights  
But all I fear are the nights  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You told the same joke to me too many times  
I wish that someone would hit it  
Just before you reach  
Just before you reach  
Just before you reach the punchline  
The party's over  
Time we broke up  
It always seemed like a bad dream  
One where I finally woke up  
This magic moment concluding our mutual fate  
But if you do have to leave me  
Who will I have left to hate?  
Who will I have left to hate?  
  
[Chorus]
