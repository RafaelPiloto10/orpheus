I hear music, mighty fine music  
The murmur of a morning breeze up there  
The rattle of the milkman on the stair  
  
Sure that's music, mighty fine music  
The singing of a sparrow in the sky  
The perking of the coffee right nearby  
  
That's my favorite melody  
You, my angel, phoning me  
  
I hear music, mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song  
  
That's my favorite melody  
You, my angel, phoning me  
  
I hear music, mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this crazy song
