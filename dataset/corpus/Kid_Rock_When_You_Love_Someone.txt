Oooh..Ooooh  
I tell you it will shake the earth beneath your feet  
The light that shines will redefine your old beliefs  
What you reap is what you sow and so it goes  
Where you plant your needs is where your garden grows  
Before you think about yourself  
Think of someone else, it will make you feel  
  
Each day ain't wine and roses  
I doubt it's meant to be  
Always a cross to bear salvation don't come free  
A heart that beats is a heart that bleeds  
And you know that's true  
So don't deny yourself of something good for you  
Before you do it for yourself, do it for someone else  
That makes it real  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause when you love someone  
It don't matter what you say  
When you love someone  
You will dance the night away  
When you love someone  
There ain't nothing you can't do  
Ain't that right  
Yeah I want to love someone tonight  
  
Will you believe in love or just sit around and judge?  
Can you forgive someone or will u hold a grudge?  
'Cause above selfishness there lies a bright blue sky  
And wealth and happiness can be a long and lonesome ride  
Yes it's hard to steer yourself  
Without that someone else to take the wheel  
Take the wheel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you believe in the art of growing old  
Do you believe that rock n roll can save your soul  
Do you believe in everything you do  
'Cause when you do that's when it all comes back to you  
Before you think about yourself  
Think of someone else  
Do it for yourself  
And do it for someone else  
  
When you love someone -
