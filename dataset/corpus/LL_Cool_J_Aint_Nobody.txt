Captured effortlessly  
That's the way it was  
Happened so naturally  
I did not know it was love  
The next thing I felt was  
You holding me close  
What was I gonna do?  
I let myself go  
  
And now we're flyin' through the star  
I hope this night will last forever  
  
I've been waitin' for you  
It's been so long  
I knew just what I would do  
When I heard your song  
Filled my heart with your bliss  
Gave me freedom  
You knew I could not resist  
I needed someone  
  
And now we're flyin' through the stars  
I hope this night will last forever  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you  
  
I wait for night time to come  
And bring you to me  
Can't believe I'm the one  
I was so lonely  
I feel like no one could feel  
I must be dreamin'  
I want this dream to be real  
I need this feelin'  
  
I make my wish upon a star  
And hope this night will last forever  
  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you  
  
And first you put your arms around me  
Then you put your charms around me  
I can't resist this sweet surrender  
Oh my nights are warm and tender  
We stare into each other's eyes  
And what we see is no surprise  
Got a feeling most with treasure  
And a love so deep we cannot measure  
  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you
