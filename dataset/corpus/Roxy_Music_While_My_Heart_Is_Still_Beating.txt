All of those people  
Everywhere  
Ever so needing  
Where's it all leading  
Tell me where  
  
Nothing insincere  
I'd better have pity  
I'd better go easy  
I never will lay down  
While my heart is still beating  
Where's it all leading  
  
Walk on air  
Am I still dreaming  
Words to spare  
Lost in their meaning  
I'd better be strong now  
I'd better stop dreaming  
My heart has flown away now  
Will it never stop bleeding?
