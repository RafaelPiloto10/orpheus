Bell on door clanks, come on in  
Floyd observes my hairy chin  
Sit down chair, don't be afraid  
Steamed hot towel on my face  
  
I was shaved [x3]  
  
Barney ties me to the chair  
I can't see, I'm really scared  
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip  
Pee-pee pressed against my lips  
  
I was shaved [x3]  
(In a way)  
I sense others in the room  
Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume  
They take turns and cut me up  
I die smothered in Andy's clutch  
  
I was shaved [x3]
