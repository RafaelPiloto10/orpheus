Will you recognise me, in the flashing lights  
I try to keep my heart beat, but I can't get it right  
Will you recognise me, when I'm laying on my back  
Something's gone inside me, and it 'aint coming back, now  
  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, mm, then I'm gone  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, woah  
Then I'm gone (x7) woo woo woo wooo  
  
Will you recognise me, when I'm stealing from the poor  
You're not gonna' like me, no I'm nothing like before, wow  
And will you recognise me, when I lose another friend  
Will you learn to leave me, or give me one more try again  
  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, woah, then I'm gone  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, now  
Then I'm gone (x7) now woo woo woo wooo  
  
Baby be mine, now, mm, mm, mmm  
  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, mm, then I'm gone  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, wow  
Then I'm gone (x19)  
  
Baby be mine, oh, woah, wow
