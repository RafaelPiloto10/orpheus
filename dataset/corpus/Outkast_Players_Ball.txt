Closed okay my deck is woofin' this is ridiculous I'm gettin' serious I'm  
Gettin' curious cause the house is smelling sick of chitlins all this  
Vicious I make no wishes cause the modern folk is in the back gettin' tipsy  
Off the nog-en and I's in a hellova contact smoke they havin' a smoke out  
In my back seat they passing herb reminding verses cause it's in the air I  
Hit the parks hit the cuts I'm makin' switches clicking the switches side  
Ta side lookin' for bitches watchin' for snitches I'm wide open on the  
Freeway my pager broke my vibe cause a junkie is a junkie three sixty
