I'ma pimp  
You can check my stats  
And rollin' a Fleetwood - that's how I mack  
I rock all the tracks  
  
So the world knows  
I love all the girls  
Smack all the hoes  
Show love to those who come real with it  
  
Life's a bitch but I deal with it  
I'm in it to win it like Yzerman  
Could drink about 15 Heinikeins  
I'm not born again  
  
But if I was I'd ask to come back with a little more love  
Well I'm puffin' a Winston  
Drinkin' a four-o  
Kid rock, and I'ma let you know  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been sitting here just wasting time  
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind  
  
Its been a couple of months in this smokey room  
Eaten shrooms drinking Boones writing tunes  
And hoping to get one of these mother fuckin' songs to hit  
  
A little bit of love that's all I need  
A little inspiration and a bag of weed  
A seed to plant so my tree can grow  
You know I left my girl cause I need that hooooold up  
  
Wait a minute I'm about to flow  
Like a breeze through the trees you can watch me blow  
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o  
Kid Rock and I'm gonna let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't no rough guy  
Ain't no tough guy  
Don't get out much and don't dress up fly  
Born in the game that's all I am  
  
Giving all my duckets to Uncle Sam  
Fuck it  
I'm free to do what I please little lady  
I was born at night but not last night baby  
  
I've been around - seen some things  
I slept in dumpsters - got high with kings  
I don't bring much - ain't gotta lot to say  
But I got more time than Morris day  
  
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o  
Kid Rock and I'm a let you know  
  
[Chorus]
