No this isn't easy  
But I can't keep runnin' from Your love  
I've been denying' way too long  
That there's something deep inside me  
That takes me down the road that leads me to Your door  
I know that I belong there with You  
My human nature would keep me far away  
But God I really need You  
I'm asking You to stay  
  
Chorus:  
Come into my life  
Change this heart forever  
Let me feel the healing' in Your touch  
Take all my hurt away  
Come into my life  
I surrender all my feelings  
You've got the love I've needed all along  
Lord, I pray that You will  
Come into my life  
  
Oh I'm through pretending  
That I've got everything a man could ever need  
You know I'm tired of the lie  
Yeah, I was so independent  
But independence never calmed my soul at night  
Now I close my eyes and peace consumes me  
Your love has shown me  
What it is I need to be  
And when I least expect it  
Love becomes more real  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, I ran from You so long  
Never could leave Your touch  
You loved me day by day  
Never leaving' a doubt  
So, now I'm tired of this fight  
And I need Your strength tonight  
You see I've never been as ready as I am right now  
  
Chorus
