Well she thinks she's looking so cool  
She thinks she's great but she's just a fool  
What awful lack of class makes this kind behave this way  
I look and only think of one thing to say  
Soup, she's just soup  
Soup of the day  
  
She's thin around the waistline  
Thin around the brain  
You see this type so many times  
Time and time again  
  
How could they really think  
They'd be treated in any other way  
Everybody's looking and everybody say  
Soup, she's just soup  
Soup of the day  
  
Well you'd think they'd know better  
That behaving in this way  
They think they're being clever  
But I really have to say  
You'd better think it over  
You'll regret it one fine day  
When the circus party's over  
And you were just soup of the day  
She's just soup  
Soup of the day
