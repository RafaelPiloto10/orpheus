When I was young  
I would scream blue murder  
Till I had my own way  
Run from the family  
And tell of a story to spite my elders  
Round and round, the boy  
In the garden of lies and science fiction  
  
Brother and sister and father of mine  
Keep us together and keep us in line  
A lot we depend on a lot we can do  
Send love to mother I'll be good to you  
  
To pollute the mind of a minor  
The only escape from the rigors of life  
Pretend we're a family and believe  
In the virtues of truth  
Round and round, caught up  
In a garden of lies and deception  
  
Brother and sister and father of mine  
Keep us together and keep us in line  
A lot we depend on a lot we can do  
Send love to mother I'll be good to you  
  
Round and round and round and round
