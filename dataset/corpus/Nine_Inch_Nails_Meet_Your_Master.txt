Lay down imposition against a polished steel  
This is something different  
You like the way this feels  
No time for asking questions  
No time for wondering  
We've had enough of you now  
We've heard everything  
  
We're goin' to play a new game  
You put on this blindfold  
You do what we tell you  
You do as you're told  
Used to be the leader, but  
Now comes the time to serve  
Maybe we'll show some mercy  
Maybe you'll get what you deserve  
  
[Chorus:]  
Countdown to the end  
Gonna make it go faster  
Right around the bend  
This is gonna be a disaster, disaster  
Countdown to the end  
And we're here to go faster  
Come on down, my friend  
It's time to meet your master  
  
You've left quite a mess here  
Under your stewardship  
You thought you'd figured it out, but  
You'll find your place in this  
Nothing is so convincing  
For you to see the truth  
Give us so many things now  
We've got in store for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down
