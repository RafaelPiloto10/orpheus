He's got a second side he's got sixth sense  
He got everything  
He got what it takes  
He got what it makes to be everyhting  
  
Seems to know all there is to know  
I took him there  
He steals the show  
He's so astute he's so acute he's gold sure he is  
  
He's eloquent he's intelligent and benevolent  
He's the epitome of ability with his expertise  
He's versatile with a lot of style  
He'd mess my heart every time he'd smile  
  
So unpretensious a warm and gentle soul  
A runner with the pack, no he's not like that  
A runner with the pack, no he's not like that  
Cause he's inventive, attentive, protective, selective  
  
Perceptive, receptive, affective, reflective  
A runner with the pack, no he'd never do that  
He got tolerance he got confidence he's significant  
And he's a connoisseur and a social stir he's magnificent  
  
So fair and square he reciprocates  
And every way he stimulates  
His quality of voracity is great  
  
A runner with the pack, no he's not like that  
A runner with the pack, no he's not like that  
Cause he's inventive, attentive, protective, selective  
Perceptive, receptive, effective, reflective  
  
(You know the he's)  
A runner with the pack, no he'd never do that
