I feel like flyin'  
I wanna run away with you  
And I feel like dyin'  
If I must go on livin' without you  
Oh love is a mountain ev'ry man must learn to climb  
And I'd reach my highest ground if you were mine  
Oh you, you just need to say the word and I'll be there  
And the world is right when someone really cares  
I feel like flyin'  
I wanna run away with you  
Don't you feel like tryin'  
I wanna spend my nights makin' love with you  
Oh love is a ghost that ev'ry man must learn to see  
And I see your very soul when you're near to me  
Oh you, you just need to call my name and I'll be there  
And the time is always right when someone cares  
Oh you, you just need to say the word and I'll be there  
And the time is always right when someone truly cares  
Oh you, you just need to call my name and I'll be there  
And the time is always right when someone cares  
Oh love is a mountain ev'ry man must learn to climb  
And I'd reach my highest ground if you were mine
