Mary Mac, dressed in black  
Silver buttons up and down her back  
How low tips her toe?  
She broke the needle and she can't sew  
  
Walkin' that dog  
Just a walkin' the dog  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
Now, listen here  
I asked my mama for fifteen cents  
See that elephant, now, jump the fence  
He jumped so high, he touched the sky  
And never got back till the fourth of July  
  
Walkin' the dog  
Just walkin' the dog  
But if you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk that dog  
Walk it now, walk it, baby  
  
Mary, Mary, quite contrary  
Tell me, baby, how does your garden grow?  
You got silver bells and cockleshells  
[Incomprehensible] maids in a row  
  
A walkin' the dog  
Just a walkin' the dog  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
Hey, hey, hey, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up  
Walkin', a walkin'  
A hey, hey, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up  
Walkin', a walkin'  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
Hey, hey, hey, turn it up, turn it  
Just walkin', a walkin'  
Hey, hey, can't you see  
Just walkin'  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
Hey, hey, hey, come on, baby  
Hey, hey, hey, just a walkin', walkin the dog  
Hey, hey, hey, hey baby, just walkin' the dog  
Hey, hey, hey  
If you don't know how to do it  
I'll show you how to walk the dog  
  
That leash, baby, bring it over here
