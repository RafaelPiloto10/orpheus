So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again  
You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men  
There's something burning inside me that makes me want to be free  
And when I get these feelings honey, you better keep away from me  
  
There's things in life now, baby, that I know I've got to do  
And I need your love now, baby, to help me see it through  
So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again  
You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men  
  
So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again  
You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men  
There's something burning inside me that makes me want to be free  
And when I get these feelings honey, you better keep away from me
