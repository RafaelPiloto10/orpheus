Verse 1  
He was a wild boy  
She was a crazy girl  
Together they were  
Wild and Crazy  
They would roam the streets at night  
Together they were partners in crime  
Sleep all day  
Roam all nite  
Like two little nocturnal rodents in a forest  
Stick together 'til the very end  
  
[Chorus:]  
Wild and Crazy!  
Everybody knows their names  
Wild and Crazy!  
Lovers, Friends, Partners (Wild and Crazy!)  
Co-workers, Enemies, Comrades (Wild and Crazy!)  
Everybody knows their names  
(oooooh, ahhhhhh)  
(ahhhhh, ohhhhhh)  
  
Verse 2  
Whenever they came around  
Everyone else would leave  
But they didn't even pay 'em no heed  
Just walked on hand in hand  
If there were meadows and gardens there  
I'm sure they would have been  
Frolickin' and playin' all day long  
Mindin' their own buisness  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bridge  
Ooh-wee! Watch 'em go!  
They look too happy  
To be true!  
Ooh-wee! Watch 'em go!  
They look too happy  
To be true!  
Ooh-wee! Watch 'em go!  
They look too happy  
To be true  
(ahah oh!)  
(ahah oh!)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Wild and Crazy!  
Watch 'em go!  
(ahah oh!)  
(ahah oh!)  
(ahah oh!)  
Until fade
