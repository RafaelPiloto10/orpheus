Listen  
Baby, by the time you get this letter  
I'll be gone  
But I left something for you on the pillow  
Put this tape in  
Press play  
I love you  
  
It's four in the morning, I'm sitting here at night  
I'm writing you this song to say what's on my mind  
I'm leaving in an hour, and you won't be up in time to say goodbye, whoa  
I'm putting this on tape (baby, you're wonderful)  
I really mean it, babe (more than you will ever know)  
I wish that I could stay (but I gotta go)  
I'll be back, but in the meantime  
Keep in mind  
  
[Chorus]  
(What you are)  
Something too big for words  
And it's my pleasure to love you, baby, for better or worse  
('Cause what you are)  
A beautiful mother to your kids  
Sometimes, it slips my mind, so in case I forget  
(Girl, you are) you're better than (anything)  
I ever had  
(You are) the perfect love  
(Never give you up because you are)  
My heart, my soul, my breath  
Take it all until there's nothing left  
'Cause, baby, you are  
  
Now, no man has ever loved his woman  
More than I love you  
Girl, you know it's true  
And no man can ever say he does his woman better than I do you  
That ain't true (here's what I do)  
Send you fresh-cut roses every day of the week  
Take you shopping whenever  
More importantly  
Wrap my loving arms around you  
To reassure everything I felt that first night  
I feel it more  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(You are)  
(You are)  
(You are)  
(Girl, you are)  
(You are)  
(You are)
