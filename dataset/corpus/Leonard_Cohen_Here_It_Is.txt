Here is your crown  
And your seal and rings  
And here is your love  
For all things.  
  
Here is your cart,  
And your cardboard and piss  
And here is your love  
For all of this.  
  
May everyone live,  
And may everyone die.  
Hello, my love,  
And my love, Goodbye.  
  
Here is your wine,  
And your drunken fall  
And here is your love.  
Your love for it all.  
  
Here is your sickness.  
Your bed and your pan  
And here is your love  
For the woman, the man.  
  
May everyone live,  
And may everyone die.  
Hello, my love,  
And, my love, Goodbye.  
  
And here is the night,  
The night has begun  
And here is your death  
In the heart of your son.  
  
And here is the dawn,  
(Until death do us part)  
And here is your death,  
In your daughter's heart.  
  
May everyone live,  
And may everyone die.  
Hello, my love,  
And, my love, Goodbye.  
  
And here you are hurried,  
And here you are gone  
And here is the love,  
That it's all built upon.  
  
Here is your cross,  
Your nails and your hill  
And here is your love,  
That lists where it will  
  
May everyone live,  
And may everyone die.  
Hello, my love,  
And my love, Goodbye.
