I'm only human I'm just a man  
Help me believe in what I could be  
  
And all that I am  
  
Show me the stairway I have to climb  
  
Lord for my sake help me to take  
  
One day at a time  
Cho...  
  
One day at a time sweet Jesus  
  
That's all I'm asking from You  
  
Just give me the strength to do ev'ryday  
  
What I have to d  
  
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus  
  
And tomorrow may never be mine  
  
Lord help me today show me the way  
  
One day at a time  
  
Do you remember when you walked among men  
  
Well Jesus you know it's worse now than then  
  
Pushin' and shovin' crowding my mind  
  
So for my sake, teach me to take  
  
One day at a time  
Cho...
