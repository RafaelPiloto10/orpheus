Want to find out where the moon goes  
When it leaves the western sky  
And night dissolves again to morning  
Azure turns to gold  
Azure turns to gold  
  
Gonna sleep with one eye open  
Gonna keep the shades half drawn  
Nearly silent dressed in shadows  
Lines and colors fall  
Lines and colors fall  
  
Gonna watch her through the window  
Just as I watched you before  
Smile knows but just won't tell me  
I just watch her go  
I just watch her go  
  
Now I know just where the moon goes  
When it leaves the western sky  
And night dissolves again to morning  
The moon is in your eyes  
The moon is in your eyes  
The moon is in your eyes  
The moon is in your eyes
