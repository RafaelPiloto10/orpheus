Blood is boring  
Sleep is boring  
Don't stop running  
I'm here counting  
  
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate  
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate  
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate  
Will he keep fuckin' with me? There's nowhere else to go!  
  
So I walk but seem to crawl  
For, I'm giving in today  
Now I run into a wall  
Cause I cannot fight my way  
  
You've gotta come with me (I cannot stand this place)  
We're falling off the world (and I'll give in this way)  
We had a chance to run (and now I can't believe)  
We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace)  
  
My life, worry, life is story  
Give up, beating  
I'll start, needing  
  
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate  
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate  
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate  
Will he keep fuckin' with me? There's nowhere else to go!  
  
So I walk but seem to crawl  
For, I'm giving in today  
Now I run into a wall

We're falling off the world (and I'll give in this way)  
We had a chance to run (and now I can't believe)  
We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace) (Embrace Embrace [x4])  
  
Oh  
Uh, uh, uh uh.  
Uh, uh, uh uh.  
Uh, uh, uh uh.  
Uh, uh, uh uh.  
  
What really do I have to follow?  
Nothing makes sense at all.  
Taking something for nothing  
Watch me as I fall.  
  
I'm bringing me down [x3]  
I'm bringing me...down  
  
You've gotta come with me (I cannot stand this place)  
We're falling off the world (and I'll give in this way)  
We had a chance to run (and now I can't believe)  
We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace) [x2]
