Nobody thought that we'd last as long as we have  
I guess we showed 'em  
Now I don't mean to brag  
We're pretty good at keepin' what we got goin'  
  
I guess we beat the odds  
Hey, how 'bout us?  
  
In this crazy world of mirrors and smoke  
Where hearts can get broke and forever's so hard to find  
People still dream, and people still hope  
That someday they'll get it right  
A love like yours and mine is why they try  
  
You know I'll kiss you downtown  
Right there on your mouth with everyone staring  
I don't mind if they see just what you mean to me  
Girl, that's something worth sharing  
  
Love's a beautiful thing  
Hey, let it catch on  
  
In this crazy world of mirrors and smoke  
Where hearts can get broke and forever's so hard to find  
People still dream, and people still hope  
That someday they'll get it right  
A love like yours and mine is why they try, they try, baby  
  
Our best days are up ahead  
Girl, we ain't done yet  
No, far from it  
  
In this crazy world (in this crazy world of mirrors and smoke)  
Where hearts can get broke and forever's so hard to find  
People still dream, and people still hope  
That someday they'll get it right  
A love like yours and mine is why they try,  
They try, they try
