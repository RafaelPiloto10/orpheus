In high seas or in low seas  
I'm gonna be your friend  
I'm gonna be your friend  
In high tide or in low tide  
I'll be by your side  
I'll be by your side  
  
I heard her praying, praying, praying  
I said I heard my mother  
She was praying in the night (praying, praying, praying)  
And the words that she said (the words that she said)  
  
They still-a linger in my head (lingers in my head)  
She said a child is born in this world  
He needs protection, ooh  
God, guide and protect us  
  
When we're wrong, please correct us  
(when we're wrong, correct us)  
And stand by me  
  
In high seas or in low seas  
I'm gonna be your friend  
He said I'm gonna be your friend  
And, baby, in high tide or in low tide  
I'll be by your side  
I'll be by your side  
  
I said I heard my mother  
She was crying in the night (I heard her crying, crying, crying)  
And the tears that she shed (the tears that she shed)  
They still lingers in my head (lingers in my head)  
  
She said a child is born in this world  
He needs protection, ooh  
God, guide and protect us  
When we're wrong, (when we're wrong) correct us  
  
And in high seas or in low seas  
I'm gonna be your friend  
I'm gonna be your friend  
Said, high tide or low tide  
I'll be by your side  
I'll be by your side
