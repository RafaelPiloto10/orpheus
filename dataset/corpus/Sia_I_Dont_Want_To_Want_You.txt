"I Don't Want To Want You"  
  
I like to take you  
Only cause I choose not to leave you  
I like to make something of you  
Only cause I choose to believe in you  
  
I don't want to want you like I do  
I don't want to want you like I do  
Like I do  
  
I, I, I like to show you  
Only cause I choose not to hide from you  
I like to know you  
Only cause I choose to introduce myself  
Only cause I choose to introduce myself  
  
I don't want to want you like I do  
Like I do  
I don't want to want you like I do  
Like I do, like I do  
  
I like to take you  
Only cause I choose not to leave you  
I like to make something of you  
Only cause I choose to believe in you
