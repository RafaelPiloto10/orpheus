Down Poppie Johnny Road, nobody hears your name  
Life that I was lovin', like stealin' a ride on a train  
Wanna steal a ride on a train  
  
Crawlin' in the dirt all night  
I guess this is a place  
Newborns lashed to a dead oak tree  
Settle deeper in the rain  
Settle deeper in the rain  
  
Hold me tight, flying through the air  
Hold on strong, and we're almost there  
Laugh so hard, the devil gets scared  
I got a real good mind to beat your senseless  
  
Best to count your blessing child  
The sun's not too hot today  
Like to get to church before  
Oh, before this old jacket fades  
Take us right to the shade  
  
That's the end of Poppie Johnny Road  
Old blind that cures your misery  
Give her five dollars, boy  
Oh, and a reason to believe  
A reason to believe  
  
Hold me tight, flying through the air  
Coal yards calling, we're almost there  
Laugh so hard and the devil's all scared  
I got a real good mind to beat you senseless  
  
Down Poppie Johnny Road, nobody hears your name  
The life that I love, like stealin' a ride on a train  
Oh, steal a ride on a train  
  
At the end of Poppie Johnny Road  
Old Blind that cures your misery  
Just get five dollars there and a reason to believe  
A reason to believe  
  
Hold me tight, flying through the air  
Coal yards calling, we're almost there  
Laughed so hard and the devil gets scared  
I got a real good mind, to beat you senseless  
  
I got a real good mind  
Senseless  
I got a real good mind  
Senseless  
I got a real good mind  
Senseless  
I got a real good mind
