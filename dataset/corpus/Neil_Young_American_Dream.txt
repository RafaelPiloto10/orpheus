I used to see you  
On every T. V.  
Your smiling face  
Looked back at me.  
I used to see you  
On every T. V.  
Your smiling face  
Looked back at me.  
Then they caught you  
With the girl next door,  
People's money  
Piled on the floor,  
Accusations  
That you try to deny,  
Revelations  
And rumors begin to fly.  
  
Now you think about  
Reaching out  
Maybe get some help  
From above.  
Now you think about  
Reaching out  
Maybe get some help  
From above.  
Reporters crowd around  
Your house.  
Going through your garbage  
Like a pack of hounds,  
Speculating what they  
May find out,  
It don't matter now,  
You're all washed up.  
  
You wake up in the middle  
Of the night.  
Your sheets are wet  
And your face is white,  
You tried to make  
A good thing last,  
How could something so good,  
Go bad, so fast?  
  
American dream, American dream  
American dream, American dream.  
  
Don't know when  
Things went wrong,  
Might have been when you  
Were young and strong.  
Don't know when  
Things went wrong,  
Might have been when you  
Were young and strong.
