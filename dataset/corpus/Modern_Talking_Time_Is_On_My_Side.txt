You are the sunshine baby of my life  
Oh baby you are just the one  
Without you oh I can't go on  
You are the one, only the strong survive  
Oh Baby I can't let you go  
I promised you, my love will show  
  
Time is on my side  
Tonight it's our night  
Time is on my side  
Love we cannot hide  
  
You are the nearest thing to heaven girl  
Oh baby you are just the one  
Without you oh I can't be strong  
You are the only star in my new world  
Oh baby I can't let you go  
I promised you, my love will grow
