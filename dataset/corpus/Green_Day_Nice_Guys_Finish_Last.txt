Nice guys finish last  
You're running out of gas  
Your sympathy will get you left behind  
Sometimes you're at your best  
When you feel the worst  
You feel washed up like piss gone down the drain  
  
Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane  
I'm so fucking happy I could cry  
Every joke can have it's truth but now the joke's on you  
I never knew you're such a funny guy  
  
Oh nice guys finish last  
When you are the outcast  
Don't pat yourself on the back  
You might break your spine  
  
Living on command  
You're shaking lots of hands  
You're kissing up and bleeding all your trust  
Taking what you need  
Bite the hand that feeds  
You lose your memory and you've got no shame  
  
Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane  
I'm so fucking happy I could cry  
Every joke can have it's truth but now the joke's on you  
I never knew you're such a funny guy  
  
Oh nice guys finish last  
When you are the outcast  
Don't pat yourself on the back
