No time, no place to talk about the weather  
Promise of love is hard to ignore  
Who said the chance wasn't getting any better  
Labor of love is ours to endure  
  
Highest branch on the apple tree  
It was my favorite place to be  
I could hear them breaking free  
But they could not see me  
  
I will run for shelter  
Endless summer lift the curse  
It feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe  
  
I have all I want, is that simple enough?  
A whole lot more I'm thinking of  
Every night about six o'clock  
Birds come back to the pond to talk  
They talk to me, birds to talk to me  
If I go down on my knees  
  
I will run for shelter  
Endless summer lift the curse  
It feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe  
Feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe  
  
And it's a pleasure that I have known  
And it's a treasure that I have gained  
And it's a pleasure that I have known  
  
It's a tight squeeze, but I won't let go  
Time is on the table and the dinner's cold  
  
I will run for shelter  
Endless summer lift the curse  
Feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe  
  
I will run for shelter  
Endless summer lift the curse  
Feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe
