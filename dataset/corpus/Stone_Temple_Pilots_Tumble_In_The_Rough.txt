I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I can't live  
I can't cry  
I can't die  
I can't walk  
I can't talk  
I can booze  
I can booze and steal your shoes So I can move  
Tumble in the rough  
  
I'm looking for a new meditation  
Still looking for a new way to fly  
Don't want any plastic validation  
Not looking for a new way to die  
  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
So what  
  
I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I can't live  
I can't cry  
I can't die  
I can't walk  
I can't talk  
I can booze  
I can booze and steal your shoes So I can move  
Tumble in the rough  
  
I'm lookin' for a new stimulation  
Quite bored of those inflatable ties  
I'm looking for a new rock sensation  
Dead fish don't swim around in jealous tides  
  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
So what  
  
Can't live, can't buy new shoes (Tumble in the rough)  
Lived on a summer with new shoes (Tumble in the rough)  
Can't live, can't die - new shoes (Tumble in the rough)  
Lived on a summer with new shoes (Tumble in the rough)  
  
I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I can't live  
I can't cry  
I can't die  
I can't walk  
I can't talk  
I can booze  
I can booze and steal your shoes So I can move  
Tumble in the rough  
  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
I made excuses for a million lies  
But all I got was humble kidney pie  
So what
