One taste  
That ain't so much  
You think you'll be safe from her touch  
  
She calls  
You can't hide  
Your back's to the wall, the wall's on fire  
  
Oh, when her music starts to play  
Oh, you could dance your life away.  
  
Once it's gotcha, never set you back down  
Once it's gotcha, you'll lose your head in the clouds  
  
Sweet dreams  
Of her kiss  
No heaven could be quite like this  
  
Your love  
Runs so strong  
You can't get enough, right or wrong  
  
Oh, when her music starts to play  
Oh, you could dance your life away
