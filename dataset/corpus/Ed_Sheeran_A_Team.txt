White lips, pale face  
Breathing in snowflakes  
Burnt lungs, sour taste  
  
Lights gone, days end  
Struggling to pay rent  
Long nights, strange men  
  
And they say  
She's in the class A team  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since eighteen  
But lately her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
  
And they scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
'Cause we're just under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
And she don't want to go outside, tonight  
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland  
Or sells love to another man  
It's too cold outside  
For angels to fly, for angels to fly  
  
Ripped gloves, raincoat  
Tried to swim and stay afloat  
Dry house, wet clothes  
  
Loose change, bank notes  
Weary-eyed, dry throat  
Call girl, no phone  
  
And they say  
She's in the class A team  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since eighteen  
But lately her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
  
And they scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
'Cause we're just under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
But she don't want to go outside, tonight  
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland  
Or sells love to another man  
Its too cold outside  
For angels to fly  
An angel will die  
Covered in white  
Closed eye  
And hoping for a better life  
This time, we'll fade out tonight  
Straight down the line  
  
And they say  
She's in the class A team  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since eighteen  
But lately her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
  
They scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
And we're under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
And we don't want to go outside, tonight  
And in the pipe fly to the motherland  
Or sell love to another man  
It's too cold outside  
For angels to fly, angels to fly  
To fly, fly  
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly  
Angels to die
