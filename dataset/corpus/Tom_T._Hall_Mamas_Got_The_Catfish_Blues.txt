I ain't had a bite 'cause the moon's too bright  
I wish I had a big one or two  
My crock line's set and my hooks are all wet  
And mama's got the catfish blues  
Don't like to see her unhappy  
She treats me like a water tree  
I hate to see mama with the catfish blues  
And the catfish are layin' in the river asleep  
There's a bottle of wine layin' easy on my mind  
I dug enough bait to catch a few  
My reeling's wet but I cannot forget  
Mama's got the catfish blues  
There's a turtle on the stump and the toadfrog jump  
And I guess, I could gig me a few  
In settlin' fog I caught a big water dog  
Mama's got the catfish blues  
I don't like to see her unhappy  
She treats me like a water tree  
I hate to see mama with the catfish blues  
And the catfish are layin' in the river asleep  
There's a bottle of wine layin' easy on my mind  
I dug enough bait to catch a few  
My reeling's wet but I cannot forget  
Mama's got the catfish blues, yeah
