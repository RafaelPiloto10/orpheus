My girlfriend slipped and fell  
Now she's hanging from a cliff  
I can't come to her rescue  
But these flowers I must sniff  
  
You see I'd really like to save her  
but I ain't got the nerve  
I'm chicken hearted  
I'm chicken hearted  
  
I'm tryin' to kiss my girl  
And it makes me want to faint  
I'm scared of my own shadow  
And afraid of what I ain't  
  
I've no inspiration  
I'm kinda yellow...  
I'm chicken hearted,  
I'm chicken hearted  
  
Mama's in the workshop  
Daddy's in the jail  
I seem to be afraid  
To go to work and make their bail  
  
I guess my folks will have  
I'm chicken hearted,  
I'm chicken hearted
