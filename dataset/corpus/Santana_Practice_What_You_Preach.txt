What's wrong with you  
Can's you live by the way you preach  
You Change everytime you see someone  
And forget about the things you need  
But I know from just being around  
It's easy to go down hill  
Starting from today  
I'll seek only my lords way  
So I'll be happy, free and unafraid from today  
  
Well, I know that just being around  
It's easy to go down hill  
Starting from to day  
I'll seek only my lords way  
So I'll be happy, free and unafraid from today
