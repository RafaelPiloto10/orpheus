Every night  
Caught up on the same old dream  
I hear your broken heart  
Crumbling down and haunting me  
And everyday  
Try to tell myself it ain't so hard  
But then I hear your name  
And it feels like a grip around my heart  
'till I change the way you feel  
'till I change the world  
So help me girl  
I'll show you wounds can heal  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell 'ya what I'm gonna do  
I'll be comin' back for you  
I'll move the mountains  
Part the sea  
Anything for you  
I'll be back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
  
Forget that girl  
She could never take your place  
It's hard enough  
When you look at me that way  
I know I was caught red-handed  
I wouldn't blame you if you twist the knife  
I swear I've come to my senses  
Tell me what to do  
Anyday I'll make it right  
I've got to change the way you feel  
If I have to I'll change the world  
So help me girl  
I'll beg borrow and steal  
If that's what it takes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
At 't-till make you believe me  
I'm prepared to make any sacrifice  
The shadow of our love keeps gettin' bigger  
Without your love I'll sure die  
  
Tell you what I'm gonna do  
I keep comin' back for you  
I'll move the mountains  
Part the sea  
Anything for you  
I'll be back 'n blue back 'n blue  
  
Back 'n blue  
So help me girl  
Beg borrow and steal  
If that's what it takes  
I'll be back 'n blue back 'n blue  
I'm prepared to make any sacrifice  
Back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
So help me girl
