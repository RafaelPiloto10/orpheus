Down on the river, it's an easy kind of life  
Everybody here's feeling fine  
No need to worry or get in a hurry  
Nothing to spend but time  
  
Light up a smoke and tell a few jokes  
And pass the old jug around  
We're gonna get right on a Saturday night  
When the sun goes down  
  
Down on the river, down on the river  
Just some old boys a making a lot of noise  
Down on the river, down on the river, down on the river  
If anyone calls tell them, we're all down on the river  
  
Well, we'll go fishing by the light of the moon  
And bait them hooks by hand  
Early in the morning take them off the line  
Fry 'em all up in a pan  
  
We gotta get home while we still got a job  
Or we'll have to answer to the man  
And everybody knows we gotta go  
We'll be back again  
  
Down on the river, down on the river
