Maybe leaving's better in the afternoon  
When the rain don't fall so hard  
From where we were we had to look down far below  
To see just what went on in our own backyard  
  
Coming down slow without a thing to show  
Wondering what went on while we were up there  
Mountain roads now asphalt highways  
That we once called heaven skyways  
Children lost what is the cost to get back home again  
  
La La La La La La La La Laaaaa  
La La La La La La La La Laaaaa  
  
It was a high Cumberland Jubilee  
Such a high Cumberland Jubilee
