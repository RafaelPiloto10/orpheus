Mister majestic fires a gun  
Mister majestic  
He got a lie on his tongue  
You can't help but listen  
He got a way with words  
Don't ask useless questions  
Unless you want to  
Leave this world  
Madam odessa carries a knife  
Across to the jailhouse  
In her pretty style  
She ain't looking out for business  
She got a way with words  
She is gonna take that man  
For what he done to her  
This was how the west was won  
Lawless and unruly  
Now I guess what's done, is done  
She took her old man in cold blood  
He hit the deck  
With that si-si-si-sickening thud  
Life was cheap, that's what we  
Always heard about  
It was over something stupid  
They could have talked it out  
This was how the west was won  
Lawless and unruly  
Now I guess what's done, is done  
Billy thought that billy was right  
Where is the killer, nobody knows  
He's waiting in the dark saloon  
For night to close  
He tried to cheat  
At the gambling table  
A stranger pulls and fires  
As he falls he sees the stranger is  
Madam in disguise  
This was how the west was won ...
