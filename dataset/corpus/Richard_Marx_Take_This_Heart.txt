I've been where you are before  
No one understands it more  
You fear every step you take  
So sure that your heart will break  
  
It's not how the story ends  
You'll be back on your feet again  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby, this time  
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away  
No more goodbyes  
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away  
  
The pain's still alive in you  
For what one man put you through  
You say that we're all the same  
But I'm called by no other name  
  
We all need a place to run  
Won't you let me be the one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't keep the dream in you locked outside your door  
Just believe in this love  
And don't be afraid anymore  
  
I need you to please be strong  
I've waited for you too long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This time  
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away  
No more goodbyes  
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away  
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away.
