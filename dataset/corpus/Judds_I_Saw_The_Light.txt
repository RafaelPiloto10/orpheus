I laid a red rose  
On your front porch  
Wrote "I love you"  
On a note  
I rang the door bell  
And turned to go  
Baby, when the curtains moved  
I couldn't believe the view  
  
[Chorus:]  
I saw the light in your window tonight  
I saw two shadows holding each other tight  
I know the truth when I look in your eyes  
I saw the light in your window tonight  
  
So take your cheatin' hands  
Off my red dress  
'Cause I ain't wearin'  
This thing for you  
I see you clearly now  
And your lies, too  
They say that love is blind  
Baby, not this time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why, baby, why should I listen to you?  
I cried, baby, cried, now I'm walking out the door  
  
They say that love is blind, baby, not this time  
  
[Chorus]
