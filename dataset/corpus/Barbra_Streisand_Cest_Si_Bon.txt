C'est si bon  
Lovers say that in france  
When they thrill to romance  
It means that it's so good  
C'est si bon  
So I say to you  
Like the french people do  
Because it's oh so good  
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear,  
Leads to only one thought  
And the thought is this, dear!  
C'est si bon  
Nothing else can replace  
Just your slyest embrace  
And if you only would be my own for the rest my days  
I will whisper this phrase  
My darling, my darling...  
C'est si bon!
