Don't change your mind,  
I ain't got the time to sit and wonder.  
I'm doing fine.  
If you decide to leave, I won't go under.  
  
You know I've come this far without you  
It won't be too hard to be alone.  
I've got choices all around me,  
So I won't be spending too much time at home.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Girl, I'm gonna miss you.  
I'm gonna miss you, baby.  
I can't forgive you,  
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby.  
  
No, don't say a word.  
I already heard that you don't love me.  
In your state of mind,  
I don't need to hear your side of the story.  
  
Your friends all said we had a future  
And I don't think I really want to know.  
My friends keep telling me to lose you  
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I broke my back to make you happy.  
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care.  
If you think you're better off without me,  
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on,  
Gonna miss the air you breathe.  
I'm just not quite happy, baby,  
'bout your crazy plans to leave.
