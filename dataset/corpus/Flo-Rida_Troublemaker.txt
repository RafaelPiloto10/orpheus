You're a troublemaker  
You're a troublemaker  
  
You ain't nothing but a troublemaker girl  
  
You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down  
The way you bite your lip  
Got my head spinnin' around  
After a drink or two  
I was putty in your hands  
I don't know if I have the strength to stand  
  
Oh oh oh  
Trouble troublemaker yeah  
That's your middle name  
Oh oh oh  
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain  
And I wanna know  
  
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad  
Oh oh oh  
My mind keeps saying  
Run as fast as you can  
I say I'm done but then you pull me back  
Oh oh oh  
I swear you're giving me a heart attack  
Troublemaker  
  
It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind  
I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes  
There must be poison in those fingertips of yours  
Cause I keep comin' back again for more  
  
Oh oh oh  
Trouble troublemaker yeah  
That's your middle name  
Oh oh oh  
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain  
And I wanna know  
  
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad  
Oh oh oh  
My mind keeps saying  
Run as fast as you can  
I say I'm done but then you pull me back  
Oh oh oh  
I swear you're giving me a heart attack  
Troublemaker  
  
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad  
Oh oh oh  
My mind keeps saying  
Run as fast as you can  
Troublemaker  
I say I'm done but then you pull me back  
Oh oh oh  
I swear you're giving me a heart attack  
Troublemaker  
  
Maybe I'm insane  
Cause I keep doing the same damn thing  
Thinking one day we gonna change  
But you know just how to work that back  
And make me forget my name  
What the hell you do I won't remember  
I'll be gone until November  
And you'll show up again next summer  
  
Yeah  
Typical middle name is Prada  
Fit you like a glove girl  
I'm sick of the drama  
You're a troublemaker  
But damn girl it's like I love the trouble  
And I can't even explain why  
  
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad  
Oh oh oh  
My mind keeps saying  
Run as fast as you can  
Troublemaker  
I say I'm done but then you pull me back  
Oh oh oh  
I swear you're giving me a heart attack  
Troublemaker  
  
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad  
Oh oh oh  
My mind keeps saying  
Run as fast as you can  
Troublemaker  
I say I'm done but then you pull me back  
Oh oh oh  
I swear you're giving me a heart attack  
Troublemaker
