Well, I'm gonna raise a fuss  
I'm gonna raise a holler  
About a working all summer  
Just to try to earn a dollar  
Well, time I called my baby  
Try to get a date  
My boss says, no dice son  
You gotta work late  
Sometimes I wonder  
What I'm a gonna do  
But there ain't no cure  
For the summertime blues  
  
Oh, well my Mom and Poppa told me, son  
You gotta make some money  
If you want to use the car  
To go ridin' next Sunday  
Well I didn't go to work  
Told the boss I was sick  
Well you can't use the car  
Cause you didn't work a lick  
Sometimes I wonder  
What I'm a gonna do  
But there ain't no cure  
For the summertime blues  
  
I'm gonna take two weeks  
Gonna have a fine vacation  
I'm gonna take my problem  
To the United Nations  
Well I called my congressman  
And he said, whoa  
I'd like to help you son  
But you're too young to vote  
Sometimes I wonder  
What I'm a gonna do  
But there ain't no cure  
For the summertime blues
