Refrain] Oh, I love trash!  
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty  
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty  
Yes, I love trash  
I have here a sneaker that's tattered and worn  
It's all full of holes and the laces are torn  
A gift from my mother the day I was born  
I love it because it's trash  
[Refrain]  
I have here some newspaper thirteen months old  
I've wrapped some fish inside it, it's smelly and cold  
But I wouldn't trade it for a big pot o' gold  
I love it because it's trash  
[Refrain]  
I've a clock that won't work, and an old telephone  
A broken umbrella, a rusty trombone  
And I am delighted to call them my own  
I love them because they're trash  
[Refrain, ending with]... Yes, I love, I love, I love trash
