When you start falling  
Who's gonna catch ya  
I'm willing to betcha  
It will be me  
Who's gonna love ya  
Like there's no other  
Search and discover  
It will be me  
  
When all the others  
Have gone and hurt you  
Who won't desert you  
It will be me  
Weighing the options  
So much to think of  
But when you think love  
It will be me  
  
[Chorus]  
You may not see it now  
Love is strange that way  
But someday, someway  
Baby somehow  
  
When you've been broken  
And dreams don't oblige ya  
Who's that beside ya  
Oh, it will be me  
  
[Chorus]  
You may not see it now  
Love is strange that way  
But someday, someway  
Baby somehow  
  
Who'll be your only  
True romancer  
You know that answer  
It will be me  
What will it take to  
Bring you to your senses  
And finally convince you  
It will be me
