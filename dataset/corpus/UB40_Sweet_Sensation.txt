I can feel those thrill's walking over  
When you hold me tight  
Now I feel those pains taking over  
When you say goodnight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh what sweet sensation  
Lord what strange emotion  
You've got love and devotion  
And I won't forget your touch  
  
Now there's nothing left for me to say girl  
But stay in your world  
You've got so much soul deep inside girl  
And love that's richer than gold  
  
[Chorus]
