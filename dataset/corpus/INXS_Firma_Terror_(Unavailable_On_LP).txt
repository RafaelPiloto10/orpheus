Lyrics:  
Here on terra firma  
The violence is spreading  
The walls are collapsing  
Into your back yards  
Here on terra firma  
The fires are raging  
The riots up staging  
To prove a point to none  
Here on terra firma  
The fear is choking  
The life out of each and every one  
Here on terra firma  
Where TV is King  
Where a black man with the same name  
Had a televised beating  
It's not too late  
Yeah it's never too late  
To heal these wounds  
That are fatal to the end  
To understand our sins  
To make amends  
See 'em down in hell  
Must turn back the tide  
This hatred must be stopped  
Let's throw our arms out wide  
And the dead are breaking in  
When your world comes to an end  
Will you say you did all could  
And then just hang your head  
Why not believe  
In the good of man  
Not bricks and burn  
Take all that you can  
To love your fellow man  
With all of your heart  
As you would yourself  
We must try not to stand above  
And hate you go to hell  
Put love in your heart  
God is not some TV show  
Our life is not some part  
Try to believe  
That only good will come  
If you give not to receive  
That is kingdom come  
Here on terra firma  
The violence is spreading  
Spread to your back yard  
Here in firma terror  
Leads to hatred and unrest  
Not only can we beat it  
No, that would be best
