I won't share you, no  
I won't share you  
With the drive  
And ambition  
The zeal I feel  
This is my time  
  
The note I wrote  
As she read, she said  
"Has the Perrier gone  
Straight to my head  
Or is life sick and cruel, instead?"  
  
"Yes!"  
No - no - no - no - no - no  
No - no - no - no - no - no  
Oh...  
  
I won't share you, no  
I won't share you  
With the drive  
And the dreams inside  
This is my time  
  
Life tends to come and go  
That's OK  
As long as you know  
Life tends to come and go  
As long as you know  
Know, know, know, know, know  
Know, know, know, know  
Oh...  
  
I won't share you, no  
I won't share you  
With the drive  
And the dreams inside  
This is my time  
  
I want the freedom and I want the guile  
I want the freedom and the guile  
Oh, life tends to come and go  
As long as you know  
Know, know, know, know  
Know, know, know, know  
Oh...  
  
I won't share you, no  
I won't share you  
I'll see you somewhere  
I'll see you sometime  
Darling...
