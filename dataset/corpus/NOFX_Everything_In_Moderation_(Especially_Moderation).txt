Thirty nine, my hair should be parted not spiked and green  
My nights should end at ten and not six AM  
But it is and they don't  
I still get excited when the Adolescents play  
Wake up not knowing what I did last night  
Finding out and thinking that was cool, not sad  
  
I might be an adult but I'm still a minor at heart  
Okay, my liver is my senior part  
But that's a part you can trade in  
When your band has been a band longer than the Ramones  
And critics coin you "the punk Rolling Stones"  
That's when you know this is for life
