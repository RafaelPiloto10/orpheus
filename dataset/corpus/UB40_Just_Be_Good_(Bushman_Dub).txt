Just be good to each other, yeah  
Donate some peace of mind  
Invest in one another, yeah  
A love of all mankind  
  
Just be good to each other, yeah  
You know we don't get long  
It takes so much to recover, yeah  
And we can't get it wrong  
  
I'm the meanest, toughest, baddest boy in town  
I'm a thief, a liar, one who hunts you down  
The final word in justice, and I'll fill you full of hate  
So down upon my knees, I am about  
To seal you fate  
  
If we're good to each other, yeah  
If we just take the time  
Treat all men as your brother, yeah  
Everything will be fine  
  
When we're good to each other, yeah  
You can feel in your heart  
The love that all lovers, yeah  
When they're apart  
  
I'm the biggest, richest, righteous and strong  
Devil plays the tune, I'll make you sing my song  
Finger on the button and my eyes are on the prize  
In case you had forgotten, I'm a master of disguise  
  
So be good to each other, yeah  
And I trust you will find  
On the road to discover, yeah  
That true love is blind  
  
A reformer coke addict, puppet on a string  
My papa gives me credit, so I'm living like a king  
Vengeance will be mine, I will collect my dues  
I'm a walking Armageddon so the world can  
Sing the blues  
  
Just be good to each other, yeah  
Donate some peace of mind  
Invest in one another, yeah  
A love of all mankind  
  
So be good to each other, yeah  
And I trust you will find  
On the road to discover, yeah  
That true love is blind  
  
Yeah
