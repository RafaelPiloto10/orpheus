I am still your friend  
Standing by to catch you  
If ever life should let you down  
And you should fall.  
You don't need to pretend  
If ever doubt should find you.  
I don't need to remind you  
I'm there for you before and after all.  
I am who I am  
And I would never fool you.  
I feel the same way you do  
About honesty.  
But do we understand  
How love is sometimes jaded?  
It keeps us separated  
Even though we'll never part.  
So to be lovers  
We've got to understand  
Today is how today begins,  
Tomorrow's how it ends.  
And to be lovers  
Some things we rise above.  
'Cause sometimes love is wonderful  
But sometimes it's only love.  
Loving who I am  
Is something that you've taught me.  
The kind of love you've brought me  
Takes me through the day.  
And even though our minds  
Are sometimes disagreeing  
Our hearts they're still believing  
We'll work it out and stay.  
So to be lovers  
We've got to understand  
Today is how today begins,  
Tomorrow's how it ends.  
And to be lovers  
Some things we rise above.  
'Cause sometimes love is wonderful  
But sometimes it's only love.
