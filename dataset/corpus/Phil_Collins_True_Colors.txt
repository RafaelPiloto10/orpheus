You with the sad eyes  
Don't be discouraged  
Oh I realize  
It's hard to take courage  
In a world full of people  
You can lose sight of it all and the darkness,  
Inside you makes you feel so small  
  
But I see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow  
  
Show me a smile then,  
Don't be unhappy, can't remember when  
I last saw you laughing  
If this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
Just call me up  
Because you know I'll be there  
  
And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Just show your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow  
  
Such sad eyes  
Discouraged now  
Realize  
  
When this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
Just call me up  
Because you know I'll be there  
  
And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Just show your true colors  
True colors, true colors  
  
'Cause there's a shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors, true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Beautiful, like a rainbow  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Show me your colours  
Show me your rainbow  
  
(That's why I love you) Show me your colours  
Show me your rainbow
