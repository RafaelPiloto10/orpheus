This next song is  
Is dedicated to those American fighting girls!  
  
That's right  
Those American fighting girls  
Who aren't afraid to take the law into their own hands.  
To die if necessary!  
To keep our cities safe from criminal scum.  
  
The oingo boingo proudly salutes the American commando girls  
  
Commando girls  
Commando girls  
Commando girls won't you come out tonight?  
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?  
Commando girls You'll never never catch them crying!  
  
By daytime they're receptionists  
Accountant girls so clean  
Late at night they hit the streets  
Soldiers with a dream.  
  
When they go out they arm themselves  
With kakis and fatigues  
They're tough as nails and armed to the teeth  
With automatic M-16s  
  
Iconoclastic girls that know the plan  
To finnish the job like no one else can  
To fight so the city's safe for you and me  
  
Oh!  
Commando girls won't you come out tonight?  
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?  
Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!  
  
They prowl the streets in disciplined packs  
Looking for acts of violence  
Sweet little poison pussycats  
They travel smooth and silent  
  
And when they spot their guilty prey  
They waste no time on busts  
They stand their ground and open fire  
Unload their might of justice  
  
Oh!  
Take no prisoners and leave no clues  
Read all about it in the morning news  
Nobody out there knows what really happened!  
  
Oh!  
Command girls won't you come out tonight?  
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?  
Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!  
  
[guitar solo]  
  
When my little girl comes home at night  
Exhausted from her fighting  
When she unzips her camouflage tights  
She always looks so inviting!  
  
Slippery skin all covered with sweat  
Shivering in the moonlight.  
Smell the gunpowder and sweet hot breath  
We're gonna have fun tonight!  
  
Oh!  
Under the covers it's hard to know  
She risked her life just minutes ago  
A stiff salute to their courage and their passion!  
  
Commando girls...  
  
[repeat this verse 3x]  
Giddy up Giddy up Get 'em all right  
Round em up round em up round em up tight  
Ready now ready now ready for the fight  
Shoot em up shoot em up shoot em in the night  
  
Commando girls won't you come out tonight?  
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?  
Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!  
  
Never catch them crying!  
Never catch them crying!  
Commando girls...  
Commando girls...  
Commando girls...  
Commando girls...  
Commando girls...
