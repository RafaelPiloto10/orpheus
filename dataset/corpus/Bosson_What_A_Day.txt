In the morning  
When you wake up to a brand new day  
With a feeling  
Everything is gonna go your day  
And you open up the window  
And the air is just seeting with life...  
  
What a day, when the sun is shinning through  
It's shinning for you  
What a day, when the birds are singing too  
They're singing for you  
What a day, oh oh  
What a day, oh oh  
What a day, oh oh  
What a day...  
  
Having breakfast  
In a garden full of blooming trees  
It's so quiet  
You can hear the sound of falling leaves  
Though you close your eyes for a moment  
Light is all that you see...  
  
What a day...  
  
You've been searching  
You've been climbing never give up  
Just to realise  
You've been standing on the mountain top  
Cause the future's gone tomorrow  
But your life is right here today...  
  
What a day...  
  
The future's gone tomorrow  
Life is here today  
Things' gonna go your way  
This is yor day  
The future's gone tomorrow  
Life is here today... [x2]
