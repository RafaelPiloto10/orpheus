Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you  
It's late September and I really should be back at school  
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used  
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more  
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone  
You stole my heart and that's what really hurt  
  
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age  
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything  
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax  
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more  
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone  
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without  
  
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand  
But you turned into a lover and  
Mother what a lover, you wore me out  
All you did was wreck my bed  
And in the morning kick me in the head  
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore  
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone  
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried  
  
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school  
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool  
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand  
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face  
You made a first-class fool out of me  
But I'm as blind as a fool can be  
You stole my heart but I love you anyway  
  
Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face  
I'll get on back home one of these days
