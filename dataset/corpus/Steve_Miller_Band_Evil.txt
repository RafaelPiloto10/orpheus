You know  
If somebody, somewhere done you wrong  
Oh, don't worry about your revenge, no  
  
I said if somebody, somewhere done you wrong  
Oh, don't worry about your revenge, no no  
'cause that's when evil  
Oh, evil slips on in  
  
Hey, when I first met you baby  
You were nothing but a child  
When I first met you baby  
I used to let you run wild  
  
But somewhere, somehow  
Lord, I don't know how  
All your goodness  
Slipped away  
  
And that's when evil  
Yeah  
Evil let it stay  
Evil let it stay, yeah  
  
Evil's with me in the morning  
Evil's with me and I can't get away, no  
But there's gonna come a time  
Oh, when somebody else is gonna pay  
Gonna pay baby
