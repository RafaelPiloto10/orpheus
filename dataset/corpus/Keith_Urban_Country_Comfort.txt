Soon the pines will be falling everywhere  
As the village children fight each other for their share  
And the six-o-nine goes roaring past the creek  
As Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week  
  
I saw Grandma yesterday down at the store  
Well she's really doing fine for eighty-four  
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn  
The poor old girl she needs a hand to run that farm  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's good old country comfort in my bones  
It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known  
It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown  
Country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home  
Oh it's goin' back home  
  
Down at the well they've got a new machine  
The foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen  
"Hey but that ain't natural" old Clay would say  
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home  
Whoa, it's goin' back home  
Hey take me back home  
And a truck, and a truck that's goin' back home  
Any truck
