Leather boots poundin' the floor  
Black and shiny kickin' the door  
The police, hit the streets  
They would never take the boots off of their feet  
  
If I break the law and get caught  
I could get smashed in the face by the big boys  
'Cause they're frightened by the real world  
Frightened by the real world  
Scared of the real world. Oh yeah  
  
I saw a cop, he looked pretty shot  
By some criminals, left there to rot  
I took a look, no one around  
I put on his boots and stomped on the ground  
  
Stood tall and felt so strong  
I wanted to be just like them  
So I could hurt somebody  
Hurt somebody  
  
Hurt somebody, hurt somebody  
Scared of the real world. Oh yeah  
Scared of the real world. Oh yeah  
  
Don't litter or score in the dark  
Don't kill your lover and don't overpark  
Cause if you murder or if you loot  
Get the heel of my new leather boots  
  
If I break the law and get caught  
You could get smashed in the face  
By this young boy  
Who is frightened by the real world  
This boy is frightened by the real world  
I gonna hurt somebody  
'Cause I'm frightened of the real world. Oh yeah
