Oh oh  
Hold on  
Ah you know what?  
Can we back it up just a little bit?  
(Rewinding noises, various vocal sounds)  
  
I said why,  
I said why, (why)...  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me...  
Oh, oh, yeah...  
We were born the same day  
We even think the same way  
It couldn't be more right  
We are what they call a perfect match  
It's something that you can't touch  
Down to the last bone, you're my baby  
But to be honest  
There's just one thing  
A part that is missin'  
You don't seem to care at all  
  
Tell me, tell me, baby  
How come you don't wanna love me  
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you  
Tell me, tell me, just how  
What am I supposed to do right now  
Why can't you love me?  
Why-y, tell me, my baby  
  
Now from the moment we met  
I thought that I was all set  
How could I be so wrong  
Now I'm hearing that you're seeing someone new  
And I wanna know who  
But does he love you love like I do?  
You're my baby  
But I promise you this one thing  
Whatever that's missing  
I will make it up to you  
So tell me baby  
  
Tell me, tell me, baby  
How come you don't wanna love me  
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you  
Tell me, tell me, just how  
What am I supposed to do right now  
Why can't you love me?  
Why-y, tell me, my baby  
  
You're getting under my skin  
You're messing up with my mind  
You're never letting me into your life  
Tell me baby how come you don't you wanna love me  
And am I supposed to live without?  
If there is no way to make you feel the same way too  
Oh you...  
  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me  
  
We were born the same day  
We even think the same way  
We are what they all call a perfect match  
Tell me baby  
  
How come you don't wanna love me  
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you  
Tell me, tell me, just how  
What am I supposed to do right now?  
Why can't you love me?  
  
Tell me, baby  
Tell me, tell me, baby  
How come you don't wanna love me  
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you  
Tell me, tell me, just how  
What am I supposed to do right now  
Why can't you love me?  
  
Why-y, tell me, my baby  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, why  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah  
Tell me, tell me, tell me... Yeah  
I said, tell, me, baby.  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah,  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah.
