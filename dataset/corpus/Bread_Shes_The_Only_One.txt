She's a butterfly  
But she flies too high  
She won't speak the truth  
She don't make excuses  
She don't seem to care  
But you want her anywhere  
'cause she's the only one  
She don't make the scene  
But that don't chnge a thing  
You just plan and scheme  
You insist on dreamin'  
She won't play your game  
But it's all the same  
Now she's the only one  
She knows too well that she's the only one  
She doesn't care if you're the lonely one  
You want to say it's over, but it's just begun  
She's the only one  
She knows too well that she's the only one  
She doesn't care if you're the lonely one  
It's not the way you planned it  
But she's really got you on the run  
Your one and only one
