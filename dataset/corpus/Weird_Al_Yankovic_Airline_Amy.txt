Met this pretty young stewardess on a non-stop flight  
She showed me to my seat and it was love at first sight  
Now lately I've been flying to all kinds of places  
That I never really wanted to go  
'Cause I'll do anything just to spend a little time  
With the sutest flight attendant I know  
  
You set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy  
Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flyer, Airline Amy  
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747  
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy  
  
Every one of our dates is at thirty thousand feet  
She always points out the exits to me, she's so sweet  
You know she gets me my headphones for free  
Refills my coffee cup whenevr I ask  
And you gotta admit my baby looks pretty hot  
When she's wearin' that oxygen mask  
  
Well well, you set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy  
Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flyer, Airline Amy  
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747  
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy  
  
Amy, darlin', don't you know you really drive me nuts  
Every time you're handing out those honey roasted peanuts  
Airline Amy, this is my new mission  
Gotta get you in an upright locked position  
  
Oh yeah, you set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy  
Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flyer, Airline Amy  
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747  
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy  
Yeah yeah, you set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy  
You're the only woman I desire, Airline Amy Found a little piece of heaven on
a 747  
And no one else can take me higher  
No one else can take me higher  
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy
