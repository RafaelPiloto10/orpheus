In my house there's been a mercy killing.  
The man I used to be has been crucified.  
And the death of this man was the final way of revealing,  
In the spiritual way to live, I had to die.  
Now if I let that dead man linger in me,  
I might get a little idol in my way.  
So, I'm going down to the celebration river,  
And take this dead man down to a water grave.  
  
Chorus:  
I'm goin' down to the river.  
And I'm gonna be buried alive.  
I want to show my Heavenly Father,  
The man I use to be has finally died.  
  
Now when I think of where I'm goin',  
In terms of where I've been,  
It makes me glad to know, my Lord, that I've been born again.  
Now when I think of where I'm goin',  
In terms of where I've been,  
It makes me glad to know, my Lord, that I've been born again.  
  
Chorus
