Well there's a place where two worlds collide  
The pile of stone against the pull of the tide  
You can stay with your feet on the ground  
Or step into the water, leave the dry behind  
  
On the shoreline  
Meet me on the shoreline  
Where you can only swim if you try  
  
Well, if there's somewhere on the other side  
It might be better, it might be as bad  
Someday soon you'll have to make a move  
Cos you can't stay forever, ah just waiting  
  
On the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
Meet me on the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
  
Take me over, lead me through  
  
Well can you take me there, to the other side  
Where everything is new, uncertain and strange  
Don't ever let me go till we're there  
I don't know what it is I'm looking for  
And until it's found I won't be sure  
  
Well, there are squares in the game of life  
When you can keep on moving or turn aside  
Yes, there are times when you have to decide  
To put your feet in the water, or stay  
  
On the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
Meet me on the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
Where you can only swim if you try  
I'll be there, oh  
On the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
I'll be there on the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
Where you can only swim if you try  
I'll be there  
I'll be there, oh  
Yes, I'll be there  
I'll be there
