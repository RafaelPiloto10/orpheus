Dream lover please be mine  
I love you every night  
Dream lover where are you?  
You're the only one I'll ever love, uh huh  
Dream lover of my dreams  
I only see you when I dream my dream  
I love you endlessly  
I wake up nervous in a sweat  
Don't ever wake me up  
Don't wake me up  
Dream lover you're the only one I love  
  
It's only you who satisfies me  
You mesmerize and mystify me  
I'll never get this feeling from any other  
And I really miss you in the morning  
  
Dream lover you and I  
Are two lovers of the night  
Dream lover hope you see  
You're the only one I'll ever love, uh huh  
Dream lover of my dreams  
I only see you when I dream my dream  
I love you endlessly  
I wake up nervous in a sweat  
Don't ever wake me up  
Don't wake me up  
Dream lover you're the only one I love  
  
How I wish that I could keep you  
But I'll just see you when I see you  
I wish the night would last just a little longer  
?Cause I really miss you when it's morning  
  
After each night, the day seems long  
For dream lovers who wait to rush into each other's arms  
It's you that keeps me dreaming  
  
Dream lover please be mine  
I love you every night  
Dream lover where are you?  
You're the only one I'll ever love, uh huh  
Dream lover of my dreams  
I only see you when I dream my dream  
I love you endlessly  
I wake up nervous in a sweat  
Don't ever wake me up  
Don't wake me up  
Dream lover you're the only one I  
  
Love of my love  
Dream of my dream
