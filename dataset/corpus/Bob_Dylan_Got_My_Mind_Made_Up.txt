Don't ever try to change me  
I been in this thing too long  
There's nothing you can say or do  
To make me think I'm wrong  
Well I'm going off to Libya  
There's guy I gotta see  
He's been living there three years now  
In an oil refinery  
I've got my mind made up  
I've got my mind made up.  
  
Call your Ma in Talahassee  
Tell her her baby's on the line  
Tell her not to worry  
Everything is gonna be fine  
Well I gave you all my money  
All my connections too  
There ain't nothing in this world girl  
You can say I didn't give to you  
I've got my mind made up  
I've got my mind made up.  
  
You will be alright girl  
Someone's watching over you  
He won't do nothing to you  
Baby that I wouldn't do  
Well if you don't want to see me  
Look the other way  
You don't have to feed me  
I ain't your dog that's gone astray  
I've got my mind made up  
I've got my mind made up.  
I've got my mind made up  
I've got my mind made up.  
I've got my mind made up.
