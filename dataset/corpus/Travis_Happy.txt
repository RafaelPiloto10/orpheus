It starts in the morning  
When you're lying next to me  
I'm rolling, I'm rolling  
I'm rolling so quickly  
Now I'm not a doctor  
And I'm not a lawyer  
I get a prescription and set it on fire  
Blow me a kiss  
I'll be happy for the rest of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy  
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy  
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy  
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy  
Oh, oh, aw  
And I'm so happy  
  
And I really shouldn't like it  
But I love it  
When I say I'm not excited  
You're invited  
And I think I'm getting older  
There's this weight across ma shoulder  
Its a shame we're the same  
Such a shame I'm to blame all the time  
  
But early this evening  
I wanted to be with you  
I got on the blower  
The next thing I know you're speaking  
Now I'm gonna tell you what I've been thinking  
And I've got a hunch that you're thinking the same thing and with some luck  
We'll be lying together tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh oh ah  
Oh oh ah  
Oh oh ah  
And I'm so happy
