Take comfort where you find it  
whatever gets you through  
Take comfort don't be blind to it  
You must do what's a right for you  
  
Every one at times must run for cover  
Don't you know you really can't be blamed  
For in this you're just like any other  
There's no need, no need to feel ashamed  
  
Take comfort where you see it  
Whatever makes it right  
Take comfort when you need it  
To help you through the night  
  
By the way we live in our confusion  
And the way that we misspend our youth  
By the time we're stripped of our illusions  
We may find illusions are the truth
