All day I'm walking in a dream  
I think about you constantly  
Just like an ever flowing stream  
Your memory haunts me constantly  
  
Shadows fall and I try to drive you from my mind  
So you're no longer near to me  
But my heart sees you there with me  
Every sunset you share with me  
  
The rain that patters through the trees reminds  
Me of you constantly  
Your name is whispered by the breeze and love birds  
Bring your song to me  
  
Just as sure as the stars keep burning  
In the sky your love will stay a flame in me  
A flame that burns so bright  
Not only through the night  
But constantly  
  
Just as sure as each star keeps burning  
In the sky your love will stay a flame in me  
A flame that burns so bright  
Not only through the night  
But constantly  
  
Though we may be far apart  
You're constantly deep in my heart
