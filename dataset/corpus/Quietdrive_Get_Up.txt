Sometimes it's not that time  
For things I cannot hear  
For words I cannot feel  
The way you want to go  
It makes me feel like shit  
I'm messed but that's not it  
I wonder if she'll care  
For me ever again  
Waiting for the last time  
I'm waiting for the right time  
To see if she will know the things  
She doesn't say to me  
  
And I feel the way I feel  
Because I need you all the time  
And I know the things you know  
But that's just not enough to make it mine  
And I won't do anything that it might  
Compromise this time  
So I'll just sit and hold my breath  
Only that's not enough to make you mine  
  
Get up it's time to die  
Just guess and don't ask why  
Be late and just don't try  
Someday we will fly  
Higher than the satellites  
Into a spacial paradise  
Where up is up and down is down  
And no one is around  
(I don't want to see you crying)  
(Let's leave)  
(The dramatics behind)  
  
And I feel the way I feel  
Because I need you all the time  
And I know the things you know  
But that's just not enough to make it mine  
And I won't do anything that it might  
Compromise this time  
So I'll just sit and hold my breath  
Only that's not enough to make you mine  
  
To make you mine  
To make you mine
