Never had no need  
For any military aid  
And I never took charge of the light brigade  
I got no castle to defend or attack  
But still I seem to be picking up flack  
I am the captain of this body of mine  
I'll send fear into the enemy lines  
On the ground, in the air or at sea  
They're all pointing a finger at me  
I'm at war with the world  
That's the way it must be  
I'll fight while I can  
To put an end to this misery  
I'm at war with the world  
I'll have to fight to be free  
Yes I'm at war with the world  
Nobody's capturing me  
Never have no need  
For any military aid  
Never took charge of the light brigade  
I got no castle to defend or attack  
But still I seem to be picking up flack  
War with the world, with the world  
I'll have to fight to be be free  
Yes I'm at war with the world, with the world  
Nobody's capturing me  
War with the world  
What do they want from me?  
War with the world  
Why don't they let me be?
