Go home Ann  
Go home Ann  
Go home Ann  
Ann go home  
I had you in my bed last night  
I did what I wanted to do, well all right  
Go home Ann, it's almost funny  
Go home Ann, it's almost done  
I never said I loved you  
Never said I cared  
This won't last forever  
There is something in my heart  
Go home Ann  
Go home Ann  
Go home Ann  
Ann go home  
I tricked you, had my fun  
You could have been anyone  
Go home Ann, it's almost funny  
Go home Ann, it's almost done  
I never said I loved you  
Never said I cared  
This won't last forever  
There is something in my heart
