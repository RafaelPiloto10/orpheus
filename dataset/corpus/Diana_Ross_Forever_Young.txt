May God bless  
And keep you always  
May your wishes all come true  
May you always do for others  
And let others do for you  
  
May you build a ladder to the stars  
And climb every road  
And may you stay forever young  
  
May you grow up to be righteous  
May you grow up to be true  
May you always know the truth  
And see the light surrounding you  
  
May you always be gracious  
Stand upright and be strong  
And may you stay  
Stay forever young  
  
Forever young  
Forever young  
May you stay forever young  
  
May your hands always be busy  
May your feet always be swift  
May you have a strong foundation  
With the winds changing shift  
  
May your heart always be joyful  
May your song always be sung  
And may you stay  
  
Forever young  
Forever young  
Stay forever young  
Stay forever young  
  
Stay  
Stay forever young  
Forever young  
Forever young  
  
Stay forever young
