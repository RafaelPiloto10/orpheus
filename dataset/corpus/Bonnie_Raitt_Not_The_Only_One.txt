I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction  
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin' that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.  
  
One chance intervention, see what it can signify  
The slightest misapprehension, baby  
And we'd have passed each other by  
When I heard your sweet voice callin'  
Saw your light come shinin' through  
I couldn't stop my heart from turning  
Churnin' out my love for you, my love to you.  
  
I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction  
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin' that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.  
  
True love or perfection  
It seems like it's overdue  
Then just when you least expect it  
It comes sneakin' up on you  
When I thought that I was dreaming  
Felt your body close to mine  
Now love takes on a different meaning,  
Together till the end of time.  
  
I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction  
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin' that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.  
  
I was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction  
Feelin that I'd always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin that I wasn't the only one  
The lonely one.
