The boy's got problems  
The boy's got stress  
The boys' a .38 hidden in his desk  
The boy's got a chickie  
With four months to go  
Grim Facts - every parent better know  
  
The girl's a deadly teaser  
Wants to do a private show  
She's got a hundred thousand fantasies  
She wants the band to know  
She likes to brush across my Levis  
She likes to watch him grow  
Grim Facts - every parent better know  
Grim Facts - every parent better know  
  
[Chorus]  
Red lights - Gang fights  
Brewing in the heat  
Cop cars - Gay bars  
On your precious street  
That ain't so neat  
  
Sister's on the street now  
Looking for some Joe  
Only got about an hour  
To pay for her new nose  
She gets a hundred for her body  
A nickel for her soul  
These are grim facts - every parent must know  
Grim facts - every parent must know  
  
[Chorus]  
Red lights - Gang fights  
Brewing in the heat  
Cop cars - Gay bars  
On your precious street  
That ain't so neat  
  
And I'm feeling itchy  
Got a fire down below  
I'm a walkin loaded time bomb  
Just about to blow  
Tries to slide inside my pockets  
But it's strictly SRO  
Grim facts - every parent gonna know  
Grim facts - every parent gonna know  
  
[Chorus]  
Red lights - Gang fights  
Brewing in the heat  
Cop cars - Gay bars  
On your precious street  
That ain't so neat  
  
Mmm Grim facts, you know, growing all the time  
Mmm Grim facts, real grim Yeah
