In the eyes of a woman, in a world of desire,  
From the moment she looked my way. I was so hypnotized  
Should I show how I feel, she's the magnet, I'm steel  
The eyes of a woman, there's nowhere to run  
The eyes of a woman  
  
In the arms of an angel, in a dangerous disguise  
Love's a blue fascination  
It's a mystery that burns, takes a lifetime to learn  
The eyes of a woman, there's nowhere to run  
The eyes of a woman, my fears come undone  
In the eyes of a woman, there's nowhere to run  
The eyes of a woman, my fears come undone  
  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run
