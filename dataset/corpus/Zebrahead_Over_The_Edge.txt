She wants to know where I've been  
She's got the gloves on again  
She thinks she's smooth now I'm saying  
I'm not going down (I'm not going down)  
You say this ain't the end to me  
Fall down, pull the rug under me  
Feels like I'm falling but I tell you  
I'm not going down  
One day, you'll be the end of me  
Go blind, pull the wool over me  
Feels like I'm falling but I tell you  
I'm not going down  
Because you push me over the edge  
Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath  
Because you push me over the edge  
Tired of wasting my time  
And you're putting me through this again (through this again)  
She wants to fight and I've been drinking  
We put the walls up again  
I know she's right that I'm tripping  
But I'm not going down  
Repeat Chorus  
Because you  
Never did try  
Never did look to see that I'm alright (whoa)  
Because you're  
Always right  
Gotta fight  
Always want to know (whoa)  
Because you
