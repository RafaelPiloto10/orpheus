All men must have someone, have someone  
Who would never take advantage  
Of a love bright as the sun.  
Someone to understand them,  
And you just may be the one.  
  
All men must have someone, have someone  
Who would never take for granted  
All the pleasures and the fun.  
Someone to stand beside them  
And you just may be the one.  
  
I saw when you walked by  
The love light in your eye  
And I knew I must try  
To win you more than just a friend,  
I'm starting near the end,  
And I go again.  
  
All men must have someone, have someone  
Who would never take advantage  
Of a love bright as the sun.  
Someone to stand beside them  
And you just may be the one.  
Someone to understand them,  
And you just may be the one.
