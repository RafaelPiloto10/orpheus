Clear,  
Yeah,  
Yeah its official  
Yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Hey ziggy I told them niggas (oh yeah)  
They wouldn't believe me tho  
I do this shit though  
  
[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]  
Its 3:45 she pulled up to my house  
Grabbed my strap, got the door  
With a blunt in my mouth  
Say I'm bout to put the smack down  
You know i'll put the smack down  
And now I put the smack down  
She park in the background  
Look at me I'm standing tall  
She knows how to keep it up  
We just left the club  
So you know we both drunk as fuck  
30 min in, second wind  
Call it cardio  
I go up and down round and round super Mario!  
Oh wee oh wee she busting like a Uzi  
I'm riding that Suzuki  
She wetting such a jacuzzi  
Call it in, code 10  
Get ready for the water flow  
Number 16 terr it up  
  
[Chorus: Trey Songz]  
What can I say (i ain't lying)  
Ain't no easy way to say this (yeah)  
And I don't know if you can handle it (I don't know if you can handle it)  
But I'm thinking about taking it ((taking it there))  
Cause thats the only way you ain't get it (and you)  
You lay around with them boys up town (laying around)  
And I've been thinking about it all day long (all day long shawty)  
And that two think I cant handle it ((but her)  
But I'm think I might end up taking it  
  
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]  
I'm thinking about it, then by receiving  
She can get it right back up , just give her a reason  
Any given season winter, spring, summer, fall  
I came to see the show baby goin' and make the water fall  
She know I'm the one to call when she want that good shit  
She know I'm the one to call when she wants the hood shit  
Baby looking all good about to meet her all hood  
Jump her in the call yea you know the handle all wood  
I stepped up in the spot (spot) yea smelling like a pound  
Yea you know I'm taking name, yea ain't got to take em down  
Yea ain't got to take em off for me, over aggressive  
About to be an accident just call for progressive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]  
I don't know if you can handle this, know if you can handle me  
First I'm gonna start right here where your man should be  
I don't know if you can handle this, know if you can handle young  
If you ain't never had a real nigga, better get you one  
Come through on some thug shit (thug shit)  
Gotta respect shit  
Yea I come through on some thug shit (thug shit)  
Gotta accept it  
She know that I'm never shy most time we probably high  
Kid licked the kitty cat you goin' need an alibi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And how you doing jeezy [Repeat: x3]
