We've got the power, we've got the hunger for the search  
As we race across the heavens to embrace the universe  
In this hour and in truth what is it worth  
When we can't escape the madness  
We've created on this earth  
  
They say that money talks but you and I  
Know places money just don't say enough  
  
Let there be love where there is emptiness  
Let there be faith where hope is gone  
Let there be strength where there is helplessness  
And open eyes to see right from wrong  
We've gotta find a way to trust  
The very best in all of us  
Let there be love, let there be love  
  
We live divided behind imaginary walls  
Brother against brother, we just watch each other fall  
With hearts united we will never stand so tall  
Reachin' out to one another  
We'll find the meaning of it all  
  
Ain't one power we will ever know  
Could ever heal the poverty of the soul  
  
Let there be love where there is emptiness  
Let there be faith where hope is gone  
Let there be strength where there is helplessness  
And open eyes to see right from wrong  
We've gotta find a way to trust  
To forgive and rise above  
Let there be love, let there be love  
  
(When will we learn, tell me when will we see)  
How many more promises spoken  
While the dreams of the innocent die  
Every day another heart gets broken  
While the flame of hate survives  
When will the healing begin in our lives  
  
Let there be love where there is emptiness  
Let there be faith where hope is gone  
Let there be strength where there is helplessness  
And open eyes to see right from wrong  
We've gotta find a way to trust  
The very best in all of us  
Gotta be more than wise enough  
To forgive and rise above  
Let there be love, let there be love
