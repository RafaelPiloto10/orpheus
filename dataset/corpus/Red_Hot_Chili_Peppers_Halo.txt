I'm the man, I'm the king  
I'm the one that's pure inside  
Everyday, Everyway  
I smell of suicide  
Bitter sins how they grow within  
So you tell me it ain't right  
I am all sins and you're my reason for life  
  
I will stone you, stone you  
Wrap my arms around you  
I will stone you, stone you  
My little halo  
  
I'm the man, I'm the king  
I'm the one that's broken from giving  
Everday, everyway  
I swear just one last try  
Killing me with the death to be  
Something that's so right  
I am all sins, my hands are scarred with time  
  
I will stone you, stone you  
Wrap my arms around you  
I will stone you, stone you  
My little halo  
  
I'm the man with the rock in his hand, got  
The rock in my hand gonna stone you stone you
