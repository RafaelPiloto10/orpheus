Don't wanna know you  
Don't wanna know your name  
Said I don't wanna call you  
Don't wanna talk about anything  
I don't wanna like you  
I don't care if you like me  
Said and if you haven't caught on yet  
I'm lying through my teeth  
  
See the problem is the more I fight it  
The harder it gets to deny it  
And everything in me wants to be with you  
But I've seen where love can leave you devastated  
So everyday I look in the mirror and I say this  
  
I tell my self I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
Said I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
'Cause I know what it is and I know just what it does  
So I don't wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
I don't wanna be in love  
  
Don't wanna love when you walk in the room  
Don't wanna love everything to the click clack of your shoes  
Don't wanna love when you put on sweats in the afternoon  
And you curl up next to me as we watch cartoons  
  
Said I don't wanna be  
I tell myself I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
SaiD I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
'Cause I know what it is and I know what it does  
So I don't wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
I don't wanna be in love  
  
Wish I didn't love the way you smile at me  
And the sun shines  
Wish we could live happily ever after but girl I'm terrified  
Even though it feels so right  
  
I tell myself I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
Said I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
'Cause I know what it is and I know just what it does  
So I don't wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
I don't wanna be in love  
  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
Said I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
'Cause I know what it is and I know what it does  
So I don't wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
So I don't wanna be in love  
  
So now I don't wanna be in love,  
Right now is just too much,  
So I don't wanna be in love...
