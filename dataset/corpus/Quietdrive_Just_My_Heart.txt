The way I feel when I'm in doubt  
Is the way I feel when I'm without  
The way you kiss when we're alone  
The way you won't pick up your phone  
  
But she works on that garden alone like her father  
All day long, all day long  
And I think that she's thinking of me but you know I may be wrong, I may be
wrong  
  
It's only just my heart  
It's only just my veins  
You've been swimming in so long  
Slowly killing all this pain  
  
Don't you know I like the way she makes me laugh out loud  
The way she makes me think about  
The perfect way to turn her on  
The way that I slip off her tongue  
  
But she works on that garden alone like her father  
All day long, all day long  
And I think that she's thinking of me but you know  
I may be wrong, I may be wrong  
  
It's only just my heart  
It's only just my veins  
You've been swimming in so long  
Slowly killing all this pain  
But it's only just the sun  
That takes away the rain  
Suddenly I'm not as sad as yesterday  
What's left to say when you've said all you've said  
Take down the picture by my bed  
What's left to bleed when you've bled all you've bled  
I keep on thinking about  
  
The way I feel when I'm out of luck  
The way that I can't live without you  
  
What's left to take when you have nothing left  
You took all the best  
  
It's only just my heart  
It's only just my veins  
You've been swimming in so long  
Slowly killing all this pain  
But it's only just the sun  
That takes away the rain  
Suddenly I'm not as mad  
Suddenly I'm not as bad  
  
Suddenly I'm not as sad as yesterday  
Suddenly I'm not as sad as yesterday
