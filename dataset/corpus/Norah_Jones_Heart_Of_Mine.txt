Heart of mine, be still  
You can play with fire but you'll get the bill  
Don't let him know, don't let him know that you love him  
Oh, don't be a fool, don't be blind heart of mine  
Heart of mine, go back home  
You've got no reason to wander, no reason to roam  
Don't let him see, don't let him see that you need him  
Oh, don't put yourself over the line heart of mine  
Heart of mine, go back where you've been  
The only trouble for you is if you let him in  
Don't let him hear, don't let him hear where you're going  
Oh, untie the ties that bind heart of mine  
Heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile  
I give you an inch and you take a mile  
Don't let yourself fall, don't let yourself stumble  
Oh, do the time, don't do the crime heart of mine  
Heart of mine  
Heart of mine
