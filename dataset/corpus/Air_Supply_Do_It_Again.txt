I used to watch you walk away  
Til the road you take would bend  
I was the man to turn you on  
And you knew it after all  
Come tomorrow when I'm all weary  
You would turn me down again  
At least that's the way I can remember  
  
Do it again, do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
  
Every little word you told me got home  
I'm still thinking about them  
Every little secret we could have known  
And we can't live without them  
  
You surely started something  
You surely gave me something new  
  
Do it again, do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
  
And I do think about you each now and then  
And each time it gets tighter  
From the road I can see the last break  
And my head's getting lighter  
  
Do it again, do it again (repeat)
