Love would be easy if you always said the right thing  
Love would be easy if you never had to think about  
How somebody else would feel  
So go and live the life of strangers  
Put a mask on  
Dance around the dangers  
And never look behind your lover's face  
So I'll never have the chance to give you grace  
  
It's in the fights and falls working through it all  
When you're not afraid to climb another wall  
When you speak the truth that you used to hide  
Seems like you're crossing to the other side  
But then I follow you so you're not alone  
Then I wrap my arms around you and take you home  
And say it's okay, it's okay if love is that hard  
That's how we find out who we really are  
  
What you're going through, I go through all that too  
What you're going through, is nothing short of why I fell in love with you  
So go and lay there in the shadows  
Like an outcast too messed up to deal with  
But what you think is broken is what I need  
Yeah that's the stuff that's gonna heal the brokenness in me  
  
It's in the fights and falls working through it all  
When you're not afraid to climb another wall  
When you speak the truth that you use to hide  
Seems like you're crossing to the other side  
But then I follow you so you're not alone  
Then I wrap my arms around you and take you home  
And say it's okay, it's okay if love is that hard  
That's how we find out who we really are  
That's how we find out who we really are  
  
It's in the fights and falls working through it all  
Just to get it back you would scratch and crawl  
When you speak the truth that you used to hide  
Seems like there's no way to get off this ride  
But then I follow you so you're not alone  
Then I wrap my arms around you and take you home  
And say it's okay, it's okay if love is that hard  
Say it's okay, it's okay if love is that hard  
That's how we find out who we really are  
It's how we find out who we really are
