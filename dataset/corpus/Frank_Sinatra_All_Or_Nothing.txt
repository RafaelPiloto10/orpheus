All or nothing at all  
Half a love, never appealed to me  
If your heart, never could yield to me  
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all  
  
All or nothing at all  
If it's love, there is no in between  
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been  
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all  
  
But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek  
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall  
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak  
And my heart may go dizzy and fall  
  
And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call  
I would be, caught in the undertow  
So you see, I've got to say no, no  
All or nothing at all
