This tattered document  
A mystery you can solve  
Some burnt out filament  
Flies buzzing around the bulb  
  
Country darkness  
  
He thought of traveling  
Heard an approaching train  
Drown out his desperate pulse  
A song with no refrain  
  
Country darkness  
  
She daydreams forbidden sings  
There must be something more  
The prison she lives in  
The one with the open door  
  
Country darkness  
  
The veil is covering  
A glistening and cruel blade  
Suffer little children  
Repent, unfaithful maid  
  
Country darkness
