[Barbra:]  
Once there was a wicked witch  
In the lovely land of oz  
And a wickeder, wickeder,  
Wickeder witch that never, ever was  
She filled the folks in Munchkin Land  
With terror and with dread  
Till one fine day from Kansas  
A house fell on her head  
And the coroner pronounced her: dead  
And through the town the joyous news went running  
The joyous news that the wicked old witch  
Was finally done in  
Ding-Dong! The witch is dead!  
  
[Harold:]  
Which old witch?  
[Barbra:]  
The wicked witch  
Ding-Dong! The wicked witch is dead!  
Wake up you sleepy head  
  
[Harold:]  
Rub your eyes  
  
[Barbra:]  
Get out of that bed  
Wake up! The wicked old witch is dead!  
  
[Both:]  
She's gone where the goblins go  
Below, below, below - yo-ho!  
Let's open up and sing  
  
[Barbra:]  
And ring those bells out...  
  
[Harold:]  
Sing the news out!  
  
[Barbra:]  
Ding-Dong! The merry-o  
Sing it high and sing it low  
Let them know the wicked old witch is dead  
  
[Harold:]  
Why everyone's glad  
She took such a crownin'  
  
[Barbra:]  
Bein' hit by a house  
Is even worse than drownin'  
  
[Both:]  
Let 'em know the wicked old witch is dead!!!
