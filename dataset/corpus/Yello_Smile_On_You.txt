Thank you very very much ladies and gentlemen  
You still are programmed  
Of your local radio station  
That's not just giving you another feature  
We are presenting you the truth  
The truth about human beings  
The truth about human desire  
The truth about human eyes  
The truth about human faces  
The truth about everybody  
The truth about you
