In a run down bed and breakfast  
A room with a view, across the river  
I tried to loos the claustrophobia  
Opened up and find Utopia  
There's no more denying  
As my mind go flying  
Ten light years away to save my soul  
Ten light years away to change it all  
Whatever it may take I gotta try again  
Girl it's time to start over  
Ten light years away  
I'd been watching the reflection  
Of a bamboo in the shade, when I saw her  
A very hot day in Havana  
In a midnight blue lagoon  
So I tried to get exciting  
I knew she was hiding  
Ten light years away so take me home  
Ten light years away where i come from  
Help me find today It's been way too long  
Girl it's time to start over  
Ten light years away  
There's no more denying  
As my mind go flying  
Ten light years away to save my soul  
Ten light years away to change it all  
Whatever it may take I gotta try again  
Girl it's time to start over  
Ten light years away so take me home  
Ten light years away to change it all  
Help me find today It's been way too long  
Girl it's time to start over  
Ten light years away
