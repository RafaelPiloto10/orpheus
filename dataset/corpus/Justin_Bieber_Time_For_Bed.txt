What you wanna do girl  
We've been on the phone  
We've been sending texts  
When you coming through girl?  
I don't wanna talk  
I just wanna see what's next  
Girl, bring your behind to me  
I promise to give you what you need  
Tell me your fantasies  
And I guarantee that you won't ever wanna leave  
  
So listen you on your way  
Cause I know I'm turning you on  
Name no play like foreplay  
At 3 o'clock in the morn'  
And it ain't no way the neighbors ain't gon' hear all that moaning  
And that screaming  
Are you ready baby?  
  
Girl I think it's time for bed  
But I ain't tryna go to sleep  
So just bring your body to me  
Cause it's time for bed  
See I'm gon' give you what I need  
When we're rolling our bodies to jeans  
Cause it's time for bed  
Time for bed  
Girl it's time for bed  
Time for bed  
Girl it's time for bed  
Time for bed  
  
[Justin Bieber]  
And I know that I can turn you on  
Guess til forever til the early morning  
And I don't know if you're on the streets no more  
I'm gonna swear that you be going back at me for more
