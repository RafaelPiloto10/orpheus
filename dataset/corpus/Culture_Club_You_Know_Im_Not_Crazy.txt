Say your mind has an overload  
Your heart beats rhythm  
Hot and cold  
Your stature has a naked bucks  
When you're near  
You're not like us  
  
[Chorus:]  
You know I'm not crazy  
You know I'm not crazy  
  
I caught on to the way you smile  
Love could only last a while  
I couldn't love  
I couldn't touch  
The situation  
Was too much  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your love fails me  
Your love, it fails me  
Your love fails me  
Your love, it drives me crazy  
  
Don't tell me that lovers always mistrust  
The lies in your eyes  
The death in your lust  
It's more than distraction  
You touch you feel  
Our hearts dance apart  
And you say this is real  
You know I'm not crazy  
  
Talk about the love we feel  
The passion that our hearts conceal  
Kiss and run  
The fools we trust  
Love inside a blinding lust  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold me to my every word  
Forget about the things you heard  
Time will conquer  
Time will state  
We owe every tear to fate  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your love fails me  
Your love, it fails me  
Your love fails me  
Your love, it drives me crazy
