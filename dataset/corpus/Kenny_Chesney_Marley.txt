I've seen so many places and so many faces  
Left behind so many traces of my soul  
I carry all these voices with the ringing in my ears  
Some girl's tears and the rhythm of the road  
Sometimes my life takes more than I can give  
That's when I gotta go  
  
Where no one's around  
But the silence and the sound  
Of "Three Little Birds" for company  
I got a sip of something strong  
A secondhand "Old Man and the Sea"  
Out here with me  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
  
God knows I love my life and I thank Him every night  
But sometimes I feel the knife of responsibility  
And the struggle and the strife, what's wrong and what's right  
Has got me searching for the light and my place of peace  
  
Where no one's around  
But the silence and the sound  
Of "Three Little Birds" for company  
I got a sip of something strong  
A secondhand "Old Man and the Sea"  
Out here with me  
Me and Marley  
  
We all live in chaos, noise and negativity  
But I still believe in one love bigger than you and me  
You and me  
You and me and Marley  
You and me and Marley  
  
I hear redemption's song  
A whisper on the sea  
Out here with me  
Out here with me  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
  
I hear redemption's song  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley
