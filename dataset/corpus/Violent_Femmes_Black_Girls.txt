I dig the black girls,  
Oh so much more than the white girls.  
I was so pleased to learn they were faster.  
Si-est, si-est, si-est vous I'm after?  
  
All comes a faggot white boy.  
Said look, look, look first kind of joy.  
They come around so queer and quiet,  
As I rebel and riot.  
  
Shall I dig the white boys?  
All so much more that the black boys.  
I was so pleased to learn they're not smarter.  
Go on, give, give, give it to me harder,  
Harder, harder, just say harder.  
  
You know I love the Lord of hosts,  
the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.  
I was so pleased to learn that he's inside me  
In my time of trouble he will hide me.  
  
I dig the black girls.  
I dig the black girls.  
I dig the black girls.  
I dig the black girls.
