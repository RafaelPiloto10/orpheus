The hours, the minutes seem to fly  
And since the last goodbye  
You and I came a long way  
The nights, too short to fill with sleep  
Or falling in too deep  
Seem so far away now  
  
Memories, all we share between us  
Everything we were, all that we remain  
But memories somehow came between us  
Breaking up two minds that were one and the same  
  
The years are moments passing by  
No time to wonder why  
You and I went the wrong way  
The days too short to fill with dreams  
Or question what it means  
Are a part of me now  
  
Remember all the leaves were falling  
Walking hand in hand, standing in the rain  
Remember distant voices calling  
Whispers in the dark, I can hear them again  
  
Since the last goodbye  
It's all the wrong way 'round  
Since the last goodbye  
It's all the wrong way 'round  
  
Memories, all we share between us  
Everything we were, all that we remain  
But memories somehow came between us  
Breaking up two minds that were one and the same  
  
Since the last goodbye  
It's all the wrong way 'round  
Since the last goodbye  
It's all the wrong way 'round
