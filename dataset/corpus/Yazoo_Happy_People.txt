Take no notice 'Cause I'm just the same  
There's a thousand other faces with the very same name  
And we look like each other, and we all live together.  
We talk about the same things  
And we never try and change things.  
  
[Chorus]  
We're the happy, happy people  
  
We never give opinions and we never state views  
After all, you can't be sure that what we say is true  
And if you want to join us, you can follow on behind us.  
You can talk about your visions  
You can make some big decisions.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We believe in having fun and smiling all the time  
And sometimes we're on tv if we're over 69  
And when we have a raffle, then it's just a big reshuffle.  
It's a democratic poll  
But we're the ones who are in control.  
  
[Chorus]
