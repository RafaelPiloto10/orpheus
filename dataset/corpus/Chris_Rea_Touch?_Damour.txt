Touche d'amour  
Yours is a sunny day.  
Of this I'm sure - blowing my clouds away.  
Ijust don't know what this will do to me  
I only want it to be  
Touche d'amour  
Touche d'amour  
Yeah.  
Touche d'amour  
I'm sailing around the room.  
Like never before could never have come too soon.  
I want this dance to last forever  
For it to last forever more.  
Touche d'amour  
Touche d'amour  
Yeah.  
I want this dance to last forever  
For it to last forever more.  
Touche d'amour  
Touche d'amour  
Touche d'amour  
Touche d'amour  
Oh.  
Touche  
Touche d'amour  
Touche d'amour.
