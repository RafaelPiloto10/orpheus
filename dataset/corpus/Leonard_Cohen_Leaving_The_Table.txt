I'm leaving the table  
I'm out of the game  
I don't know the people  
In your picture frame  
If I ever loved you or no, no  
It's a crying shame if I ever loved you  
If I knew your name  
You don't need a lawyer  
I'm not making a claim  
You don't need to surrender  
I'm not taking aim  
  
I don't need a lover, no, no  
The wretched beast is tame  
I don't need a lover  
So blow out the flame  
  
There's nobody missing  
There is no reward  
Little by little  
We're cutting the cord  
We're spending the treasure, oh, no, no  
That love cannot afford  
I know you can feel it  
The sweetness restored  
  
I don't need a reason  
For what I became  
I've got these excuses  
They're tired and lame  
I don't need a pardon, no, no, no, no, no  
There's no one left to blame  
I'm leaving the table  
I'm out of the game  
  
I'm leaving the table  
I'm out of the game
