[Instrumental]  
  
I stepped outside of my little house and stood barefoot on a rock. The pacific
ocean rolled towards me. Across the bay, a family of seals sprawled on the
kelp uncovered by the low tide. A blue heron honked overhead. All around the
house the wild roses were blooming. The air smelled sweet and salty and loud
with crows and bees. My house was clean. I had food in the fridge for a week.
I sat outside 'til the sun went down.  
  
That night the piano beckoned for the first time in ten years. My fingers
found these patterns which express what words could not. This song poured out
while a brown bear rummaged through my garbage cans.  
  
The song has seven verses constructed for the days of that happy week. On
Thursday the bear arrives.
