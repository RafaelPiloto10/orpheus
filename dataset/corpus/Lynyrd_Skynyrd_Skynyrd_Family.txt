Well it looks like it's another Skynyrd Family Christmas time  
Seems like it was just New Years day  
Started out in old L.A.  
  
Those big wheels keep turning once again  
Well this bus we ride we call our home  
And it's what keeps us moving on  
But eleven months on this road  
I'm going home  
  
Family's there trimming the tree  
Cooking that turkey waiting on me  
Just like Santa I'll be right on time  
38'll be there too  
  
CDB will be guiding you to another Christmas time  
Sleigh bells ringing  
Children singing  
It's another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
Sleigh bells ringing  
Children singing  
It's another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
Sleigh bells ringing  
Children singing  
  
It's another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
It's another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
It's another Skynyrd family Christmas time  
It's another Skynyrd family Christmas time
