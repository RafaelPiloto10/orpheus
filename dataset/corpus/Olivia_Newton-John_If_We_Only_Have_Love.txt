If we only have love  
Then tomorrow will dawn  
And the days of our years  
Will rise on that morn  
If we only have love  
To embrace without fears  
We will kiss with our eyes  
We will sleep without tears  
  
If we only have love  
With our arms open wide  
Then the young and the old  
Will stand at our side  
  
If we only have love  
Love that's falling like rain  
Then the parched desert earth  
Will grow green again  
  
If we only have love  
For the Him that we shout  
For the song that we sing  
Then we'll have a way out  
  
I we only have love  
Then Jerusalem Stands  
And then death has no shadow  
There are no foreign lands  
  
If we only have love  
We will never bow down  
We'll be tall as the pines  
Neither heroes nor clowns  
  
If we only have love  
To be shared with all men  
We will drink from the grail  
To be born once again  
  
Then with nothing at all  
But the little we are  
We'll have conquered all time,  
All space, the sun and the stars.
