It only happens when I dance with you  
That trip to heaven till the dance is through  
With no one else do the heavens seem quite so near  
Why does it happen, dear, only with you?  
  
Two cheeks together can be so divine  
But only when those cheeks are yours and mine  
I've danced with dozens of others the whole night through  
But the thrill that comes with spring when anything can happen  
That only happens with you  
  
  
  
Two cheeks together can be so divine  
But only when those cheeks are yours and mine  
I've danced with dozens of others the whole night through  
But the thrill that comes with spring when anything can happen  
That only happens with you
