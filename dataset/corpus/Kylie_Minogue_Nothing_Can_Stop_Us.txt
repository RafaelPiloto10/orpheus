I've gone a long, long way  
Since the day you walked into my life  
We've smoothed out all the rough edges  
Of our sweet love and devotion  
The price is high given life as a scale  
Wondering where I'd gone wrong  
And I know it's going to work out fine  
When I see that look in your eyes  
I never felt so good  
I never felt so strong  
Nothing can stop us now  
Yeah, nothing can stop us now  
[Incomprehensible] some people say  
That a man who thinks that a woman is weak  
Is so wrong  
'Cause nobody can hide from you  
We both know something else is true  
Just the touch of your hand  
And I know we're going to make it  
I never felt so good  
I never felt so strong  
Nothing can stop us now  
I never felt so good  
I never felt so strong  
Nothing can stop us now  
Nothing can stop us now  
Nothing can stop us now  
Nothing can stop us now
