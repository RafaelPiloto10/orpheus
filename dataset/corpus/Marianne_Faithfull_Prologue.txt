So my sister and I left Louisiana  
Where the moon on the Mississippi is a-shining ever,  
Like you always hear in the songs of Dixie.  
We look forward to our home-coming?  
And the sooner the better.  
  
Anna II  
  
And the sooner the better!  
  
Anna I  
  
It's a month already since we started  
For the great big cities where you go to make money.  
In seven years our fortune will be made  
And then we can go back.  
  
Anna II  
  
In six years would be much nicer.  
  
Anna I  
  
Our mom and dad and both our brothers wait in old Louisiana  
And we'll send them all our money as we make it,  
For all the money's got to go to build a little house  
Down by the Mississippi in Louisiana.  
Right, Anna ?  
  
Anna II  
  
Yes, Anna.  
  
Anna I  
  
She's the one with the looks, I'm realistic,  
She's just a little mad, my head is on straight.  
But we're really one divided being  
Even though you see two of us  
And both of us are Anna,  
Together we've but a single past, a single future,  
One heart and one savings account,  
And we only do what's best for one another.  
Right, Anna?  
  
Anna II  
  
Yes, Anna.
