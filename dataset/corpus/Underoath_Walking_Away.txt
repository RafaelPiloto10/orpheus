The day I left you was the worst mistake I ever made  
Was ready to become something I didn't need you dragging me down  
Thought your love just wasn't enough  
My hair combed, nice shoes tied tight  
  
Was ready to conquer life  
Help unwanted I can do this on my own and then I found myself wounded  
Tripping over myself, falling and scraping my knee  
Sadness fills for I know I've failed  
  
Why did I leave scared to go back  
Hoping you'll take me in with open arms  
But also know the hurt I've caused  
The breeze of angel wings  
  
Standing there a midst of lowers of every being  
Tears grow and orchestra begins to play  
What a beautiful day, why are you alone  
Run child it's time for you to go home  
  
Wounded spirit face in the dirt  
I cry out for you to take me in  
Your heart holds me close, and  
I look up to face this world which so scares me  
  
Faith in you loneliness just seems to fade.  
The man once inside now a child walking in your footsteps  
Hoping held leaves under feet from the trees of fall  
Listening to autumn's call  
  
A deep breathe to continue on, fragile  
Depending on you Christ carry's me the rest of the walk
