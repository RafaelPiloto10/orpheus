Walks like a lady  
With her tender charms  
She moves like a lady  
When I'm in her arms  
She loves like a lady  
Lovin' all night long  
She cries like a baby  
When she's done something wrong  
  
I told you once, yes, I told you twice  
But you never listen to my advice  
I catch you walkin' with that boy again  
I'm gonna set you free  
Oh, I'm gonna set you free  
  
Loves like a lady  
So soft and slow  
She feels like a lady  
Ooo, I can't let go  
She smiles like a lady  
Smilin' all night long  
But cries lake a baby  
When she's done something wrong  
  
Walks like a lady  
Oh, but she cries like a little girl  
Walks like a lady  
Yes, but she cries like a little girl  
Walks like a lady  
Walks like a lady  
Cries like a little girl
