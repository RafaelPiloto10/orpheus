(feat. Keri Hilson)  
  
[Keri:]  
I Used To Move Around,  
I'm Feeling Kinda Stuck These Days (Because Of You)  
And I'd Be On The Highway,  
If Only I Could Leave My Place (Because Of You)  
I Used To Be A Talker  
But I Ain't Got Nothing Good To Say (Because Of You)  
And I Be Trying To Hide But it's Written All On My Face  
  
So I...  
I Really Thought You Were The One, The Only One  
I Guess That I Was Wrong  
Then You Turned Out You Wasn't It  
The Opposite  
Of Everything I Thought, So...  
  
What Do You Do After Love?  
(After Love)  
What Can You Say When It's Said And Done?  
(Nothing At All)  
'cause you Can't Hide A Heart Break  
(Yea I know)  
And You Can't Stop These Tears From Falling Down  
So What Do You Do? What Do You Do?  
(What Do You Do) After Love?  
(After Love)  
  
[Chorus:]  
After Love, (Ooh Ooh)  
After Love,(After Love It Hurts So Bad)  
After Love  
After Love,(Uh Huh)  
After Love  
  
[P-Diddy:]  
Yea Uh Uh  
I Remember That First Day  
That I Saw Her Face  
The Feeling I Had Sorta Felt Like My Birthday  
Beautiful I Must Say  
She Was My Earthquake  
Cute Face, Nice Shape,  
She Made My Earth Shake  
I'ma Try And Keep The Faith,  
Do It Like The Church Say  
She The One For Me And I Don't Care What Him Or Her Say  
Thought I Had A Home Run  
But I'm Just At First Base  
I Found Out In The Long Run  
Just Another Heart Break  
So How Much Can My Heart Take  
You Was Like Air To Me  
You Know I Wouldn't Leave  
I Needed You To Breathe  
See Life Is But A Dream  
So Is Love And I Believe  
If You Ever Been In Love  
You Would Know What I Mean  
Yea, So Lord Help Me Please  
I Wanna See The Light  
She Keep Telling Me I'm Wrong  
But I Know I'm Right  
I'm Tryin To Ignore  
'cause I Don't Wanna Fight  
I Know I Make Mistakes  
But Still I Need Her In My Life  
  
[Keri:]  
Tell Me How I'm Supposed To Heal This Open Wound (Because Of You)  
And Tell Me Who Woulda Thought That I'd Ever Be Trying To Get Over You  
I'm Stuck In The Moment, Of Memories Of Me And You...  
And I Can Get Over It, But I Ain't Sure If I Want To...  
  
'cause You Have Made Your Bed, Now you Gotta Lie In It  
(you Gotta Lie In It Babe)  
Now All The Things you Said Don't Mean A Thing  
(Don't Mean A Thing To Me No)  
  
I Can't Believe I Gave you One - Last - Shot  
I Let It Ride Now Baby It's - Your - Stop  
I Was Supposed To Leave - Now The Jokes On Me  
It Took A While To Finally Come To My Senses  
But What...?  
  
What Do You Do After Love? (Ooh Ooh)  
What Can You Say When It's Said And Done?  
(When It's Over, Oh)  
'cause you Can't Hide A Heart Break (Yea I Know)  
And You Can't Stop These Tears From Falling Down  
So What Do You Do? (Ooh Ooh)  
What Do You Do After Love?  
(After Love, Baby)  
After Love.  
  
[P-Diddy:]  
Yea I Know you Hear Me  
Listen To Me, Please  
But This Is What You Need To Do  
Pay Attention  
She Know Who I'm Talking To, And I Know you Listening  
I Think About You All The Time, If Not Every Minute  
I Promise, Hurting You Was Never My Intentions  
It's Something Bout Your Style, The Way That you Present It  
Every Fantasy I Ever Had You Was In It  
I Apologize, For Every Time That You Might Have Cried  
There's Not Enough Words To Describe How I Feel Inside  
Guardian Angel Sent From The Skies  
I Always Knew You Woulda Made A Beautiful Bride  
And That's Why  
I Wish You Coulda Stayed So Much  
But I fucked Up  
And Went And Betrayed Your Trust  
You Know, There's No More  
Dolce And Gabbana, Gucci, Prada, Trips To Nevada  
And I Admit What You Heard Is Probably True  
But Outta All These Girls The Only One I Love Is You  
I Love You  
  
[Keri:]  
I'm Broken But I'm Hoping Somebody Put Me Back Together (4x)  
  
What Do You Do After Love?  
What Can You Say When it's Said And Done  
When it's Over  
Cos you Can't Have A Heart Break  
And You can't Stop Your Tears From Falling Down  
So What Do You Do? What Do You Do?  
After Love.
