The bar is crowded and bright  
But inside I feel empty and decaying  
The smoky air full of music and words  
It's our record that is playing  
  
Disque Bleu is all that I hear  
Songs that we loved now make me cry  
Disque Bleu brings only a tear  
You were singing good  
  
But you were singing your good-byes  
To me tonight  
The night is warm and the pavement  
Below is a river of young lovers  
  
A radio drifting in makes me hide  
With my heart beneath the covers  
  
Disque Bleu is all that I hear  
Songs that we loved now make me cry  
Disque Bleu brings only a tear  
You were singing good  
  
But you were singing your good-byes  
To me tonight  
You gave no indication  
This was happening to us  
  
You showed no hesitation  
As you quickly waved  
From your seat on the bus  
That pulled away  
  
Disque Bleu is all that I hear  
Songs that we loved now make me cry  
Disque Bleu brings only a tear  
You were singing good  
  
But you were singing your good-byes  
To me tonight  
You gave no indication  
This was happening to us  
  
You showed no hesitation  
As you quickly waved  
From your seat on the bus  
That pulled away
