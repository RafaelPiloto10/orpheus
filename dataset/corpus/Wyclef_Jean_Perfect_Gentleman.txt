(This one's goin' out to the strip joints  
Yo, meet me at Suzy's Rendez-vous  
For every Go-Go Bar  
I'ma send this one out to the gentlemen's clubs  
Magic City, New York dogs, Rolex  
I be seeing y'all up in there late at night  
I understand when your girl is stressing you out  
(Crazy girls) Know what I'm saying?  
Don't let the ladies fool y'all now, fellas  
They be doin' the same thing y'all be doin'  
Turn up my symphony, man.  
Turn up my symphony!  
Drop a BEAT!)  
  
Just 'cuz she dances go-go  
It don't make her a ho, no  
Maxine, put your dance shoes on  
We going to the disco  
We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico  
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo  
  
Ten grand, let me see you shake it like you got no  
bones in your body and you was made to be a celebrity  
Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show  
me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy  
Thirty grand, to the highest bidder but Chris Rock  
said, 'There's no sex in the champaigne room'  
Forty grand, looked into her eyes, I saw tears falling  
down, type of tears that money couldn't buy  
  
Just 'cuz she dances go-go  
It don't make her a ho, no  
Maxine, put your dance shoes on

Excuse me, what is your name?  
  
Uh, my name is Hope, yo  
I was blessed with the body of the Goddesses  
Have you any idea how hard this is?  
I could flex in 25 positions  
But I only work here to pay my tuition  
Yo, tantalizing teaser  
Table-top pleaser  
Give me what I need a  
Mastercard a Visa  
Lap dance fantasy  
Picture us on and on white canopy  
Wyclef extended his hand to me  
Like Billy D. said he's feelin me  
Take me away from here, so far  
Where they ride horses, no cars  
No more stripping in bars  
Me and you 'Clef, against the odds  
  
Just 'cuz she dances go-go  
It don't make her a ho, no

(Yo a lot of y'all sitting with y'all girls  
fronting like the budweiser commercial  
Talking bout, 'IIIIIII, I don't be going to the strip joints'  
You lying man! You'd be surprised who you see up in there man.  
I got one question for you liars, man)  
  
Shot callers, Wasn't you a preacher?  
You calling her a hooker? He without sin cast the first stone.  
I met her on the subway, she gave me that VIP card  
And told me if I ever have problems,  
Don't hesitate to come by, yeah, yeah, yeah
