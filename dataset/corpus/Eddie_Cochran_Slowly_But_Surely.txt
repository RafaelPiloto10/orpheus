Slowly but surely, though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely I'm losin' you  
Soon you'll be leavin', soon I'll be grievin'  
Slowly but surely I'm losin' you  
I can see it in your eyes, I can feel it in your kiss  
But I didn't realise it would all end like this  
Slowly but surely, though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely. I'm losin' you  
  
Somebody's takin' my place, I can plainly see  
It's written on your face, you're not satisfied with me  
Slowly but surely, though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely, I'm losin' you
