I'm gone  
You can't get ahold of me  
So long  
It's coming over me  
I fly by  
And shatter the speed of sound  
Sky High  
And I never wanna come down  
Oh Yeah  
I'm a six gun  
I'm fully loaded  
There's a Love Bomb  
I'm about to explode it  
I'm a bonfire  
I'm burning through the night  
Bye Bye  
I'm an arrow in flight  
Oh Yeah  
I'm not gonna be a crucifix pin cushion  
I'm not gonna be a voodoo doll  
I fly with military precision  
This is my holy ground  
Oh Yeah
