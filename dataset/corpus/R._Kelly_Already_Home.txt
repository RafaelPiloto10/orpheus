[Chorus:]  
Every night up in the club  
Gettin' money with the thugs  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then there was you  
And I don't wan to be a player no more  
Every night up in the club  
Trickin' with a different girl  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then I met you  
Girl you changed my mind  
  
[Verse:]  
Walk up in the club, saw her in the club  
At first sight I fell in love  
I'm not supposed to be falling in love  
'Cuz I'm a hustla and a playa  
But she had the baddest body to me  
The prettiest eyes I ever did see  
Her smile had me gone as soon as she did it  
'Cuz shorty got a booty and man I've got to hit it  
Lil' mama doin' her thing and I love it  
On the floor makin' it swing and I love it  
Thick clothes she don't mind when I love ya  
And now I can hit it when I want it  
  
[Bridge:]  
She (she) might be my lover  
She makes me want no other  
She don't care 'bout going to the strip club  
'Cuz she want to go too  
And I've never met a girl like you  
That makes me want to settle down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every night up in the club  
Gettin' money with the thugs  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then there was you  
And I don't wan to be a player no more  
Every night up in the club  
Trickin' with a different girl  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then I met you  
Girl you changed my mind  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Imma spend my money on her  
Pop champagne in the club with her  
Hit the mall and take a shopping  
I don't know maybe some diamonds for her  
She deserves a real baller in her life, and I'm that man  
Who pick still me ladies, let me see your hands  
  
[Bridge:]  
She (she) might be my lover  
She makes me want no other  
She don't care 'bout going to the strip club  
'Cuz she want to go too  
And I've never met a girl like you  
That makes me want to settle down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every night up in the club  
Gettin' money with the thugs  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then there was you  
And I don't wan to be a player no more  
Every night up in the club  
Trickin' with a different girl  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then I met you  
Girl you changed my mind  
  
(Brakedown)  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
And none of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
Fuck with my baby  
Fuck with my baby  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
None of these chicks can fuck with my baby  
Fuck with my baby  
Fuck with my baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every night up in the club  
Gettin' money with the thugs  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then there was you  
And I don't wan to be a player no more  
Every night up in the club  
Trickin' with a different girl  
Thought I never fall in love  
Then I met you  
Girl you changed my mind
