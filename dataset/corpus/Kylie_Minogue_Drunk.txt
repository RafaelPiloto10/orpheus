I'm suffocated with desire  
I need to save me from myself  
I ache for great experience  
There's a riot in my senses  
  
Time and space and hurt and tears are not enough  
Love and light and faith and words are not enough  
  
I'm not happy drunk til I'm drunken  
Till you take all of me  
  
You put me to the test and I understand  
There's more and more and more to know  
Don't take me halfway  
I won't be contented that way  
  
Time and space and hurt and tears are not enough  
Love and light and faith and words are not enough  
  
Time flies like my love for you and  
Space grows like my envy for you  
Hurt comes like my pain for you and  
Tears pour like my lust for you  
Love lies like my hope for you and  
Light falls like my armour for you  
Faith stays like my care for you and  
Words wait like my crave for you  
  
I'm not happy drunk till I'm drunken  
Till you take all of me  
I'm not happy waste till I'm wasted  
Till you take all of me
