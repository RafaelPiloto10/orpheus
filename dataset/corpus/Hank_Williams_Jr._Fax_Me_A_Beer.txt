Well here we are smack in the middle of the 90's high tech age  
We got lasers, cds, microchips, and fat free fat these days  
Well that's all fine but I got a mind that's changing to fast for me  
'Cause what I thought was new last month this month is history  
I got a brand new vcr, it's got 29, 000 functions  
And I can't make the damn thing work so there goes Petticoat Junction  
That's when I got the best idea I think I had in years  
I think I'll be cool and invent the tool that'll fax me a beer  
  
Would you all please fax me a beer  
This invention is gonna set the whole world on it's ear  
Yeah, makin' old whiskey that was riskey but this is all in the clear  
Sit back, relax, and punch ol' fax and I'll fax you a beer  
  
Japan and Germany they got nothing on us you see  
Why this is the latest and good ol' American high technology  
And when this hits the marketplace Uncle Sam will rule the world  
Well hold on cause I'm working on a machine that'll faxa real live girl  
  
Would you all please fax me a beer  
This invention is gonna set the whole world on it's ear  
The old office code will never quite bet the same  
When it come cold and clear  
Sit back, relax, and punch ol' fax and I'll fax you a beer  
  
Would you like me to fax me a beer  
This invention is gonna set the whole world on it's ear  
The old office code will never be the same  
When it comes out cold and clear  
Sit back, relax, and punch ol' fax and I'll fax you a beer  
Sit back and drank and give thanks to Hank and I'll fax you a beer
