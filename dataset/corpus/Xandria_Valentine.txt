Be the valentine, rip the heart of mine  
Give your innocence to the brightest of dreams  
This is harvest time, taste the bloodred wine  
Of this gilded art, it is spilled from my own heart  
  
It?s so hard to see my face  
In the mirror?s cold disgrace  
I wonder what is this I have become  
A childish forlorn wish  
So easy to seduce  
Seems like it?s just one step to fall down  
  
Be the valentine?  
  
I can hardly write these lines  
Cause I already have signed  
My name across the wall of prayers  
  
Now I listen to my name  
Sounding like a blame  
I close my eyes and start to sing my song  
  
Be the valentine?  
  
If I?m looking back behind  
To long forgotten times  
There?s something that is burning on and on  
  
Oh, oh, oh, pactum fraudis!  
Oh, oh, oh, pactum fraudis!  
Oh, oh, oh, pactum fraudis!  
Oh, oh, oh, pactum fraudis!  
Sanguinans!  
  
I live in memories, cast into melodies  
They die in harmony with greed and treachery  
  
Be the valentine?  
  
How can I run from this hurting neverending pain?
