After you've gone and left me cryin'  
After you've gone there's no denyin'  
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad  
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had  
  
There'll come a time, now don't forget it  
There'll come a time when you'll regret it  
Someday, when you grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only  
After you've gone, after you've gone away  
  
After you've gone and left me cryin'  
After you've gone there's no denyin'  
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad  
You're gonna feel bad  
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,  
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had  
  
There'll come a time, now don't forget it  
There'll come a time when you'll regret it  
But baby, think what you're doin'  
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so  
It's gonna drive you to ruin  
After you've gone, after you've gone away.
