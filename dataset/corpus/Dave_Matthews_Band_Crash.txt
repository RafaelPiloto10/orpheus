You've got your ball  
You've got your chain  
Tied to me tight tie me up again  
Who's got their claws  
In you my friend  
Into your heart I'll beat again  
Sweet like candy to my soul  
Sweet you rock  
And sweet you roll  
Lost for you I'm so lost for you  
You come crash into me  
And I come into you  
I come into you  
In a boys dream  
In a boys dream  
  
Touch your lips just so I know  
In your eyes, love, it glows so  
I'm bare-boned and crazy for you  
When you come crash  
Into me, baby  
And I come into you  
In a boys dream  
In a boys dream  
If I've gone overboard  
Then I'm begging you  
To forgive me  
In my haste  
When I'm holding you so girl  
Close to me  
  
Oh and you come crash  
Into me, baby  
And I come into you  
Hike up your skirt a little more  
And show the world to me  
Hike up your skirt a little more  
And show your world to me  
In a boys dream, in a boys dream  
  
Oh I watch you there  
Through the window  
And I stare at you  
You wear nothing but you  
Wear it so well  
Tied up and twisted  
The way I'd like to be  
For you, for me, come crash  
Into me
