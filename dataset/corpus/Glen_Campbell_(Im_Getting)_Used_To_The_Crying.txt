I've gotten you-used to the cry-yin'  
But at least we're alone  
When I have to craw-awl  
But dar-arlin' when you say  
That I'll find lo-o-ove again  
I think I hate that most of a-all  
I've gotten you-used to the tear-eardrops  
And at least we're alo-one  
When they start to fall  
But dar-arlin', dar-arlin', when you say  
I'll find lo-o-ove again  
I think I hate that most of a-all  
I've gotten you-used to the cry-yin'  
And at least we're alone  
When I have to crawl  
But dar-arlin', dar-arlin, goodbye  
Takes so lo-ong to say  
And I think I hate that mo-ost of a-a-a-a-all
