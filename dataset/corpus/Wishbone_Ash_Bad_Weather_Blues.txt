Well, I been away,  
I said I been away for so long.  
Tell me, have you,  
Have you done me wrong?  
Can I tell by the look that's in your eyes,  
Have you kept your loving locked away inside?  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -  
Take away these bad weather blues?  
I done time, I got carried away,  
I done laid this high-class babe out in the hay,  
Spent half a year in the jailhouse all alone -  
This never would have happened if I'd stayed at home, oh no.  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -  
Take away these bad weather blues?  
Come on everybody, then, clap your hands in the air.  
Come on, a little bit louder, a little bit louder,  
Come on everybody. I'll teach you, come on,  
We want to hear you. louder, louder!  
We want you all to join in with us -  
When we say "yeah", when we say "yeah",  
We want you to say "yeah". you got it?  
Come on, are you ready? can't hear you!  
That's better, here we go.  
  
Say yeah, yeah  
Say yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Can you shake the dust, can you shake the dust,  
Can you make me shine?  
Can you shake the dust and make me shine  
Like they do in sheffield all the time?  
Been everywhere around the world,  
Seen every, every kind of girl, yeah.  
But it moves me the way that I think I know,  
And it weakens me, so make your loving flow.  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -  
Take away these bad weather blues?  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -  
Take away these bad weather blues.
