Phone Message from Ross Robinson  
"Hey dude it's Ross  
Just callin to say hey  
I'm much better now  
I fractured my spine  
It was fucked up  
I did a triple over a double  
And landed on my head  
So um...I did it on the 426  
Yep...wasn't to fun  
But before that dude I was fuckin totally in tune  
And feelin kick ass on the track  
It was like the best I've ever felt  
So maybe that's why I started gettin all cocky and shit  
Uhh...Alright man, just workin away super hardcore on Slipknot  
And I'm about 5 days left and take like a week off  
Or somethin like that and start the next one  
Hope your doin good dude  
Talk to ya later"
