Here we are, seven days  
And seven nights of empty tries  
It's ritual, habitual  
But it's never gonna work this time  
  
We're to the point of no return  
And along the way the only thing we've learned  
Is how to hurt each other  
  
I'm looking back and wondering why  
It took so long to realize  
That nothing's changed, it never will  
All these years of standing still  
And still we stay in all this pain  
And nothing's gonna make it go away  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
  
So save your voice  
Don't waste your breath  
Can't you see we're at the end  
And this goodbye is permanent  
So wish me well and try to forget  
  
And all the fights  
And all the ways  
We almost made it  
But we never did  
And it's finally come to this  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
  
We can not hide what we've become  
So sick and tired of being numb  
It's done, it's done  
It's done  
  
I don't wanna wait another minute  
Put me out of my misery  
I can read your mind baby you're not in it  
And we're not what we used to be  
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me  
If you would only let me go  
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
I know, I know, I know  
Something that I already know  
'Cause I know, I know, I know  
'Cause I know, 'cause I know
