In the early rush of morning  
Trying to get the kids to school  
One's hanging on my shirttail  
Another's locked up  
In her room  
And I'm yelling up the stairs  
Stop worrying 'bout your hair  
You look fine  
  
Then they're fightin' in the backseat  
I'm playing referee  
Now someone's gotta go  
The moment that we leave  
And everybody's late  
I swear that I can't wait  
'Till they grow up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Then they do  
And that's how it is  
It's just quiet in the morning  
Can't believe  
How much you miss  
All they do  
And all they did  
You want all the dreams  
They dreamed of  
To come true  
Then they do  
  
Now the youngest is starting college  
She'll be leavin' in the Fall  
And Brianna's latest boyfriend  
Called to ask if we could talk  
And I got the impression  
That he's about to pop the question any day  
  
I look over at their pictures  
Sittin' in their frames  
I see them as babies  
I guess that'll never change  
You pray all their lives  
That someday they will find happiness  
  
[Chorus:]  
Then they do  
And that's how it is  
It's just quiet in the morning  
Can't believe  
How much you miss  
All they do  
And all they did  
You want all the dreams  
They dreamed of  
To come true  
Then they do  
  
No more Monday pta's  
No carpools  
Or soccer games  
Your work is done  
Now you've got time  
That's all your own  
You've been waitin' for so long  
For those days to come  
  
[Chorus:]  
Then they do  
And that's how it is  
It's just quiet in the morning  
Can't believe  
How much you miss  
All they do  
And all they did  
You want all the dreams  
They dreamed of  
To come true  
Then they do
