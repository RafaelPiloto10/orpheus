Valleri. I love my Valleri.  
There's a girl I know who makes me feel so good.  
And I wouldn't live without her, even if I could.  
They call her Valleri.  
I love my Valleri.  
  
She's the same little girl who used to hang around my door.  
But she sure looks different than the way she looked before.  
I call her Valleri.  
I love my Valleri.  
  
Valleri. I love my Valleri.  
I love my Valleri.  
I need ya, Valleri.
