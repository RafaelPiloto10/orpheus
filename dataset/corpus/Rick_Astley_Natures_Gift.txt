Everybody needs a woman in their life  
A mother or a sister, a man may need a wife  
If you have a woman in your life  
Don't take her for granted you'll regret it by and by  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't use her or abuse her, or you'll lose her  
She filled with emotion, strong as the sea  
Deep as an ocean, and she'll always be  
So high on her feelings, high on my list  
She's everything, she is nature's gift  
  
Give her the attention that she's worthy of  
Show her some respect  
And don't take advantage of the fact that she loves you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mother nature gave us  
Mother nature gave us this creation  
Mother nature gave us  
Mother nature gave us this creation  
Someone you can count on,  
She'll always be there whenever you need her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Weary from giving so much of herself  
Never complaining, always seems  
So high on her feeling, so high on my list  
She's everything she is nature's gift
