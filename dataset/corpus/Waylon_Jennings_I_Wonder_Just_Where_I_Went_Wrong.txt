Your love, I'm no longer sure of  
Seems there's times you'd rather be alone  
And if I'm losing you tell me what did I do  
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong  
Even though I still feel the same  
I can't help but feel I'm to blame  
Have I done all that I can do to show my love for you  
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong  
Even though I still feel the same  
I can't help but feel I'm to blame  
Have I done all that I can do to show my love for you  
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong  
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong
