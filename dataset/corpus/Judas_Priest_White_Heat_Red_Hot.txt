The father's son, thy kingdom come, electric ecstasy,  
Deliver us from all the fuss and give us sanctuary.  
Lead us all into arena, magnificent in death.  
Well let us serenade the sinner, we'll follow in his step.  
  
White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot.  
The fury songs, venomous wrongs so rich in tragedy,  
An overture forever more to senseless victories.  
Give to us this day of glory the power and the kill  
So we avoid the wrath and all the almighty fire of  
  
White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot.  
The heat's hot burns a lot.  
Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall.  
The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men.  
  
Prepare to fight, unsheathe your scythe a ghastly beam of ill  
To slice the life with blinding light and seventh dimensional skill.  
The centuries of dedication inherited till at last  
From years of solar gladiation can only end in  
  
White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot.  
The heat's hot burns a lot.  
Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall.  
The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men.  
  
White heat  
Red hot  
White heat  
Red hot
