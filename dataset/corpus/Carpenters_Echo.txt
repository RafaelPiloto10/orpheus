Echo  
By Tom Petty  
  
Put down your things and rest awhile  
You know we've both nowhere to go  
Yeah, daddy had to crash  
He was always halfway there you know  
And no, I don't pretend there's any more of that  
They say one day, you'll look up and laugh and hear  
  
The same sad echo when you walk  
Yeah, the same sad echo when you talk loud and clear  
It's the same as the same sad echo around here  
  
I promise you this winter  
I will worship you like gold  
And ride your train forever  
Electric fortunes to be told  
And I don't want to question or even celebrate  
All the joy you took and then gave back too late  
  
It's the same sad echo when you lie  
It's the same sad echo when you try to be clear  
It's the same as the same sad echo around here  
  
Well, I woke up right here  
In a pool of sweat  
With a box of pills and you  
Yeah, and I'm gonna keep my head  
I'm gonna keep my cool  
Oh, I'm so in love with you  
Yes and in another world nothing was like this  
There may have been a girl  
There never was a kiss  
  
The poison came in liquid  
She was naked all the time  
And no one could explain it  
It was all between the lines  
And I don't seem to trust anyone no more  
It could be faith I'm just not sure  
  
It's the same sad echo every day  
Yeah the same sad echo another way  
When you call  
It's the same as the same sad echo most of all  
  
Well you just got tired  
You just gave in  
You took it hard  
Then you just quit  
You let me down  
You dropped the ball  
You fell on your face most of all  
And I don't want to mean anything to you  
I don't want to tempt you to be true  
  
It's the same sad echo comin' down  
It's the same sad echo all around in my ears  
It's the same as the same sad echo around here
