They're really rockin' Boston  
In Pittsburgh, P. A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
All over St. Louis  
And down in New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
  
Sweet little sixteen  
She's just got to have  
About half a million  
Framed autographs  
Her wallet filled with pictures  
She gets 'em one by one  
Become so excited  
Watch her, look at her run  
  
Oh mommy mommy  
Please may I go  
It's such a sight to see  
Somebody steal the show  
Oh daddy daddy  
I beg of you  
Whisper to mommy  
It's all right with you  
  
'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand  
In Philadelphia P.A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
All over St. Louis  
Way down in New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
  
'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand  
Philadelphia P.A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
All over St. Louis  
Way down in New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
  
Sweet little sixteen  
She's got the grown up blues  
Tight dresses and lipstick  
She's sportin' high heel shoes  
Oh, but tomorrow morning  
She'll have to change her trend  
And be sweet sixteen  
And back in class again  
  
Well they'll be rockin' Boston  
Pittsburgh, P. A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas  
And 'round the Frisco Bay  
Way out in St. Louis  
Way down to New Orleans  
All the cats want to dance with  
Sweet little sixteen
