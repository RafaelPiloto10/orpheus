It's a beautiful day today, everything is going my way  
Even the words do what I say, oh babe, got to get away  
To be impossible, isn't that difficult  
In the city you're invisible, when you come from a small town  
Everything is all right, everything is all right  
I'm not your baby, please  
A tourist in a traffic jam, baby sham and handy cam  
I'm not your mother, you're not my man, I'm not your baby  
Don't treat me like I'm a trick, I won't treat you like you're a prick  
Don't need no doctor, I'm not ill, I'm not your baby  
Everything is all right, everything is all right  
I'm not your baby, please  
Cut out the poetry, lets hit the main artery  
No time for a tourniquet, the colors all run out of me  
You brought me all kinds of goods, now my heart is so full up it hurts  
It's heavy as a shopping bag, it's full of things I should give back  
Everything is all right, everything is all right  
I'm not your baby, please  
I'm not your baby  
I'm not your baby  
Don't want you to cover me, smother me or mother me  
I like to feel this incomplete, I'm not your baby  
Everything is all right, everything is all right  
I'm not your baby, please  
Not dizzy, just busy, didn't drink nothing fizzy  
No pills to feel easy, don't know what got into me  
Daylight's a kind of robbery, the night is your geography  
So you're not white, you're pink and rosy  
You could be right, but you're way above me  
Me, I'm in recovery, a star of pornography  
I'm a tourist, there's a lot to see  
You don't like the photographs of me  
So you've got a lot to say  
You don't sleep around, but sometimes you stray  
You don't believe, often times you pray  
For something, what is it babe  
Don't treat me like I'm a trick, I won't treat you like you're a prick  
Don't need no doctor, I'm not sick, I'm not your baby  
Everything is all right, everything is all right  
I'm not your baby, please  
I'm not your baby, I'm not your baby, I'm not your baby  
I'm not your baby, I'm not your baby, I'm not your baby  
I'm not your baby
