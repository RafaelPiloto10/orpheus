I see the world  
Feel the chill  
Which way to go  
Windowsill  
I see the words  
  
On a rocking horse of time  
I see the birds in the rain  
Oh dear dad  
Can you see me now  
I am myself  
  
Like you somehow  
I'll ride the wave  
Where it takes me  
I'll hold the pain  
Release me  
  
Oh dear dad  
Can you see me now  
I am myself  
Like you somehow  
  
I'll wait up in the dark  
For you to speak to me  
I'll open up  
Release me  
Release me  
Release me  
Release me
