Did you ever see two Yankees  
part upon a foreign shore  
When the good ship's just about to  
start for Old New York once more  
  
With tear dimmed eye they say goodbye  
they're friends without a doubt  
When the man on the pier  
Shouts "Let them clear", as the ship strikes out  
  
Give my regards to Broadway  
Remember me to Herald Square  
Tell all the gang at Forty Second street  
that I will soon be there  
  
Whisper of how I'm yearning  
To mingle with the old time throng  
Give my regards to old Broadway  
and say that I'll be there ever long  
  
Give my regards to Broadway  
Remember me to Herald Square  
Tell all the gang at Forty Second street  
that I will soon be there  
  
Whisper of how I'm yearning  
To mingle with the old time throng  
Give my regards to old Broadway  
and say that I'll be there ever long  
  
Say hello to dear old Coney Isle  
If there you chance to be  
When you're at the Waldorf  
have a smile and charge it up to me  
  
Mention my name every place you go  
as 'round the town you roam  
Wish you'd call on my gal  
Now remember, old pal when you get back home  
  
Give my regards to Broadway  
Remember me to Herald Square  
Tell all the gang at Forty Second street  
that I will soon be there  
  
Whisper of how I'm yearning  
To mingle with the old time throng  
Give my regards to old Broadway  
and say that I'll be there ever long  
  
Give my regards to Broadway  
Remember me to Herald Square  
Tell all the gang at Forty Second street  
that I will soon be there  
  
Whisper of how I'm yearning  
To mingle with the old time throng  
Give my regards to old Broadway  
and say that I'll be there ever long
