He sits alone in a crowded station  
And lights his cigarette  
The light flickers slightly  
And tells him politely  
His life's not at it's best  
  
She weighs him up 'cause his love's taken lightly  
And love's her only regret  
But love's not a sin in her eyes  
And she's asking him why -  
"Why are you leaving"  
"I just can't say"  
"Why are you leaving"  
"He don't know daddy's gonna stay"  
  
Put a little light in her darkest day  
So she can see it  
Put a little love in her heart on the way  
So she can feel it  
  
He walks home with his pride in his pocket  
And pulls it out with his change  
And his love is something and it just turned into nothing  
Now isn't that strange  
  
She holds her head high close to the bright sky  
He's got his head in the clouds  
But love's not a sin in her eyes  
And he's telling her why -  
"Why are you leaving"  
"I just can't say"  
"Why are you leaving"  
"He don't know daddy's gonna stay"  
  
Put a little light in her darkest day  
So she can see it  
Put a little love in her heart on the way  
So she can feel it
