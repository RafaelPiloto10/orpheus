Oh my darling I sure loved that meal  
Though I could still taste the pig squeal  
Now I'm weak and losing focus  
I think you gave me trichinosis  
Trichinosis is little worms that dig  
And burrow through your body after you eat raw pig  
I love you hon but can't help but notice  
That you gave me trichinosis  
By candlelight I ate that pork  
I couldn't see danger on my fork  
Oh if you do love me completely  
Never again feed me food that will eat me  
Now I feel kinda strange inside like I'm in an apartment  
With tenants I just can't seem to evict  
Theyre having a party and I'm the buffet  
I love you darling but Id be lying  
If I didn't tell you this was eating me up inside
