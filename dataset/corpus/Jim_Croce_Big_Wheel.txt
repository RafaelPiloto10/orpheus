[Chorus]  
Big wheel, don't you roll  
Big diesel, don't you whine  
Through the night as I'm runnin' down the road  
Big semi, don't you stop, 'cause if you do I'm not  
Gonna make it back to Baltimore with my load  
  
Well, the truckstop's warm and friendly  
And the coffee keeps me up  
And the waitress there would like to waste my time  
But I'll have to pass it by  
As it's down the road I fly  
Just a racin' with that pocket watch of mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Smoke a-puffin', tires a hummin'  
Burnin' up the road  
Countin' road signs and the miles to Baltimore  
One eye out for weighin' stations  
One for radar traps  
They can't stop me, 'cause my plans don't call for that
