Wait till the twilight is gone and the  
Heaven's lights are on.  
  
Well I have seen the flames  
While lords of terror reigned  
Armor clashing splits the night  
While the angels soared,  
Packs of demons roared  
Flashing metal, I jumped in the fray  
  
Feel the bite, hear the scream  
We fear no evil  
Helped by hands unseen  
With a voice, like the wind  
Seven trumpets sound the chords of dreams, now  
  
In mountain caverns deep, the molten flames would leap.  
The virgin metal was thrust in the forge  
Its power works for those  
Whose dreams of peace still hold  
The skies rejoice the coming day.  
  
Gonna shout, gonna scream  
The stacks of glory, sweetly sing their praise  
Gonna shout, gonna scream, shake the world  
And let them know we're here.
