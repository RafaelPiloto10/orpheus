She knows I'd do anything she wants me to,  
The love she finds is deeper than the ocean.  
She knows I'd do anything she wants me to,  
A river of dew,  
  
Warmer than the dawning.  
Surrender  
Tie the cover to the ground.  
Surrender  
  
Tie the cover to the ground.  
But don't turn around and walk away again.  
Don't turn around and walk away again.  
He knows I'd say anything he wants to hear,  
  
Loud and clear calls the voice of lovers.  
He knows I'd do anything he wants me to,  
Like ruby rain,  
I wash away the pain.  
Surrender...
