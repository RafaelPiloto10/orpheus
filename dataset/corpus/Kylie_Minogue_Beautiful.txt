You, you are so beautiful  
  
It used to be, you and me  
Love like no other  
Our world around, could fall apart  
But we had each other  
Saw you walking, you were smiling  
And it hit me like the first time  
Feels like yesterday, has come and gone  
But nothing's changed, when I look at you  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful  
You're my eyes  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
Still hurts sometimes  
Love on the line  
But we said forever, yeah  
Sailing on, through the storms  
But we had together  
And now I  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful  
And now I  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful
