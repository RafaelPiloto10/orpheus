No one can decide  
When lightning will strike  
And everything falls into place  
But lately it seems  
When you're in my dreams  
I find that I don't want to wake  
  
I want to slowly  
Unlock the mystery  
I want to make love  
I want to make history  
  
[Chorus:]  
With you  
I see a lifetime with you  
And if one thing is true  
It's that God knew someday I'd be standing  
On the edge of forever with you  
  
I'm ready to fall  
To give you my all  
Cause you're everything I'll ever want  
It's amazing to me  
How far we can see  
Our horizon goes on and on  
  
I want to slowly  
Unlock the mystery  
I want to make love  
I want to make history  
  
[Chorus:]  
And when I'm shivering  
Your body will be my blanket  
And then I'm drifting, baby  
You'll be my anchor  
  
[Chorus:]
