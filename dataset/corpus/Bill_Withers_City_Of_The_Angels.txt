City of the angels spread your wings for me  
I've been other places looking for my dream  
Eastern cities move to fast  
Southern ones to slow  
I can't go back to my past  
And I need someplace to grow  
  
City of the Angels  
Clear your cloudy skies for me  
I heard you got some places that I ought to see  
Heard you got a Disneyland not to far away  
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day  
  
LA, LA, find a place for me  
Give me all your spaces please  
It's where I want to be  
  
City of the Angels spread your wings for me  
I heard you got some places an old man like me should see  
Heard 'bout your Disneyland not to far away from town  
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day  
  
LA, LA, find a place for me  
Give me all your spaces please  
It's where I want to be  
  
I heard you got a Disneyland not to far away  
And when it rains I understand the skies are clear all day  
  
LA, LA, find a place for me  
Give me all your spaces please  
It's where I want to be
