Climbing to the top  
I'll tell you anything you want  
We're on this planetary journey to a place beyond  
The independent minds will tell you  
The colors you should wear  
But know the game of life  
Is just a game of solitaire  
  
Climbing to the top  
The ones you love will come and go  
When you lose you sacrifice  
Chasing the rainbow  
And if you should climb this magic ladder  
The story will unfold  
Just remember when you reach the top  
All that glitters is not gold  
  
Time, just take the time  
What you think is what you find  
You know the answers  
You're no ordinary dancer  
Face the changes you go through  
Have the faith in what you do  
You know the answers  
You're no ordinary dancer  
  
Climbing to the top  
I'll tell you anything you want  
Were on this planetary journey  
To a place beyond  
You can climb the highest mountain  
Swim the deepest seas  
The only thing that matters  
Is you will find your destiny  
  
You know the answers  
You're no ordinary dancer  
  
Climbing to the top  
I'll tell you anything you want  
You're on an imaginary journey  
To a place beyond  
You can climb the highest mountain  
Swim the deepest seas  
The only thing that matters  
Is you will find your destiny
