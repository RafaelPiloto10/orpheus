So many years I've been waiting alone  
So many days in blue  
Thinking that life maybe passed me by  
Then suddenly I found you  
And now all of my life seems to change overnight  
And I don't know what to do  
You say you want to be mine  
That it's love this time  
I want to believe it's true  
I want to believe it's you  
  
It's never easy for me in love  
I never can find what I need  
I need a lover that's lost but hasn't lost touch  
Someone who's lost like me  
And then I come on too strong and I play it all wrong  
I don't know why I do  
But something tells me tonight  
That this might be right  
I want to believe it's true  
I want to believe it's you  
  
Oh...I want to believe it's true  
Oh...I want to believe it's you  
I keep having this dream that I go through  
A man holds me close but I never see who  
Babe, can't you see that  
I want to believe it's you  
  
It's easy to hide your heart away  
It's easy to never choose  
I've loved and I've lost and I've lost my way  
And now I'm afraid to lose  
But when you say that it's right  
That it's here tonight  
I'm ready to see it, too  
Like a prisoner's release  
Like a promise of peace  
I want to believe it's true  
I want to believe it's you
