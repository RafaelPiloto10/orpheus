Now I know that I'll forget you cause I forgot you a while ago  
And when I thought of you just now only one tear drip down slow  
My mind is hard and twisted so and it hardly ever sleeks  
But the only time I've hurt is when my heart beats  
Since I'm finally gettin' over you I think I'll celebrate  
Think of breakin' all your pictures and I might throw one away  
And I won't feel this awful pain in about ten million weeks  
Cause the only time I hurt is when my heart beats  
The only time I hurt is when my heart beats  
I live in constant mis'ry cause the hurtin' just repeats  
I think about you now and then and everytime your mem'ry speaks  
But the only time I hurt is when my heart beats  
[ steel ]  
The only time I hurt...
