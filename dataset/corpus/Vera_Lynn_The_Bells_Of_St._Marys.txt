The bells of St. Mary's  
Ah! hear they are calling  
The young loves, the true loves  
Who come from the sea  
  
And so, my beloved  
When red leaves are falling  
The love bells shall ring out  
Ring out for you and me  
  
The bells of St. Mary's  
At sweet even time  
Shall call me, beloved  
To come to your side  
  
And out in the valley  
In sound of the sea  
I know you'll be waiting  
Yes, waiting for me  
  
At the porch of St. Mary's  
I'll wait there for you  
In your soft wedding dress  
With its ribbons of blue  
  
In the church of St. Mary's  
Sweet voices shall sing  
For you and me, dearest  
The wedding bells ring
