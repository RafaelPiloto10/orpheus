I think I just fell in love with a porn star  
Turn the camera on, she a born star  
Turn the corners in a foreign car  
Call the coroners do the C.P.R.  
She gave that old nigger an ulcer  
Bitter sweet taste made his gold tooth ache (uh)  
Make a knee shake, make a priest faint (uh)  
Make a nun cum, make her cremate (uh)  
Move down town cop a sweet space (uh)  
Livin' life like we on a sweep stakes (what)  
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes (huh)  
Well I'ma levitate, make the devil wait (yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you lost your mind  
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line  
No more drugs for me  
Pussy and religion is all I need  
Grab my hand and  
Baby we'll live a hell of a life  
  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
In your wildest  
You can hear the loudest screams  
Comin' from inside the screen  
You a wild bitch  
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy  
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy  
Or do anal, or do a gang bang  
It's kinda crazy, it's opposite the same thing  
Well I guess a lot of niggers do gang bang  
And if you run trains, we all in the same game  
Run away slaves all on a chain gang  
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star  
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard  
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids  
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the brides maid s  
She wanna roll play, 'till I roll over  
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja  
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day  
Especially if she can't get that dress form Oscar Day  
Laurenta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the change  
That's a dress of her back and told her get away  
How can they say they live they life wrong  
When you never fuck wit' the lights on  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
  
Have you lost your mind  
Tell me what you think, we've crossed the line  
No more drugs for me  
Pussy and religion is all I need  
Grand my hand  
Baby we'll live a hell of a life  
  
I think I fell in love with a porn star  
And got married in the bathroom  
Honeymoon on the dance floor  
And got divorced by the end of the night  
That's one hell of a life
