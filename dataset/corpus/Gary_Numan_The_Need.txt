Get the need  
Get it.  
I'm in the movies.  
  
Hello young thing  
I'm an old film star  
Maybe you've seen my picture.  
  
I need it  
Like an old newsreel  
I'm just fading away.  
  
Bang bang dear  
I've got the needles  
And I've got the need  
If you'd be so kind.  
  
Come on and feel the need in me  
Come on and feel the need.  
Feel it!  
  
Hello young thing  
I've got reverse instructions  
In the back of my car.  
  
I need it  
Don't cry till this thing is over  
And my friends applaud.  
  
Bang bang dear  
When can we do this again  
And put it all on film  
  
Hello young love  
I've got something to show you  
And please don't be ashamed.  
  
I'm the man  
I'm the atrocity film star  
And I've got the need.
