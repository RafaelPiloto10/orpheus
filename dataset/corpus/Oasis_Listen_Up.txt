Listen up  
What's the time said today  
I'm gonna speak my mind  
Take me up to the top of the world  
I want to see my crime  
  
Day by day  
There's a man in a suit  
Who's gonna make you pay  
For the thoughts that you think  
And the words they won't let you say  
  
One fine day  
Gonna leave you all behind  
It wouldn't be so bad  
If I had more time  
  
Sailing down a river alone  
I've been tryin' to find my way back home  
But I don't believe in magic  
Life is automatic  
But I don't mind being on my own  
No I don't mind being on my own
