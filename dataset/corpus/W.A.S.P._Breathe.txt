You don't have to hear my heart beat  
All you need is to look into my eyes  
And tell me I'm the one you heart needs  
I'm the only one you run to in the night  
  
Oh let me burn the words forever mine  
Across your heart, across your mind  
Take your hands and feel my heart beat  
come and let me feel it in your eyes  
  
All you have to do is touch me  
Oh and lay your flame across my fire  
Oh let me spread your wings and come inside  
And take your heart and make you mind  
  
Come and lay down your heart on me  
All that I want to feel is  
Breathe in me  
Lay down your heart on me  
  
Feel you inside of me  
Breathe on me  
Come and take me on, take me down  
Oh take me all the way  
  
There's only one way  
Only one thing I need, all I need  
Take me way down  
Come and lay down on me
