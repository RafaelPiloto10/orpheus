This time you're really dead  
Once followed, but always led  
You thought you'd rise above it all  
  
It's all inside your head  
All ripping it up in shreds  
I know someday you're gonna fall  
  
And I don't wanna say I told you so  
But I told you so  
Now you've lost control  
  
And I don't wanna be the rise and fall  
So gimme more or nothing at all  
  
You're in an awful way  
Sucked in by what you crave  
They just can't wait to see you crawl  
  
And you can only laugh  
Give in to the other half  
They're only tearing down your walls  
  
They've come to see you rise and fall  
They're only tearing down your walls  
They've come to see you rise and fall  
And I don't wanna say you've lost control  
  
Rise and fall is  
Good and evil,  
Appearance and reality,  
Judgment and reflection.  
It is to judge and to be judged,  
To dream and to accept.  
It is Triumph and despair,  
Wish and realization,  
  
And we are both.
