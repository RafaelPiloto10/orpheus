Promise me you'll remember  
This love together today  
We may not have tomorrow  
It's not for us to say  
Fate isn't kind to lovers  
It breaks the hardest hearts  
Promise you'll remember  
How good we are  
  
Why do I find the sadness  
Under your sweetest kiss  
Destiny seems to whisper  
It won't stay like this  
  
Whenever we're together  
I feel time standing still  
I only know I love you  
And I always will  
If we should lose each other  
Somewhere inside the dark  
Promise me you'll remember  
How good we are  
  
Whenever we're together  
I feel time standing still  
I only know I love you  
And I always will  
If we should lose each other  
Somewhere inside the dark  
Promise me you'll remember  
How good we are  
  
Time isn't kind to lovers  
It breaks the hardest hearts  
Promise me you'll remember  
How good we are
