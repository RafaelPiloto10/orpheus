It's Alright (Baby's Coming Back)  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's alright, baby's coming back  
And I don't really care where he's been.  
It's alright, baby's coming back  
And I won't turn him around this time.  
  
I'll be your cliff (you can fall down from me).  
I'll be your ledge (you can lean upon me).  
I'll be your bridge, your flowering tree  
You can still depend on me  
  
And I'll be (the ticking of your clock).  
And I'll be (the numbers on your watch).  
And I'll be (your hands to stop the time).  
I'll even be your danger sign.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'll be (your grace your dignity).  
And I'll be (your night your destiny).  
And I'll be (your comfort and your ease).  
I will be your storm at seas  
  
And I'll be (your sharp intake of breath).  
And I'll be (your work I'll take no rest).  
And when the world falls to decline  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Make it easy on yourself tonight).
