Back when Cain was able  
Way before the stable  
Lightning shot right out from the sky  
A mothership with fate said  
Let's give it a try  
  
Conscience was related  
Man, he was created  
Lady luck took him by surprise  
Her sweet and bitter fruit  
It surely opened his eyes  
  
Well, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
Well, she ate it  
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right  
  
Even Eve in eden  
Voices tried deceivin'  
With lies to show the lady the way  
At first she stopped and turned  
And tried to walk away  
  
Man, he was believer  
Lady was deceiver  
So the story goes, but you see  
The snake was he and she just climbed right up his tree  
  
So, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
She ate it  
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right  
  
Science was related  
Man, he was created  
When lady luck took him by surprise  
Her sweet and bitter fruits  
Surely opened his eyes  
  
Evil came like rain  
And who knows who's to blame  
And something tried to lay her to waste  
And all she want to need was just a little taste  
  
So, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
Yeah, she ate it  
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right  
Well, she ate it  
Lordy, it was love at first bite  
Yeah, she ate it  
Never knowing wrong from right, right,  
Well that's right
