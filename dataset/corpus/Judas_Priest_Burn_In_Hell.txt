Speak to me  
Of those days I won't forget  
Your worst dreams  
Has just returned, to pay you back  
I'm still laughing  
There's not much else I can do  
But one's thing's certain  
I'm coming back for you  
  
Have you got a gun  
Do you remember well  
Who you used it on  
It's time to burn in Hell  
  
Say my name  
I can hear you whisper  
Not to blame?  
You are going to blister  
Scream in the night  
I've been counting the days  
It's so amusing  
To see you again  
  
Have you got a gun  
Do you remember well  
Who d'ya use it on  
You're going to burn in Hell  
  
Die  
Why?  
Time to pay the price  
Kill  
I will  
Have my sacrifice  
  
Plead  
With fear  
I am getting near  
Friend  
Liar  
Time to eat some fire  
  
Have you got a gun  
Do you remember well  
Who d'ya use it on  
You're going to burn in Hell  
  
Burn in Hell  
I can hear you whisper  
Burn in Hell  
You are going to blister  
  
Have you got a gun  
Do you remember well  
Who d'ya use it on  
You're going to burn in Hell  
  
Burn in Hell  
I can hear you whisper  
Burn in Hell  
You are going to blister  
  
Snarl like a dog  
You'll scream like a banshee  
Stuck like a hog  
You're gonna love me  
  
Burn in Hell  
I can hear you whisper  
Burn in Hell  
You are going to blister  
Burn in Hell  
Screaming like a banshee  
Burn in Hell  
Burn
