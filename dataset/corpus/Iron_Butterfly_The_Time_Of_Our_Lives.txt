Listen to the clock beat as it ticks out time away,  
And listen to the birds' laughter as they live for today,  
And listen to the heart beat as it beats our lives away.  
  
These are the things that we hear in our world,  
And these are the things that we hear in the time of our lives,  
In the time of our lives.  
  
And to us they are real,  
And for us they're ideal.  
  
How you doing people that passed on yesterday?  
Did you meet with justice on your judgement day?  
  
These are the things that we hear in our world,  
And these are the things that we hear in the time of our lives,  
In the time of our lives.  
  
And to us they are real,  
And for us they're ideal.  
  
Yes, to us,  
Without a doubt they're real.  
  
Without a doubt they're real.  
  
Without a doubt they're real!
