Night is falling  
We're doing the things we do  
You are acting just like me  
I'm acting just like you  
Do you remember  
When you were my friend?  
That's the way I'd like things  
Just like way back then  
  
Baby's sleeping  
Brother is on the run  
I am out undoing  
All the good I've done  
If you loved me  
Tell you what I would do  
Wrap the world in silver foil  
Bring it home to you  
  
Lately, I feel  
That I can't pretend  
I may never, ever see  
The likes of you again  
I take a walk, I come back home  
Then I sit a spell  
Watch the ponies dance around  
The empty wishing well  
  
Night has fallen  
I've said the things I did  
The only baby sleeping  
Is when I was a kid  
Do you remember  
When you were my friend?  
That's the way I'd like things  
Just like way back then
