[Chorus]  
Ain't no big deal to say I love you still  
Call out my name  
I'll be here  
Ain't no big deal to say my love is real  
When you reach out I'll be there  
  
[Bridge]  
Please don't be afraid to look me in the eye  
Sad time is gone I got no tears to cry  
Don't say you don't know I'm right  
When I say we'll get by  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Intermediate]  
Nobody makes me feel the way that you do  
Night time's such a thrill when I spend it with you  
Ask me what is on my mind  
So I can tell you true  
  
[Ain't no big deal  
My love is for real]  
I love you still  
[Ain't no big deal  
My love is for real]  
Ain't no big deal  
I love you still  
[Ain't no big deal  
My love is for real]  
Baby I love you still  
[Ain't no big deal  
My love is for real]  
Ain't no big deal  
Uh uh uh uh uh  
Ain't no big thing  
Uh uh uh uh  
I said (first time only)  
Ain't no big deal  
Uh uh uh uh uh  
Ain't no big thing  
Uh uh uh uh  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Intermediate]  
  
[Reach out  
Reach out]  
I'll be there  
Yeah  
Oh yeah  
[Reach out  
Reach out]  
I'll be there  
Yeah  
I'll be right by your side  
[Reach out  
Reach out]  
I'll be there

I'll be there  
Yeah
