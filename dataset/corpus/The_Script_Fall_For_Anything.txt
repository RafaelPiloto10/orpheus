Don't that bring you down, down, down [Repeat: x4]  
  
Don't give yourself away  
Don't live your life that way  
Of course he's gonna say  
Anything you want  
He'll leave quicker than he came  
Now you've got yourself to blame  
Don't put yourself back in the fire again  
  
It's the same damn thing, you're so quick to believe  
And do it over and over again  
And its the same mistakes that I'm watching you make  
And do it over and over again  
  
So before they bring you down  
(you gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything)  
'Til you fall for anything, 'til you fall for,  
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything  
('Til you fall for anything, 'til you fall for)  
  
Don't that bring you down, down, down (x4)  
  
Oh  
Please don't be so naive  
Don't wait 'til your heart bleeds  
Love wasn't built for speed  
Listen to me girl  
He keeps fucking with your head, tryin' to get you into bed  
And in the morning you'll just hate yourself  
  
It's the same damn thing, you're so quick to believe  
And do it over nd over again  
And it's the same mistakes that I'm watching you make  
And do it over and over and over again  
  
Before they bring you down,  
(you gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything)  
'Til you fall for anything, 'til you fall for  
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything  
('Til you for anything, 'til you fall for)  
  
Don't that bring you down, down, down [Repeat x4]  
  
[Repeat x3]  
Can you give until there's nothing to give until  
There's nothing to give until there's nothing to give  
  
Before they bring you down,  
(you gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything)  
'Til you fall for anything, 'til you fall for.  
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything  
('Til you fall for anything, 'til you fall for)  
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything  
('Til you fall for anything, 'til you fall for)  
You gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything  
('Til you fall for anything)  
  
Before they bring you down, down down  
Don't that bring you down, down, down [Repeat x4]
