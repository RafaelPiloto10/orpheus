I stand in awe  
That You know my name  
Just a glimpse of Your love for me  
And now I am changed  
Because You showed me how  
To walk a different way  
I have peace like I've never known  
I am living  
You move me  
Lord, You move me  
There's a fire burning in my soul  
And it's flowing through me  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me  
Now I must tell the world what I know  
You move me  
For too many years  
I have been color blind  
Only saw in shades of gray  
Stuck in black and white  
But by grace You opened my eyes  
Now I see the light  
And Your love has colored my world  
And makes my soul cry  
You move me  
Lord, You move me  
There's a fire burning in my soul  
And it's flowing through me  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me  
Now I must tell the world what I know  
Lord, You move me  
Day after day I'm amazed  
That You gave Your life for me  
When I think of the price that You paid  
How can I not say?  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me  
There's a fire burning in my soul  
It's flowing through me  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me  
Now I must tell the world what I know  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me, yeah  
Now I must tell the world what I know  
You move me, yeah, yeah  
You move me  
You move me  
Yes, You do  
Oh, Your love amazes me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You move me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
