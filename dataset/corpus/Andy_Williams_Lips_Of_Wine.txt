I tasted your sweet lips, thrilled to my fingertips  
Lips of wine, warm with fire, you are my one desire  
Lips of wine, and they are mine  
  
While tropic breezes play, while palm trees gently sway  
Lips of wine, come to me, whisper low so tenderly  
Lips of wine, and they are mine  
  
Sweet Hawaiian miss, no more will I roam  
I must have your kiss and I can't go home  
  
You stole my heart from me, pretty rose of Waikiki  
Lips of wine, sweet and rare, tell me you will always care  
Lips of wine, and they are mine  
  
(Sweet lips, sweet and tasty lips)  
  
Sweet Hawaiian miss, no more will I roam  
I must have your kiss and I can't go home  
  
I tasted you sweet lips (sweet lips, your sweet and tasty lips)  
Thrilled to my fingertips (sweet lips, your sweet and tasty lips)  
Lips of wine, warm with fire, you are my one desire  
Lips of wine (sweet lips) and they are mine (sweet lips of wine)  
And they are mine (sweet lips of wine)  
FADE  
Ooh, they are mine (sweet lips of wine)
