Don't believe a word your grandfather says  
He's been classified grade A psycotik  
You can see it from the hole in his head  
A saner man would have used a bigger gun  
  
Degeneration ah ah ah ah ah  
The lunatic clause was written for you  
  
The story spoken is the story unheard  
By you so listen cause it's unbelievable  
A certain trait has passed while centuries turned  
This certain trait has been a family tradition  
  
No simple way to tell you son  
We share the same red tainted blood  
I'm gonna kill me, you're gonna kill you  
Killing you  
  
Don't believe a word your grandfather says [Repeat: x3]  
He's a psycotik, grade A psycotic
