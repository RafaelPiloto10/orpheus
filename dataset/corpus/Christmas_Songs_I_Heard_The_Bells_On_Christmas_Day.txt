I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day  
Their old familiar carols play,  
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on earth, good will to men.  
  
I thought how, as the day had come,  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along the unbroken song  
Of peace on earth, good will to men.  
  
And in despair I bowed my head:  
"There is no peace on earth," I said,  
"For hate is strong and mocks the song  
Of peace on earth, good will to men. "  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:  
"God is not dead, nor doth he sleep  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
In peace on earth, good will to men.
