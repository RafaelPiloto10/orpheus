I'm Popeye the sailor man. I'm Popeye the sailor man.  
I'm strong to the finich, cause I eats me spinach.  
I'm Popeye the sailor man.  
  
I'm one tough gazookus, which hates all palookas.  
Wot ain't on the up and square.  
I biffs 'em and buffs 'em and always out roughs 'em  
But none of 'em gets nowhere.  
  
If anyone dares to risk my "fisk", it's "boff" an' it's "wham" un'erstan'?  
So keep "good be-hav-or", that's your one life saver  
With popeye the sailor man.  
  
I'm Popeye the sailor man, I'm Popeye the sailor man.  
I'm strong to the finich, cause I eats me spinach.  
I'm Popeye the sailor man.
