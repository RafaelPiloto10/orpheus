The other day I came across  
Someone I knew and he was lost  
I don't care what we have done  
You never will believe it  
It's a life that's made for me  
Where I can be completely free  
So long as I obey this sound  
That echoes all around  
Just like the ocean or the sea  
Just like the blood that burns in me  
Someone like you cannot be free  
Just like a lock without a key  
Just like the ocean or the sea  
Just like the blood that burns in me  
Someone like you cannot be free  
Just like a lock without a key  
  
Just like the ocean or the sea  
Just like the blood that burns in me  
Someone like you cannot be free  
Just like a lock without a key  
Just like the ocean or the sea  
Just like the blood that burns in me  
Someone like you cannot be free  
Just like a lock without a key  
  
So, I thought this cannot be  
There's someone else in here with me  
I don't care where we have been  
You never will believe it  
I know you and you know me  
And we're as happy as we can be  
I know where this world belongs  
It don't mean much to me  
Just like the ocean or the sea  
Just like the blood that burns in me  
Someone like you cannot be free  
Just like a lock without a key
