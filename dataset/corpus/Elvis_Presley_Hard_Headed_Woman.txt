Well a hard headed woman,  
A soft hearted man  
Been the cause of trouble  
Ever since the world began.  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man.  
  
Now Adam told to Eve,  
"Listen here to me,  
Don't you let me catch you  
Messing round that apple tree."  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man.  
  
Now Samson told Delilah  
Loud and clear,  
"Keep your cotton picking fingers  
Out my curly hair."  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man.  
  
I heard about a king  
Who was doing swell  
Till he started playing  
With that evil Jezebel.  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man.  
  
I got a woman,  
A head like a rock.  
If she ever went away  
I'd cry around the clock.  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man.
