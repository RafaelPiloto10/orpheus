Oh cleanser of the mess I've made  
Upon the hill our places trade  
Stretched on a cross Your body crushed  
By human hands You formed from dust  
  
[Chorus]  
How wonderful Your mercy is  
How awesome are Your ways  
I come, I come  
To worship You  
For all You've done  
Oh cleanser of the mess I've made  
Your boundless love for me portrayed  
With patience for my learning curve  
By holding back what I deserve  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh cleanser of the mess I've made  
With everything at Your feet laid  
I watch as all my cares erode  
And from my soul these words explode  
  
[Chorus]
