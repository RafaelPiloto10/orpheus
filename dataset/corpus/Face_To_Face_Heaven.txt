heaven is the whole of the heart and heaven don't tear you apart yeah heaven
is the whole of the heart and heaven don't tear you apart there's too many
kings wanna tear you down and a world at the window gone underground there's a
hole in the wky where the sun don't shine and a clock on the wall and it
counts my time and heaven is the whole of the heart and heaven don't tear you
apart yeah heaven is the whole of the heart and heaven don't tear you apart
there's a song on the air with a love-you-line and a face in a glass and it
looks like mine and i'm standing on ice when i say that i don't hear planes
and i scream at the fools wanna jump my train and heaven is the whole of the
heart and heaven don't tear you apart yeah heaven is the whole of the heart
and heaven don't tear you apart yeah heaven ah heaven yeah heaven
