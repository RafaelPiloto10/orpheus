Well I think I see another side  
Maybe just another light that shines  
And I look over now through the door  
And I still belong to no one else  
Maybe I hold you to blame for all the reasons that you left.  
And close my eyes 'till I see your surprise  
And you're leaving before my time.  
Baby won't you change your mind?  
  
Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now.  
It's like I told you I'm over you somehow  
Before I close the door  
I need to hear you say goodbye.  
Baby won't you change your mind?  
  
I guess that hasn't changed someone  
Maybe nobody else could understand  
I guess that you believe you are a woman  
And that I am someone else's man  
But just before I see that you leave  
I want you to hold on to things that you said  
Baby I wish I were dead.  
  
Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now.  
It's like I told you I'm over you somehow  
Before I close the door  
I need to hear you say goodbye  
Baby won't you change your mind?
