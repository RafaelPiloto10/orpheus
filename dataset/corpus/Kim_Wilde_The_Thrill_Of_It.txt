Thinking about what a friend just said  
You know nothing good comes easy  
You took the thought right from my head  
You only seem to tease me  
Then you turn  
(It on again)  
Then you turn  
(Me on again)  
Then I learn the answers to all my questions  
Now some thing's taking over  
It's the thrill of it, the thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
The thrill of it, it's taking me over  
Now what am I supposed to do  
You know it can't go on much longer  
Every time when I'm near you  
You know the feelings so much stronger  
Then you turn  
(It on again)  
Then you turn  
(Me on again)  
Then I learn the answers to all my questions  
Now some thing's taking over  
It's the thrill of it, the thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
The thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
It's taking me over  
You know it's taking me over  
You know it's taking me over  
Then you turn  
(It on again)  
Then you turn  
(Me on again)  
Then I learn the answers to all my questions  
Now some thing's taking over  
It's the thrill of it, the thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it, the thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it
