I love you so much!  
But I hate what you've done  
I know from here things will never be the same  
And things will probably never change  
I know what we want  
Isn't exactly what god had planned  
Hey it's all I can do is  
Hope you can see the difference  
And prey for the best  
Please don't forget me!  
  
I wont soothe your pain  
I wont ease your strength  
  
Drake:  
I should let you fall in love with  
Someone else girl  
I live in L. A  
You in Chicago  
You're not patient  
I'm not patient  
We shouldn't be together  
I think we shouldn't be together  
No more no (no more no)  
Just think I'm where it all beginning  
You're the envy of your prince  
Plus you know you're not yourself any more  
The miracle of change  
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl  
And I'm sorry  
I said I'm sorry girl  
(Yeah)  
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it  
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying  
  
Is it wrong for me to tell these women what they wanna hear  
Try to control us  
You wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us  
  
All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy  
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments  
I mean women inspire me to great things  
(Drake:?)  
I need to grow some fucking confidence  
And why you gotta say the last words  
And if I tell you how I really felt  
(There probably end up being another argument candy girl,  
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)  
Yeah  
And that shit starts to get old  
And I don't mean to say the most  
But you know how they say you are who you hang with?  
So it bothers me when you hang with hoes  
  
Drake:  
Is it wrong for me to tell these women what they wanna hear  
  
You know how they say  
If you love somebody  
That don't love you back  
Love them anyway
