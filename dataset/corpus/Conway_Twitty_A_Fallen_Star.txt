A star fell from Heaven  
Right into my arms  
The brightest star I know I've never seen  
Then I found out that it was  
Only you and all your charms  
You came into my life to fill a dream.  
  
A fallen star, that's what you are  
The twinkle in your eye came from the sky  
You must have sailed from the Milky Way  
A fallen star, that's what you are.  
  
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine,  
I'm sure they'll miss a star as bright as you.  
But the stars will send their blessings and brighter they will shine,  
For when they see the dream that's coming true.  
  
A fallen star, that's what you are  
That twinkle that's in your eye came from the sky  
You must have sailed from the Milky Way  
A fallen star, that's what you are...  
  
(A fallen star)...
