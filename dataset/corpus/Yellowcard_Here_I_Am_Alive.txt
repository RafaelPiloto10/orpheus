If I could write to the kid I was before  
I'd tell him you'd get everything you ever wanted  
But you will still want more  
Someone's gonna tell you  
Who you should wanna be  
So you forget the vision that they didn't want to see  
And when they give up, 'cause they will give up say  
"Here I am alive"  
  
They say you don't grow up you just grow old  
It's safe to say I haven't done both  
I made mistakes, I know, I know  
But here I am alive  
So many people close to me cut me down  
This is supposed to be a bad luck town  
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground  
But here I am alive  
  
If I could write to myself when I was on top of it all,  
I'd say you're going overboard and when you are falling  
You're gonna feel so small  
Someone's gonna tell you that you deserve the worst  
They'd say you're never coming back and tell you that you're cursed  
But when they give up, 'cause they always give up say-  
"Here I am alive"  
  
They say you don't grow up you just grow old  
It's safe to say I haven't done both  
I made mistakes, I know, I know  
But here I am alive  
So many people close to me cut me down  
This is supposed to be a bad luck town  
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground  
But here I am alive  
  
And when they give up, 'cause they will give up  
Say: "Here I am alive!!"  
And when they give up, 'cause they always give up  
Say: "Here I am alive!!"  
  
They say you don't grow up you just grow old  
It's safe to say I haven't done both  
I made mistakes, I know, I know  
But here I am alive  
So many people close to me cut me down  
This is supposed to be a bad luck town  
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground  
But here I am alive  
  
Here I am alive  
(Here I am alive)  
Here I am alive  
(Here I am alive)  
Here I am alive  
(Here I am alive)  
Here I am alive  
(Here I am)  
  
If I could write to the kid I was before
