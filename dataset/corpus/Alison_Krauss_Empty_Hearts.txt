Are you leaving, are you going?  
Did you think you could lose that feeling  
Without me knowing?  
Are you wishing you'd never met me?  
Does it take some train whistle blowing  
To forget me?  
  
All the losing  
And the knowing that you love her still  
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel  
Tell me what an empty heart must feel  
  
Are you leaving, are you going?  
Did you think you could lose that feeling  
Without me knowing?  
All the losing  
And the knowing that you love her still  
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel  
Tell me what an empty heart must feel
