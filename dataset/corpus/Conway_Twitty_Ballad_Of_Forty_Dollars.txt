The man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die  
He laid down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes  
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs  
It took us seven hours and I guess we must have drunk a case of beer  
  
I guess I oughta go and watch 'em put him down but I don't own the suit  
And anyway when they start talkin' bout the fire and hell well I get spooked  
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass  
And anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass  
  
Well here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine  
Hm look at all that chrome I do believe that that's the sharpest thing I've
seen  
That must belong to his great uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm  
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm  
  
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that  
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black  
He's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale  
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil  
  
Now listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps  
I think that when you's in the war they always hired and played a song like
that  
Well here I am and there they go and I guess you'd call it my bad luck  
I hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is that fellow owed me forty bucks
