Well I've had enough of the ways of men  
said I've had enough of the ways of men  
Yes, I've had enough of the ways of men  
his sordid games rape my brain  
Well, I've had enough of his tomfoolery and shame  
yes, I've had enough of his tomfoolery and his shame  
Oooh, I've had just enough of his tom-tom foolery and his shame  
his sordid games rape my brain  
As the wind sweeps across generations up and down the sweep of history  
he leaves his tracks in all places, leaves his stain in all beds  
He builds schools and pleasures, all designed to prevent illumination  
all of his games rape my brain  
He put his flag in the desert, but I need water  
he put his flag in the desert, but I need water  
He put his flag in the desert, but I need water  
he put his flag in the desert, but I need water, water, water  
Long hast thou dwelt in darkness  
quit the night, and seek the day
