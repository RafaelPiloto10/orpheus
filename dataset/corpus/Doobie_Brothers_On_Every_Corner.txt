Brother, you've fallen far behind.  
What is it that's on your mind?  
Sister, oh how do you decide?  
What do you see through your clouded eyes?  
On every corner I turn to,  
Some variation of "help me please,"  
Can't pretend I don't see you there.  
How should I feel?  
Brother, you've fallen to your knees.  
What do your children need?  
The distance is never out of reach,  
There's only inches between you and me.  
On every corner I turn to,  
Some variation of "help me please,"  
Can't pretend I don't see you there.  
How should I feel?  
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' your way, you know  
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today.  
Count up the corners of 'em, add up the dollars for 'em.  
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' your way, you know,  
Ten thousand of 'em all over town.  
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today,  
But is it really helpin', whatever I do?  
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' at you, you know  
Will I feel good about it, will I feel a fool?  
I hate to beg, 'cause I feel like such a fool?  
On every corner I turn to,  
Some variation of "help me please,"  
Can't pretend I don't see you there.  
How should I feel?
