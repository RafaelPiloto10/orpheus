Lately I been stuck imagining  
What I wanna do and what I really think,  
Time to flow out  
Be a little inappropriate  
'Cause I know that everybody's thinkin' it  
When the lights out  
  
Shame on me  
To need release  
Uncontrollably  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I wanna go all the way  
Taking out my freak tonight  
I wanna show  
All the dirt  
I am running through my mind  
  
Lately people got me all tied up  
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt  
Time to blow out  
I've been told who I should do it with  
To keep both my hands above the blanket  
When the lights out  
  
Shame on me  
To need release  
Uncontrollably  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Shame on me (shame on me)  
To need release (to need release)  
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably)  
  
[Chorus: x2]
