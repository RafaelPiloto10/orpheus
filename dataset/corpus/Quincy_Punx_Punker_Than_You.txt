you drink coffee at the right cafes  
and bitch about the rights of gays  
i drink beer down at the river  
and bitch about my swollen liver  
you listen to the P.C. groups  
and wear you brand new DM boots  
mind controlled by profane existance  
fucking crass hole keep your distance  
I'm Punker Than You  
you spike your hair with soap not glue  
you drink robatussin too  
you think punk is something new  
where were you in '82  
you wear a fucking cure t-shirt  
you think their artsy, i think their dirt  
tesco vee is much more artistic  
besides he dont wear fucking lipstick
