I see you watching me  
Yeah, you know I'm on it  
See how I'm living  
You know I'm too strong  
All they throw at me  
I'm not fallin' for it  
They think I'm alone  
They've got it all wrong  
  
Everybody on the left and everybody on the right  
Who's not scared to testify (willing to testify)  
Gotta let the world know it  
That you're not afraid to show it  
If you're not afraid to show it  
Let me hear you tonight  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
All my people in the place  
You're looking good with style and grace  
But here's my question, listen clear  
Where my soldiers (right here)  
Say hey (hey)  
If you know you keep it tight  
Say hey (hey)  
Where my soldiers at (right here)  
  
The world's watching you  
What'cha gonna do now  
Will you make a move  
Will you show and prove  
In all that you do  
Gotta represent  
The life that we've been given  
The reason why we're living so  
  
Everybody on the left and everybody on the right  
Who's not scared to testify (willing to testify)  
Gotta let the world know it  
That you're not afraid to show it  
If you're not afraid to show it  
Let me hear you tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All my people in the place (repeat)  
  
Well, you know there's a reason  
We're here to change the world  
And you know I'm believing  
We can do it but it's up to you  
The request of the maker  
Of the ocean and the sky so blue  
It's a call for some soldiers  
So if you're not afraid to take a stand  
Then let me see you raise your hand  
  
[Chorus]
