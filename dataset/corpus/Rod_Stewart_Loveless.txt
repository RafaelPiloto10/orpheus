What'cha doin', what'cha doin' what'cha doin' right now?  
Have you found another lover? Are you out of town?  
I won't leave another message right after the tone  
?Cause I know you got the others and you still don't call  
  
There's no magic, no sunshine  
No rainbows in my life  
Look at all the things you took from me  
  
Baby I'm loveless  
Feeling so hopeless  
Feeling so foolish  
For being so helpless  
  
Baby I'm loveless  
It's like you could care less  
If you did you'd come right back to me  
  
Tell me what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside  
Got me tossing' and turning' in the middle of the night  
Like an animal struggling in a trap  
?Cuz I can't go forward and I can't go back  
  
There's no springtime  
Just winter  
And each night gets colder  
Look at all that pain you took from me  
  
Baby I'm loveless  
Feeling so hopeless  
Feeling so foolish  
For being so helpless  
  
And the sun don't shine  
It's just wintertime  
And every night there's no one in my life  
Take a look at what you took from me  
  
Baby I'm loveless  
Feeling so hopeless  
Feeling so foolish  
For being so helpless
