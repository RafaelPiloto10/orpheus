Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you  
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it is true  
I love you more than ever, girl, I do  
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you  
I want you at the moment I feel blue  
I'm living every moment, girl, for you  
Walk, walk cat, walk, go, Johnny, go  
Same old tale of blues  
Elmo James got nothing on this, baby  
I've loved you from the moment, I saw you  
You looked at me that's all you had to do  
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too  
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you  
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true  
I love you more than ever, girl, I do, tale of the blues
