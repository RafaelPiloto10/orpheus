On the banks of the river  
Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave  
On the other side of the river  
Stood his lovely Indian maid  
Little White Dove was her name  
Such a lovely sight to see  
But their tribes fought with each other  
So their love could never be  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love that couldn't die  
He couldn't swim the raging river  
'Cause the river, it was too wide  
He couldn't reach little White Dove  
Waiting there on the other side  
In the moonlight, he could see her  
Throwing kisses 'cross the wave  
Her little heart was beating faster  
Waiting there for her brave  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Yes, Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love that couldn't die  
Running Bear dove in the water  
Little White Dove, she did the same  
As they swam out to each other  
Through the swirling stream they came  
Now their hands touched and their lips met  
The swirling river, it pulled them down  
Now they'll always be together  
In their happy hunting ground  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Yes, Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love that couldn't die
