Oh please don't you think baby that I am wrong to cry, yeah.  
You loved me, too,  
So how come you just sit there and laugh  
And laugh and laugh and laugh?  
Things just can't be this way  
And not for very long  
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no.  
Our love affair said it's just history, yes it is.  
  
And I tried to love you in my own way,  
I think that you know I did.  
But to have you here, to see you living,  
Oh so near to me, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Oh but you are distant and so it's dead  
And so often people are glad to be old, yeah yeah,  
Our love affair is just history, yes it is.  
  
Once in a green time a flower  
Oh, fell in love with the sun.  
The passion lasted for an hour  
And then she wilted from her loved one.  
  
Once in a green time a flower  
Oh, fell in love with the sun.  
The passion lasted for an hour  
And then she wilted from her loved one.  
  
And I see you looking up at the sky, how high it is, yeah.  
You wonder if there is, whoa another me  
Now how can that be, how can it be?  
Well, I sit here and I ask you, why all this?  
I just got toni-ni-ni-night  
Our love affair said it's just a history  
But baby, baby, I said it's over, Charlie,  
I can't stand another lo-lo-lonely,  
I'm never too lonely.  
  
It's over baby,  
Where were you when I wanted ya  
And needed ya right by my side?  
I said-a, baby, baby, don't you feel me moving,  
Baby, don't you hear me cry ?  
I know I hurt you, but Lord don't you know I cried,  
I know I hurt you, but babe don't you know I tried,  
Oh baby, oh babe, whoa.
