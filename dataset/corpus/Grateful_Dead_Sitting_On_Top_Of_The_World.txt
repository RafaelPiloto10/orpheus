Mississippi river so big and wide, blond haired woman on the other side.  
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry 'cause I'm sitting on top of the
world.  
  
I worked all summer, spring and fall, blond haired woman the cause of it all.  
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry 'cause I'm sitting on top of the
world.  
  
I saw her in Dallas and El Paso. said come back baby, I need you so.  
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry 'cause I'm sitting on top of the
world.
