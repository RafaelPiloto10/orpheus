(by Hoobastank)  
  
I will dedicate  
And sacrifice my everything  
For just a second's worth  
Of my story's ending  
I'll be willing to  
Never come in suddenly  
Will I ever get to see  
The ending to my story  
  
Chorus  
Show me what it's for  
Make me understand it  
'Cause I've been crawling in the dark  
Looking for the answer  
Is there something more  
Than what I've been handed?  
'Cause I've been crawling in the dark  
Looking for the answer  
  
You carry on  
Show me  
It's ok to  
Use my heart and not my eyes  
To navigate the darkness  
Will the ending be  
Ever coming suddenly?  
Will I ever get to see  
The ending to my story?  
  
Chorus  
  
So when and how will I know?  
How much further will I have to go? (have to go)  
How much longer 'til I finally know? (finally know)  
Because I'm looking and I just can't see  
What's in front of me  
In front of me  
  
Chorus
