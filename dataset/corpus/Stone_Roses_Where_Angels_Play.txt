Come with me to a place no eyes have ever seen  
A million miles from here where no one's ever been  
God-given grace and a holy heaven face  
I'm on the edge of something shattering  
I'm coming through  
OK, let's fly she says this carpet's made for two  
This ugly little box no place for me and you  
Our carpet falls on a dew-fresh dappled plain  
Take a look around there's something happening  
All the colors fade  
  
I don't want you now  
Bang bang bang gone  
Ooh I don't need you now  
The seeds are sown  
Ooh bang bang pretty pretty bang bang  
I don't think so no no  
I don't think so no no  
Bang bang
