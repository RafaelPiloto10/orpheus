Well they've been writing your name on a bathroom wall  
But it don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing  
They want to ruin your life, they wann see you take a fall  
But it don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing at all  
  
Stupid people say stupid things  
And it'll drive you right up the wall  
Sometimes I feel the same way too  
But it don't mean nothing at all  
  
You're mom and dad don't care about the way you feel  
And you just can't take it, you just can't take it  
You got the short end of a shitty deal  
Just can't take it, you just can't take it no more  
  
Stupid people say stupid things  
And it'll drive you right up the wall  
Sometimes I feel the same way too  
But it don't mean nothing at all  
  
They put a lot of effort into making you feel like a clown  
You gave it your best shot and they shot you down  
  
Stupid people say stupid things  
And it'll drive you right up the fucking wall  
Sometimes I feel the same way too  
But it don't mean nothing at all  
Well it don't mean nothing at all  
It just don't mean nothing at all  
Well it don't mean nothing at all
