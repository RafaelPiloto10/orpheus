You moved like honey in my dream last night  
Yeah, some old fires were burning  
You came near to me and you endeared to me  
But you couldn't quite discern me  
  
Does that scare you? I'll let you run away  
But your heart will not oblige you  
You'll remember me like a melody  
Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you  
  
And my big secret-gonna win you over  
Slow like honey, heavy with mood  
  
I'll let you see me, I'll covet your regard  
I'll invade your demeanor  
And you'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze  
And you'll wonder what it is about me  
  
It's my big secret-keeping you coming  
Slow like honey, heavy with mood  
  
Though dreams can be deceiving  
Like faces are to hearts  
They serve for sweet relieving  
When fantasy and reality lie too far apart  
  
So I stretch myself across, like a bridge  
And I pull you to the edge  
And stand there waiting  
Trying to attain  
The end to satisfy the story  
Shall I release you?  
Must I release you?  
As I rise to meet my glory  
  
But my big secret  
Gonna hover over your life  
Gonna keep you reaching  
When I'm gone like yesterday  
When I'm high like heaven  
When I'm strong like music  
'Cause I'm slow like honey  
And heavy with mood
