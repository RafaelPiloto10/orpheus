Close your eyes do what you wanna  
Baby how can I wait much longer  
Make it hard to believe it happened to me  
Morning comes too late tomorrow  
All you lose is the dream you borrow  
All you got is a soul that's born to be free  
and cries to the wind  
Waiting for you  
My dream will find you someday  
I stand beside my vision of you  
And have you loving me  
  
I still love you  
I still love you  
  
Though you're my imagination  
You be there when we find salvation  
Only then will there be no reason to hide  
Stormy night out in the heaven  
I believe in the true forever  
There's a bright new star when somebody dies  
I cry to the wind  
Waiting for you  
Sweet love returning someday  
The day you learn love happened to you  
You will be here with me  
  
I still love you  
I still love you  
  
I'll be waiting for you  
Sweet love returning someday  
The day you learn love happened to you  
You will be here with me  
  
I still love you  
I still love you  
I still [Repeats]
