She and I live in our own little world  
Don't worry about the world outside  
  
She and I agree  
She and I lead a perfectly normal life  
Ah but just because we aren't often seen socially  
People think we've got something to hide.  
But all our friends know we're just a little old fashioned  
She and I  
  
Oh ain't that great  
Aint it fine  
To have a love someone that others can't find  
Aint it wonderful to know all we ever need is just the two of us  
She and I  
So wonderful  
She and I  
  
She and I share with every body else  
The same wants, needs and desires  
She and I save  
She and I pay on everything we acquire  
  
Ah but just because we aren't often seen separately  
People think we live one life.  
  
Its hard for them to see how anyone could be as close as  
She and I
