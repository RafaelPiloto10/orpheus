I want you to remember  
First kiss you ever had  
When our lips met together  
I knew that was that  
  
I'm still standing  
Keeping you dancing yeah,  
You know you want it  
I'm still going  
Making the party blow  
The way you like it  
  
Do you want to hear me sing pop  
'cause I don't think I want to stop  
And I love it when my beats drop  
Yeah it makes me feel hot  
Guess whose back on top  
  
I'll happily surrender  
To your desire  
A touch so warm and tender  
Is setting me on fire  
  
I'm still standing  
Keeping you dancing yeah,  
You know you want it  
I'm still going  
Making the party blow  
The way you like it  
  
Do you want to hear me sing pop  
'cause I don't think I want to stop  
And I love it when my beats drop  
Yeah it makes me feel hot  
Guess whose back on top  
  
(funking to this sound  
We're gonna get down)  
  
Pop, stop, drop, hot  
  
(do you want to hear me sing) pop  
('cause I don't think I wanna)stop  
(and I love it when my beats) drop  
(yeah it makes me feel) hot  
Guess whose back on top  
  
Do you want to hear me sing pop  
'cause I don't think I want to stop  
And I love it when my beats drop  
Yeah it makes me feel hot  
Guess whose back on top
