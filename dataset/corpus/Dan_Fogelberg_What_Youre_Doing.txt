Look...what you're doing  
Baby what in heaven are you thinking of?  
Look...what you're doing  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love,  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love.  
You used to say that you would always stay  
But now you say you want to find your freedom.  
But are the promises of being free  
Worth the sacrifice of all you had with me.  
You know I've always tried the best I could  
To prove my love to you and make you happy  
And once upon a time if felt so good  
What has happened now to make you want to fly.  
Do you want to see me cry?  
Look...what you're doing  
Baby what in heaven are you thinking of?  
Look...what you're doing  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love,  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love.  
I ain't the fool that you believe I am  
You tell your lies but I can see right through them.  
Cause in your eyes I see another man  
But he will never love you like you know I can.  
Oh, girl, you know I can.  
(You better open up your eyes and)  
Look...what you're doing  
Baby what in heaven are you thinking of?  
Look...what you're doing  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love,  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love.
