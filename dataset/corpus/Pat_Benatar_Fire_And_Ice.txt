Ooo, you're givin' me the fever tonight  
I don't want to give in  
I'd be playin' with fire  
You forget, I've seen you work before  
Take 'em straight to the top  
Leave 'em cryin' for more  
I've seen you burn 'em before  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fire and ice  
You come on like a flame  
Then you turn a cold shoulder  
Fire and ice  
I want to give you my love  
But you'll just take a little piece of my heart  
  
You'll just tear it apart  
  
Movin' in for the kill tonight  
You got every advantage when they put out the lights  
It's not so pretty when it fades away  
'Cause it's just an illusion in this passion play  
I've seen you burn 'em before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So you think you got it all figured out  
You're an expert in the field, without a doubt  
But I know your methods inside and out  
And I won't be taken in by fire and ice  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
You come on like a flame  
Then you turn a cold shoulder  
Fire and ice  
  
You come on like a flame  
Then you turn a cold shoulder  
Fire and ice.
