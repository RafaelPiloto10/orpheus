Happy to see you again  
I'm happy 'cos you're a girl's best friend  
I love it when you get real close  
But I don't smile so no-one knows  
That I'm happy just to be next to you  
And I love the way you do the things you do  
And it doesn't have to be so hard  
To get happy when love's in charge  
And I'm happy, I'm feeling really free  
And I'm not satisfied with misery  
I said I'm h a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
Did I ever tell you just how much I love you?  
I may have forgotten sometimes  
With the boats and the stars and the wine in the glass  
And the touch of your body on mine  
You make me h a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)
