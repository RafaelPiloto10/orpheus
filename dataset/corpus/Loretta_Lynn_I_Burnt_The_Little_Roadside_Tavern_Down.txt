Oh I burnt the little roadside tavern down the only one for miles and miles
around  
Now it's pile of ashes on the ground  
Yeah I burnt the little roadside tavern down  
Oh I warned my man just stay away from that tavern or I'll burn it down
someday  
I think he thought it was a joke until he smelled the smoke  
Then he screaned that woman finally got her way  
Oh I burnt the little roadside...  
[ steel ]  
He acted like a man who'd lost its mind after he bought all those bottles of
wine  
You should have heard him talk and should as he tried to put it out  
Drowin' water on the bucket at a time  
Oh I burnt the little roadside...  
Yes I burnt the little roadside tavern down
