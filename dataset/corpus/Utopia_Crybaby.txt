Cry to me, those were your very words  
You said cry to me, cry to me  
There you stood, laughing at my tears  
You said, silly boy, forget your childhood fears  
But you don't realize how strange it makes me feel  
Now we're exchanging parts  
Stop, you're breaking my heart  
Who's the crybaby now  
Cry to me, cry to me, you're the crybaby now  
Cry to me, cry  
Who's the crybaby, who's breaking my heart  
  
Lie to me, you know that I know you too well  
So don't you lie to me, lie to me  
I watch you from afar, crying up your sleeve  
When they turn away,
