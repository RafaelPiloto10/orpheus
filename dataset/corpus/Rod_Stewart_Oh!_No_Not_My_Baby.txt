When my friends told me you had someone new,  
I didn't believe a single word was true  
I told them all I had faith in you.  
I kept a-right on sayin'  
  
Oh, no, not my baby,  
Oh no, not my sweet baby.  
You're not like all those other girls  
Who play with the men's hearts like they were toys.  
  
My mama told me, "Son when rumors spread  
That there is truth somewhere,  
And you should use your head."  
But sure didn't listen to what she said,  
Don't you know I kept a-right on sayin'  
  
Oh, no, not my baby,  
Oh no, not my sweet baby.  
  
You're not like all those other girls  
Who lead you on and tell you lies  
No, no, my baby  
  
Tell me, baby  
I don't believe what they say, no  
  
Oh, no, not my baby,  
Oh no, not my sweet baby.  
Oh, no, not my baby,  
Oh no, not my sweet baby.  
  
Not my baby, not my baby  
Not my baby, not my baby  
Not my baby, not my baby  
Not my sweet sweet baby,  
  
Not my baby, not my baby  
Not my baby, not my baby  
Not my baby, not my baby  
No way, not my baby  
  
Not my baby, not my baby  
Not my sweet sweet baby  
Oh, no, not my baby,  
Oh no, not my sweet baby.  
  
Oh, no, not my baby,  
Oh no, not my sweet baby.  
Oh, no, not my baby,  
Oh no, not my sweet baby.  
  
Oh, no, not my baby,  
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
