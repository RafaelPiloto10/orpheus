I remember you I remember  
You I remember you  
I remember lying awake at night and thinking just of you  
But things don't last forever and somehow baby  
They never really do  
They never really do  
  
I remember you I remember  
You I remember you  
I remember lying awake at night and thinking just of you  
But things don't last forever and somehow baby  
They never really do  
They never really do  
  
I remember you I remember  
You I remember you  
I remember you I remember  
You I remember you  
I remember you, you I remember you I remember you  
  
I remember lying awake at night and thinking just of you  
But things don't last forever and somehow baby  
They never really do  
They never really do  
  
I remember you I remember  
You I remember you  
I remember you I remember  
You I remember you  
I remember you
