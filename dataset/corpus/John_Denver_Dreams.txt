There are dreams that sail away to sea  
And some that stay at home  
There are dreams in need of company  
And some that stand alone  
There are dreams that stay inside all day  
And never see the light  
And if dreams come true  
I swear to you  
I'll dream of you tonight  
  
In a corner bar the local star  
Destroys a passing chord  
He sits behind a Mason jar  
And dreams of his reward  
Then he takes his break  
And he counts his take  
A dollar buys a beer  
A quarter of his life is gone  
And what's he doing here?  
  
Times are hard  
The old backyard is covered in cement  
The people seem afraid to dream  
And dream don't cost a cent  
  
There are dreams that stay inside all day  
And never see the light  
And if dreams come true  
I swear to you  
I'll dream of you tonight  
And if dreams come true  
I swear to you  
I'll dream of you tonight
