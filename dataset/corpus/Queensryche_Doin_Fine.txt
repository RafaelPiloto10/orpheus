Have you noticed The way people seem today?  
Look in their eyes, you can feel their uncertainty.  
Working hard for what they fear others would think.  
Empty hearts are afraid to break away: don't be afraid.  
We could all use a little sunshine  
Take the day off: outside.  
Hey look around, everything's better now  
And here we are and we're doin' fine.  
If we look inside, breath deep, and count to ten.  
We'll find what we need to see us through  
All the way to the end.  
We'll know all the answers  
Once we stop this judgment game  
And realize deep down we're all the same.  
We could all use a little sunshine  
Take the day off and smile.  
Hey look around everything's better now,  
And here we are and getting along fine.  
Yeah, we're doin' just fine.  
We could all use some sunshine  
Take the day off and smile.  
Hey look around, everything's better  
And here we are getting along just fine.  
Next time we could try a little harder  
And quickly put out the fire,  
By working out our differences and  
Finding truth we can all believe in.  
We're looking at life from a different side.  
We're looking at like from a different side.  
And I know that we'll all be fine.  
And I know that we'll all be fine.
