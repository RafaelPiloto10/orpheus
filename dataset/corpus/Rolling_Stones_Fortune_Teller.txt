(Neville)  
Went to the fortune teller  
Had my fortune read  
I didn't know what to tell her  
I had the dizzy feeling in my head  
  
Then she took a look at my palm  
She said sonny your fields out of wong  
She looked into her crystal ball  
And said you're in love  
  
I said I couldn't that be so  
I'm not passion with the girls I know  
She said when the next one arrives  
You'll be looking into her eyes  
  
I left there in a hurry  
Looking forward to my big surprise  
The next day I discovered  
That the fortune teller told me a lie  
  
I hurried back down to that woman  
As mad as I could be  
I told her I didn't see nobody  
Why'd she make a fool out of me  
  
Then something struck me  
As if it came from up above  
While looking at the fortune teller  
I fell in love  
  
Now I'm a happy fellow  
Well I'm married to the fortuen teller  
We're happy as we can be  
Now I get my fortune told for free  
  
Now I'm a happy fellow  
Well I'm married to the fortune teller  
We're happy as we can be  
And I get my fortune told for free
