Me and my brother were talking to each other  
'Bout what makes a man a man  
Was it brain or brawn, or the month you were born  
We just couldn't understand  
  
Our old man didn't like our appearance  
He said that only women wear long hair  
  
So me and my brother borrowed money from Mother  
We knew what we had to do  
We went downstairs, past the barber and gymnasium  
And got our arms tattooed  
  
Welcome to my life, tattoo  
I'm a man now, thanks to you  
I expect I'll regret you  
But the skin graft man won't get you  
You'll be there when I die  
Tattoo  
  
My dad beat me 'cause mine said "Mother"  
But my mother naturally liked it and beat my brother  
'Cause his tattoo was of a lady in the nude  
And my mother thought that was extremely rude  
  
Welcome to my life, tattoo  
We've a long time together, me and you  
I expect I'll regret you  
But the skin graft man won't get you  
You'll be there when I die  
Tattoo  
  
Now I'm older, I'm tattooed all over  
My wife is tattooed too  
A rooty-toot-toot, rooty-tooty-toot-toot  
Rooty-toot-toot tattoo too  
To you
