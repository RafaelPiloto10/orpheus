Cold beer and a strange cigarette  
Getting you high getting you wet  
Falling in love falling out of debt  
Straight gay black or white  
Strutting in the dark hiding in the light  
Doing it wrong doing it right just doing it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other  
I got the right we all got the right  
  
One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck  
One man's meat is someone's empty well  
One man's meat is some guy's aching butt  
One man's meat is another man's living hell  
  
Short fat thick or thin  
Take it in the gut take it on the chin  
Living in glory living in sin  
Hard day's work going down slow  
Riding the road where the green grass grows  
Watching in die what d'you know  
Watch it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other  
I got the right  
  
One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck  
One man's meat is someone's empty well  
One man's meat is some guy's aching butt  
One man's meat is another man's living hell
