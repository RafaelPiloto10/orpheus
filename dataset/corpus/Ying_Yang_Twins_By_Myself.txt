[Intro]  
Eh, yo, yo yo  
This is Ying Yang Twins with a ghetto public service announcment (uh oh)  
Red light (ohh), red light (ohh, ohh)  
Stay by yourself, (ohh) by yourself (ohh)...  
[Chorus] - 2X  
Smoke by myself  
Drink by myself  
Poke these hoes by my goddamn self, for rrreal (By my goddamn self)  
For rrreal (By my goddamn self)  
[Verse 1]  
Nigga dwell on it, can't he  
So tell on me, got my bitch all at the crib  
Try to smell on a nigga, want to stay around him  
But when I'm sitting on the couch  
She keep me saying "ouch", 'cause she grabbin on my crouch  
And I already know, thinking to myself  
What the fuck, somebody told  
Had to have been one little nigga that I showed  
Some shit that they never should have seen, anyhow  
All hell nigguh...hatin' on me now, smokin' on my weed  
Steady drinkin' on my beer, hell naw niggah  
Get the fuck up out of here, can't hold one  
So you can't hold your tongue, nigga lips smackin  
Like she chew bubble gum, tell her where I been  
What I did, who I'm with  
Said see me with two bitches, that's when I said it  
I gotta stay the fuck away from head, I'ma  
[Chorus] - 2X  
[Verse 2]  
Smokin' weed by myself, drinkin' Henn by myself  
Buckin' hoes by myself, I fuss with nobody else  
Now red light, child started a fight  
Just talking all about us, and whilin', its alright  
I hate when my brothers, fuckin' up undercovas  
Shorty, did I stutter? Go get another rubba  
Child is shaking like blubba, child that want me to cut her  
Too many niggas in the house, time to get out!  
I get freaky in the back, while you play at your work  
I'm hitting the fat monkey, and damn your girl chunky  
Haven't seen what I've been, I'm drinking all alone  
On the phone with my b...l, you, n, t 'course every day  
I white out, acamo, philly, or marsailles  
Give a fuck about a bitch, what that muthafucka say?  
Who gives a shit? Grab a bitch in the club  
Show her love with a dub, and them niggas hatin' 'cause I...  
[Chorus] - 2X  
[Verse 3]  
Smoke by myself, drink byself  
Poke by myself, cause I was born by my God damn self  
Fuck, run and train, that shit lame  
I'd rather be one-on-one with a bitch gettin' brain  
Too many heads on a blunt, nigga don't get high  
I don't give a fuck, if ya got fire  
Every now and then you chip, and you want to get Henn  
But you never got a twinny-twin-twin, don't roll trees  
Hey man, shit, take it from me  
You better off to get drunk on a Pepsi  
Up, that's a beep, might be a freak (Hey lemme roll with your phone?)  
I ain't taking nobody with me, I'ma ride by myself  
Get high by myself, get drunk by myself  
Fuck this ho by my goddamn self (myself)  
Don't nobody hold your own, like your own  
that's why we on our own...  
[Chorus] - 3X  
[Outro]  
See now when you do what you do, how you do what you do  
When you do what you do, nobody can tell on you  
If you all by yourself, ah ah ah, say it  
I don't need no friends, I don't need no foes  
I'ma drink my Henn, and choke all out the door  
Now everybody said goodbye, get your hand that burns  
It's just good to see ya ride, reverse, reverse  
Biieetch, reverse, reverse, biieetch  
To wonder all this time, what happened this time? (Hoooo!)  
Everybody tries ta, everybody chill...we just playin'  
Everybody but me, Ying Yang Twins out for the 2001  
(Eh, we'd like to thank y'all)  
Went down to the jukebox...
