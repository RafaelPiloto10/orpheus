Well here's the good news Angel  
Here's the bad  
It could hurt you darling  
It could make you happy or sad  
Ooh here she comes now!  
It was a radio  
Playing on the running board  
With a Hey someone singing  
Oh My sweet lord  
She was calling now  
Come on in lets get free  
Where we go doesn't matter  
If you just love me  
'cause Falling down,  
Time after time  
Falling into the sea  
Standing up's tough enough,  
Tough enough for me  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
It's raining stones  
Give it up darling  
Rattling bones  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
It's called fate  
Give it up darling  
Lift off this weight  
I've laid down in the gutter  
Looking up at the stars  
Washed by the rain  
And these passing cars  
I want to feel something  
And it's called happy again  
I'm gonna leave this town,  
Change my name  
Won't be back again  
'cause Falling down,  
Time after time  
Falling into the sea  
Standing up's tough enough,  
Tough enough for me  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
It's raining stones  
Give it up darling  
Rattling bones  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
It's called fate  
Give it up darling  
Lift off this weight  
Solo  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
It's raining stones  
Give it up darling  
Rattling bones  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
It's called fate  
Give it up darling  
Lift off this weight  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
It's raining stones  
Give it up darling  
Rattling bones  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
It's called fate  
Give it up darling  
Lift off this weight  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
It's not too late  
Give it up darling  
Rattling bones  
Give it up,  
Give it up  
Don't let go  
Give it up darling  
Lift off this weight
