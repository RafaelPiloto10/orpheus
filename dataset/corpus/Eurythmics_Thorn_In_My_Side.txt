Thorn in my side.  
You know that's all you ever were.  
A bundle of lies.  
You know that's all that it was worth  
I should have known better  
But I trusted you at first.  
I should have known better  
But I got what I deserved  
  
To run away from you  
Was all that I could do.  
To run away from you  
Was all that I could do.  
  
Thorn in my side.  
You know that's all you'll ever be.  
So don't think you know better  
'Cause that's what you mean to me  
I was feeling complicated.  
I was feeling low.  
Now everytime I think of you  
I shiver to the bone  
  
[Chorus]
