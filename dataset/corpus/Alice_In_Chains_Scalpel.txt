Road narrows, pouring down  
I'm breaking without a sound  
Bits and pieces of trying  
Get what you pay for, nothing  
  
Frozen dreaming of yesterday  
Potent, creeping I'm far away  
From my hometown I lit out  
To save my skin and shed some doubt  
  
I know how false the floor  
How high the sky  
Been down that road before  
  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
  
Hard as truth is, been my friend  
Don't need to be invited in  
I'll go round 'til bested  
Pick up myself and try again  
  
I know how false the floor  
How high the sky  
Been down that road before  
  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
  
All comes in time  
Don't fight it, don't mind it  
Whatever may come  
  
All comes in time  
Don't fight it, don't mind it  
Whatever may come  
  
I know how false the floor  
How high the sky  
Been down that road before  
  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself
