Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all alone for so long  
All the hope I had in finding love was almost gone  
Then an angel came along  
I believe good things come to those who wait  
And destiny, girl, I know it must be fate  
Now I see, 'cause I found my soul mate  
You're all I need  
So wonderful, beautiful  
But the words don't do you justice, girl  
You're so much more  
And I dedicate my life to love you so  
Love you so  
I believe good things come to those who wait  
And destiny, it must be fate  
'cause now I see, babe, 'cause I found my soul mate  
You're all I need, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Let me say it, I wanna say it again, girl  
I believe that good things come to those who wait  
And destiny, girl, I know it must be fate  
'cause now I see, 'cause I found my soul mate  
You're all I need  
Never, never, never, never, never, never leave me, babe  
Stay right there, right there, right there  
So hard to describe, babe, you bring tears to my eyes  
You're all I need  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible] love you so, baby  
You're all I need, baby
