To the ends of the Earth  
I'll follow my star  
To the ends of the Earth  
Just to be where you are  
  
No matter where you roam  
I'll never be far behind  
Who cares  
Where the path may wind  
As long as I find you?  
  
Though the melody dies  
The song lingers on  
And a thousand goodbyes  
Won't convince me  
You're gone  
  
I'll follow you, my love  
You'll never be free  
To the ends of the Earth  
Till you've given  
Your love to me  
  
No matter where you roam  
I'll never be far behind  
Who cares  
Where the path may wind  
As long as I find you?  
  
Though the melody dies  
The song lingers on  
And a thousand goodbyes  
Won't convince me  
You're gone  
  
I'll follow you, my love  
You'll never be free  
To the ends of the Earth  
Till you've given  
Your love to me
