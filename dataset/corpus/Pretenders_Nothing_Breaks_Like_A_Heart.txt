You don't love me anymore  
I can feel it  
But I want you more than before  
So I conceal it  
Walk on, walk on baby  
Don't look back  
This happy face is just a disguise  
Oh baby  
When love dies  
  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Glass shatters, even cars fall apart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
  
When you walked out  
At first I celebrated  
But this footloose, fancy free stuff's overrated  
  
Oh I got my way  
Now I'm free to roam  
These tears of laughter are just lies  
Oh baby  
When love dies  
  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Glass shatters, even cars fall apart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
I feel so bad bad bad  
Oh, oh oh  
I'm so sad sad sad  
I wasn't this shook in the L.A. earthquake  
How much can one heart break?  
  
You don't love me anymore  
I can feel it  
But I want you more than before  
So I conceal it  
Walk on, walk on baby  
Don't look back  
This crumbling heart is no surprise  
  
Oh baby, when love dies  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Glass shatters, even cars fall apart  
Nothing breaks like a heart  
Oh, nothing breaks like a heart  
Oh, nothing breaks like a heart  
Oh, nothing breaks like a heart
