Bzzz.... Bzzz....  
Hi, hello, Miss Sweeney?  
Could you please come in my office for a second?  
I'm heading home for the day  
And I thought it'd be good for you and me to check in  
I met with the gal from Expo  
And they do have the "slab" cabinets in white  
She thinks we can take the measurements  
Down at the site  
If we do that, we'll be just fine, Miss Sweeney  
That's all I got to say to you at this time, Miss Sweeney  
Actually there's one other thing on my mind  
  
Girl, you make the rain clouds disappear  
The sun always shines when you're near  
I'm waiting until you love me  
  
I'm so sorry Miss Sweeney  
I don't know where that came from  
I think I was overcome by spontaneous emotion  
Anyway, the cash deposit of five thousand will need to be sent to the property
owner tomorrow  
If there are any problems with the deposit or contract  
Don't be afraid to holler  
I don't want to have a approve each stinking dollar  
That we borrow  
Aww forget it, Miss Sweeney  
  
Girl, you make the rain clouds disappear  
The sun always shines when you're near  
I'm waiting until you love me  
  
Miss Sweeney, I got to admit the truth  
I am totally head over heels in love with you  
Every day you come to the office looking fine  
Navy business suit clinging tightly to your spine  
You ask me if I'm ready to get down to work  
Sweeney, baby, I'm ready...be my...  
  
Girl, you make the rain clouds disappear  
The sun always shines when you're near  
I'm waiting until you love me  
Girl, you light the skies of my life  
I swear I will make you my wife  
I'm waiting until you love me
