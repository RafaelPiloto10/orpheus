I feel like I've been locked up tight  
For a century of lonely nights  
Waiting for someone to release me  
You're lickin' your lips  
And blowing kisses my way  
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away  
Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby)  
  
Ooh, my body's sayin' let's go  
Ooh, but my heart is sayin' no  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)  
Gotta like what you do  
  
(I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Gotta rub me the right way honey  
I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Come come, come on and let me out)  
  
The music's fading and the lights down low  
Just one more dance and then we're good to go  
Waiting for someone  
Who needs me  
Hormones racing at the speed of light  
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight  
Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby)  
  
Ooh, my body's sayin' let's go  
Ooh, but my heart is sayin' no (but my heart is sayin' no)  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me (Oh)  
I can make your wish come true (Your wish come true oh)  
Just come and set me free baby  
And I'll be with you  
  
(I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Gotta rub me the right way honey  
I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Come come, come on and let me out)  
  
I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Gotta rub me the right way honey  
(If you wanna be with me)  
I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Come come, come on and let me out  
  
Ooh, my body's sayin' lets go  
Ooh, but my heart is sayin' no  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
Just come and set me free, baby  
And I'll be with you  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle baby)  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me (If you wanna be with me)  
I can make your wish come true  
Just come and set me free baby  
And I'll be with you  
  
I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Come come, come on and let me out
