Let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set 'em up, set 'em up we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress babe, I'll wear a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky  
  
All our scribbled love dreams  
Lost or thrown away  
Never miss the shuffle on an overflowin' day  
When love needs a transfusion  
Shoot it full of wine  
Fishin' for a good time  
Starts with throwin' in your line  
  
Let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set 'em up, set 'em up we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress babe, I'll wear a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky
