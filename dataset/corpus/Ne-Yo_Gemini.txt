Oh! She's a queen, she's a...  
She's a dream, she's a headache  
More than a normal cat could ever take  
But little momma fits me perfect  
And inside I glow!  
She's as mean as a daemon, but sweet as an angel  
Don't know if I wanna kiss her or strangle  
So many different size, different angles  
That's just modern love!  
  
Bridge:  
I'm fixing... difficult, easy  
Doesn't matter, she's the one I need!  
She's the one I need!  
Love is my... one she is right here  
I'll be hers forever happily (ever happily)!  
  
Chorus:  
Gemini, I'm love with you my Gemini  
Baby, you stay at the top of my mind  
I'm holding up to your love, and girl I won't let go!  
My Gemini, stay by my side, cause baby this time love never dies  
I'm holding up to your love,  
  
and girl I won't let go, my Gemini!  
  
Uh,... fake us a fantasy, but the...  
You're everything and nothing, all in one (all in one)  
And I could love you and hate you like one at the same time  
Two size of the same beautiful dime  
I will admit it can be confusing  
Baby, but it's so much fun!  
  
Bridge:  
I'm fixing... difficult, easy  
Doesn't matter, she's the one I need!  
She's the one I need!  
Love is my... one she is right here  
I'll be hers forever happily (ever happily)!  
  
Chorus:  
Gemini, I'm love with you my Gemini  
Baby, you stay at the top of my mind  
I'm holding up to your love, and girl I won't let go!  
My Gemini, stay by my side, cause baby this time love never dies  
I'm holding up to your love,  
And girl I won't let go, my Gemini!
