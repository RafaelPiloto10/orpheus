One, two, one, two, three, four  
  
Sweet and high at the break of dawn  
Simple tune that you can hum along too  
I remember there was a time  
When I used to sing for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Do do do, do do do  
Do do do, do do do  
Do do do, do do do  
  
I used to sing for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Knew all the words to the popular songs  
With the radio on full volume  
I remember there was a time  
When I used to sing for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to sing for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Forget the chorus, you?re the bridge  
The words and music to everyday I?ve lived  
There?s nothing, I wouldn?t give  
For one more time, when I can sing for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Soft and low when the evening comes  
Holding you, sleeping in my arms  
I remember there was a time  
When I used to sing for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to sing for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to sing for you
