Where do I live  
Where is my wife?  
I am alone  
What's life worth living for?  
Where am I going and what am I looking towards?  
Where are my kids having their fights?  
Calling my name so I can kiss their sores  
  
I'm just a man on the run  
It's a bore  
  
So father can you tell me again  
Father can you tell me again that I'm livin'  
'Til I meet you on that day on the other side  
  
I'm internationally known  
With platinum and gold  
I've got millions sold  
But after the party, I'm left standing in the cold  
I would like to be a simple man  
I'd buy me a farm and live off the land  
Could a wife and some children be better than being in band?  
  
So father can you tell me again  
Father can you tell me again that I'm livin'  
'Til I meet you on that day on the other side  
  
On the other side  
  
So father can you tell me again  
Father can you tell me again that I'm livin'  
'Til I meet you on that day on the other side  
  
On the other side
