There's a fire starting in my heart,  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark  
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.  
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.  
See how I leave, with every piece of you  
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.  
There's a fire starting in my heart,  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark  
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless  
I can't help feeling...  
We could have had it all... (you're gonna wish you, never had met me)...  
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had
met me)  
And you played it... (tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (rollin in the
deep)  
Baby I have no story to be told,  
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.  
Think of me in the depths of your despair.  
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.  
The scars of your love, remind me of us.  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless  
I can't help feeling...  
We could have had it all... (you're gonna wish you never had met me)...
Rolling in the deep  
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had
met me)  
And you played it... (tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (rolling in the
deep)  
Could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep.  
You had my heart inside of your hand,  
But you played it to the beat.  
Throw your soul through ever ope door (whoa)  
Count your blessings to dins what you look for (whoa -uh)  
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)  
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.  
(You're gonna wish you... Never had met me)  
We could have had it all (tears are gonna fall... Rolling in the deep)  
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you... Never had met me)  
It all. (tears are gonna fall)  
It all  
It all (rolling in the deep)  
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you, never had met me)  
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had
met me)  
And you played it... (tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (rolling in the
deep)  
We could have had it all (you're wish you never had met me)  
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had
met me)  
But you played it  
You played it.  
You played it.  
You played it to the beat
