I never meant to cause you any sorrow  
I never meant to cause you any pain  
I only wanted one time to see you laughing  
I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain  
  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
I only wanted to see you bathing in the purple rain  
  
I never wanted to be your weekend lover  
I only wanted to be some kind of friend, hey  
Baby, I could never steal you from another  
It's such a shame our friendship had to end  
  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
I only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain  
  
Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changin'  
It's time we all reach out for something new, that means you too  
You say you want a leader, but you can't seem to make up your mind  
And I think you better close it and let me guide you to the purple rain  
  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
If you know what I'm singin' about up here, come on raise your hand  
Purple rain, purple rain  
I only want to see you, only want to see you in the purple rain
