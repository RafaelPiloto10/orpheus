What is it children that falls from the sky?  
Tayi, taya, tayi, aye ya.  
Mannah from Heaven from most high,  
Food from the Father, tayi, taye ya.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the grief.  
  
Peace to your brother, give and take heed,  
Tayi, taya, it left two feet.  
One foot extended, snake to the ground,  
Wave of the Earth, one turn around.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again,shake out the grief, babe.  
  
Stretch out your arms now dip and sway,  
Fruit of thy bird, tayi, taya.  
Threw off your shoe, haul off the sow,  
Dust off the words that shape from the tale.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.  
  
Here we are, Father, here, Holy Ghost,  
Bread of your bread, host of your host.  
We are the tears that fall from your eyes,  
Word of your word, cry of your cry.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again.  
We shall live again, we shall live.  
  
What is it, Father, in your eye,  
What is this grave sign, eyes to cry.  
Blood of my baby, well, just what I need.  
What is it, hide me, way off to speed.  
  
Who is it, Father, holy that night?  
What is it, Father, that moves to the right?  
What is it, Father, isn't it pain?  
What is it, Father, that shapes from your main?  
  
What is it, Father, supposed to be brave?  
A lot of questions, the right to live  
What is it, baby, I can't do.  
Your mama loves you, I'm dying, too.  
  
I won't forget you, never lie  
I'll always love you till I die
