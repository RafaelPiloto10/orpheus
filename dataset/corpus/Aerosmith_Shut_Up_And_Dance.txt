Talk is cheap, shut up and dance  
Don't get deep, shut up and dance  
Love has got me down  
The weight is all around  
So you lend a hand to peace on earth  
Here's my piece, now what's it worth  
Yea, but it's all right  
When you can't define the crime  
Then life ain't worth a dime  
When they take away everything you got  
And they rub your nose in the funky spot  
Not without a fight  
When you work your fingers to the bone  
And what does that get you--nothing  
If in a crowd of people  
You're still alone I hope that tells you something  
The road to heaven is paved in hell  
And it makes you wonder  
Why you're here at all  
Check out the shape of your circumstance  
He wears the dress and she wears the pants  
Here comes Jill and she needs romance  
But you can't do jack so shut up and dance!  
Sex is like a gun  
You aim, you shoot, you run  
When you're splittin' hairs with Mr. Clean  
It' like gettin' head from a guillotine  
And the night has just begun  
Talk is cheap, shut up and dance  
Don't get deep, shut up and dance
