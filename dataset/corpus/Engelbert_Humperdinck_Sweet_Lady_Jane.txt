Tonight we're listening to the sweetest song  
Tonight the melodies go on and on  
We'll dream of love and the days gone by  
Then we sail to dawn  
  
And the lights of love will feel the sky  
Nobody loves you like I do, sweet lady Jane  
Nobody feels the way I do, may I explain  
I'll jump a train, I'll steal an airplane  
To be with you  
  
I'll fight a samuraj if he made you cry  
Am I getting through ?  
  
Tonight, I watched the people standing still  
Tonight, it's almost like I want them there  
I don't mind a bit  
  
You're a, just as long as I know the lady will be going home with me  
Nobody loves you quite the same  
Nobody loves you more, my lady Jane
