If you don't believe what I say  
You won't believe I'm not that way  
And I never meant to turn the hurt around  
I would be a fool to lose the love I'd found  
And if you take me back, I'll let you know  
  
I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be  
You're the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me  
  
If you heard the whole thing before  
Then once again, I'll tell you more  
I would be a fool to ever let you go  
Oh I had to go away to finally know  
How much I need you back, I need your love  
  
I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be  
You're the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be  
You're the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me  
Come back to me, come back to me  
I'll take you back, if you come back to me  
Come back to me  
  
If you come back to me  
Come back to me, come back to me  
I'll take you back  
If you come back to me, come back to me  
  
(stronger, stronger) stronger than before  
I will love you even more  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (stronger, stronger)  
You're the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me,  
Come back to me, come back to me  
  
(stronger, yeah) I'll be stronger than before,  
I will love you even more  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (stronger, stronger)  
By the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me,  
Come back to me, come back to me  
  
(stronger, yeah) I'll be stronger than before,  
I will love you even more  
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back  
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (oh yeah, yeah)  
You're the light inside of me  
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me,  
Come back to me, come back to me
