Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Ambition? ha!  
If all i've heard is true,  
There's nothin' much i can do  
To change the world, it's irreversible.  
But in what it lacks,  
It's got a taste that smacks of somethin' irresistible.  
  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
  
Submission? yes!  
Now i won't name names, and a secret's a secret,  
But a hint's a hint or a clue.  
You really want to know, you really want to go,  
There's only two things you got to do.  
  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
  
Mother, mother.  
Mother, mother.  
Mother, mother.  
  
My mission? ah, yes!  
Everybody hear? everybody here,  
It's a fate i all agree.  
Sometimes you win, i never lose,  
To me it's no mystery.  
  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.
