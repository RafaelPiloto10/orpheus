I woke up this morning with these certified blues,  
They sure been stalking me 'round.  
So down tonight I couldn't tie my shoes.  
They about to drop me in the ground.  
  
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine.  
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind.  
These certified blues are gonna take their time.  
  
I've been living here, way down South,  
A place that I want to stay.  
Been working hard just to feed my mouth.  
Just can keep them blues away.  
  
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind.  
These certified blues are gonna take their time.  
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine.  
  
You say you're feeling bad and you don't know why.  
You're broke and your woman been lying.  
And just one thing before I'm fired,  
The blues have just been certified.  
  
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine.  
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind.  
These certified blues are gonna take their time.
