Well I worked hard and I got lots of money  
Well I tried hard but I don't want to stay  
Yeah I've seen too much trouble, I felt too much pressure bubble  
I knew there had to be a better way  
  
I wouldn't hide if you thought I was worth it  
You'd smack me down when I misbehave  
But everybody knows that I've got flunkies here in tow  
To clean up all the messes that I've made  
  
I'm going over the cliff  
I'm going over the cliff  
And it's hard to tell if life is a burden or a gift  
Yeah I'm going over the cliff  
  
Forgive me or forget me everybody  
Well I guess I always had this honest streak  
Yeah I'm sick of all the yawning, the bitching, and the bawling  
I'm sick of feeling powerless and weak  
  
Please don't call me cool just call me
