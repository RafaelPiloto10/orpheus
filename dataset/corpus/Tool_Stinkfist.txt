Something has to change.  
Un-deniable dilemma.  
Boredom's not a burden  
Anyone should bear.  
Constant over stimulation numbs me  
And I wouldn't have  
It any other way.  
It's not enough.  
I need more.  
Nothing seems to satisfy.  
I don't want it.  
I just need it.  
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.  
Finger deep within the borderline.  
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.  
Relax, turn around and take my hand.  
I can help you change  
Tired moments into pleasure.  
Say the word and we'll be  
Well upon our way.  
Blend and balance  
Pain and comfort  
Deep within you  
Till you will not want me any other way.  
It's not enough.  
I need more.  
Nothing seems to satisfy.  
I don't want it.  
I just need it.  
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.  
Knuckle deep inside the borderline.  
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.  
Relax. Slip away.  
Something kinda sad about  
The way that things have come to be.  
Desensitized to everything.  
What became of subtlety?  
How can it mean anything to me  
If I really don't feel anything at all?  
I'll keep digging till  
I feel something.  
Elbow deep inside the borderline.  
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.  
Shoulder deep within the borderline.  
Relax. Turn around and take my hand.
