You came looking for the answers  
To some questions on his mind  
Seeking truth and understanding  
In the hope that he would find  
A way to better serve his brothers  
And his sisters in the sun  
Sharing all that he has given  
Giving all to everyone  
  
Come and listen to the story  
Of a journey once begun  
Of a people and their plenty  
And their season in the sun  
And how they gave themselves to symbols  
And things that they could hold  
Living lives in desperation  
In the fear of letting go  
  
It amazes me  
And I know the wind will surely one day  
Blow it all away  
It amazes me  
And I'm so very grateful that you made the world this way  
  
For our plans have come together now  
Where do we go from here  
Will our differences divide us  
Must we always live in fear  
For there are things that we must move through  
Some things to cast aside  
But our father watches over us  
Our mother will provide  
  
It amazes me  
And I know the wind will someday surely  
Blow it all away  
It amazes me  
And I'm so very grateful that you made the world this way  
  
It amazes me  
It amazes me  
It amazes me
