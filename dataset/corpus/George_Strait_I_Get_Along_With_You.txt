I don't get along  
With people who aren't kind  
I don't get along  
With folks with only money on their minds  
  
And I don't get along with someone  
Who's always trying to tell me what to do  
But on and on  
I get along with you  
  
Well I don't like  
People always tellin' me that I should change  
They get simple lives  
and they think they've got my life to rearrange  
  
But they don't understand  
Exactly what love boils down to  
Cause on and on  
I get along with you  
  
Well all it takes to please me  
Is waking in the morning feeling you by my side  
And all I ever needed  
Is knowin' that I'm needed in your life  
  
I may not do  
All the things that other people want me to  
But on and on  
I'll get along with you.  
  
Yeah on and on  
I'll get along with you.
