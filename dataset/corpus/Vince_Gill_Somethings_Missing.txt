The street looks different tonight  
Something has changed  
I had this picture in mind  
But it's just not the same  
  
Had this great expectation  
About a heart that's free  
I thought that's what I wanted  
Would be waiting for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby something's missing tonight  
Something ain't feeling right  
Baby something's wrong and I'm so confused  
Baby something's missing inside  
Something I can't find in the night  
I finally realized what I'm missing is you  
  
In this crowd of old friends  
Why do I feel alone  
I thought I'd fall back in step  
This is where I belong  
  
I thought that freedom was a voice  
Calling from the dark  
Now I see I was only free  
When you were in my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I thought that freedom was a voice  
Calling from the dark  
Now I see I was only free  
When you were in my heart  
  
[Chorus]
