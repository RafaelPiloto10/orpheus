Away in a manger  
No crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Lay down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky  
Look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The candles are glowing the baby awakes  
The little Lord Jesus  
No crying he makes  
I love you Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh  
  
Be near me Lord Jesus  
I ask you to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children  
In your tender care  
And fit us for heaven to live with you there
