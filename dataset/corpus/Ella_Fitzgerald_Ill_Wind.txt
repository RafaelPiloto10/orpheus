Blow ill wind, blow away, find my love today  
You're blowin' me no good, no good  
Go ill wind, go away, skies are oh, so gray  
Around my neighborhood and that's no good  
  
You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'  
Ain't that a shame  
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up  
From out of nowhere, when loves to blame  
  
So ill wind, blow away, find my love today  
You're blowin' me no good, no good, no good
