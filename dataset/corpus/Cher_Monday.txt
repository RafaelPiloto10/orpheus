MONDAY  
WRITER SONNY BONO  
  
  
Monday knows what it's all about  
She's the kind of girl that can do without  
She was mature at sixteen years  
She grew up fast she was raised on tears  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
Her ma was wind and her pa was rain  
She made her home in an empty train  
Her clothes were patched  
And shoes were worn  
She played with the sun  
And fought with the storm  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She bought a book and learned to read  
So no one could learnt what she heard  
She even ate a hershey bar  
To make her kisses sweeter  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She wonder by night  
When the sun was disarray  
Cause every one notice her in the day  
She wrote in her book  
That a flower is good  
But why is a weed so misunderstood  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She learned how to sing  
And she learned how to pray  
She learned it all in one short day  
But she never learned black from white  
She never even learn how to fight  
Do do do do- do do do do  
Do do do do- do do do do  
Do do do do- do do do do
