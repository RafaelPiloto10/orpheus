In the industry you see I keep a yellow tape  
Got the microphone because we want to be free  
Never oppress, nor to relay your stress  
? Ability, but now you're put to the test  
I run a set in the cool atmosphere  
Don't worry about my? Or the car that I steer  
The material pressure is just a digressor  
Be livin' my life for me because you struggle with pressure, uh  
  
You know!  
You know the mindset's a threat  
You know!  
You know the mindset's a threat  
You know!

Bringin' in the new lifestyle in 1991 now  
With a rrrrrang 'em up in style we're bringin' it deep, yo  
Now bring it down  
Aw, shit  
  
Listen to what I'm sayin'  
Materialism I'm slayin'  
Chasin' a? 'cause you know what I mean  
It's the system your obeyin  
Throwin' it like a catcher  
You say what you think you?  
?? Go!  
I run a set in the cool atmosphere  
Don't worry about my? Or the car that I steer  
The material pressure is just a digressor  
Be livin' my life for me because you struggle with pressure, uh  
  
(You know!)  
Yeah!

In the new sound!  
(You know!)  
Ease up!
