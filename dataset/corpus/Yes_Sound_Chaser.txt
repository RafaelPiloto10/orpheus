Faster moment spent spread tales of change within the sound  
Counting form through rhythm electric freedom  
Moves to counter-balance stars expound our conscience  
All to know and see  
The look in your eyes  
  
Passing time will reach as nature relays to set the scene  
New encounters spark a true fruition  
Guiding lines we touch them  
Our bodies balance out the waves  
As we accelerate our days  
To the look in your eyes  
  
From the moment I reached out to hold  
I felt a sound  
And what touches our soul slowly moves as touch rebounds  
And to know that tempo will continue lost in trance of dances  
As rhythm takes another turn  
As is my want I only reach  
To look in your eyes  
  
Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha  
Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha  
Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha
