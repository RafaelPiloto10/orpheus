I'm trading my sorrows  
I'm trading my shame  
I'm laying them down for the joy of the lord  
  
I'm trading my sickness  
I'm trading my pain  
I'm laying it down for the joy of the lord  
  
We say yes lord yes lord yes yes lord  
Yes lord yes lord yes yes lord  
Yes lord yes lord yes yes lord amen  
  
I'm pressed but not crushed persecuted but not abandoned  
Struck down but not destroyed  
I am blessed beyond the curse for his promise will endure  
That his joy's gonna be my strength  
Though the sorrow may last for the night  
His joy comes with the morning
