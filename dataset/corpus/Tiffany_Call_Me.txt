Color me your color, baby  
Color me your car  
Color me your color, darling  
I know who you are

I know where you're coming from  
Call me on the line  
Call me, call me any anytime  
Call me, my love, you can call me any day or night  
Call me!  
Cover me with kisses, baby  
Cover me with love  
Roll me in designer sheets

Emotions come, i don't know why  
Cover up love's alibi  
Call me on the line  
Call me, call me any anytime  
Call me oh my love  
When you're ready we can share the wine  
Call me  
Ooh, he speaks the languages of love  
Ooh, amore, chiamami (chiamami)  
Oo, appelle-moi, mon cherie (appelle-moi)  
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, anyway!  
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, any day, anyway!  
Call me my love  
Call me, call me any anytime  
Call me for a ride  
Call me, call me for some overtime  
Call me my love  
Call me, call me in a sweet design  
Call me, call me for your lover's lover's alibi  
Call me on the line  
Call me, call me any anytime
