You got weapons of mass seduction  
If I was broke I'd give you half of nothing  
Or give it all then I give you more  
I'm no decorator but the writing's on the wall  
Winter summer fall, April, May and June  
You shot me through the heart but I don't have a wound  
You got a good aim cause I could've sworn I moved  
When it comes to relationships I don't have a clue  
  
Love at first sight I don't know I zoom  
You put a hit on me ba da bing ba da boom  
If this is pain let me hurry up and let me suffer  
What doesn't kill me should make my love tougher  
I'm tough now, whassup now  
Fire at me I swear I won't duck down

No need to ask if I'm ready, yes

And we gon' do it big although we just met  
I was just being fresh yeah I know I'm a mess  
But I like spontanuity, continuity  
Let it flow let it flow... Just sit with me  
And I'm not pressing charges  
Don't want you to ricochet and hit another target  
You take me to the edge, right up to the margin  
All I see is fireworks I can feel it sparking  
Hope you keep me at the centre of your bullseye  
And you know it's more benefits or full time  
You are everything and more
