Let's not drag this out  
Everything's in motion  
Though I've only ever loved you kind  
And with devotion  
I remember when I met you  
And even from the start  
I thought one day you'd probably just come home  
And break my heart  
  
It's funny what you know  
And still go on pretending  
With no good evidence  
You'll ever see that happy ending  
  
You  
Looking for your distance  
And sensing my resistance  
You had to do your will  
  
I  
Had to learn the hard way  
We were just an empty dream too big  
For hope alone to fill  
  
I know I'm a dreamer  
(i know that I'm a)  
So I'll give you that  
(dreamer)  
Still I hope I'm more than just a place  
(still I hope I'm more)  
You laid your hat  
(than a place you laid your hat)  
You're a land of secrets  
(you are its only)  
Its only citizen  
(citizen)  
And though I paid my dues  
(though I paid)  
I was never allowed in  
(i was never allowed in)  
And so I am a stranger  
(so I am a stranger)  
Especially today  
(especially today)  
As I get sad and lonely  
And you get your way  
  
You  
Were looking for your distance  
And sensing my resistance  
You had to do your will  
  
I  
I had to learn the hard way  
That we were just an empty dream too big  
For hope alone to fill  
  
Holding on for change I know  
We never stood a chance  
(no we never stood a chance)  
So I could only wait  
And watch you slip right through my hands  
(watch you slip right through my hands)  
  
You  
Were always looking for your distance  
And sensing my resistance  
You had to do your will  
  
I  
I had to learn the hard way  
We were just an empty dream too big  
For hope alone to fill
