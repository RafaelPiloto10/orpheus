I just wanna dance the night the night away  
Go ahead and make my day Mister DJ  
  
Honeys if you're gay  
Burn it up like a gay parade  
Honeys if you're straight  
Pump it up, take it all the way  
Intoxicated, emancipated, unapologetic  
Is what I am today  
Light me up  
  
Make the night go on and on and on  
You know we go on and on and on  
Make the night go on and on and on  
I'm living up my life until the day I die  
Don't need a lullaby  
  
Music got me sweating hard I feel my heart  
Thumping like an 808 uh huh OK  
If you wanna mess with us  
Sink you with a counter-punch  
  
Honeys if you're gay  
Burn it up like a gay parade  
Honeys if you're straight  
Pump it up, take it all the way  
Intoxicated, emancipated, unapologetic  
Is what I am today  
Light me up  
  
Make the night go on and on and on  
You know we go on and on and on  
Make the night go on and on and on  
I'm living up my life until the day I die  
Don't need a lullaby
