So sad  
Watch good love go bad  
Smoke from a distance  
Fire burning me  
Oh, babe, the heaven can't wait  
I need these hints  
I'm feeling, my heart is appealing  
  
Sweet lady sheila  
Do you? Do you really want me?  
Sophisticated lady want me  
Sweet little Sheila  
Do you? Do you really love me?  
She's a different baby to me  
  
I only want Sheila  
Oh my Sheila  
Oh, she's precious  
Like the sun  
I only want Sheila  
Oh, my Sheila  
Oh she's foolish  
And most fun  
  
Oh, babe  
For the promise you made  
Be careful they've got storms, you're afraid  
Oh, babe  
Don't say it's too late  
Words can't express my feelings, being  
Believing
