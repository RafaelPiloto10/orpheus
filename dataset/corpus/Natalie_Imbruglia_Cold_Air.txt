Waiting for the last leaf to fall  
Can I hear a cry for a dead man to crawl?  
Asleep like stones in the well  
Empty as you leave your dry seashell  
  
Never seen you come this far  
Never thought I'd hope this hard  
  
(Like air) Always looking down upon yourself  
(Like air) You live two feet above yourself  
(Somewhere) We will always be in parallel  
(Out there) It's a place without a hope in hell  
(Like air)  
  
Haven't made a sound all week  
Tryin' to gather up some promises to keep  
I watched as the icicles fell  
Pinned to the bottom or drowning, it's hard to tell  
  
You may be human after all (I've never seen you come far)  
Must you build yourself so tall  
  
(Like air) Always looking down upon yourself  
(Like air) You live two feet above yourself  
(Somewhere) We will always be in parallel  
(Out there) It's a place without a hope in hell  
(Like air)  
  
Tryin' to wash your trace off my skin  
Cover up the footprints I've been walkin' in  
It's easier to cut you cold  
You can keep your waste of space, I'm halfway home  
  
You may be human after all (I've never seen you come far)  
Must you build yourself so tall  
  
(Like air) Always looking down upon yourself  
(Like air) You live two feet above yourself  
(Somewhere) We will always be in parallel  
(Out there) It's a place without a hope in hell  
(Like air)
