Honey why you calling me so late?  
It's kinda hard to talk right now.  
Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?  
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud  
  
Well, my girl's in the next room  
Sometimes I wish she was you  
I guess we never really moved on  
It's really good to hear your voice say my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
It's funny that you're calling me tonight  
And, yes, I've dreamt of you too  
And does he know you're talking to me  
Will it start a fight  
No I don't think she has a clue  
  
Well my girl's in the next room  
Sometimes I wish she was you  
I guess we never really moved on  
It's really good to hear your voice say my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel

With the lips of an angel  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
Honey why you calling me so late?
