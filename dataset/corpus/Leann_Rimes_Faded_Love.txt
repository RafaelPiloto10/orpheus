As I look at the letters  
That you wrote to me  
It's you that I am thinking of  
As I read the lines  
That to me were so dear  
I remember our faded love  
  
I miss you darlin' more and more everyday  
As Heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat I still think of you  
And remember our faded love  
  
As I think of the past  
And all the pleasures we had  
As I watch the mating of the doves  
It was in the springtime  
That you said good-bye  
And I remember our faded love  
  
I miss you darlin' more and more every day  
As Heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat I still think of you  
And remember our faded love  
  
And remember our faded love
