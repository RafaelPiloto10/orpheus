No need for you to set alone,  
Just waiting by your telephone  
Cause I ain't gonna call you any more.  
Oh I gave you love and you broke my heart,  
And you cheated on me from the start.  
And now I ain't gonna love you any more.  
  
[Chorus]  
I mean I ain't gonna love you any more,  
I know I couldn't love you as before.  
So I'm gonna tell you goodbye,  
Don't mind these tears there in my eyes  
Cause I ain't gonna love you any more  
  
My darlin' I just worship you,  
And look what you have loved me through.  
You left me with a heart so sick and sore.  
  
Oh you're the one that was unfair,  
It wasn't in you to play square.  
And now I ain't gonna love you anymore.  
  
[Chorus]
