(sylvester)  
Sitting here alone  
Drinking from an empty can of beer  
Wishing you were here  
Think I hear the bell  
Must be my imagination  
Hoping you'll appear  
Are you feeling well  
Would you write a letter just to say  
Had a lovely day  
I never realized  
How lonely I would be without you  
I guess I'll pull down the blind  
I've finished all the wine  
I guess I'll pull down the blind  
I feel I'm feeling fine  
Had a busy day brought in the milk  
And saw the folks next door  
Who could ask for more  
Tomorrow leaves today  
I look at a photograph of you and me  
How's the family  
I guess I'll pull down the blind  
I've finished all the wine  
I guess I'll pull down the blind  
I feel I'm feeling fine
