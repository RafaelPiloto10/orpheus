Would you hold onto my hand when I get lonely  
Could I come to you whenever I'm in need  
Would you always have a place for me to lay my body down  
Would you be my lady in the morning would you be my lady  
Would you walk with me across the bridges I forgot to burn  
Could you face the future lookin' at my past  
If I took the time to teach you all the things you need to learn  
Be my lady in the evening would you be my lady  
  
Does it matter to you that you're not my first love  
Would you let a thing like that stand in your way  
If I said you was the woman that could ease my troubled mind  
Would you be my lady when I need you would you be my lady  
Would you walk with me across the bridges I forgot to burn  
Could you face the future lookin' at my past  
If I took the time to teach you all the things you need to learn  
Would you always have a place for me to lay my body down
