If we leave here today  
We could be a thousand miles away  
Take to that road, see how far it goes  
And on that great ocean road  
Oh the country's in our bones  
All the trouble that you know  
Empties out as you go  
  
Oh walk with me, talk with me  
Tell me your stories  
I'll do my best to understand you  
You're flesh and blood, flesh and blood  
Don't refuse me your love  
More than words can express  
More than wealth or success  
  
Oh there's a thousand things to do  
So let's start here with me and you  
All the pain that you feel  
All the hurt that seems so real  
  
Oh come on, walk with me, talk with me  
Tell me your stories  
I'll do my very best to understand you  
You're flesh and blood  
  
You can't go on holding back the flooding river  
Keeping all that fear inside  
I understand how trouble haunts you  
It haunts me, too  
Yes, and I do know how you feel  
  
Oh there's a thousand things to do  
So let's start here with me and you  
Gonna take a little time  
Let's see what we can find  
  
Oh come on, walk with me, talk with me  
Tell me your stories  
I'll do my best to understand you  
  
Oh won't you walk with me, talk with me  
Tell me your stories  
I'll do my very best to understand you  
You're flesh and blood, flesh and blood  
You're flesh and blood
