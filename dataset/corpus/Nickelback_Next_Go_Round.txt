I wanna do it 'till the sun comes up  
Until we're both so good and sweaty  
That we can't stand up  
I wanna do it 'till we're both about to drop  
As long as we're tied up together  
Then we're never gonna stop  
  
I wanna go until the neighbors all complain  
Because they heard somebody screamin'  
And they think we're both in pain  
I wanna go so long your parents think you've died  
There gonna call the cops, the CIA, and then the FBI  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah,  
We're gonna love it when the lights go down  
Hold on here we go  
Yeah,  
We're gonna go until our legs give out  
Round and round we go  
Yeah,  
We're gonna do it hanging upside down  
Up and down we go  
Yeah,  
We're getting ready for the next go round  
Round and round we go  
  
So shut the windows, lock the doors, unplug the phone  
For all intents and purposes there ain't nobody home  
Then we can do it 'till the batteries are done  
And borrow two from the TV remote  
To turn this thing back on  
  
I wanna cover you with jello in the tub  
We can roll around for hours without ever comin' up  
I want you naked with your favorite heels on  
Slap John Deere across my ass  
And ride me up and down the lawn  
  
[Chorus: x2]
