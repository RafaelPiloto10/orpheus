I dreamt last night that he held me tight  
In a bar we knew way back when -  
Drinkin' sloe gin  
Oh, what a thrill  
Oh, what a sin  
  
Oh then the band played "Goodnight, Sweetheart"  
One more dance and we were ready to go.  
From the spark heel boppin'  
To the light of a steamed window.  
  
Oh, what a thrill  
Oh, what a sin.  
For a heart throb,  
Too long gone to cry again  
  
With them smoke-filled runaway kisses  
Some so young  
Chances are a million to one  
You got me startin' to believe  
That the thrill ain't never gone.  
  
Then I woke up in the dark to a different sound  
That was coming from my radio  
They were playin' somethin' else  
'sides "Go, Johnny, Go Go Go"  
  
So I turned to my sweetie, said "Roll over, Honey  
'Cause your mama's gonna show you some fun."  
I said "Roll over, Honey, cause  
The thrill ain't never gone."  
  
Oh, what a thrill  
Oh, what a sin.  
For a heart throb,  
Too long gone to cry again  
  
Those smoke-filled runaway kisses  
Some so young  
Chances are a million to one  
You got me startin' to believe  
That the thrill is never gone.
