When I wanted you, you would not reciprocate  
When I needed you, you would always show up late  
But things have changed, and I've got the upper hand  
You can run and I've got you eating out of my hand  
  
That's more like it, yeah  
That's more like it  
Make my dinner, bring it to me  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
Yeah, that's more like it  
Yeah, that's more like it  
I see where and when it happens  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
  
When my birthday came, you would not remember it  
When I talked to you, you were never listening  
But tables turn, and it's great to be on top  
Got you good to appreciate the good that you've got  
  
That's more like it, yeah  
That's more like it  
Make my dinner, bring it to me  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
Yeah, that's more like it  
Yeah, that's more like it  
I see where and when it happens  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
  
I like chocolate, and I like daisies  
Maybe you better write this down  
I love cashmere, and I want diamonds  
I'm ready for my massage right now, oh right now  
  
That's more like it, yeah  
That's more like it  
Make my dinner, bring it to me  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
Yeah, that's more like it  
Yeah, that's more like it  
I see where and when it happens  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
That's more like it  
That's more like it
