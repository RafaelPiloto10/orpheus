Gotta tell you a story  
On a cold winter's night  
You'll be sailin' for glory  
Before you know what is right  
  
So come over here now  
I got a vision for you  
It's my personal snake oil  
It's just something I do  
  
I'm the jester with no tears  
And I'm playing on your fears  
I'm a trickster smiling underneath this mask of love and death  
The eternal lie I've told  
About the pyramids of gold  
I've got you hooked at every turn your money's left to burn  
  
You'll be wanting a contract  
You'll be waiting a while  
I'd like to give you my contact  
But that isn't my style  
  
Well you only get one chance  
And it's too good to miss  
if i didn't lie to ya  
Then I wouldn't exist  
  
Greed, lust and anvy pride  
It's the same old, same old ride  
The smoke and mirrors visions that you see are just like me  
I'm a banker's face  
With just a letter out of place  
I know someone just like you knows someone just like me  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try  
  
So gone is the glory  
And gone is the gold  
Well if you knew the story  
How come, it has to be told  
  
Well you can say I'm a devil  
And I wouldn't say no  
But out here on the dark side  
Hey, on with the show  
  
So now my tale is told  
Big and bad and twice as bold  
This ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow  
There is no easy way  
For an honest man today  
Which is something you should think of as my lifeboat sails away  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try
