So what's with your kind  
You scavenge to find  
What makes you  
Sepreme in design  
Accuse you cause they had the fun  
So differently divine  
When my mind goes override  
Its so typical to capture anonyminty  
I choose the crowd to divide  
  
So you'll see I try  
(Jon) cannot ever displace  
You see I'm jaded at times  
(Jon) from nowhere leaving this place  
So you see me die  
(Jon) right in front of your face  
You see I'm jaded at times  
(Jon) from nowhere leaving this place  
  
They made us with a tool  
Then they taught us how to live  
We met the candyman  
He filled us with his contraband  
Then they scared us all away  
  
While your visiting your bubble of reality  
Salivating at the sound of the bells  
I'll be seducing you through your confession  
They've been the ones you've known forever  
Someones been lied to  
With all the rage caught us dismal  
At times we've known forever  
You've been denied of supervision  
Just a test tube life away  
How could you make believe that we've lived through circumsicion  
When it's right here next to me  
Friendships changed to time  
They'd never let us leave  
You took your time too late  
Missing what you've never had  
I'll be the only one who knows  
Just how we've been abused
