[Chorus]  
It's gotta be love  
That keeps us together  
It's gotta be a feeling from the heart  
It's gotta be love  
It must last forever  
Or I won't let the fire start  
It's gotta be love  
  
I don't have time for a part time love affair  
I can't pretend it's love when it's not really there  
So don't you lead me on if you don't really care  
It's gotta be real  
And I got a feeling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't just let you take my love and walk away  
And you must know that love is not a game I play  
So when you say you love me  
You better mean just what you say  
  
It's gotta be real  
And I got a feeling  
  
[Chorus: x2]
