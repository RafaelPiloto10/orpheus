They kill for a reason  
They'll strike anyone  
Doesn't matter how old or young  
Pay'em big cash, they'll give'em a slash  
Explain how it should be done  
A shot in the head  
The man cut in half  
Tortured 'till death  
You'll never see him back  
  
[Chorus:]  
Underground killers  
They are everywhere  
Killing for money  
They don't care  
Leaving their victims covered with blood  
Underground killers  
Will make a mess  
Whose killing plans have been set  
Murdering their victims without mercy  
They promise to make it worse  
Tell'em their next mission  
And they'll give'em death  
Burn him alive  
A high voltage jolt  
A stab in the back  
They pomise you'll see him dead  
  
[Lead]  
  
Slay the victim to death  
Dead bodies everywhere  
Brutality is their authority  
Killers are not afraid of death  
  
[Chorus:]  
Underground killers  
They are everywhere  
Killing for money  
They don't care  
Leaving their victims covered with blood  
Underground killers  
Will make a mess  
Whose killing plans have been set  
Murdering their victims without mercy  
They promise to make it worse  
More massacre for the long future generation  
Their customers are the only police source of information  
You've paid'em in full  
For the dirty job they've done  
Now you must die  
Like the other ones.
