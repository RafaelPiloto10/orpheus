Well did your baby leave you alone  
And with nobody now to call your own  
I know the feelin', I got the feelin'  
Oh it happened to me, yeah-yeah baby  
Well did your baby, yeah make you cry  
And did you cry now, till you thought you would die  
Well I know the feelin', I got the feelin'  
It happened to me (I'm gonna tell you 'bout it too)  
Did you ever, oh have the blues  
Say right from your hair child, to the bottom of your shoes  
Because you know now, down deep in your soul  
Hey that your baby don't love you no more, oh-oh-oh  
Would you crawl on your hands and knees  
And would you beg her, oh come back please  
Well I know the feelin', baby I got the feelin'  
It happened to me (Oh talk to me baby)
