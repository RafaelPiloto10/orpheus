When I saw you at the Cat Club  
You looked really kind of cool now  
Well come along with me 'cause  
We got a lot of things to do now  
  
You don't ever have to be lonely  
Just as long as you're here by my side  
You don't ever have to be lonely  
Just as long as you've nothing to hide  
  
Oohh...Oohh...  
Come along with me 'cause  
We're gonna have a real cool time  
  
Girl you're girl you know you're always in my mind  
You know girl you know I want you all the time  
Girl girl you know I want you all the time
