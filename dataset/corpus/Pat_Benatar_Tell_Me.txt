Why do I have these thoughts go through my head  
Do they come out of the air  
Suspicion always washes over me like a disease  
I cannot share I can't ignore the way you treated me sometimes  
So go ahead and convince me otherwise  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Tell me it's okay, that every thing's fine  
Show me that it's possible not to cry, swear that you'll  
Never leave and you'd rather die than hurt me  
Just tell me that every thing's gonna be fine  
  
Give me a reason why I should stay  
One I won't regret in the end  
This time say something I can believe  
Something you haven't used yet  
I can't ignore the way you treated me sometime  
So go ahead and convince me otherwise  
  
So many empty words were spoken here today  
So many promises I'd like to dream away  
Like verses whispered in some ancient ritual  
That accusations fly, but we are no closer to the truth
