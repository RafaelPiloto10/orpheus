Chronomentrophobia  
The fear of clocks  
The fear of time  
  
High as the cost of living  
I take what I've been given  
Pastor say "be strong"  
Ooh hey hey  
I ain't got time leave me alone  
  
I ain't got much time left  
I've got to funk you now  
  
[Chorus]  
Chronomentrophobia [Repeat: x8]  
  
Lord be having mercy on my soul  
I'm having the impression that my life goin' be a bowl  
Of cherries but its very hard for me to cope  
Got tired of being broke  
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope  
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds  
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head  
Born in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far  
Still battling in this racial war  
Trying to find solutions to the situation I'm facing  
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing  
Letting my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge  
Like dropping books lets stop the crooks  
From robbing you of your brains and such using welfare as a crutch  
I'm in it for good you into my hood you won't be finding much  
Hope that when I'm gone y'all remember this  
What we stood for "fuck that fame and that glitz"  
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending  
And got to be more careful know what corners you be bending  
Revelations getting impatient and now I'm dead  
Remember what I said I'm gone bow ya heads
