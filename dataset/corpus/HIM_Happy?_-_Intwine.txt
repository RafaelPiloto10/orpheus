isn't it strange,  
that the stars don't shine no more now since you're gone  
isn't it strange  
that we can't look back and see just what went wrong.  
  
i wanna know now where we are,  
should i pretend and let things be  
and knowing what you've done,  
could you come face to face with me  
  
isn't it strange  
that you told me one thing and suddenly changed your mind  
isn't it strange  
that you'd come here for me turn away and leave me behind  
  
now it feels like i'm drowning,  
feels like i'm drowning without you  
i know the feeling,  
cause i've felt this all before  
  
i hope you don't feel just like me,  
i hope you don't feel just like me  
i hope you don't feel just like me,  
i hope you're happy  
  
isn't it strange  
that the world seems to turn away when i try to explain  
why it's so strange  
that two can be as one yet not the same  
  
and it feels like i'm drowning,  
feels like i'm drowning without you  
i know the feeling,  
cause i've felt this all before  
and it feels like i'm dying,  
feels like i'm dying now i know the truth  
  
i hope you don't feel just like me,  
i hope you don't feel just like me  
i hope you don't feel just like me,  
i hope you're happy  
  
don't feel just like me,  
i hope you don't feel just like me  
i hope you don't feel just like me,  
i hope you're happy  
  
don't feel just like me,  
i hope you don't feel just like me  
fuck i hope you feel much worse than me,  
maybe not so happy  
  
not so happy, yeah,  
not so happy, yeah  
not so happy,  
welcome to my world  
  
not so happy, yeah,  
not so happy, yeah  
not so happy,  
welcome to my world
