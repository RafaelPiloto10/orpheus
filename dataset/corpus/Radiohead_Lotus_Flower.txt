I will shape myself into your pocket  
Invisible  
Do what you want  
Do what you want  
  
I will shrink and I will disappear  
I will slip into the groove and cut me off  
And cut me off  
  
There's an empty space inside my heart  
Where the weeds take root  
And now I'll set you free  
I'll set you free  
  
There's an empty space inside my heart  
Where the weeds take root  
So now I'll set you free  
I'll set you free  
  
Slowly we unfurl  
As lotus flowers  
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick  
Just to see what if  
Just to see what is  
I can't kick your habit  
Just to fill your fast ballooning head  
Listen to your heart  
  
We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice  
And while the cat is away  
Do what we want  
Do what we want  
  
There's an empty space inside my heart  
Where the weeds take root  
So now I'll set you free  
I'll set you free  
  
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick  
Just to see what if  
Just to see what is  
The bird lights float into my room  
  
Slowly we unfurl  
As lotus flowers  
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick  
I dance around the pit  
The darkness is beneath  
I can't kick your habit  
Just to feed your fast ballooning head  
Listen to your heart
