Staring up at the moonlight  
Looking up at the stars  
I'm alone and I just want to be with you  
But I don't know where you are  
  
Maybe I took you for granted  
So blind, I let your love slip away  
Now I'm missing you so much I can't stand it  
Please believe me when I say,  
  
After tonight, I never will be the same again  
This time I'm sure that nothing means more  
Than giving you all the love I can  
After tonight I promise, I'm gonna be a better man  
Just hold me tight, and I'll be all right  
After tonight  
  
Anticipating the moment  
When I can make love with you again  
Patience is a virtue I'm finding  
Very hard to understand  
  
After tonight, I will never be the same again  
This time I'm sure that nothing means more  
Than giving you all the love I can  
After tonight I promise, I'm gonna be a better man  
Just hold me tight, and I'll be all right  
After tonight
