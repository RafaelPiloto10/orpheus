Everybody all around the world  
Gotta tell you what I just heard  
There's gonna be a party all over the world  
  
I got a message on the radio  
But where it came from I don't really know  
And I heard these voices calling all over the world  
  
All over the world,  
Everybody got the word  
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight  
  
Everybody walkin' down the street  
Everybody movin' to the beat  
They're gonna get hot down in the you. S. A.  
(New York, Detroit, L. A.)  
  
We're gonna take a trip across the sea  
Everybody come along with me  
We're gonna hit the night down in gay Pareee  
  
All over the world,  
Everybody got the word  
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
London, Hamburg, Paris, Rome, Rio, Hong Kong, Tokyo  
L. A., New York, Amsterdam, Monte Carlo, Shard End and  
  
All over the world,  
Everybody got the word  
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight  
  
Everybody all around the world  
Gotta tell you what I just heard  
Everybody walkin' down the street  
I know a place where we all can meet  
Everybody gonna have a good time  
Everybody will shine till the daylight  
  
All over the world,  
Everybody got the word  
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight  
  
All over the world  
Everybody got the word  
All over the world  
Everybody got the word  
All over the world  
Everybody got the word
