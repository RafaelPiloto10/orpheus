Eddie holland, lamont dozier, and brian holland  
It's so hard lovin' you  
But I just can't let you go  
  
Little darlin', I love you  
Little darlin', I need you  
Little darlin', I want you  
Little darlin', got to have you  
  
And if it means givin' up my pride  
Oh, I'm gonna give it up, give it up  
There's always one who loves more than the other  
I don't mind, I don't mind  
I'm willin' to pay the price  
Have your love at any sacrifice  
  
Little darlin', I need you  
Little darlin', I love you  
Little darlin', I want you  
Little darlin', got to have you  
  
Only my pillow knows  
How many tears I've cried  
Only my heart knows  
The awful hurt I feel inside  
My life is so lonely  
Waitin' for you to love me only  
I'm willin', darlin'  
  
I'm willin' to pay the price  
Have your love at any sacrifice  
  
Little darlin', I need you  
Little darlin', I want you  
Little darlin', I love you  
Little darlin', I need you  
Little darlin', I want you  
Little darlin', got to have you  
  
Yeah, there was a time  
Way back in your life  
When I was the only one, only one  
You'd better let this fool back in  
Or you will be the lonely one  
Darlin', I love you  
Little darlin' I need you
