Somebody somewhere told me  
You were gonna break my heart  
Somebody somewhere told me  
You were gonna break me apart  
I didn't listen and I didn't care  
I didn't think that talk was anywhere  
I didn't listen and I didn't care  
Nobody told me 'bout your low down friends  
Somebody somewhere help me  
I got to find a brand new way  
Somebody somewhere help me  
I got to make a brand new way  
I didn't listen and I didn't know  
I didn't think it would hurt me so  
I didn't listen and I didn't know  
Nobody told me 'bout your low down friends  
Somebody somewhere help me  
I got to turn it, turn it 'round  
Somebody somewhere help me  
I got to get my feet on the ground  
I didn't listen and I didn't care  
I didn't think that talk was anywhere  
I didn't listen and I didn't know  
I didn't think it would hurt me so
