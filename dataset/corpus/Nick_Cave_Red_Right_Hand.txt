Take a litle walk to the edge of town  
Go across the tracks  
Where the viaduct looms,  
Like a bird of doom  
As it shifts and cracks  
Where secrets lie in the border fires,  
In the humming wires  
Hey man, you know  
You're never coming back  
Past the square, past the bridge,  
Past the mills, past the stacks  
On a gathering storm comes  
A tall handsome man  
In a dusty black coat with  
A red right hand  
  
He'll wrap you in his arms,  
Tell you that you've been a good boy  
He'll rekindle all the dreams  
It took you a lifetime to destroy  
He'll reach deep into the hole,  
Heal your shrinking soul  
Hey buddy, you know you're  
Never ever coming back  
He's a god, he's a man,  
He's a ghost, he's a guru  
They're whispering his name  
Through this disappearing land  
But hidden in his coat  
Is a red right hand  
  
You ain't got no money?  
He'll get you some  
You ain't got no car? He'll get you one  
You ain't got no self-respect,  
You feel like an insect  
Well don't you worry buddy,  
Cause here he comes  
Through the ghettos and the barrio  
And the bowery and the slum  
A shadow is cast wherever he stands  
Stacks of green paper in his  
Red right hand  
  
(Organ solo)  
  
You'll see him in your nightmares,  
You'll see him in your dreams  
He'll appear out of nowhere but  
He ain't what he seems  
You'll see him in your head,  
On the tv screen  
And hey buddy, I'm warning  
You to turn it off  
He's a ghost, he's a god,  
He's a man, he's a guru  
You're one microscopic cog  
In his catastrophic plan  
Designed and directed by  
His red right hand  
  
(Organ solo)  
  
Extra verse from dj Spooky Remix (From Scream 2 Soundtrack):  
He'll extend his hand, real slowly for a shake  
You'll see it coming toward you, real slowly for a shake  
(Grabbing at your peril buddy?) cause you know you ain't  
Getting near much as he will take.  
  
He's a...  
  
He's mumbling words you can't understand  
He's mumbling word behind his red right hand.
