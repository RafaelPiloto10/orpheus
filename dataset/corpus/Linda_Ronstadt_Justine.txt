This is the one about the girl, the girl who came to stay  
Oh but love came down like a hammer and it blew her away  
She's sliding down down down, no place to put her hands  
But she don't think of nothing but the boys in the hot sand no  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
Justine  
You know just what this kiss will mean to you  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
I wanted love explained, I had to know what you knew  
But the face of Aphrodite is a blank when it looks at you  
Your heart does its little tricks, your feelings burn right through  
But the cold wire edge of the whip is all that's left of you, oh no  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
Justine  
You know just what this kiss will mean to you  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
Oh no  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do  
Justine  
You know just what this kiss will mean to you  
Justine  
Don't forget about the little things our hearts do
