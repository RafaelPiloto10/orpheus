There's clothes all over the floor  
Don't remember them being here before  
Smell of perfume is in here, why's lipstick on the mirror  
And still I don't understand  
  
No pictures left in the hall  
There's three new holes in my wall  
Where the hell's my credit cards, why's my wallet in the yard  
And still I don't understand  
  
Well, now I guess I should've listened  
When you said you'd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other  
Why's love gotta be so tough  
  
Should see the look on my face  
My shit's all over the place  
Why's this happening to me, why'd you take both sets of keys  
And still I don't understand  
  
Well, now I guess I should've listened  
When you said you'd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other  
Why's love gotta be so tough  
  
Oh, and now I guess I should've listened  
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh, ahh-oh, ahh-ahh, ahh-oh, ahh-ahh  
  
There's clothes all over my floor  
I don't remember them being there before  
There are no candles in here, lipstick's still on my mirror  
And still I don't understand  
  
Oh, and now I guess I should've listened  
When you said you'd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other  
Why must love be so tough  
  
Well, now I guess I should've listened  
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh  
When you said you'd had enough  
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other  
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh  
Why's love gotta be so tough
