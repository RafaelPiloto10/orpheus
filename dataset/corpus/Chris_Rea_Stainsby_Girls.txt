Some girls used to kiss and run  
Never knew what they had done  
Some girls always wasted time  
Keep you hanging on the line  
Some loved horses and always stayed at home  
But a Stainsby girl loved the Rolling Stones  
  
Now some had games that you had to play  
Making rules along the way  
Strange attractions newly found  
Pride and passion kicked around  
Some girl stole your heart  
Like most girls do  
But a Stainsby girl, she could break it in two  
  
And I fell in love, I fell in love  
I fell in love with a Stainsby girl  
  
Deepest water Stainsby blue  
Running straight, and running true  
Names and faces fade away  
Memory here to stay  
  
Some girls steal your heart  
Most still do,  
But a Stainsby girl, she could break it in two  
  
I fell in love, I fell in love  
I fell in love with a Stainsby girl
