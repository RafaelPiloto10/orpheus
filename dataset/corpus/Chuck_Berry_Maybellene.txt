Maybellene  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
As I was motivatin' over the hill  
I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville.  
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road,  
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford.  
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five,  
She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
Pink in the mirror on top of the hill,  
It's just like swallowin' up a medicine pill.  
First thing I saw that Cadillac grille  
Doin' a hundred and ten gallopin' over that hill.  
Offhill curve, a downhill stretch,  
Me and that Cadillac neck by neck.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford,  
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more.  
It then got clody and it started to rain,  
I tooted my horn for a passin' lead  
The rain water blowin' all under my hood,  
I knew that was doin' my motor good.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
The motor cooled down, the heat went down  
And that's when I heard that highway sound.  
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead  
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.  
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still  
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.
