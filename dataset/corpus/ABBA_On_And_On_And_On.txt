I was at a party  
And this feller said to me  
Something bad is happening  
I'm sure you do agree  
People care for nothing  
No respect for human rights  
Evil times are coming  
We are in for darker nights?  
I said who are you  
To talk about impending doom?  
He got kinda wary  
As he looked around the room  
He said, I'm a minister  
A big shot in the state?  
I said I just can't  
Believe it, boy  
I think it's great  
Brother can you tell me  
What is right and what is wrong?  
He said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone  
  
Over in the corner  
I could see this other guy  
He was kinda flirty  
He was giving me the eye  
So I took advantage  
Of the fact that I'm a star  
Shook my hair and took  
A casual stroll up to the bar  
And as sure as hell  
This guy was coming up to me  
He said, who am I and  
Who are you and who are we  
What's our situation do  
We have some time for us?  
I said, I was not exactly  
Waiting for the bus  
He said, if you're going  
Somewhere can I come along?  
I said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone
