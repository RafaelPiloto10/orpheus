Daddy was a soldier he taught me about freedom  
Peace and all the great things that we take  
Advantage of  
Once I fed the homeless, I'll never forget  
I look upon thier faces as I treated them with  
Respect  
And  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
Life keeps on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
Momma was a lunitic, she liked to push my buttons  
  
She said I wasn't good enough, but I guess I  
Wasn't trying  
Never like school that much, they tried to teach  
Me better  
But I just wasn't hearing it because I thought I  
Was already pretty clever  
And  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
They keeps on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
They keep on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
What do you expect from me?  
What am I not giving you?  
What could I do for you to make me ok in your  
Eyes?  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
They keep on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
Life keeps on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
This is my Vietnam  
This is my Vietnam
