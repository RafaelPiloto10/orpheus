Yesterday, a child came out to wander  
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar  
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder  
And tearful at the falling of a star  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
Then, the child moved ten times 'round the seasons  
Skated over ten clear frozen streams  
Words like, "When you're older", must appease him  
And promises of someday make his dreams  
  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came,  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now  
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town  
And they tell him, "Take your time. It won't be long now.  
'Til your drag your feet to slow the circles down"  
  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty  
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true  
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty  
Before the last revolving year is through.  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return, we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and 'round and 'round  
In the circle game  
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game.
