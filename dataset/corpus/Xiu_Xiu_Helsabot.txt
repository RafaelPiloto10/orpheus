I did something bad  
I got in a fight  
About drugs  
Kicked him in the neck  
  
I am helsabot  
I am all you're not  
But you wish you were  
  
I am working hard  
Don't you laugh at me  
I am helsabot  
Alcohol fueled robot  
  
I take off my clothes  
Then I say to joe  
"do your pants ever just fall off?"  
A menage-et-trois' fine  
  
I am helsabot  
I am all you're not  
But you wish you were  
  
I am working hard  
Don't you laugh at me  
I am helsabot  
Alcohol fueled robot
