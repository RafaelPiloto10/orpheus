Any kind of fool with the will to live  
Tries to get it right with the one they're with  
But even though I give you special treatment  
You keep getting high juvenile delinquent  
  
And this is how it feels to be  
On the payroll company  
Your every scene is in the round  
And all the men are falling down  
  
Constantly harassed and misunderstood  
I'm the 'lost and found' of the neighbourhood  
And I am not a part of society  
So don't get off the ground just be with me  
  
And this is how it feels to be  
On the payroll company  
Your every scene is in the round  
And all the men are falling down  
  
I would brave the rainstorm in my car  
Maybe you can leave but you won't get far  
It wasn't just a dream it was much too good  
Just another day in the brotherhood  
  
And this is how it feels to be  
On the payroll company  
Your every scene is in the round  
And all the men are falling down  
  
And this is how it feels to be  
On the payroll company  
Your every scene is in the round  
We don't need to hang around
