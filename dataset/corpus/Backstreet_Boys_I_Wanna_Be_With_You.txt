I want to be with you  
It's crazy but it's true  
And everything I do  
I want to be with you  
  
I'd like to know your policy  
When it comes to me  
Like to know what's in your mind  
It's not easy to see  
I Know now what I feel  
And what to do  
I want to be with you  
And I'll be waiting  
Until you face the truth  
When the light is fadin'  
You know what I want to do  
  
I want to be with you  
It's crazy but it's true  
And everything I do  
I want to be with you  
  
Yeah everybody say  
Yeah, see you once again  
Yeah, everybody swing  
Yeah, everybody swing  
  
Wish you'd come and set me free  
So that I can see  
All the things I've left behind  
What's missin' in me  
I'm looking for a sign  
In the things you do  
I want to be with you  
And I'll be waitin'  
Until you face the truth  
When the light is fadin'  
You know what I want to do  
  
I want to be with you  
It's crazy but it's true  
And everything I do  
I want to be with you
