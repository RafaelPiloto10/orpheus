Trouble chasing me again  
Breaking down my best defense  
I'm looking  
God I'm looking for your  
  
Weary just won't let me rest  
And fear is filling up my head  
I'm longing  
God I'm longing for you  
But I will  
  
Find you in the place I'm in  
Find you when I'm at my end  
Find you when there's  
Nothing left of me to offer you  
Except for brokenness  
  
You lift me up  
You never leave me thirsty  
When I am weak  
When I'm lost and searching  
I find you on my knees  
  
So what if sorrow shakes my faith  
What if heartache still remains  
I'll trust you  
My god I'll trust you  
'Cause you are faithful  
And I will  
  
When my hope is gone  
When the fear is strong  
When the pain is real  
When the it's hard to heal.  
  
When my faith is shaken  
And my heart is broken  
And my joy is stolen  
God I know that you lift me up  
You never leave me searching
