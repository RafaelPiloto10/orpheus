Joy to the world  
Joy to the world  
Joy to the world  
  
Joy to the world  
The lord is come  
Let earth receive her king  
Let every heart prepare him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and heaven and nature sing  
  
Joy to the world  
The savior reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods  
Rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy  
  
Joy to the world  
Joy to the world  
Joy to the world  
Joy to the world  
  
Joy to the world  
The lord is come  
Let earth receive her king  
Let every heart prepare him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and heaven and nature sing  
  
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
