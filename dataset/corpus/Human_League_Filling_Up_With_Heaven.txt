Once there was a vision  
Once there was a glow  
Once there was a certainty  
No chance could overthrow  
Hope was scorched by summer  
Crushed and beaten down  
Once there was a winner  
Now there was a clown  
Without you life had seemed so  
But now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Now I'm filling up with Heaven  
No baby no baby no baby no  
Filling up  
No baby no baby baby baby no  
Filling up  
No baby no baby no baby no  
No baby no baby baby baby no  
All the fortune that my  
Luck had brought  
It couldn't even make me smile  
Without you life had seemed so  
A lonely hideaway my last resort  
All achievement infantile  
Now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Hey hey hey  
As the years had passed by  
I became more cynical  
All the magic had died  
My existence clinical  
Ow ow ow ow  
But now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Down down  
Down down  
Filling up  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Down down  
Down down  
Hey hey hey hey  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Woah woah woah woah  
Now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Down down  
Down down  
Filling up filling up  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Ow ow ow ow ow  
Woah woah woah  
Now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Without you life had seemed so  
Hostile  
Down down  
Down down  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Hey hey hey hey  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Down down  
Down down  
Filling up  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile
