Have a holly, jolly Christmas,  
It's the best time of the year  
I don't know if there'll be snow,  
But have a cup of cheer.  
  
Have a holly, jolly Christmas,  
And when you walk down the street  
Say hello to friends you know  
And everyone you meet.  
  
Oh, ho, the mistletoe  
Is hung where you can see,  
Somebody waits for you,  
Kiss her once for me.  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas,  
And in case you didn't hear,  
Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year  
  
Oh, ho, the mistletoe  
Is hung where you can see,  
Somebody waits for you,  
Kiss her once for me.  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas,  
And in case you didn't hear,  
Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year
