Isn't it a pity  
Now, isn't it a shame  
How we break each other's hearts  
And cause each other pain  
  
How we take each other's love  
Without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back  
Isn't it a pity  
  
Some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
When not too many people  
Can see we're all the same  
  
And because of all their tears  
Their eyes can't hope to see  
The beauty that surrounds them  
Isn't it a pity  
  
Isn't it a pity  
Isn't is a shame  
How we break each other's hearts  
And cause each other pain  
  
How we take each other's love  
Without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back  
Isn't it a pity  
  
Forgetting to give back  
Isn't it a pity  
Forgetting to give back  
Now, isn't it a pity  
  
[Repeat: x6]  
What a pity  
What a pity, pity, pity  
What a pity  
What a pity, pity, pity
