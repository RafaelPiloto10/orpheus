As I sit in my b-boy stance  
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants  
We finna enhance your brain, check it out  
Once upon a time not long ago  
When the player from the Pointe didn't have no flow  
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the sto'  
Caught a nigga slipping, but now I lay it to the flo'  
Just like carbon, cause I got the heat in my rhythm  
Momma nay not, never bragging just to stay knot  
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson  
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions  
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope  
But for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope  
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine  
Activity, my soliloquy, may be hard for some to swallow  
But so is cod liver oil  
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl  
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil  
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call  
  
[Chorus]  
Touched by the wheelz of steel  
Now show me how you feel  
Touched by the wheelz of steel  
Now show me how you feel  
  
It took your momma nine months to make it  
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it  
Cut that kronk clean up I did, but I did so not safely  
Don't want no AIDS, no claps, or no rabies  
Yo, we take no shit, like, stopped up commodes  
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks  
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle  
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'  
But not for long cause we got a better sack to serve  
Trying to take you other people for your rims at the curb  
Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go head, go head  
More head for me, while you ride to the beat  
Drop, like Tears, like For Fears, you know  
Shout Shout let it all out, just for my peers  
And pupils who feel like it's time to unwind  
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Okay, like this, yeah yeah  
One time for my boy doing King shit  
Two times for Legit and it don't quit  
Three times for my folks in the drop top  
Four times OutKast and it don't stop  
One time for my cause doing Queen things  
Dead fresh to the teeth eating chicken wings  
Three times for my guhls in the beauty shop  
Four times OutKast and it don't stop  
  
[Chorus]
