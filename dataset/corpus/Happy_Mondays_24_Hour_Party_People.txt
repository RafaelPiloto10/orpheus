Twenty four hour party people

So why don't you join in?

I can see you through the door  
You been chewing bread and water  
And there's a grudge on you  
You know you not ought not to have  
You've been running around the racetrack  
You've been running around the racetrack  
Put that mudder to bed to bed

With the twenty four hour party people plastic face can't smile the whites out  
Cause I have to wait for you to conduct  
Press the pause of the self destruct
