You know your favorite old pair of shoesthe ones with the hole in the toe you
won't loseyour favorite record that's all scratched and usedbut still you love
to play when your feeling blue  
That faded rose that's all dried outthose Bukowski poems we couldn't live
withoutyour high school picture when you had wild hairthat stormy day on the
beach that got us here  
Oh, you better believe there's just one thing you needcan't you see...  
Chorus: It's just me babyit's just me babyif there's just one thing that you
should keepin your book of dreamsit's just me baby  
Just like a shadow 10 feet tallstanding right behind you should you falli'll
be the one to hold you up to walkwhen this wicked world makes us want to crawl  
And if your waves should ever break at seai'll be there waiting, I'm that
sandy beachi'm that same old dog, scratching those same fleasi'll be by your
side, you can count on me  
Chorus  
It's just me babywhat's it gonna take to make you seewhat's it gonna take 'til
you believe in me  
Oh, how my smile fades and my heart just breaksevery time you go away  
Chorus  
It's just me babywhat's it gonna take to make you seewhat's it gonna take 'til
you believe in me  
And if someday some new memory comes alonglooking shiny new, feeling really
strongyou can tell him that I'll tell himhe can just move oni'm a fighter -
I've been fighting for you all night longit's just me baby
