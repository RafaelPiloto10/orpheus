I looked up at the tallest building.  
Felt it falling down.  
  
I could feel my balance shifting.  
Everything was moving around.  
  
These streets so fixed and solid.  
Ah, shimmering haze.  
  
And everything I relied on disappeared.  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight from the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.  
  
All the strangers look like family.  
All the family look so strange.  
  
The only constant, I am sure of.  
Is this accelerating rate of change.  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight off the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.  
  
I stand here, watch you spinning.  
Until I am drawn in.  
A centripetal force.  
You pull me in.  
  
Pull me in.  
  
OVO  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight off the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.
