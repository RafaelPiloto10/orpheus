When the winds of ice are raging  
And the sun departs for night  
There's a thousand eyes upon you  
But no one sees your plight  
Oh no mercy hath the darkness  
No love or heavens rain  
You can feel the sound of anguish  
Hear the cries of screaming pain  
  
We are the guardians of the flame  
Masters of the ancient rites  
Our duty was ordained  
To protect the realm of light  
  
If you cross the gates of wisdom  
Beware of the outer sign  
Here the wolves of war are feasting  
And on who knows what they dine!  
Oh if your courage doth forsake you  
Invoke thy masters name  
We come with swords of fire  
To banish the profane  
  
Oh, we are the ones who check the forces of evil  
Flames fly from our hands to engulf  
The bastard called sin  
War, rains through the skies  
Our wrath shakes the pillars of heaven, now  
The jackal is slain, fountains of blood drench the land  
Come light up the torch, we have returned victorious  
  
All's well in the world tonight  
Sweet dreams from the palace of light  
Sleep well, my children
