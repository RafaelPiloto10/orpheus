Candace: Mom, look, don't roll your eyes at me  
Mom, look, just come over and see  
Mom, look, it shouldn't be so hard  
Mom, look, they built it in the backyard  
Candace: Once they made it winter in June  
Linda: I didn't see it  
Candace: Built a rocket to the moon  
Linda: I didn't see it  
Candace: Mom, they cause me so much pain!  
Linda: Now, Candace...  
Candace: Once they even gave me Perry's brain  
Linda: Oh for crying out loud...  
  
Candace: They built a submarine, a time machine  
A haunted house that made me scream  
Drove cattle through the mall  
Built a giant bowling ball  
Blew me up to fifty feet  
A chariot dragged me down the street  
  
(Candace stops to catch her breath)  
(La la la la la la la la)  
  
Candace: Made their stupid clothes a fashion craze  
Shoelace tips a household phrase  
Shot me through a circus tent  
Always asked where Perry went.  
A lava flow destroy my face  
A giant roller derby race  
Thawed a caveman out of ice  
Built a roller coaster twice
