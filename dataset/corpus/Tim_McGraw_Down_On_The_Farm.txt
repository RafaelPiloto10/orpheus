Every Friday night there's a steady cloud of dust  
That leads back to a field filled with pickup trucks  
It's got old Hank crankin' way up loud  
Got coolers in the back, tailgates down  
There's a big fire burning but don't be alarmed  
It's just country boys and girls getting down on the farm  
  
Well you can come as you are, there ain't no dress code  
Just some rural route rules that you need to know  
Don't mess with the bull he can get real mean  
Don't forget to shut the gate stay out of the green  
If it starts to raining will just head to the barn  
Where country boys and girls are getting down on the farm  
  
You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute  
But there's some things you can do outside those city limits  
Ain't no closing time, ain't no cover charge  
Just country boys and girls getting down on the farm  
  
Ed's been on his tractor ain't seen Becky all week  
Somebody said they seen em heading down to the creek  
Farmer Johnson's daughters just pulled up in a jeep  
Man he knows how to grow em if ya know what I mean  
Old Dave's gettin' loud but he don't mean no harm  
It's just country boys and girls getting down on the farm  
  
Ah let's get down y'all  
Stay out of that hay
