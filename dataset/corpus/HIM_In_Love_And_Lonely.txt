In love and lonely  
Just to see you cry  
In love and lonely  
  
I'm not with you my baby  
  
I'm in love with you  
Not the tears in your eyes  
I can't remember  
The last time you smiled  
Oh I know how it feels  
I know what it's like  
To be  
In love and lonely  
  
In love and lonely  
Don't what to do my baby  
  
It's not alright  
This can't be the end  
  
The time to say good bye  
No I won't walk away that easy  
After all this time  
Oh you know how it feels  
You know what it's like  
  
In love and lonely  
To be  
In love and lonely  
  
Oh you know how it feels  
You know what it's like  
You know how it is  
But you just can't stop crying  
In love and lonely  
  
In love and lonely  
  
In love and lonely  
In love and lonely
