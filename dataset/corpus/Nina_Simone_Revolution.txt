And now we got a revolution  
Cause I see the face of things to come  
Yeah, your Constitution  
Well, my friend, its gonna have to bend  
I'm here to tell you about destruction  
Of all the evil that will have to end.  
Some folks are gonna get the notion  
I know they'll say I'm preachin' hate  
But if I have to swim the ocean  
Well I would just to communicate  
Its not as simple as talkin' jive  
The daily struggle just to stay alive  
Singin' about a revolution  
Because were talkin' about a change  
Its more than just evolution  
Well you know you got to clean your brain  
The only way that we can stand in fact  
Is when you get your foot off our back
