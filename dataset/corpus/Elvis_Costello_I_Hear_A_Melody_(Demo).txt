It's easy to do, it's not so easy to say  
I was talking to you when you took my tongue away  
I hear a melody and I feel so ashamed  
I got nothing you'd need and you're so hard to blame  
  
I hear a melody, I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and you're so hard to blame  
  
You will never work out I know that's easy to see  
So the way that I want you to stay is hidden in me  
You'll never know the fool I'm feeling tonight  
But it's best that you never know 'cause I know it's not right  
  
I hear a melody, I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and I know it's not right  
  
I hear a melody, I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and I know it's not right
