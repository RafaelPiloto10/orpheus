She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes  
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies  
And she only reveals what she wants you to see  
She hides like a child, but she's always a woman to me  
  
She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you  
She can ask for the truth, but she'll never believe you  
And she'll take what you give her, as long it's free  
Yeah, She steals like a thief, but she's always a woman to me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Ohhh... she takes care of herself  
She can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time  
Ohhh... and she never gives out  
And she never gives in, she just changes her mind  
  
And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden  
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding  
But she'll bring out the best and the worst you can be  
Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
She's frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel  
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool  
And she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree  
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you  
But she's always a woman to me
