When you sleep.... where do your fingers go?  
what do your fingers know?  
what do your fingers show?  
where do your fingers go... yea  
  
when you sleep... do they tremble..on the edge.. of the bed  
or do you fold them... neatly.. by your head  
do they clench like claws against your own skin  
when youre living your day all over again

do they play guitar in a latin bar  
are they strangers or lovers, do they drive your car?  
are they swimming submissivly, sex acts of life  
or just cutting through jell-o with a very sharp knife  
now Zeus was a womanizer  
always on the lake  
but Hera usually punished her  
that Zeus was one to take  
  
when you sleeeeeeeeeeeeep  
where do your fingers go?  
  
Are they pulling out weeds form the dusty soil  
are they never rewarded fruits of the toil  
are they scratching their nails on the chalk boards of death  
only seeking attention when everyone in the room has left
