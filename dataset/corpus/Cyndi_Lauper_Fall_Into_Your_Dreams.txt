Little baby, on my shoulder  
I could fall into your dreams...  
Wrap myself up, all around you  
Till you don't know what it means.  
  
Don't lie shrugging your shoulders now like I shouldn't stare.  
Don't sigh so deep.  
Are you the kind of man that I hoped you would or wouldn't be?  
  
Maybe baby's gone to sleep...  
Maybe baby's gone to sleep.  
  
Pull myself a little closer,  
I could feel your body breath  
Hear the pulsing of my heartbeat  
Rhyming rhythms endlessly.  
  
If I could catch three wishes from a falling star,  
One I would keep...  
And two I would put on your pillow with a lullaby...  
Maybe baby's gone to sleep  
Maybe baby's gone...  
  
Hold on to a thought at the end of the day...  
Someday we'll be watching the clouds as they're drifting away.  
And you might think about leaving but I'll always stay.  
  
Little baby on my shoulder,  
I could fall into your dreams  
Wrap yourself up all around me  
Till you don't know what it means...  
I could fall into your dreams...  
I could fall into your dreams...  
Maybe baby's gone to sleep...
