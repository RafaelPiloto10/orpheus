Disgraced  
Expendable, we are not really real  
A mirage of solitude is what they try to heal and  
I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade  
  
Spewing bile atrocities  
Bringing existence to it's knees  
I will manifest my sins and  
I will kill mercy within  
Immersed in this hypnotic spell  
Influenced by the hate that swells  
I'm not terrified anymore  
There's nothing left but open sores  
  
Disengaged  
Relinquish the reality, I've known  
I'm feeling like I'm alienated from my own and  
I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade  
  
Spewing bile atrocities  
Bringing existence to it's knees  
I will manifest my sins and  
I will kill mercy within  
Immersed in this hypnotic spell  
Influenced by the hate that swells  
I'm not terrified anymore  
There's nothing left but open sores
