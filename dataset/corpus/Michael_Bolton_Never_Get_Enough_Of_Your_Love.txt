So alive when you're near  
Sometimes this pounding in my heart is all that I can hear  
Everyday, every night  
I feel my weakness gettin' stronger  
With each moment passin' by  
  
I keep tryin' to tell my heart  
Just a matter of time till the feeling subsides  
But time doesn't change a thing  
And I want you to know  
That I need you more than ever  
  
[Chorus]  
Never get enough of your love  
It would only take me  
Till the end of forever  
Never get enough of your love  
Heaven knows I've tried  
But I can't get enough of your love  
  
Can't deny what I feel  
The more I fall into this dream, the more I know it's real  
I just run to your touch  
'Cause nothin' else can satisfy this hunger for your love  
  
They say that a time will come when the thrill is gone  
Still it keeps goin' strong  
And time doesn't mean a thing  
'Cause as good as it gets  
Oh, it just keeps gettin' better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The more I feel, the more I feel about you  
The trouble is I never get enough  
The more I live, the more I just can't live without you  
I can't get enough  
No never enough of your love  
  
[Chorus]
