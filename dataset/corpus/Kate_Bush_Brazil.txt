Brazil  
When hearts were entertained in June  
We stood beneath an amber moon  
And softly whispered 'some day soon'  
  
We kissed and clung together  
Then  
Tomorrow was another day  
The morning found me miles away  
With still a million things to say  
  
Now  
When twilight beams the skies above  
Recalling thrills of our love  
There's one thing I'm certain of  
  
Return I will  
To old Brazil
