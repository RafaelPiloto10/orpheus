Machine Gun  
Tearing my body all apart  
  
Machine Gun, yeah  
Tearing my body all apart  
  
Evil man make me kill ya  
Evil man make you kill me  
Evil man make me kill you  
Even though we're only families apart  
  
Well I pick up my axe and fight like a bomber  
(You know what I mean)  
Hey! And your bullets keep knocking me down  
  
Hey, I pick up my axe and fight like a bomber now  
Yeah, but you still blast me down to the ground  
  
The same way you shoot me down, baby  
you'll be going just the same  
Three times the pain,  
and your own self to blame  
Hey, Machine Gun  
  
I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe  
I ain't afraid no more  
After a while, your, your cheap talk don't even cause me pain,  
so let your bullets fly like rain  
  
'Cause I know all the time you're wrong baby  
And you'll be going just the same  
Yeah, Machine Gun  
Tearing my family apart  
Yeah, yeah, alright  
Tearing my family apart  
  
(Don't you shoot him down)  
(He's 'bout to leave here)  
(Don't you shoot him down)  
(He's got to stay here)  
(He ain't going nowhere)  
(He's been shot down to the ground)  
(Oh where he can't survive, no, no)  
  
Yeah, that's what we don't want to hear anymore, alright  
(No bullets)  
At least here, huh huh  
(No guns, no bombs)  
Huh huh  
(No nothin', just let's all live and live)  
(You know, instead of killin')
