The antique people are down in the dungeons  
Run by machines and afraid of the tax  
Their heads in the grave and their hands on their eyes  
Hauling their hearts around circular tracks  
Pretending forever their masquerade towers  
Are not really riddled with widening cracks  
And I wave goodbye to iron  
And smile hello to the air  
  
O the new children dance -- I am young  
All around the balloons -- I will live  
Swaying by chance -- I am strong  
To the breeze from the moon -- I can give  
Painting the sky -- You the strange  
With the colors of sun -- Seed of day  
Freely they fly -- Feel the change  
As all become one -- Know the Way  
  
The velocity addicts explode on the highways  
Ignoring the journey and moving so fast  
Their nerves fall apart and they gasp but can't breathe  
They run from the cops of the skeleton past  
Petrified by tradition in a nightmare they stagger  
  
Into nowhere at all and they look up aghast  
And I wave goodbye to speed  
And smile hello to a rose  
  
O the new children play -- I am young  
Under the juniper trees -- I will live  
Sky blue or gray -- I am strong  
They continue at ease -- I can give  
Moving so slow -- You the strange  
That serenely they can -- Seed of day  
Gracefully grow -- Feel the change  
And yes still understand -- Know the Way  
  
The king and the queen in their castle of billboards  
Sleepwalk down the hallways dragging behind  
All their possessions and transient treasures  
As they go to worship the electronic shrine  
On which is playing the late late commercial  
In that hollowest house of the opulent blind  
And I wave goodbye to Mammon  
And smile hello to a stream  
  
O the new children buy -- I am young  
All the world for a song -- I will live  
Without a dime -- I am strong  
To which they belong -- I can give  
Nobody owns -- You the strange  
Anything anywhere -- Seed of day  
Everyone's grown -- Feel the change  
Up so big they can share -- Know the Way  
  
The vaudeville generals cavort on the stage  
And shatter their audience with submachine guns  
And Freedom and Violence the acrobat clowns  
Do a balancing act on the graves of our sons  
While the tapdancing Emperor sings "War is peace"  
And Love the Magician disappears in the fun  
And I wave goodbye to murder  
And smile hello to the rain  
  
O the new children can't -- I am young  
Tell a foe from a friend -- I will live  
Quick to enchant -- I am strong  
And so glad to extend -- I can give  
Handfuls of dawn -- You the strange  
To kaleidoscope men -- Seed of day  
Come from beyond -- Feel the change  
The Great Wall of Skin -- Know the Way  
  
The bloodless husbands are jesters who listen  
Like sheep to the shrieks and commands of their wives  
And the men who aren't men leave the women alone  
See them all faking love on a bed made of knives  
Afraid to discover or trust in their bodies  
And in secret divorce they will never survive  
And I wave goodbye to ashes  
And smile hello to a girl  
  
O the new children kiss -- I am young  
They are so proud to learn -- I will live  
Womanwood bliss -- I am strong  
And the manfire that burns -- I can give  
Knowing no fear -- You the strange  
They take off their clothes -- Seed of day  
Honest and clear - Feel the change  
As a river that flows - Know the Way  
  
The antique people are fading out slowly  
Like newspapers flaming in mind suicide  
Godless and sexless directionless loons  
Their sham sandcastles dissolve in the tide  
They put on their deathmasks and compromise daily  
The new children will live for the elders have died  
And I wave goodbye to America  
And smile hello to the world
