He's a movie star, only drives rented cars.  
Met him in a bar, said "I know who you are."  
Took him to my party as the games were starting.  
Bottle's on the ground, are you ready now?  
When it comes to me, I'm gonna be ready.  
It's my turn in a minute, gonna put my message in it.  
Five minutes in the closet with you.  
  
He's in a bunch of movies, really stupid movies.  
It's not entirely his fault, he can't control it all.  
I am not afraid, I can hardly wait.  
Truth or dare, I don't care, tell the truth I dare you.  
  
When it comes around, when it comes around,  
When it comes around, when it comes around.  
Do you feel it too, what I feel for you?  
If it was just us, would you do what I do?  
Doo-doo-doo-doo. Doo-doo-doo-doo.  
Doo-doo-doo-doo. Doo-doo-doo-doo.  
  
Everybody's watching. Everybody's looking.  
She's such a sucker. He don't want to fuck her.  
He is gonnna kiss me, if he doesn't miss me.  
I am ready for it now. Already on the ground.  
Five minutes in the closet with you.  
Oooh! Five minutes in the closet with you.  
  
Spin it 'round again X8
