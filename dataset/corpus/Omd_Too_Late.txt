Have you heard about the hollow man?  
Too frightened so he turned and ran, from the vision that he cherished so.  
Couldn't see it, so he let it go.  
Everybody has a secret sin.  
But everybody needs a chance to win.  
Anyone could see I'm a man that's sad and broken by the things I've done.  
But now I'm sorry that I said goodbye.  
And I'm sorry cause it's me that's crying.  
I never finished what I started to, but I'm just so sorry that I'm hurting
you.  
  
But it's too late for us to just be friends.  
And too late for anything but the end.  
And too many dreams fell through our hands.  
And it's just too late to understand.  
  
Now I'll never make a new beginning,  
And I'll never stop the pain from winning.  
Nothing matters to me anymore now.  
I've lost the things I was fighting for.  
And now I'm sorry that the dreams are gone,  
And I'm sorry cause I'm not the  
One who comes running when you need me so,  
Cause I'm the fool that's let you go.  
  
But it's too late for us to just be friends.  
And too late for anything but the end.  
And too many dreams fell through our hands.  
And it's just too late to understand.  
  
All the tears of pain are falling down, (oh, oh, oh, oh).  
All the tears of pain are falling down, and you know...  
  
But it's too late for us to just be friends.  
And too late for anything but the end.  
And too many dreams fell through our hands.  
And it's just too late to understand.  
  
But it's too late for us to just be friends.  
And too late for anything but the end.  
And too many dreams fell through our hands.  
And it's just too late to understand.  
  
But it's too late... Too late... It's too late...
