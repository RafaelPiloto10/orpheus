Hey!  
Alright!  
Whoo! How 'bout 'cha now,  
Come on  
Oh yeah!  
Dig it!  
That's right.  
Is everybody ready?  
Let's go!  
Up and down, around and 'round  
In and out  
Crank it, blow out  
Ouch  
Help me  
Flip on over  
Oh baby, you know what I like  
She choked the chain, she got the hook  
Can't get away  
Fever starts to climb, reaching one hundred five (degrees)  
I think I need a shot of your love  
Love, love is the source  
Love, love is the source of infection  
Hey Eddie  
Say what  
That's what I'm talkin' about  
Wax it down now  
Ready, set, go!  
Love, love is the source  
Love, love is the source  
Love, love, love, love is the source  
Love, love is the source
