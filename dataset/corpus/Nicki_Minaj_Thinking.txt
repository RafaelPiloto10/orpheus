[Lenny Harold, Nicki Minaj]  
Yeah Uh

What you're thinking  
Can I change your mind  
Second to none, in crowd  
It's how we do it, yea  
Nicki Miraj  
  
Ah, shit I got this whips is topless  
Yall couldn't see me looking through binoculars  
Look second to none all we do is drop this,  
Six to six flow so I roll with dodges.  
And I'm in the club, everybody wanna dub  
Sip a little bub and I probally wit a thug  
Play hard to get, but I'm thinking bout it,  
So you whisper in my ear, what you thinking shawty?  
  
[Lenny Harold, verse 1]  
Hey, tryina' do withcha cause shawty cause I deal with you  
You keep me inside of those try to guess what to do next  
Should I stay or should I go  
Is difficult to love ya,  
When you don't know what you want,  
And you're left with decisions while I got cloudy visions  
You know  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shawty, what you're thinking?  
You know  
What got you thinking, let go  
I know that you know, you want this love,  
You know that I know,  
You're thinking oh. (x2)  
  
[Lenny Harold, verse 2]  
Hey, it's burning me up, just wanna get close to ya  
And you're playing games with this attraction,  
Shawty I got a it bad it's pathetic  
Oh, I just wanna understand, you're leading me for a reason  
You know  
I see it in your eyes thinking on the same line,  
  
So come and take it baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Shawty what you're thinking?  
You know  
What got you thinking, let go  
I know that you know, you want this love,  
You know that I know,  
You're thinking oh. (x2)  
  
[Lenny Harold, verse 3]  
You got me thinking  
Why is it so hard for you to make your move?  
Make your move  
Shawty make your move  
When it's what you want, girl  
So why you're running from your feelings  
When you know how to handle it, yeah?

You know baby, you gotta follow your heart  
Not your mind, you feel me  
Na, na, nana no, na, nana, na, na, nana na.  
Na, na, nana no, na, nana, na, na, nana na.

See I already did it, tell her to come and get it.  
Who got a setup like inmirage everybody wanna get up  
In my entarouge, at this stage in the game I'm in the range  
With change, don't fuck with lames that's my claim to fame nigga.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shawty, what you're thinking?
