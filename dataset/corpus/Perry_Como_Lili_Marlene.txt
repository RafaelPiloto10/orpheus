( This is the story of Lili Marlene,  
doo, doo, doo doo, doo! )  
  
Would you like to hear the story,  
of a girl that many soldiers know?  
It's a tale of love in all it's glory,  
they tell when the lights are soft an' low!  
  
Underneath the lamp post by the brigades  
standing all alone every night you'll see her wait,  
she waits for a boy who marched away  
and though he's gone, she hears him say:  
  
"Oh promise you'll be true,  
fare thee well Lili Marlene,  
'till I return to you,  
fare thee well Lili Marlene! "  
  
( This is the story of Lili Marlene! )  
With a kiss she gave her promise,  
to be constant as the stars above,  
every soldier knows she's kept her promise,  
and she has been faithful to her love!  
  
( Underneath the lamp post by the brigade  
standing all alone every night you'll see her wait,  
for this is the place a vow was made  
and breezes sing her serenade . . . )  
  
"Oh promise you'll be true,  
fare thee well Lili Marlene,  
'till I return to you,  
fare thee well Lili Marlene, "  
  
( This is the story of Lili Marlene!  
Though wee stems have an ending,  
no one knows just what the end will be  
but tonight when twilight is descending,  
if you'll come along, here's what you'll see . . . )  
  
Underneath the lamp post by the brigade  
standing all alone every night you'll see her wait,  
and as they go marching to the fray  
the soldiers all salute and say:  
  
We'll tell him you've been true,  
fare thee well Lili Marlene,  
'till he returns to you,  
fare thee well . . .  
Lili Marlene!
