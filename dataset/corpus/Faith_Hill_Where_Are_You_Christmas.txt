Where are you Christmas?  
Why can't I find you?  
Why have you gone away?  
  
Where is the laughter,  
You used to bring me?  
Why can't I hear music play?  
  
My world is changing  
I'm rearranging  
Does that mean Christmas changes too?  
  
Where are you Christmas?  
Do you remember,  
The one you used to know?  
  
I'm not the same one  
See what the time has done  
Is that why you have let me go?  
  
Christmas is here, everywhere  
Oh, oh  
Christmas is here, if you care  
Oh  
  
If there is love in your heart and your mind  
You will feel like Christmas all the time  
Oh  
  
I feel you Christmas  
I know I found you  
You never fade away  
Oh  
  
The joy of Christmas  
Stays here inside us  
Fills each and every heart  
With love  
  
Where are you Christmas?  
Fill your heart with love
