i am the city, you let me be  
i am the city  
  
Coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
And you feel a strange attraction  
The air is vibrant and electrified  
Welcome to me here I am, my arms are open wide  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
People come and take their chances  
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot  
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul  
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
Dazzled by the crazy magic  
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The parks and the squares that you see  
All the sounds that you hear  
And the air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
I am the city  
You let me be  
I am the city  
  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
  
Coming through a cloud  
You're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise
