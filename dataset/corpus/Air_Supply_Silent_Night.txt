Silent night  
Holy night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
  
Round yon virgin  
Mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night  
Holy night  
Son of god  
Love's pure light  
  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
  
Silent night  
Holy night  
Wondrous star  
Led by light  
With the angels  
Let us sing  
Hallelujah to our king  
  
Christ the savior is born  
Christ the savior is born
