Five gears in reverse  
For girls looking at the big lift  
Somebody send out for the night nurse  
Please don't stick me on the late shift  
If you don't know by now  
Nobodys gonna tell you  
If you don't know by now  
The shock will probably kill you  
  
But if your patience is corrupted and you still cannot decide  
Youre sitting in the garage contemplating suicide  
And you have no motivation you can't even catch your breath  
All of this acceleration is driving you to death  
  
Five gears in reverse  
You think I don't know what I'm doing  
Another fashionable first  
Like walking down the road to ruin  
But if you're safe and sound  
Don't let me interrupt you  
And if you're gagged and bound  
Well how can I corrupt you  
  
Chorus
