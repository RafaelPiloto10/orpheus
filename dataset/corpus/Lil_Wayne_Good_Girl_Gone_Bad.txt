[Lil' Wayne]  
Okay, I'm talkin' about a  
Good girl, gone bad  
Crooked world, wrong path  
Right Mom, wrong Dad  
I sing this song mad, but not mad enough to shoot you  
But it just eats me up, like some bbq from Luther's  
In the mornin' with the roosters  
On the corner with the boosters  
And she's the freshcut and they're on her like sutures  
And I wanna talk to her  
But her Mama has to school her  
I wanna see her better  
She's the weather of my future  
I don't wanna see another hurricane  
Baby you can kill the pain  
If you just let me explain  
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'  
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train  
Stuck in the passenger seat  
Travlin' through the fast lane

Well once upon a time, there was a Mom and a Dad  
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had  
A beautiful daughter, two story house, two car garage  
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard  
See Daddy was a doctor  
And Mommy was a banker  
Mommy's job got outsourced  
So now Mommy's dranker  
Daddy had a malpractice suit  
Now he's a snorter  
And all this shit's takin' place  
Right in front of their daughter  
She says, "Daddy what's wrong?"  
But he's just too high  
"Mommy what we gon' do?"  
She just get drunk and cry  
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right  
Lookin' for answers alone in the darkness of night  
Shit anit right... Lil girl gone some where out there stranded can't nobody
find her and they don't understand it she was raise hood can't blame her
parents lost in the sauce not the why that they planed it
