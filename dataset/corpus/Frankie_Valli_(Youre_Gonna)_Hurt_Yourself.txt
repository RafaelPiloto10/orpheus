I love you just you, it's true (baby, it's true)  
But how much more do you need to be satisfied  
Than I can give the way you live (baby, can give)  
You cheat all over, a rover you are  
Makes me tell you oh  
  
[Chorus]  
You know you're gonna hurt yourself (hey)  
You know you're gonna hurt yourself  
When you're broke and worn out  
When your heart is torn out  
  
1, 2 Don't 3, oh call me  
1, 2 Don't call me  
I love you to coda  
  
It can't wait 'til it's too late (baby, it's true)  
If you want my love, take my love, but don't go shoppin'  
'Round the town 'til you have found (baby, can give)  
The guy you needed was me all along  
Baby, baby, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Instrumental break (as per last three lines of verse]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Girl, yeah know you're gonna hurt yourself, hey)  
Girl, don't hurt yourself  
(Girl, yeah know you're gonna hurt yourself, hey)  
Come on now, girl  
(Girl, yeah know you're gonna hurt yourself, hey)  
You know you're gonna hurt yourself  
(Girl, yeah know you're gonna hurt yourself, hey)  
Come on girl
