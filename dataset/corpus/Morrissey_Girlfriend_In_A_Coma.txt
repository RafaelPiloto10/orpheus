Girlfriend in a coma  
I know, I know  
It's serious  
Girlfriend in a coma  
I know, I know  
It's really serious  
  
There were times  
When I could have  
Murdered her  
But you know  
I would hate anything  
To happen to her  
No I don't want  
To see her  
  
Do you really think  
She'll pull through?  
Do you really think  
She'll pull through?  
Oh  
  
Girlfriend in a coma  
I know, I know  
It's serious  
By, by, by, by  
By, by, baby, goodbye  
There were times  
When I could have  
Strangled her  
But you know  
I would hate anything  
To happen to her  
Would you please  
Let me see her  
  
Do you really think  
She'll pull through?  
Do you really think  
She'll pull through?  
Oh  
  
Let me whisper  
My last goodbyes  
I know  
It's serious
