Remember the days of the old school yard  
we used to laugh a lot.  
Oh don't you remember the days of the old school yard.  
When we had imaginings and we had all kinds of things  
And we laughed and needed love  
Yes I do, oh and I remember you.  
  
Remember the days of the old school yard  
we used to cry a lot.  
Oh don't you remember the days of the old school yard.  
When we had simplicity and we had warm toast for tea  
And we laughed and needed love  
Yes I do, oh and I remember you.  
  
You were my sweet love (woman)  
My first sweet love (Cat)  
My lovey dove (woman)  
My love lovey dove (Cat)  
No matter what [unknown] (woman)  
What ever the place (Cat)  
I'd still see your face (woman)  
Your smiling face (Cat)  
You [unknown] me (woman)  
Inside my dreams (Cat)  
Like England's queen? (woman)  
God save our Queen. (Cat)  
Though time may fade (woman)  
Though time may fade (Cat)  
It ain't never too late (woman)  
To learn about love (both)  
learn about love (Cat)  
  
Remember the days of the old school yard  
we used to laugh a lot.  
Oh don't you remember the days of the old school yard.  
When we had imaginings and we had all kinds of things  
And we laughed and needed love  
Yes I do, oh and I remember you.
