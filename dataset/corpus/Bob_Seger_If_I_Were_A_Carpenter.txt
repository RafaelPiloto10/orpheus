If I were a carpenter and you were a lady  
Would you marry me anyway?  
Would you have my baby?  
If I worked my hands in wood  
I wonder would you still love me?  
I say yes, I would, I'll put you above me  
That's what I want you to say  
And would you save my love from loneliness  
Would you save my love from sorrow, if you would  
I give you my onlyness, girl and all of my tomorrows  
If a tinker were my trade, would you still find me?  
Carrying the pots and the pans that I made  
Walking along the highway  
That long lonely highway  
If I was a carpenter, and you were a lady  
And I was just a carpenter  
Instead of a rock and roll star  
Just a carpenter, a carpenter, a carpenter
