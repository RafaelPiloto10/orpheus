(Yodel)  
I'm always blue, feeling so blue  
I wish, I had someone I knew  
Just to help me tuck away my blues  
Lonesome blues  
So won't you be that someone  
To help me lose the blues  
I really need someone to love me, someone to kiss  
Someone to scold me, someone to miss  
So help me tuck away my lonesome blues  
(Yodel)  
I really need someone to love me, someone to kiss  
Someone to scold me, someone to miss  
So help me tuck away my lonesome blues
