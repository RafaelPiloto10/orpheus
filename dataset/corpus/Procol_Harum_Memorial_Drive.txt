Cellar full of diamonds, turret full of gold  
All for a mermaid's locket, too much to hold  
Drink the seals' blood from the ocean  
Drink the whole ocean dry  
Steal the moonshine from the night-time  
Steal the sun from the sky  
  
Black-skinned warrior, Zulu Queen  
Sold for a silver dollar, shipped across the sea  
Worked like a Mexican donkey  
Used like a hole in the ground  
Branded her skin like she didn't feel a thing  
Crying without a sound
