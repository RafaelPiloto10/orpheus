Turn me off  
Pull the plug  
Leave me with some dignity  
I am not  
What I was  
And I don't need the sympathy  
  
Alive inside me  
No one can hear me  
  
Brain dead  
I'm not  
Brain dead  
Sentenced  
Forgot  
  
Paralyzed  
In my shell  
Enduring every  
Endless day  
  
Immobilized  
On my back  
Aware of everything  
They say  
  
Extricate me  
Eliminate me  
  
Brain dead  
I'm not  
Brain dead  
Drip fed  
Forgot  
  
I can't blink my eye or cry  
Or even speak  
They crowd around my bed  
Condescending words are said  
Thinking I don't hear or know  
What is going on?  
Hello  
Can't you suckers hear my cries  
From inside? I'm still alive  
It's my decision to abort  
Turn off the goddamn life support  
  
Let me pass  
From this world  
So I fade away in peace  
  
Comprehending  
Unrelenting  
  
Brain dead  
I'm not  
Brain dead  
Sentenced  
Forgot  
  
Brain dead  
I'm not  
Brain dead  
Drip fed  
Forgot
