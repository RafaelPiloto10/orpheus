You can't by stand all the people  
Stand them on their own  
They will fall to pieces  
So we watch them grow  
Into strange and pretty faces  
I don't know  
Clutching to my lipstick traces  
Watch them go  
  
Make mistake number three [Repeat: x3]  
  
It's strange how much it changes  
How they want to know  
How cynical are people  
That's where children go  
  
Dragged into a conversation  
They can't hold  
It's so bad  
But it prepares them for the mold  
  
Make mistake number three  
(repeat three times)  
  
Why is my love like an ocean run dry?  
Why is my love  
Such a struggle with life?  
  
You can"t by stand all the people  
Stand them on their own  
They will fall to pieces  
So we watch them grow  
  
Make mistake number three [Repeat: x3]  
  
Make mistake number three
