Don't I need a savior  
Just to bail me out  
I'll hold my breath  
Until the water lets me out  
And I say  
Alimony never can pay  
Hey, hey, hey  
I'm on the breadline  
Your on the answer phone  
You're off the hook  
And I'm left all alone  
It's a shame  
Passion isn't always to blame  
Hey, hey, hey  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)  
It's a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  
I'm undercover  
My love has overgrown  
Retaliation is emotion  
I have shown  
And I say  
All the money never can pay  
Hey, hey, hey  
I'm on the level  
You're on the second floor  
I'm counting seconds  
As my hand goes for the door  
It's a shame  
Pleasure isn't always the same  
Hey, hey, hey  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)  
It's a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  
I need revenge for love, revenge for love  
Revenge for love, revenge for love  
Don't I need a savior  
Just to bail me out  
I'll hold my breath  
Until the water lets me out  
And I say  
Alimony never can pay  
Hey, hey, hey  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)  
It's a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  
Oh, I needed, I needed, I needed  
Revenge for love  
Sweet revenge for love  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)  
It's a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge
