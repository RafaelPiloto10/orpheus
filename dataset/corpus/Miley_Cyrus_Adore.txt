I was looking for a good time  
I was down so low thought I'd never get up  
Then a midnight lady with eyes of green  
Said she didn't look much older than seventeen  
She said, I'll take you to a place  
That you've never seen  
If your lookin' for a good time  
Lookin' for a good time  
Lookin' for a good time  
  
She took me away downtown  
To a smoky cafe called Barefoot George  
There were other people walking  
Then she knocked three times  
She whispered to a guy he's a friend of mine  
Said take off your shoes and come on inside  
If your lookin' for a good time  
Lookin' for a good time  
Lookin' for a good time  
  
Well the lights when on  
And the lights when off  
And the music stopped  
And a man grabbed me from behind  
And said ya just got caught  
Well your under age and this here's a raid  
I should take ya in  
I'm gonna to do you a favor and let ya go  
Don't ya let me catch you round here no more  
Looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time  
  
When I got home with my bare feet  
Daddy said he should have put me over his knee  
And asked me where I've been till a quarter to three  
Said looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time
