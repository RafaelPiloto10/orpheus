Let's go  
  
What happened to the man who used to take me straight into misery  
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me  
How could this be?  
Tell me what's this desperation  
'Cause I don't recognize, he's changed  
I think I made a bad mistake  
  
'Cause once I ran away  
I love you since the day, the day I broke your heart  
It's more than I could take  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
Now everything is coming undone  
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
  
I must admit the grass is so much greener on the other side  
Since you left I noticed now you're so much meaner  
And it's something I think I like  
Tell me what's this desperation  
'Cause I don't recognize, he's changed  
I think I made a bad mistake  
  
'Cause once I ran away  
I love you since the day, the day I broke your heart  
It's more than I could take  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
Now everything is coming under  
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
  
I made a bad mistake  
Used to pray for space  
Drowning you one more time  
And mend my wicked ways  
  
'Cause once I ran away  
I love you since the day, the day I broke your heart  
It's more than I could take  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
Now everything is coming under (coming under)  
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
The day we fell apart
