When all the world  
Is a hopeless jumble  
And the raindrops tumble all around  
Heaven opens a magic lane  
  
When all the clouds darken up the skyway  
There's a rainbow highway to be found  
Leading from your window pane  
To a place behind the sun just a step beyond the rain  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
There's a land that I heard of once  
In a lullaby  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Skies are blue  
And the dreams that you care to dream  
Really do come true  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops way above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then oh why can't I?  
  
If happy little bluebirds fly over the rainbow  
Why oh why can't I?
