Sugar sit a while  
come and rest your feet  
Its been a long long while  
since you were been close to me  
  
Lets polish of a few  
Underneath the sky  
Its pulling all its faces  
You want to stand real quiet  
and see just what it brings  
we've been running too much  
need to miss out on a few things  
  
[Chorus]  
If we just get it on  
Tease and treat me wrong  
Birds do it  
Bees do it  
Drop right down to my knees to do it  
Just get me on my feet again  
Get me on my feet again  
  
Swinging like a tire  
Princess off the beat  
Telephone wires with all  
Explode at your feet  
  
I'm running out of blood  
But i'm never cold  
But I need to jump those fences  
Holding neath the show  
Cause I see just what I need  
So drag this boy on over  
Let him fall real deep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sugar I'm a mess  
But its where I want to be  
I want to burn out with a smile  
That cuts right through my teeth  
  
Everyone gets rained  
Rained on just the same  
But lately its been soaking  
Us right to the veins  
And we're running out of time  
So drag this boy on over  
And keep him til its light  
  
Can we just get it on  
Tease and treat me wrong  
Them birds do it  
Them bees do it  
Drop right down to my knees to do it  
Just get me on my feet again  
Just get me on my feet again  
Just get me on my feet again  
Get me on my feet again
