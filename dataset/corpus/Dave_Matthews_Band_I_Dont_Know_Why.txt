I waited 'till I saw the sun,  
I don't know why I didn't call,  
I left you by the house of fun,  
I don't know why I didn't call,  
I don't know why I didn't call...  
When I saw the break of day,  
I wished that I could fly away,  
Instead of kneeling in the sand,  
Catchin teardrops in my hand,  
My heart is drenched in white,  
You'll be on my mind forever,  
I'd cross the endless sea,  
I would die in ecstasy,  
But I'll be a bag of bones,  
Driving down the road alone,  
My heart is drenched in white,  
And you'll be on my mind forever,  
Something has to make you wrong,  
I don't know why I didn't call,  
I didn't call I feel as empty as a drum,  
I don't why I didn't call,  
I don't know why I didn't call,  
I don't know why I didn't call...
