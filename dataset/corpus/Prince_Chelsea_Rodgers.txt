A model  
Used to be a role model  
  
I don't know  
Come on Chelsea  
I dunno  
Come on  
  
Ah, go ahead now Chelsea! Go ahead now!  
Uh, this for Jersey right here  
Go ahead now  
  
[Chorus]  
Chelsea Rodgers was a model  
Thought she really rocked the road, yes she did  
Kept her tears up in a bottle  
Poured them out to save her soul  
  
Ask her what she liked the most  
She said, she liked to talk to Jimi's ghost  
Fantasy, her friends boast (This girl is fly)  
Chelsea's fly, like coast to coast  
  
Hollywood or Times Square  
If the party's fly, my girl is there  
Purple's on and bounce in her hair  
Twenty first Century hippy, Chelsea don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Try to catch her if you can (Come on now together)  
You never see her with my man (A brother got to jump n the water)  
He must be baptized, according to the master plan  
'Fore she give up the good thing  
Go ahead Chelsea (Go ahead Chelsea)  
  
No cut diamonds, and designer shoes (Uh, no-no!)  
Because she's too original from her head down to her feet  
(Rehab) (If you want to) (just don't mean no me)  
Chelsea don't eat no meat, still got butt like a leather seat  
Go ahead Chelsea! (Go ahead Chelsea!)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Go ahead Chelsea!  
(Speak on that horn)  
  
Come on  
Next to her they just a fool  
Chelsea read more books than a few  
Moses was a Pharoah in the eighteenth Dynasty  
And Rome was chilling in Carthage in 33 BC  
And the day that we stop counting, we live as long as a tree  
Go ahead Chelsea, teach me! Go ahead Chelsea  
  
Make a promise to your higher self, get you nothing, fame and wealth  
You don't be chasing nobodies ghost  
Of everything, make the most (Come on!)  
  
[Chorus x2]
