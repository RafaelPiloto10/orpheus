I was born in Macon Georgia they kept my dad in the Macon jail  
Dad said son if you keep your hands clean  
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail  
But I fell in with bad companions we robbed a man in Tennessee  
The sheriff caught me way up in Nashville they locked me up and threw away the
key  
I washed my hands in muddy water I washed my hands but they didn't come clean  
I tried to do what daddy told me but I must have washed my hands in a muddy
stream  
I asked the jailor I said when's my time up he said son we won't forget  
And if you try to keep your hands clean we may make a good man of you yet  
I couldn't wait to get my timming I broke out of that Nashville jail  
I just crossed the line of Georgia and I can hear the bloodhounds on my trail  
I washed my hands...
