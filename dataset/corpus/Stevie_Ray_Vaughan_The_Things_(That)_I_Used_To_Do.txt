The things that I used to do Lord, I won't do no more  
The things that I used to do Lord, I won't do no more  
I used to sit and hold your hand darlin' and cry, oh babe do not go  
  
I used to search all night for you darlin'  
Lord, and my search would always end in vain  
I used to search all night for you darlin'  
Lord, and my search would always end in vain  
But I knew all the time darlin' That you was hid out wit' your other man  
  
I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin'  
Lord, and I'm goin' back to my family too  
I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin'  
Lord, and I'm goin' back to my family too  
Nothin' I can do to please ya' darlin' I just can't get along with you
