Are you ready? Say you'll let me  
Take you for a ride  
The night is young, it's just begun  
Why don't you step inside  
Get ready, get ready  
We'll leave this place behind  
You'll feel the airwaves answer  
Every question in your mind  
  
With every moment passing by  
Who's got the time to wonder why  
It's taken eternity  
  
Chorus  
Airwaves(come and ride the airwaves)  
Airwaves(tell me how you feel)  
Airwaves(come and ride the airwaves)  
It's alright, it's alright  
You'll remember  
  
Oh, yeah  
There is a place where time and space  
Will open every door  
Revealing things beyond the dreams  
We've ever known before  
  
With every moment passing by  
Who's got the time to wonder why  
It's taking eternity  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh it's alright  
Airwaves  
Airwaves  
Airwaves
