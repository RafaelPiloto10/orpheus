I'm down on love  
An' I don't give a damn,  
I take my chances  
Whenever I can  
Like a lamb to the slaughter,  
Another sacrifice,  
For giving love to woman  
With a heart stone cold as ice  
  
I'm down on love  
An' I'm clean out of pain,  
I ain't no stranger  
To the crying game  
Too scared to suffer,  
An' too blind to see,  
But, I played with fire  
An' I got what was coming to me  
  
Now, one more heartache  
Don't bother me,  
Just one more lonely night  
To drown in misery  
  
I am a victim of love,  
A victim of love,  
Lord, I never thought  
I'd be a victim of love  
Victim of love, victim of love,  
Lord, I never thought  
I'd be a victim of love  
  
I'm down on love  
An' I feel like a fool  
To beg for mercy  
'Cause I broke the rules  
So do me no favors  
With your cool advice,  
I know the losing cost,  
An' I'll pay the price  
  
One more heartache  
Don't bother me  
One more lonely night  
To drown in misery  
  
I am a victim of love,  
A victim of love,  
Lord, I never thought  
I'd be a victim of love  
  
Victim of love,  
A victim of love,  
Lord, I never thought  
I'd be a victim of love  
  
One more heartache  
Don't bother me  
One more lonely night  
To drown in misery  
  
Victim of love,  
A victim of love,  
Lord, I never thought  
I'd be a victim of love
