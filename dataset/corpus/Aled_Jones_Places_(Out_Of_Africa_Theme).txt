Places, I still remember places  
Those precious times and places  
When everything was new  
  
Places, I still can feel those places  
Our hearts were never lighter  
The sky was twice as new  
  
Places, what happen to those places?  
Though they have changed forever  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Moments, do you remember moments?  
And nothing seems to matter  
Apart from me and you  
  
Passion, wilder than the ocean  
Timeless as the mountain  
We grew closer  
We grew wiser every day  
  
Places, I still remember places  
Those precious times and places  
When everything was new  
  
Places, do you remember places  
And nothing seems to matter  
I'm still in love with you
