You've left at last, I knew you could  
Leaving nothing to remember you by  
Except how to be happy  
And how not to care any more  
  
Two by two, these things weren't meant for you  
  
Your call never came, I wish that it would,  
So I could have something to remember you by  
Besides the way we fell to pieces  
And how not to feel anything  
  
Two by two, these things weren't meant for you  
  
It rains today, or are those tears  
Falling from the moon above  
That bell in my head  
It'll ring 'til I'm dead.
