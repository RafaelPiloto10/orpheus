You're upstairs with the boyfriend while I'm left here to listen (Angry)  
I hear you calling his name, I hear the stutter of ignition (Angry)  
I could hear you whispering as I crept by your door  
So you found some other joker who could please you more  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm not angry (Angry)  
I'm not angry anymore (Angry)  
I'm not angry (Angry)  
I'm not angry anymore (Angry)  
Ooh, I know what you're doin'  
I know where you've been  
I know where, but I don't care  
'Cause there's-a no such thing as an original sin  
  
I've got this camera click, click, clickin' in my head (Angry)  
I got you talking with your hands, got you smiling with your legs (Angry)  
Spent all my time in a vanity factory  
Wonderin' when they're gonna come and take it all back  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh, there's no such thing as an original sin  
Oh, there's-a no such thing as an original sin (Angry)  
I'm not angry (Angry)  
I'm not angry anymore (Angry)...
