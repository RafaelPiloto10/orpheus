He will be there  
Through the hurricane  
Through the pouring rain  
He will be there  
  
Through the longest night  
Everything's gonna be alright  
The storm is gonna end  
And the sun's gonna rise again  
  
[Chorus]  
Keep on shining  
Let Love light up the darkest sky  
And you'll be flying  
Rise above all the hardest times  
So hold on (Hold on)  
Be strong (Be strong)  
Come on (Come on, come on)  
Keep on shining  
  
Nothing can stop  
The way He feels  
'Cause His Love's so real  
No mountain top  
  
Will ever be too high  
'Cause with Jesus by your side  
There's nothing you can't do  
You're gonna make it through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know in your soul  
You know in your heart  
He will always be your only  
Guiding star  
  
[Chorus]
