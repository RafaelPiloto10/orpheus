I met a man  
Traveling down the road  
He looked me in the eye  
And he gave me a ring  
And he gave me a rose  
And he told me some gypsy lies  
The road is a lover, you never recover  
Not now or any time soon  
My head starts to spin  
When I think where I've been  
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune, oh  
As the wind chases after the moon  
Through the kindness  
Shown me that day  
I gave him this melody  
And we sang in duet  
'Neath the stars in the sky  
And the shadows of dancing trees  
The road is a lover, you never recover  
Not now or any time soon  
My head starts to spin  
When I think where I've been  
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune, oh  
As the wind chases after the moon
