Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart  
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start  
I tried to shower you with love and kisses  
But all I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'  
My poor heart is saggin'  
  
The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame  
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same  
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart  
Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart  
  
No, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart  
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start  
I tried to shower you with love and kisses, baby  
All I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'  
My poor heart is saggin'  
  
The way you toss my heart around's, is a cryin' shame  
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same  
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart  
Babe, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart  
  
The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame  
(Oh, yes)  
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same  
You only tearing all my little dreams apart  
Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart
