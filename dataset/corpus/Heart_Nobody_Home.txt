Don't run too fast  
Like a shot from a gun  
Don't jump too high  
And knock out the sun  
Don't stray too far  
Out on your own  
When you finally come knocking  
When you finally come knocking  
There'll be nobody home  
Nobody home  
  
Don't pull too hard  
Like a kite in the wind  
You'll break the string  
When I reel you in  
Don't take off flying  
All on your own  
When you finally come knocking  
When you finally come knocking  
There'll be nobody home  
Nobody home  
  
You say you're feeling locked inside  
Stuck inside to stay  
You want to fly away  
There's nothing I can do  
To help you make your play  
Make your getaway  
Don't dream too wild  
And shoot for the moon  
Don't ride your heart  
Like a balloon  
Don't blow away  
To places unknown  
Cause when you finally coming knocking  
When you finally come knocking  
There'll be nobody home  
Nobody home  
  
Don't run too fast  
Like a shot from a gun  
Don't jump too high  
And knock out the sun  
Don't stray too far  
Out on your own  
Cause when you finally come knocking  
When you finally come knocking  
There'll be nobody home  
Nobody home  
  
When you finally come knocking  
When you finally come knocking  
There'll be nobody home  
Nobody home  
  
When you finally come knocking  
When you finally come knocking  
There'll be nobody home  
Nobody home
