Born in the country and I like that country smile  
Of the little girls and boys, they remind me of a child  
That I knew and a big harvest moon  
That shone by supper time in the dusty afternoon  
And I need to be there when the autumn wind goes  
Singing through the trestle we would climb  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
Born in the country and I like that country song  
We played for just a nickel every time we got to town  
And I bought you a dime diamond ring  
In the hayloft we would play, we were princesses and kings  
And I need to be there when the world  
Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
Born in the country and I like that country way  
Of the uncles aunts and cousins, and the card games they would play  
While the young ones slept overhead  
Beneath the quilts that mother made, when all the prayers were said  
And I need to be there when the autumn wind  
Goes singing through the trestle we would climb  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
And I need to be there when the world  
Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time
