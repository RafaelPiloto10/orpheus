Some say it's wrong, some say it's right  
Some say it's politicians playing both sides  
Some say it's greed, some say it's change  
Some say it's all just the price we'll have to pay  
  
And I feel a storm coming in  
And I see the earth bending in the wind  
  
It's gonna rain, yeah  
Wash it all away, yeah  
And it ain't gonna stop  
No, it ain't gonna stop  
For forty days  
  
Some say it's fate, some say it's chance  
Some say it's the blood of our fathers on our hands  
Some say it's a lie, some say it's the truth  
Some say it's all coming down on me and you  
  
And I see a fire in the sky  
And I hear the thunder out on the edge of night  
  
It's gonna rain, yeah  
Wash it all away, yeah  
And it ain't gonna stop  
No, it ain't gonna stop  
For forty days  
  
Some say the stars will fall down from heaven  
Some say the angels will cry and ask us why  
  
It's gonna rain yeah  
It's gonna rain  
Oh, it's gonna rain  
It's gonna rain, rain, rain, yeah  
Wash it all away  
(It's gonna rain) for forty days  
(It's gonna rain) for forty days  
(It's gonna rain) for forty days  
(It's gonna rain) for forty days  
(It's gonna rain)  
(It's gonna rain)  
(It's gonna rain)  
(It's gonna rain)
