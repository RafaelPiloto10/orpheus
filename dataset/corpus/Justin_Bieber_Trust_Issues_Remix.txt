[Hook - Justin Bieber]  
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from  
I'mma sing until I feel it, I'mma go until it's done  
And I don't mean to say wassup and my excuse is that I'm young  
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told you  
I'm on one, you know, I'm on one  
I said I'm on one, you know, I'm on one  
Two white cups and I got that drink could be purple could  
Be pink depending on how you mix that ish money that  
We got, never get that ish, cause I'm on one, you know I'm one one  
  
You know what I like  
Oh yeah, oh yeah (x2)  
  
[Justin Bieber]  
You just need to listen, teach you how to fix it  
Cause you're cause I don't trust these women  
I don't trust these women, they might catch me slipping  
So, you're the only one cause I don't trust these women  
They might catch me slipping and put in something different  
So you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches  
I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me simping  
So you're the only one  
  
Trust issues

Drizzy Drake, check me out  
Coming live from the mothafucking North Side  
Kick game, run game, run it real good  
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside  
Same nigga that you knew way back when  
You acting like it's somebody you don't know  
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends  
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?  
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell  
Certain people don't like me no more  
New shit don't excite me no more  
Guess that they don't really make em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself  
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself  
But still, let them girls in and tell them all  
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them  
I'm all day with it man, A. M to the P. M  
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him  
  
[Justin Bieber]  
That's that ish that drives me crazy  
And that's all I've been getting lately  
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in  
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them  
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you
