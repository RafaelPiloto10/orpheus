I'm leaving to search for something new,  
Leaving everything I ever knew.  
A hundred years in the sunshine  
Hasn't taught me all there is to know.  
  
In the valley, we will gather there,  
Helpless in our surrender.  
Tomorrow the plow becomes the sword  
Make us stronger in our danger.  
  
Time will pass away,  
Time will guard our secret.  
I'll return again  
To fight another day.  
  
[Repeat x3]  
I'd have to be a warrior  
A slave I couldn't be  
A soldier and a conqueror,  
Fighting to be free
