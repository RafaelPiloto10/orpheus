I am the searcher of my fortunes  
I've got my right hand on the wheel  
We've got to dig for buried treasures  
I know exactly how i feel  
  
I went walkin'through a grave-yard  
Where the darkness is my friend  
I heard all about the beginning  
I want to see just where it ends  
  
I have fed the jaded tiger  
And every tiger knows my name  
But just as long as long as i can see my face  
I can tell myself my name  
  
Don't want to live inside myself  
I'm much better of alone  
But then you must believe in the fallin'rain  
In the morning  
  
Bury me down by the river  
Saved by the bell  
Man for all seasons
