I've got a livin' that's rough, a future that's tough  
You know what I mean  
Blankers and boasters, all the bluffers and posers  
I'm not into that scene  
  
You can tell me that I got no class  
Look around, you'll see who's laughin' last  
Don't give me speeches 'cause they're oh so droll  
Leave me alone, let me rock and roll  
  
Got an itchin' to rock, a hate for small talk  
I'm funny that way  
Got my sights on the stars, won't get that far  
But I'll try anyway  
I just like to please, don't like to tease  
I'm easy like that  
Don't like long rests, I must confess  
I'm an impatient cat  
  
I do the best that I can  
I'm just what I am  
I do the best I can  
Well, I know what I am  
  
Rock and rollin's a scream, makin' millions my dream  
Well, I do that a lot  
I'll just give it a try, won't let good times pass me by  
They're all I've got
