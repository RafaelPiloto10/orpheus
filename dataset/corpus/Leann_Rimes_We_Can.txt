They'll try to stop the dream we're dreamin'  
But they can't stop us from believing  
They will fill your head with doubt  
But that won't stop us now  
So let them say we can't do it  
Put up a road block  
We'll just run right through it 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
We can do the impossible  
We have the power in our hands  
And we won't stop 'cause we've got  
To make a difference in this life  
With one voice, one heart, two hands, we can  
  
They say the odds are stacked against us  
But that can't hold us back, we will be relentless  
There's a voice they're gonna hear  
A voice so loud and clear  
So let them say we can't do it, give us a mountain, and we're gonna move it
'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're gonna make a change today (make a change today)  
Because we've got the faith it takes  
To win this race, so let them say we can't do it  
Put up a road block  
And we'll just run right through it 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can (oh I can)  
Do the impossible (do the impossible)  
I have the power in my hands, and I won't stop  
Cause I've got to make a difference in this life  
With my one voice, one heart, two hands, we can
