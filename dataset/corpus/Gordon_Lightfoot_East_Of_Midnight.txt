Put me somewhere east of midnight  
West of the turnpike  
Anywhere I wander  
Is where I'll take my rest  
As I lie down, toss some thoughts around  
Dreams I'm told will come true if you  
Believe in those who love you right now  
Sea of dreams I long for you  
Forget about the others  
This is my hike, you can come if you like  
To feel good, I would help you if I could  
But I am out here searching  
For the things that might have been  
I need no more reminders  
Not one love letter have I seen  
And that's a pretty good start  
The ocean is where lovers meet again  
Sea of dreams by all means  
Float me out of danger until then  
Forever amen  
It's a long, long hike  
We'll be leavin' early travelin' light  
That's alright heaven will be ours tonight  
The road is paved with moonbeams  
There are faces that I knew  
They all came back to haunt me  
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you  
It takes a bit of my heart  
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore  
Sea of dreams from now on  
Forget about all the others  
Back where the line forms  
Destination sea of storms  
By all means ever onward sea of dreams  
Put me somewhere east of midnight  
Along about daylight  
Anywhere I wander  
Is where I'll take my rest  
If we could just lie down, love  
Toss some thoughts around  
It's a tough and a dirty long hike  
You can come if you like  
If we could just lie down  
Toss some thoughts around
