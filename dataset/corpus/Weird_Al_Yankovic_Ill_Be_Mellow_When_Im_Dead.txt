I don't care about your karma  
I don't care about what's hip  
No space cadet's gonna tell me what to do  
I won't swim in your jacuzzi  
You can't make me settle down  
I'd rather kick and jump and bite and scratch  
And scream until I'm blue  
I may as well be hyper as long as I'm still around  
'Cause I'll have lots of time to be laid back  
When I'm six feet underground  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
When are you cosmic cowboys  
Gonna get it through your heads?  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I can't stand the smell of incense  
I don't really like to jog  
No Joni Mitchell 8-tracks in my car, ooh  
I hate anything organic  
Even health food makes me sick  
You won't catch me sipping Perrier  
Down in some sushi bar, I tell you  
Now's the time to go for all the gusto you can grab  
You'll have plenty of time to be low-key  
When you're laid out on the slab  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
When are you cosmic cowboys  
Gonna get it through your heads?  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I don't want no part of that vegetarian scene  
I won't buy me a pair of designer jeans  
No redwood hot tub to my name  
I got all that I want and if it's all the same to you  
I don't need a course in self-awareness  
To find out who I am  
And I'd rather have a, a Big Mac or a Jumbo Jack  
Than all the bean sprouts in Japan  
So don't ask me what I'm into  
I don't need to prove I'm cool  
I'll break your arm if you ask me what's my sign  
I won't tell you where my head's at  
I don't need to see no shrink  
Psychosis may be in this year  
But I'm really not that kind  
And I'm in no hurry to be casual  
In fact, I think, I'll wait  
Until I'm pushing up the daisies  
Like wow, man, can you relate?  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead
