Now there's nothing left to do  
But to lay my head down for sleeping  
I'm weak with exhaustion and the lover's blues  
And I still can't forget those weeks I had with you  
  
But I guess it was only a summer love  
Nothing too serious and nothing to last  
I feel like a fool to be longing for that lyin' summer love  
  
Once we both loved just a bit too hard  
For deep down we both knew it was dyin'  
And we both talked just a little about forever  
But we both knew we were doing some lyin'.  
  
Now the snow falls, freezing my hurt for you  
But some nights I feel it's still there.  
I've come back now to the life I've known before you  
But I doesn't have the same old meaning.
