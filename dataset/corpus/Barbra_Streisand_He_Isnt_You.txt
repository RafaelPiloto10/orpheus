How could I be this at ease with him?  
Pour out my heart as I please with him?  
He isn't you...he isn't you...  
When will I feel so in bloom again?  
When will his voice warm the room again?  
He isn't you...he isn't you...  
Memories may fade in the shadows behind me  
But there'll be the dream  
That will always remind me - a dream that  
I'll be forever comparing him to...  
For love me, he may even die for me  
Sweep every cloud from the sky for me  
He may be king,  
But he'll never be you...
