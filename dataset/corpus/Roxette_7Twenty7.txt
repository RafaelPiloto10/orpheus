7twenty 7 is ready to move  
You know she packed her bags  
With nothing left to prove  
I thought I didn't care  
Now I'm fallin' through  
Wouldn't you?  
  
Well, it's a long long journey to the other side  
Oh I've been wishin' all night I was on that flight  
And god, you'd better take care of the sweetest eyes  
I hear myself swallowin' the tears I cry  
I hear myself swallowin' the tears I cry  
  
7twenty7 is up in the air  
You know I feel her hands  
On me everywhere  
I thought I didn't care  
Now i'm saying a prayer  
Hey mister, do you know the way  
To salvation square?  
  
It's a long long winter 'til the birds will sing  
Oh I'll be waitin' all night for the phone to ring  
I'm goin' up in smoke and phoney magazines  
Everything is just pieces of my stupid dreams  
Everything is just spieces of my stupid dreams  
  
With the clouds passin' by  
With the clouds passin' by  
It's all right  
  
7twenty7 is close to the sky  
It carries the world  
Between hello and goodbye  
Like the Monday we met  
That disappeared in a breath  
Like the Sunday she left  
Forever smellin' of death  
  
Another jet black night, another drink to go  
Oh I'll be diving my head in the pure white snow  
God, you'd better take care of this gold skinned friend  
Tell me, will I ever see her again  
Tell me, will I ever see her again
