Some are winners some are losers and some are fighters till the day they  
Die some try to make a living some others always give in many are  
Stopped before they get to try and many others are forced to leave their  
Countries they lose their families they lose sleep as soon as they are  
Gone they are forgotten but you see their tears crash on the beach you  
Can see their tears crash on the beach you can see their tears crash on  
  
Maybe a winner maybe a loser but I'm a fighter till the day I die  
It took a lifetime to cross the breadline to be a victim of accusing  
Eyes and many others are forced to leave their countries they lose their  
Families they lose sleep as soon as they are gone they're forgotten but  
You see their tears crash on the beach you can see their tears crash on  
The beach you can see their tears crash on
