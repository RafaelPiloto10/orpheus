I could say you never need to doubt.  
Lie and say you only need to shout.  
But life can chew you up and spit you out.  
Life can chew you up and spit you out.  
  
And I'm not going to be there,  
And you won't always take care,  
But my love goes with you,  
Wherever you roam.  
  
I picture you all around ten.  
But now you've grown to women and to men.  
Things will never be the same again.  
Things can never be the same again.  
  
And I'm not going to be there,  
And you won't always take care,  
But my love goes with you,  
Wherever you roam.  
No matter where you are in the world,  
You're still my boys and you're still my girls,  
And my love goes with you,  
Wherever you roam.  
  
Ooh ooh, sometimes this life's unkind.  
Ooh ooh, sometimes this life's unkind.  
It can take your mind.  
Take your mind and it'll test you  
Again, again, again, again, again,  
Again, again, again, again.  
  
And I'm not going to be there,  
And you won't always take care,  
But my love goes with you,  
Wherever you roam.  
No matter where you are in the world,  
You're still my boys and you're still my girls,  
And my love goes with you,  
Wherever you roam.  
Wherever you roam.
