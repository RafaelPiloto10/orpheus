Listen, hear he is inside  
One who lives while others lie  
I close my eyes and walk a thousand years  
A thousand years that aren't mine  
It seems he's near me when I walk  
One who loved what love denied  
He lives these years that I walk blind  
All these years can not be mine  
  
Tomorrow begat tomorrow  
Begat tomorrow  
Begat tomorrow  
  
A thousand doors a thousand lies  
Rooms a thousand years wide  
He walks in the cold sun and wind  
All these years can not begin  
  
Tomorrow begat tomorrow  
Begat tomorrow  
Begat tomorrow
