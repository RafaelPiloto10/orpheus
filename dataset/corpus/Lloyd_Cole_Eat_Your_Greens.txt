Don't hesitate, there is no time like now  
For you to break the habits of a lifetime  
Babe, get on your pony and ride  
Make no mistake, we're gonna cry at your funeral  
T-bone steak, french fries for heaven's sake,  
Your belly's bigger than your eyes  
All you could eat for a dollar and a dream  
And the drinks are on the house at the funeral parlor  
If you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
(wake up, time to fly)  
Sugar kiss, sugar kicks like a mule  
Ain't that the truth, and you're a strawberry fool  
Look at your hips, look at the cream in your coffee  
You could whip it, or we could cry at your funeral  
If you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
Well if you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey hey hey  
Well if you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
If you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
If you don't know  
If you don't know  
What's good  
If you don't know
