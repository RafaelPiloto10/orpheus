I want to go up to detroit  
I want to lie in the shade  
I want to visit the president  
And then I want to get laid  
  
I want to go down to memphis  
I want to talk to the king  
I want to tell him we're sorry  
And it won't happen again  
  
I've got a photo of james joyce  
It's a photo by man roy  
It's not very very much like him  
But it's not for me to say  
  
She sacrifices her body  
Almost every night  
Just like a lamb to the slaughter  
And she thinks it makes him feel right  
  
  
You gave me so many problems  
You made me crash in my car  
I'll have a martini cocktail  
And then we'll see where we are  
  
So just be nice to your brother  
I'll take your sister to bed  
And I can bloc bloc bloc till the weekend  
But you'd better come back soon
