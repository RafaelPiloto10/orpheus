I know it's not over  
Baby I worked this out for sure  
It's gonna be colder  
Now you force open the door  
I know you better  
than I ever have before  
I know you  
  
I know you're a fighter  
But you never fought for me  
When I was a shelter  
'Cause you're not heading home to me  
We could be closer  
We could be closer  
We could be  
  
When it's just us, you show me what it feels like to be lonely  
You show me what it feels like to be lost  
I'll take your hand for you to let it go let it go let it go  
When it's just us, you show me what it feels like to be lonely  
You show me what it feels like to be lost  
I'll take your hand for you to let it go let it go let it go let it go  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
  
We'll take a long walk  
Down the alleys of these houses  
And we'll talk  
See what conversation rouses  
When we're alone  
When we're alone, it could be home  
  
When it's just us, you show me what it feels like to be lonely  
You show me what it feels like to be lost  
I'll take your hand for you to let it go let it go let it go let it go  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be better  
It's gonna be better
