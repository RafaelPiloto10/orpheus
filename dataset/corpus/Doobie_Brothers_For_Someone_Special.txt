Tiran porter  
Well, I thought you'd be back on the track  
But I guess I was wrong, man  
For the look in your eyes was the same  
Empty high that you'd shown  
As I ran down the road I'd forgotten this load was upon you  
So the band packed it's bags and played on, goodbye  
It's been years since I cried  
But this feeling inside really hurt me  
And you know that we're loyal  
Through the years of hard toil we stood by  
But our licks' gotten better  
I thought you could weather the good times  
So I guess that it's hard to leave  
Bad times and downers behind  
So it came down to sayin'  
You haven't been playin' for so long  
That our heads caked with rust  
And the dust of a million sad sighs  
In the mornings I've tried  
To reach down inside  
And push that nightmare away  
Now I'm glad that it's over, it's over  
Now I can play
