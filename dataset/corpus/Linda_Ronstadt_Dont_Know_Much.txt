Look at this face I know the years are showing.  
Look at this life I still don't know where it's going.  
  
I don't know much but I know I love you.  
That may be all I need to know.  
  
Look at these eyes they never seen what matters.  
Look at these dreams so beaten and so battered.  
  
I don't know much but I know I love you.  
That may be all I need to know.  
  
So many questions still left unanswered.  
So much I've never broken through.  
And when I feel you near me,sometimes I see so clearly.  
That only truth I'll never know is me and you.  
  
Look at this man so blessed with inspiration.  
Look at this soul still searching for salvation.  
  
I don't know much but I know I love you.  
That may be all I need to know.  
  
I don't know much but I know I love you.  
That may be all I need to know.  
  
I don't know much but I know I love you  
That may be all there is to know.
