Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When I saw you walking down the street  
I said that's the kind of girl I'd like to meet  
She's so pretty, Lord she's fine. I'm gonna make her mine all mine  
  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When you turned and walked away, that's when I want to say now  
Come on baby give me a whirl, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When you turned and walked away, that's when I wanna say  
Come on baby give me a whirl, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey, hey, hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl
