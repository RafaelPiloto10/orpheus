I'd like to see you before I go  
There's a few things I'd like to do  
And when you're gone, you'll be gone for long  
And soon I'll be gone too  
  
But don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it, ooh  
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it  
  
Are you happy with the color of your tea  
Could you use some sugar now?  
You're satisfied with your boy or your girl  
Your little butter cup  
  
But don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it  
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it.  
  
I'd like to see you before I go  
There's a few things I'd like to do  
And when you're gone, you'll be gone for long  
And soon I'll be gone too  
  
But don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it  
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it
