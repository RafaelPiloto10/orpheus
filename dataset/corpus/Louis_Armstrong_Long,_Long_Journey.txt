Sometimes I feel so weary  
Traveling through life all alone  
Sometimes I feel so weary  
Traveling through life all alone  
  
It's a long, long journey  
And I can't make it on my own  
  
There's seven million people  
Living right here in this town  
There's seven million people  
Living right here in this town  
  
I don't need but one person  
So, baby, why won't you, please, stay around?  
  
When the sun turns blue  
And the moon shines bright all day  
When the sun turns blue  
And the moon shines bright all day  
  
That's the day, sweet mama  
I'll let you run away  
  
When the rivers stop flowing  
And the trees lay down and die  
I said, when the rivers stop flowing  
And the trees lay down and die  
  
When the stars stop shining  
Then I'll say my love's goodbye  
  
Now if I've been misbehaving  
I promise you I'll stop  
But if you quit me, mama  
I swear I'll blow my top  
  
It's a long, long journey  
But I'll make it before I'm blue  
This world can't throw me  
Mama, if I still have you
