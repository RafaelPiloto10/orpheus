I've lived life in a single room  
Hiding my scars from the moon  
I dream my dreams in the light  
  
Rehearse the lines I already know  
Basking in the tv's glow  
And pray that tonight is the night  
  
Oh, there's gotta be more than this  
A future hanging on a stranger's kiss  
Could it be I'm not so alone  
  
I'm someone special  
I'm just in disguise  
I may not be perfect  
In everyone's eyes  
It may not be tomorrow  
But I still believe  
There's someone special  
Waiting out there for me  
  
I guess the joke hasn't hit me yet  
Cause I'm still waiting on my juliet  
She must be held up somewhere  
  
Ooh, she will be the air I breathe  
She'll come for good and never want to leave  
And I'll love her only, I swear  
  
People say there must be something wrong  
For me to be all alone so long  
And their words hit me like a stone  
  
I'm someone special  
I'm just in disguise  
I may not be perfect  
In everyone's eyes  
It may not be tomorrow  
But I still believe  
There's someone special  
Waiting out there for me  
  
Lying in bed in a cold, cold sweat  
Dreaming 'bout women I'll never get  
I won't always be sleeping alone  
  
I'm someone special  
I'm just in disguise  
I may not be perfect  
In everyone's eyes  
It may not be tomorrow  
But I still believe  
There's someone special  
Waiting out there for me
