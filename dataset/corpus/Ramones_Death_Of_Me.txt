We've got to stop this crazy carrying on  
It's gonna be the death of you stop this crazy  
Carrying on it's gonna be the death of me  
It's gonna be the end you see it's gonna be the death of we  
  
If we don't stop this crazy carrying on  
It's gonna be the death of you stop this crazy  
Carrying on it's gonna be the death of me  
It's gonna be the end you see it's gonna be the death of me  
  
And I feel like I'm gonna die I don't feel so  
Good inside why baby-why, why, why?  
But I had a good time you know I had a good night  
  
We've got to stop this crazy carrying on  
It's gonna be the death of you stop this crazy  
Carrying on it's gonna be the death of me  
It's gonna be the end you see  
It's gonna be the death of me
