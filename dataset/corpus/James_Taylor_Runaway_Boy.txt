Fetch down the fiddle, rosin up the bow, don't play me nothing on the radio.  
Don't make me remember the Alamo, I'm feeling like a little bit of Cotton Eyed
Joe.  
No raging Cajun crawfish stew, fat batter coming in a Lumalamalu.  
Boy howdy and howdy damn do, something like fine setting eyes on you.  
Let me come down, I won't never go back up again, oh, hold me down.  
Let me come home, I won't never go away no more, oh let me come down.  
  
In a younger day back in Tennessee, the muddy Mississippi used to call to me,  
Float on a river and set yourself free.  
Run from the farm and the family tree, run from the runaway boy.  
  
So I've been all the places that I ever want to be, I've seen all the people
that I ever want to see.  
I'm sick and tired of being lonely and free, I'm ready today for what's
waiting on me.  
I'm gonna give up believing I was born to run, stop acting like a man that
gets shot from a gun.  
I'm putting down roots, I want to soak up sun and stay right here until my
days are done.  
Let me back down, I will never go up again. Hold me down, tie me on down.  
Let me go home, I will never go away no more, oh let me come home, oh let me
go down.
