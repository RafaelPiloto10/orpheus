It's been a little fever and maybe Bucky Beaver  
Who made me pull the lever and leave once again  
We chose just not to marry but go ahead and carry  
All of our earthly goods and go to live out in the woods  
  
Midnight on the mountain and you watch the clouds roll by  
Country air's appealin' but there's more than meets the eye  
Meets the eye...  
  
Moonlight on the cabin and you're too damn cold to sleep  
Your head turns from my pillow so I can't see you weep  
See you weep...Sarah sleep  
  
Stoned alone together least the city streets have drains  
Standing here ass high up in the rain longin' for Boston  
Once again  
  
Sarah's cold and hungry and the baby's due any day  
Stuck up in high country and it don't thaw out 'til May  
Here we'll stay...  
  
Mountain fever's on me and tonight the truck broke down  
Doctor in the valley but we can't get in to town  
He don't come 'round  
  
Sarah cried for Boston and her mother late last night  
I reassured her everything was tight but I'm not sure that it's all  
right...  
  
Midnight on the mountain and you watch the clouds roll by  
Country air's appealin' but there's more than meets the eye  
Meets the eye
