Oh, now tell me where can you party, child, all night long?  
In the basement, down in the basement, yeah.  
Oh where can you go when your money gets low?  
In the basement, whoa down in the basement  
And if a storm is taking place, you can jam and still be safe  
In the basement, down in the basement, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Where can you dance to any music you choose?  
In the basement, whoa down in the basement  
Oh, you got the comforts of home, a nightclub too.  
In the basement, whoa down in the basement.  
There's no cover charge or fee and the food and drinks are free,  
In the basement, down in the basement  
  
Come on child, you can do it, you can do it, yeah  
  
In the basement, that's where it's at (4x)  
In the basement, in the basement, in the basement  
That's where its at

Where they don't , where they don't check you age at the door,  
In the basement, whoa down in the basement  
Barracuda and ? til your feet get sore  
In the basement, whoa down in the basement  
Do any dance you want to do, there's no one under you
