Oh Alabama  
The devil fools with the best laid plan.  
Swing low Alabama  
You got spare change  
You got to feel strange  
And now the moment is all that it meant.  
  
Alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders  
That's breaking your back.  
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch  
And a wheel on the track  
  
Oh Alabama  
Banjos playing through the broken glass  
Windows down in Alabama.  
See the old folks tied in white ropes  
Hear the banjo.  
Don't it take you down home?  
  
Alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders  
That's breaking your back.  
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch  
And a wheel on the track  
  
Oh Alabama.  
Can I see you and shake your hand.  
Make friends down in Alabama.  
I'm from a new land  
I come to you and see all this ruin  
What are you doing Alabama?  
You got the rest of the union to help you along  
What's going wrong?
