I know what you're like  
You're not sleepin' at night  
I know you're losing control  
I know your plans  
  
Where you're keeping your hands  
I know it's taking its toll  
Sweet little innocent girl  
Making your way in this world  
  
Something you're feeling tonight  
Tells you what's wrong and what's right  
You gotta keep me comin' (keep me comin')  
Keep me comin' (keep me comin')  
  
You gotta keep me comin' (keep me comin')  
Keep me comin' babe (keep me comin')  
Hands on my shoulders now  
You're getting bolder  
  
Your fears are slipping away  
Each little bite lets me know that you're ripe  
You're thinking maybe you'll stay  
Now that you're burning to know  
  
How far you're willing to go  
Now that it's under your skin  
Now that you're lettin' me in  
You gotta keep me comin'...  
  
Ooh yeah, comin', comin'  
Ooh yeah, right here, right now  
You gotta keep me comin'...
