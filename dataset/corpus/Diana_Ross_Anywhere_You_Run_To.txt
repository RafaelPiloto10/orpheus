(david roberts)  
Who will be the one you run to  
Whenever it's dark and cold outside  
And where will you go  
When you need a place to hide  
Baby, did you know that I'd loved you still  
But I won't relax until  
You're back in my arms  
Can't you see that my love is real  
Darling, anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know I'll find you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
'cause I must remind you  
I would sail a boat across the sea  
I would fly a plane to wherever you may be  
Think you should know  
That my love can only grow  
But if it's the last thing that I'll ever do  
I swear that I'll make it back to you  
Before you leave  
There's one thing that you must believe  
Darling, anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know I'll find you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
'cause I must remind you  
I would sail a boat across the sea  
I would fly a plane to wherever you may be  
Think you should know  
That my love can only grow  
But if it's the last thing that I'll ever do  
I swear that I'll make it back to you  
Before you leave  
There's one thing that you must believe  
Darling, anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know I'll find you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
'cause I must remind you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know I'll find you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
'cause I must remind you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know I'll find you...
