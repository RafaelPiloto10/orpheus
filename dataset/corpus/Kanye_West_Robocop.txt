Bout the baddest girl I ever seen  
Straight up outta movie scene  
Who knew she was a drama queen  
That'll turn my life to Stephen King's  
Up late night, like she on patrol  
Checkin' everything like I'm on parole  
I told her it's some things she don't need to know  
She never let it go, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Okay, okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now  
You never stop it now  
Okay, okay, okay, you will never stop it now  
We need to drop it now, drop it, drop it  
  
Cause I don't want no robocop  
You movin' like a robocop  
When did you become a robocop  
No, I don't need a robocop  
  
Just looking at your history  
You're like the girl from misery  
She said she ain't take it to this degree  
Well let's agree to disagree  
I know she kinda crazy but it turns me on  
Keep it up enough to keep it going on  
I told her it's some things she don't need to know  
She never let it go, oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause I don't want no robocop  
You movin' like a robocop  
When you become a robocop  
Somebody please make it stop  
  
Stop, drop, roll, pop  
Bitch, I'm cold,  
Ain't use to being, told stop  
So I can never be your Robot  
Fast or slow  
You can stay, you can go  
Now that you know, now that you know  
Yea I had her before, but that happened before  
You get mad when you know  
Soldiers don't ask me no more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Okay  
Okay  
Okay (hey hey)
