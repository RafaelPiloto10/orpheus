Fifty man dead for this golden chain  
each link forged by a poor mans claim  
mined from below with sweat and fear  
brought to a shine with a widows tear  
fifty man dead for this diamond ring  
dat take da shine off the cheap blingting  
kinda mek you tink it no bonafide  
fi wear souviners from de man dat died  
  
CHORUS  
  
Ali singing..........  
  
If you really love me  
then don't buy me a ring  
diamonds and pearls  
they don't mean anything  
all that i want  
is already here  
sitting by my side  
you've got nothing to fear  
  
CHORUS  
  
Fifty man dead for this golden band  
underground with a pick in their hand  
cutting dirt where the sun not shine  
digging to survive in the mans gold mine  
how many dead for this royal crown  
this holy shrine we gather round  
worship the dollar pon your hands and knees  
humbled in the presence of your jewelery  
  
CHORUS  
  
Ali's bit
