This is the city of the dead  
As we lie side by side in bed  
I'd do something else instead  
But it is the city of the dead  
  
We went out kickin' around  
But you got drunk an' fallen down  
An' I wished I could be like you  
With the Soho River drinking me down  
  
In the city of the dead  
Fall in love an' fall in bed  
It wasn't anything you said  
Except I know we both lie dead  
  
Don't you know where to cop  
That's what New York Johnny said  
You should get to know your town  
Just like I know mine  
  
While all the windows stare ahead  
An' the streets are filled with dread  
Every nation in the world  
Slinks through the alley after girls  
  
What we wear is dangerous gear  
It'll get you picked on anywhere  
Though we get beat up we don't care  
At least it livens up the air  
  
But someday's we hide inside  
All courage gone and paralyzed  
Sniff that wind of ugly tension  
Today the jerks have got aggression  
  
It is the city of the dead
