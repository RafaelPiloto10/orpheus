I never thought the taste of you  
Would be the only thing to make me bleed  
Why am I, so alive  
While you lie still in the ground beneath me?  
  
Fear of death the dark inside  
Have become your only children  
They're in front of you, watching you  
Lost screams unholy dreams unrest  
  
I laugh at your god as he's passing through  
Slicing at your throat to warm my skin  
Never thought it'd come to this  
Fuck I've gone wrong no rest  
  
Your children still call  
Can't you hear them screaming out your name?  
You've gone insane, they're in my head  
They want you to, die in front of me, die in front of me  
  
Thinking why me?  
Wishing this was all a dream  
Insanity, reality, you're going to  
Die in front of me  
  
Pestilence is here, death awaits, your body is not of Christ  
It's my alter, helpless and alone, violate, enveloped in my skin  
Faceless canvass, tearing all your flesh, bathed in blood  
Violently regress, death's so endless, brutal is your pain  
  
Anguish is a game, broken and afraid, god can't help you now  
You'll wish your in hell, ghostly figures are always standing still  
Are they mocking me, what do they see?  
I didn't want your death to end so fast, but once you start, you cannot stop  
  
I need it now, to fucking last, die in front of me  
Die in front of me, thinking why me?  
Wishing this was all a dream, insanity, reality  
You're going to  
  
Die in front of me, pestilence is here, death awaits  
Your body is not of Christ  
It's my alter, brutal is your pain, anguish is a game  
Broken and afraid, god can't help you now  
  
You'll wish your in hell, I never thought the taste of you  
Would be the only thing to make me bleed, all alone in my  
Funeral home, playing in blood there's just got to be  
Something's wrong with me, draining veins, it's all the same  
  
The torture in my head, it won't stop, until I am fucking dead  
Pestilence is here, death awaits, your body is not of Christ  
It's my alter, helpless and alone, violate, enveloped in my skin  
Faceless canvass, tearing all your flesh, bathed in blood  
  
Violently regress, death's so endless, brutal is your pain  
Anguish is a game, broken and afraid, god can't help you now  
You'll wish your in hell
