EPONINE  
Don't you fret, Monsieur Marius,  
I don't feel any pain.  
A little fall of rain  
Can hardly hurt me now.  
You're here, that's all I need to know.  
And you will keep me safe,  
And you will keep me close,  
And rain will make the flowers grow.  
  
MARIUS  
But you will live, 'Ponine,  
Dear God above!  
If I could heal your wounds with words of love!  
  
EPONINE  
Just hold me now, and let it be,  
Shelter me,  
Comfort me...  
  
MARIUS  
You would live a hundred years  
If I could show you how.  
I won't desert you now.  
  
EPONINE  
The rain can't hurt me now.  
This rain will wash away what's past!  
And you will keep me safe,  
And you will keep me close,  
I'll sleep in your embrace at last!  
The rain that brings you here is heaven-blessed!  
The skies begin to clear and I'm at rest.  
A breath away from where you are,  
I've come home from so far...  
  
EPONINE  
So don't you fret, Monsieur Marius,  
I don't feel any pain.  
A little fall of rain  
Can hardly hurt me now.  
  
MARIUS (singing in counterpoint to Eponine)  
Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine,  
You won't feel any pain.  
A little fall of rain  
Can hardly hurt you now.  
  
MARIUS  
I'm here,  
  
EPONINE  
That's all I need to know.  
  
EPONINE  
And you will keep me safe,  
And you will keep me close,  
  
MARIUS (in counterpoint)  
I will stay with you,  
'Til you are sleeping...  
  
EPONINE  
And rain,  
  
MARIUS  
And rain,  
  
EPONINE  
Will make the flowers...  
  
MARIUS  
Will make the flowers...grow.
