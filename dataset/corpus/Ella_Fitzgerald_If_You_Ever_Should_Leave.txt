If you ever should leave  
Why would I want to live?  
Darling, you must believe  
Won't you try to forgive  
What a fool I would be  
If I fooled with your love for me?  
I'd be wrong from the start  
I'd be unfair to my heart  
So whatever you do  
Don't you say that we're through  
I'd do nothing but grieve  
If you ever should leave  
  
Oh, what a fool I would be  
If I fooled with your love for me  
I'd be wrong from the start  
I'd be unfair to my heart  
So whatever you do  
Don't you say that were through  
I'd do nothing but grieve  
If you ever should leave  
I'd do nothing but grieve  
If you ever should leave
