There are those who can live  
With the things they don't believe in  
They are giving up their lives  
For something that is less than it can be  
  
Some have longed for a home  
In a place of inspiration  
Some will find the emptiness inside  
By giving it all for the things that they believe  
They believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe it's just a dream in me  
Maybe it's just my style  
Maybe it's juat the freedom that I've found  
Given the possibility  
Of living up to the dream in me  
You know I'll be reaching for higher ground  
  
I will stand on my own  
I will live up to the vision  
I will trust in what I feel  
I'd follow my heart until it brings me home  
Brings me home  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Keep me through the night  
Lead me to the light  
Teach me the magic of wonder  
Give me the spirit to fly  
  
[Chorus: x2]
