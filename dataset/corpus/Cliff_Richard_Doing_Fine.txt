Don't feel bad,don't feel good,  
Feel alright ''cause I'm doing as I should,  
Don't look back,no I don't have the time,  
I guess I'm doing fine.  
  
Got no bags to slow me down,  
Travelling light but my feet are on the ground,  
Got no message,I ain't got a dime,  
I guess I'm doing fine.  
  
Don't need no paper telling me bad news,  
No politician giving their views,  
Don't need no doctor to tell me I'm well,  
I feel like heaven and I've been through hell.  
  
Talking straight I don't feel confused,  
Don't want nothing,I've got nothing more to lose,  
Don't need no credit,don't show me where to sign,  
I guess I'm doing fine.  
I guess I'm doing fine.  
I guess I'm doing fine.  
  
Don't come looking for me,  
'Cause I'm doing fine,  
No missing persons,  
''cause I'm doing fine,  
Don't go home,  
'cause I'm doing fine.
