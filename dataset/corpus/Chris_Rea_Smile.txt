Smile  
You don't have to spend your days in clouds  
Hiding from the sun  
Take a look around and see  
It's not that easy for anyone  
  
Smile  
You don't have to put that kind of stuff  
On a friend like me  
Or anybody else you see  
So come on and smile  
  
Rain comes falling down on everyone  
Teardrops running from the sky  
Too many nights are spent unspoken  
Oh, dry your eyes  
  
Smile  
Cos you don't have to spend your days in clouds  
Hiding from the sun  
Take a look around and see  
It's not that easy  
Take a look around and smile
