Dear Mama, well here's a letter from your girl  
Well I think my city days are done gone  
And it ain't been three weeks since I came  
And Mama, do remember what you said  
Say your prayers before you go to bed child  
And remember city boys ain't the same  
  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still  
How I wish I was home mom  
Where the blue grass is growin'  
  
And the sweet country boys don't complain  
And mama, so much perfume  
I thought I drank  
And the lord didn't seem to be nowhere around  
Hey, I felt just like a flower from the vine  
  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still  
How I'd like to be home mom  
Where the blue grass is growin'  
  
And the light shimmers and it shines  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still
