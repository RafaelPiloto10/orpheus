George Washington was the president  
But now he's dead (dead)  
Mackenzie King was Prime Minister  
But now he's dead (dead)  
  
So don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
  
Oppenheimer built the bomb  
But now he's dead (dead)  
Einstien was very very smart  
But not enough not to be dead (dead)  
  
So don't go into science  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into science  
You'll end up dead  
And don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
  
Jimi Hendrix, Janice Joplin, Brian Jones, Keith Moon,  
Jim Morrison, Roy Orbison,  
John Lennon, Bob Marley, Leonard Bernstien, Elvis Presley  
Well, we're not too sure about Elvis  
But I think you get the point  
  
Don't go into music  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into music  
You'll end up dead  
And don't go into science  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
  
Break it down  
You'll be burned, you'll be fried  
You'll be buried alive  
And there's no hope thinkin'  
That you're gonna survive  
'Cause there's the drowning and choking  
And cancer from smoking  
And smothered while sleeping  
And blood will start seeping  
  
So I have found, you'll end up in the ground  
And you'll be dead  
So I have found, you'll end up in the ground  
I wish there was an option instead  
But you'll be dead  
Dead  
Maybe with a bullet in your head  
But you'll be dead  
Dead  
Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very dead
