You can lead a horse to water  
You can lead a lamb to slaughter, oh yeah  
But the way she let me on her  
Well there ought to be a law girl  
  
But it's all over now 'cause I'm free born  
If you want my heart then it's yours  
My heart is my own,  
You can wrap it up and take it home  
  
If I take you for my lover  
You might break my heart all over, oooh yeah  
I can't stand to leave romances  
When you fall you take your chances  
  
But I don't care now 'cause I'm free born  
If you want my heart then it's yours  
My heart is my own,  
You can wrap it up and take it home
