What is this that stands before me?  
Figure in black which points at me  
Turn around quick, and start to run  
Find out I'm the chosen one  
Oh nooo!  
  
Big black shape with eyes of fire  
Telling people their desire  
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling  
Watches those flames get higher and higher  
Oh no, no, please God help me!  
  
Child cries out for his mother  
Mother's screaming in the fire  
Satan points at me again  
Opens the door to push me in  
Oh nooooo!  
  
Is it the end, my friend?  
Satan's coming 'round the bend  
people running 'cause they're scared  
The people better go and beware!  
No, no, please, no!
