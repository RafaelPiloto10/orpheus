I grabbed that telephone  
I thought we were alone  
Telling me there's company  
Your husband's comin' home  
I've been thinking about this Saturday night with you  
I've been thinking about it all week long  
And now I'm gonna lose it 'cause that  
Son-of-a-bitch got me singin' that same old song  
Got one foot out the door  
Tryin' to hit the road  
Ain't no match for your mean old man  
I think it's time to roll  
Got one foot out the door  
Got one foot out the door  
Think I'm gonna fight him?  
Don't you let him put down  
Put that to the floor  
Put the pedal to the metal  
And you beat it out of town  
No comin' back, back for more
