Looking up to the sky,  
Made me realize,  
Made me want to fly.  
  
To a place far away,  
Where they're singing songs,  
And making love all day.  
  
Somewhere beyond the sun,  
Where an atom splits,  
And an ounce is a ton.  
  
So don't you be late,  
I see the Beacon Light and it's on,  
So strap on that jammy pack,  
Fuel it up,  
Cause I'm gone.  
  
The people all dance,  
With their big long arms,  
And a peach in their pants.  
  
Picking fruit from the sky,  
As the demon ship,  
Goes passing them by.  
  
I don't know if it's love,  
But it's coming down,  
From the heaven's above.  
  
So don't you be late,  
I see the Beacon Light and it's on.  
So strap on that jammy pack,  
Fuel it up,  
Cause I'm gone.  
  
So don't you be late,  
I see the Beacon Light and it's on  
So strap on that jammy pack,  
Fuel it up,  
'Cause I'm gone
