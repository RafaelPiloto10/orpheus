Christ the Redeemer towering high over Rio  
Rio de Janeiro, Rio  
Where they held a summit to save the world  
And to mark the time when development  
As traditionally understood-had failed  
And the affluent North raping the South  
Investment from the North means  
Economic bondage for the South  
Under the burden of debt payments  
I was with a whore in Copenhagan  
Drinking eight hundred dollars worth of  
Champagne in kroner  
She came from Rio  
We were trying to save the world  
We did not get what we wanted  
She wanted money  
She did not get what she wanted  
I missed my wife  
I did not get what I wanted  
Death sat on my lap  
Death sits on all our laps  
While Christ the Redeemer  
Towers high over Rio  
Rio de Janeiro.  
Rio
