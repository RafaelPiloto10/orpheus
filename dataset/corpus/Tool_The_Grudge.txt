Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.  
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.  
Desperate to control all and everything.  
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.  
  
Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.  
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.  
Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.  
Terrified of being wrong. Ultimatum prison cell.  
  
Saturn ascends, choose one or ten. Hang on or be humbled again.  
  
Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.  
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.  
Saturn ascends, comes round again.  
Saturn ascends, the one, the ten. Ignorant to the damage done.  
  
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.  
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.  
Desperate to control all and everything.  
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.  
  
Wear the grudge like a crown. Desperate to control.  
Unable to forgive. And we're sinking deeper.  
  
Defining, confining, controlling, and we're sinking deeper.  
  
Saturn comes back around to show you everything  
Let's you choose what you will not see and then  
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again  
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent.  
  
Saturn comes back around. Lifts you up like a child or  
Drags you down like a stone  
To consume you till you choose to let this go.  
  
Give away the stone.  
Let the oceans take and trans mutate this cold and fated anchor.  
Give away the stone.  
Let the waters kiss and trans mutate these leaden grudges into gold.  
Let go.
