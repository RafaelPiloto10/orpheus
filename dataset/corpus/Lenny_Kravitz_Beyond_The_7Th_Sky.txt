Beyond the 7th sky  
There's a room where we are with God  
Beyond the sun and moon  
Where the angels will be our guard  
  
Where the weather doesn't change  
Everyday is summer  
As the sands are numbered  
Instead of cannonball grey  
  
Do you think it's kinda strange ?  
Or can we be lovers ?  
As the spirit covers our electrified rage  
  
Hold me mama  
And we'll fly across the sea  
Way beyond the moon and stars and sky  
I'm talkin' bout you and God and I  
  
Now that the time is near  
I'm ready I have no fear  
I know you're the one my dear  
The stars will come out tonight  
  
In time for our sacred flight  
Together we'll be for life  
And I will burn in your flame  
Kiss me baby  
Take my hand and come with me  
  
I'm talkin'bout the moon and stars and sky  
I'm talkin'bout you and God and I  
Let's take it to the place where life was formed  
And to the place where Jesus Christ was born
