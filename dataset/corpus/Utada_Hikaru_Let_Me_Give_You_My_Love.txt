What a day, young boy next door passed away  
Oh it makes me want to say  
I don't want to waste another day  
  
Can you and I start mixing gene pools  
Eastern, Western people  
Get naughty multilingual  
  
I was sort of like soul searching  
But your body's so jaw-dropping  
Our chemistry's groundbreaking  
Don't keep me waiting  
  
Hurry up, baby hurry up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up, baby giddy up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up, boy I know you're gonna like what I got  
  
Maybe it's not worth the wait  
Maybe I should walk away  
I don't want to waste my energy  
  
Can you and I stop acting like fools  
Or move on to other people  
It's funny, but I'd like to settle  
  
I was sort of like soul searching  
But your body's so jaw-dropping  
Some say it's rule breaking  
But times are changing  
  
Hurry up, baby hurry up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up, baby giddy up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up, boy I know you're gonna like what I got  
  
Let me know if what I'm feeling isn't mutual  
All I know is that I'm feeling very very hot hot hot  
  
Hurry up, baby hurry up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up, baby giddy up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up, boy I know you're gonna like what I got  
  
Hurry up, baby hurry up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up, baby giddy up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up, boy I know you're gonna like what I got
