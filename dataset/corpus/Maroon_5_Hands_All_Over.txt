Put your hands all over,  
Put your hands all over me,  
Put your hands all over,  
Put your hands all over me  
(Put your hands all over me)  
  
I can't seem to find  
A pretty little face I left behind  
Wandered out on the open road  
Looking for a better place to call home  
  
Gave her a place to stay  
And she got up and ran away  
And now I've had enough  
A pretty little face has torn me up  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please talk to me, talk to me  
Tell me everything, is gonna be alright  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please walk with me, walk with me now  
Love is a game you say  
Play me and put me away  
(Put your hands all over me)  
Oh  
  
Now you've lost your mind  
A pretty little girl I left behind  
And now you're getting rough  
But everybody knows you're not that tough  
  
She wandered out on the open road  
Looking for a place to call your own  
You're scared to death of the road ahead  
Pretty little thing don't get upset  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please talk to me, talk to me  
Tell me everything is gonna be alright  
(gonna be alright)  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please walk with me, walk with me now  
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away  
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away  
  
Put your hands all over me, ooh, woo  
Put your hands all over me, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Put your hands all over me, ooh (All over me)  
  
So come down off your cloud  
Say it now and say it loud  
Get up in my face  
Pretty little girl, come make my day  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please talk to me, talk to me girl  
Put your hands all over me  
Gotta walk with me, walk with me now (come on, woo)  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Gotta talk to me, talk to me (come on now babe)  
Put your hands all over me (woo)  
Gotta walk with me, walk with me  
  
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away  
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away  
  
(Put your hands all over me)  
Yeah (All over me)  
  
Put your hands all over  
Put your hands all over me
