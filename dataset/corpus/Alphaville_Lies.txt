baby  
what do i do  
playing my tune for you  
just to get you in the mood  
everybody's going to hollywood  
you're driving me mad  
but i'm smiling to the crowd instead  
a lot of money is at stake,  
this is a hit and that's a fake  
this is what you mean to me  
this is what they all should see  
make a make up in a foolish style  
telling the truth by making a big lie  
when i come, i come but nothing's at ease  
breaking up the whole is a modern disease  
maybe you think tomorrow's just a joke  
it's a joke after joke after joke after joke  
my love  
everything's an interview  
and nothing's really new  
and everybody's looking for clues  
and you know what to do with a clue  
my love  
get ready for the show  
they're waiting and they will never go  
this night is just a go  
and it's only for show  
dig that deal and be a millionaire  
drinking cocktails in the stratosphere  
getting jetlagged with my business friends in these supersonic wonderlands  
there's a flicker on the graphic display,  
first he's smiling then he's fading away  
maybe he thinks tomorrow's just a joke  
it's a joke after joke after joke after joke
