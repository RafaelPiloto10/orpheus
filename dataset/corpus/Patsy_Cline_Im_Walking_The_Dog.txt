I'm a-walkin' the dog and I'm never blue  
I'm a-walkin' that dog, I not thinkin' 'bout you  
I don't need no one to tie me down  
'Cause I'm walkin' that dog and a-paintin' the town  
  
Such an easy life, I never knew  
Well, I can't believe that it's really true  
Well, I'm a carefree gal that's seen the light  
And I'm a-walkin' that dog all the day and all night  
  
Well, I'm full of pep, I just can't grow old  
I got a one-track mind, so I've been told  
But I'm fancy free, I don't worry no how  
'Cause I'm walkin' that dog, all the law will allow  
  
Such an easy life, I never knew  
Until the day that I left you  
Well, I'm a carefree gal that's seen the light  
And I'm walkin' that dog all the day and all night
