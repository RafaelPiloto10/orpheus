I'm gonna tell you right up front  
So you will understand  
I ain't gonna waste your time  
'Cause I might not be your man  
We won't go makin' promises  
'Cause you know it just ain't right  
A promise is a promise, girl  
And tonight is just tonight  
Tonight is just tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't say that you love me  
If it don't feel right  
Don't say that you love me  
Just hold me tonight  
  
There ain't no need for broken hearts  
I know in time they mend  
Any fool can fall in love  
It's so easy to pretend  
Don't tell me I'm the only one  
If it doesn't mean a thing  
Let's take tonight for what it's worth  
And see what tomorrow brings  
And see what tomorrow brings  
  
[Chorus]
