Yeah, the rumors are true  
I deleted my Twitter  
Ha, can you believe it?  
I got 2, 2 million  
Then I said adios  
I had to say goodbye  
And this little rap is to tell my fans why  
Huh, uh!  
  
No, it wasn't because my friend told me to  
Y'all know very well, what you say I don't do  
And the reasons are simple  
I started tweetin' bout pimples  
I stopped livin' for moments  
And started livin' for people  
  
Yeah, you right what'cha doin'  
But who really cares  
If I'm playin' with Noah or just doin' my hair?  
Everything that I type  
And everything that I do  
All those lame gossip sites  
Take it and they make it news  
I want my private life private  
I'm done trying to please  
I ain't livin' for tabliods  
No, I'm livin' for me  
No more emo quotes  
And fake feuds with Demi  
Yeah, I'm done with all that  
And the truth is I'm too busy  
  
Yeah, I gotta admit  
I miss Dane Cook's tweets  
And I really liked looking at Katy Perry and Britney  
I might have some withdraws  
I was a little obsessed  
But I'm peacin' out  
And I'm leaving with this  
Ha, goodbye  
Ah, ah goodbye  
Freaky-freaky-freak-auuwww
