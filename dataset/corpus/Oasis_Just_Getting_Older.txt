It's nine o'clock  
I'm getting tired  
I'm sick of all my records  
And the clothes I bought today  
  
Am I cracking up  
Or just getting older ?  
  
I'm staying in  
I can't be bothered  
Making conversation with the friends  
That I don't know  
  
Am I cracking up  
Or just getting older ?  
  
And I bet that this is how life  
Turns out when you're finally grown  
And you know if this is my life  
I'll sit around all day and I'll moan  
  
I'm half way up to the bottom  
Of another bottle of my next best favourite friend  
  
I'm not cracking up  
I'm just getting older  
  
No I'm not cracking up  
I'm just getting older  
  
No I'm not cracking up  
I'm just getting older
