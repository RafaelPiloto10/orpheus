Whole world is watching us now  
It's a little intimidating  
But since there's no way to calm down  
Let's give them some amazing  
  
Let's make them remember  
Using one word  
Incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Let's make them remember  
We were incredible  
Simply incredible  
  
We even counted us all  
We were real sure we'd make it  
But, we learned no matter what they dish out  
It's nothing we can take it  
  
We'll go down in history  
They'll describe our love as  
Incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Let's make them remember  
We were incredible  
Simply incredible  
  
Everybody say oh  
Say oh  
Say no  
Say oh  
  
Let's make them remember  
They'll describe our love as  
Incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Let's make them remember  
We were incredible  
Simply incredible
