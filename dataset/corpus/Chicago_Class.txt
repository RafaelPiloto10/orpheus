Velma: Whatever happened to fair dealing?  
And pure ethics?  
And nice manners?  
Why is it everyone now is a pain in the ass?  
Whatever happened to class?  
  
Mama: Class.  
Whatever happened to, "Please, may I?"  
And, "Yes, thank you?"  
And, "How charming?"  
Now, every son of a bitch is a snake in the grass  
Whatever happened to class?  
  
Velma and Mama: Class!  
Ah, there ain't no gentlemen  
To open up the doors  
There ain't no ladies now,  
There's only pigs and whores  
And even kids'll knock ya down  
So's they can pass  
Nobody's got no class!  
  
Velma: Whatever happened to old values?  
  
Mama: And fine morals?  
  
Velma: And good breeding?  
  
Mama: Now, no one even says "oops"  
When they're passing their gas  
Whatever happened to class?  
  
Velma: Class.  
  
Velma and Mama: Ah, there ain't no gentlemen  
That's fit for any use  
And any girl'd touch your privates  
For a deuce.  
  
Mama: And even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass.  
  
Velma: And even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass.  
  
Velma and Mama: Nobody's got no class!  
  
Velma: All you read about today is rape and theft.  
  
Mama: Jesus Christ! Ain't there no deceny left?  
  
Velma and Mama: Nobody's got no class!  
  
Mama: Every guy is a snot.  
  
Velma: Every girl is a twat.  
  
Mama: Holy shit.  
  
Velma: Holy shit.  
  
Mama: What a shame.  
  
Velma: What a shame.  
  
Velma and Mama: What became... Of class?
