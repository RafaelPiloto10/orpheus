I know why I'm intrigued  
You keep surprisin' me  
Somewhere between the lines  
There's no way to define  
Every move you make  
Always never the same  
  
Call me mesmerized  
Somewhat hypnotized  
Somehow in conversation  
I'm lost in sweet temptation  
Every word you say  
Always never the same  
  
I can't count the ways  
You take my breathe away  
Always never the same  
  
I can't count the ways  
You take my breathe away  
Always never the same  
Always never the same  
Always never the same
