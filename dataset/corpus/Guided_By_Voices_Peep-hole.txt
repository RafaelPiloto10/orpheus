Give me the cost of the albatross  
And wear it 'round your neck for size  
Don't let it get you down  
I'm looking inside your house  
And oh and it smells so nice  
Your house always looks so nice  
maybe they're twice as high laughing  
Maybe the time is right you know  
Promise me not to leave  
I'm looking inside your brain  
And christ, it's a cluttered mess  
I love you, I must confess  
la la la la la...
