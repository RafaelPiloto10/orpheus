She comes from Boston  
Works at the jewelry store  
Down in the harbor  
Where the ferries come to shore  
She never really knew how good it would feel  
To finally find herself in a place so warm and real  
  
She wears a Red Sox cap  
To hide her baby dreads  
The girl she was in New England  
Is different now and dead  
In all the local bars  
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'  
She's from Boston  
  
She comes from Boston  
Talks to her family now and then  
Through e-mails and postcards  
She tries to explain to them  
That education and occupation will have to wait for now  
She loves the Rasta, reggae rhythms, her dreams have changed somehow  
  
She wears a Red Sox cap  
To hide her baby dreads  
The girl she was in New England  
Is different now and dead  
In all the local bars  
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'  
She's from Boston  
  
Her toes dig deep and deeper in the sand  
She's seduced by the sunsets and her new life at hand  
  
She wears a Red Sox cap  
To hide her baby dreads  
The girl she was in New England  
Is different now and dead  
In all the local bars  
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'  
She's from Boston  
  
She wears a Red Sox cap  
To hide her baby dreads  
From Boston  
She came to this island from Boston
