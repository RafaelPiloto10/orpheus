(Dave) Why d'you need taht money? (Lee) I lost Billies drugs, didn't get
parid. Now I'll lose me kneecaps. (Dave) shit, really? (Lee) I've always got
some bastard after me. I'm easy to hate. (Dave) You? But you're beautiful.
(Lee) What? (Dave) But you are. (Lee) Blokes don't go around calling other
blokes beautiful. (Dave) Well fit then. (Lee) Shut up. So, yopu ain't seeing
that Shell nomore then? (Dave) No. (Lee) Why not? (Dave) Why d'you think?
(Lee) We're only mocking about. (Dave) But it's the first time it's ever felt
right for me. Oh, I'll shut up. (Lee) No. (Dave) What? (Lee) I like your
accent.  
  
(Dave) give me hope give me one more kiss  
I've never felt a love as strong as this  
You're so cool and so warm to touch  
Since we've met I've wanted this so much  
  
(Together) never been closer to heaven  
Never been closer to heaven  
  
(Dave) Has anyone ever loved you? (Lee) Where I grew up they had this picture
of Jesus on the wall. Hippy looking geezer with a beard. They told me he loved
me. I thought, well that's all right init? When I die I'll meet him. I'm
laughing. When they used to say "what d'you wanna be when you grow up?" I'd go
"dead." No-one's ever told me they loved me. Not me mom, too smacked off her
nut. No-one in the homes. Not even someone e'd off their nut, you know. They'd
say it to everybody else but they'd never say it to me. Think tehre must be
something wroing with me. Listen mate  
  
Give me time, this is all new to me  
But I think we could learn together you and me  
It's good to kiss and do all that stuff  
But I'll tell you this, a hug would be enough  
  
(Together) never been closer to heaven  
Never been closer to heaven  
  
(Dave) Look stay. (Lee) I gotta go. (Dave) It's three in the morning. (Lee) I
got buisness, I'm sorry mate.
