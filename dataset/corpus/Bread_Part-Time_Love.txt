Part-time love  
I need somebody who's consistent  
With me  
Someone already there when I need  
Company  
'cause when l'm feeling low  
I don't want to have to go out  
Looking  
For a part-time kind of love  
  
And when the dreams and rainbows  
Start to disappear  
Don't want somebody up and running  
Out here  
'cause when you stop and start  
Baby it's just too hard upon  
My heart  
That part-time kind of love  
  
And I can't take you darling living here  
Wait and see  
I want somebody who's committed  
Now to me  
Somewhere, someday you'll have  
To take a chance  
So if you like the music baby  
Get up and dance  
  
And if we grow together daring to dream  
I know we'll find our shares of  
Peaches and cream  
And when the juices flow  
I don't want no no no excuses  
Just want your full time love  
For me  
Just want your full time love  
For me.
