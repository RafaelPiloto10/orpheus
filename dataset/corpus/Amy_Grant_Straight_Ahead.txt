Day by day, dream by dream.  
I fight to find the way to go.  
Every day opens a different door.  
Every dream shadows the one before.  
  
But slowly I can see  
The way you've made for me.  
Straight ahead, I can see your light.  
Straight ahead, through the dark.  
Straight ahead, there's no left or right.  
Straight ahead, to your heart.  
  
Carry on through the night,  
When the road is hard to find.  
Lying lights tell me to turn around.  
Lying thoughts tell me I'm lost not found.  
But clearly I can see  
You're waiting there for me.  
  
Straight ahead, I can see your light.  
Straight ahead, through the dark.  
Straight ahead, there's no left or right.  
Straight ahead, to your heart.  
Straight ahead, (straight ahead),  
Straight ahead, (straight ahead),  
Straight ahead, (straight ahead),  
Straight ahead, (straight ahead).  
  
Straight ahead (straight ahead), I can see your light.  
Straight ahead, through the dark (through the dark).  
Straight ahead, there's no left or right.  
Straight ahead, to your heart.  
Straight ahead
