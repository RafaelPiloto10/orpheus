"O God of Earth and Altar,  
Bow down and hear our cry,  
Our earthly rulers falter,  
Our people drift and die,  
The walls of gold entomb us,  
The swords of scorn divide,  
Take not thy thunder from us,  
But take away our pride."  
(G. K. Chesterton English Hymnal)  
  
Just a babe in the black abyss,  
No reason for a place like this,  
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,  
An easy way for the blind to go,  
A clever path for the fools who know  
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
She came to me with a serpent's kiss,  
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,  
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,  
So we lay in the black embrace,  
And the Seed is sown in a holy place  
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.  
  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
Bind all of us together,  
Ablaze with Hope and Free,  
No storm or heavy weather  
Will rock the boat you'll see.  
The time has come to close your eyes  
And still the wind and rain,  
For the one who will be King  
Is the Watcher in the Ring,  
It is You  
It is You
