I count the ways I let you down  
On my fingers and toes but I'm running out  
Clever words can't help me now  
I grip you tight but you're slipping out  
  
And I remember your eyes were so bright  
When I first I met you, so in love that night  
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight  
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry  
Beautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),  
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah  
  
When did the rain become a storm  
When did the clouds begin to form  
Yeah we got knocked off course by a natural force  
And well, we'll be swimming when it's gone  
  
And I remember your eyes were so bright  
When I first I met you, so in love that night  
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight  
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry  
Beautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),  
Your beautiful goodbye whoa (bye bye, bye bye)  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah  
  
All the pain you try to hide  
Shows through your mascara lines as they stream down from your eyes  
And let 'em go, let 'em fly  
Holding back won't turn back time  
Believe me, I've tried  
  
Your eyes were so bright  
And I remember your eyes were so bright  
I remember your eyes were so bright  
When I first I met you, how in love were we that night  
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight  
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry  
Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),  
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye), whoa  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), yeah yeah  
  
Beau, oh yeah
