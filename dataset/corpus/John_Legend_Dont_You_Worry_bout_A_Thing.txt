Everybody's got to pay  
But some don't know how to handle it  
Always reaching out in vain  
Just taking the things not worth having  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you worry bout a thing [x2]  
Mama  
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out  
  
You say your style of life's a drag,  
And that you must go other places,  
But just don't you feel too bad,  
When you get fooled by smiling faces,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you worry bout a thing [x2]  
Mama  
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooout  
When you get oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooofffff your trip  
  
Don't you worry bout a thing [x2]  
  
Don't you worry bout it  
  
[scatting]  
  
Don't you worry bout a thing [x2]  
Mama  
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out  
When you get off your trip  
  
Everybody needs a change  
A chance to check out the new  
But you're the only one to see  
The changes you take yourself through  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing [x2]  
Pretty Mama  
Cause I'll be standing on the sides when you check it out  
  
Don't you worry bout a thaaaaaaang. [x4]  
  
Don't you worry bout it  
  
[scatting]  
  
Don'tcha worry bout a thang [repeat]  
Don't worry [x5]
