father  
you're a sad old man  
your tawdry vest is gray  
  
memories  
of a former man  
are all your words convey  
  
father  
oh can't you see  
the tarnished robe you wear  
  
a crown  
for fools  
the people laugh  
you never seem to hear  
  
father  
you're life's a ship  
that's never been to sea  
  
the bottle  
that surrounds your life  
you'll sail eternally  
  
[keyboard solo]  
  
children  
please understand  
a man must stand alone  
  
and face a world  
he'll never know  
and never call his own  
  
ba ba bum bum  
ba ba bum bum  
ba ba bum bum  
ba ba bum bum  
ba ba bum bum  
ba ba bum bum  
ba ba bum bum  
ba ba bum bum  
[continue echo]  
  
father  
father  
father  
father  
father  
father  
[continue echo]
