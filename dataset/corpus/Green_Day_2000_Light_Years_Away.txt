I sit alone in my bedroom  
Staring at the walls  
I've been up all damn night long  
My pulse is speeding  
My love is yearning  
  
[Chorus]  
I hold my breath and close my eyes and  
Dream about her  
'Cause she's two thousand light years away  
She holds my malakite so tight so  
Never let go  
Cause she's two thousand light years away  
Years Away!  
  
I sit outside and watch the sunrise  
Lookout as far as I can  
I can't see her, but in the distance  
I hear some laughter,  
We laugh together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I sit alone in my bedroom  
Staring at the walls  
I've been up all damn night long  
My pulse is speeding  
My love is yearning  
  
I hold my breath and close my eyes and  
Dream about her  
'Cause she's two thousand light years away  
She holds my malakite so tight so  
Never let go  
'Cause she's two thousand light years away
