This race is already run  
Get off your horse, get on this train  
" Welcome to the real world "  
I said " Welcome to the real world "  
Are we rushing like the wind?  
Naked out and naked in  
" Welcome to the free world "  
I said " Welcome to the me world "  
Are we rushing like the wind?  
Put your lovin' arms around  
Did you lose your faith in God, no?  
Does your conscience always get you down?  
Fall to pieces, rough and tumble  
Does your conscience always get you down?  
These days it's all the mind  
It's Elemental  
Don't say your up when your down  
It's Elemental  
Put your lovin' arms around  
This your new year's resolution  
Put your lovin' arms around  
Nothing doing resolution  
Put your lovin' arms around  
Take another leap in the dark  
With a humble heart  
Do yourself some good  
What did you become?  
Patience, be sure  
Baby, baby  
These days it's all the mind  
It's Elemental  
Don't say your up when your down  
It's Elemental
