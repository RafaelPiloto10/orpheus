You could be my silver spring  
Blue-green colors flashin'  
I would be your only dream  
Your shinin' autumn ocean crashin'  
Don't say that she's pretty.  
And did you say that she loves you?  
Baby I don't want to know.  
  
So I'll begin not to love you  
Turn around, you'll see me runnin'  
I'll say I loved you years ago  
And tell myself you never loved me no  
Don't say that she's pretty.  
And did you say that she loves you?  
Baby I don't want to know oh no  
And can you tell me was it worth it?  
Baby, I don't want to know  
  
Time cast a spell on you but you won't forget me  
I know I could've loved you  
But you would not let me  
  
Time cast a spell on you but you won't forget me  
(I was such a fool)  
I know I could've loved you  
But you would not let me  
(Give me one more chance)  
I'll follow you down 'til the sound of my voice  
Will haunt you  
You'll never get away from the sound  
Of the woman that loves you
