All of my life, all of my life  
I've been searching for a love like ours  
Somewhere to stay, somewhere safe in your arms  
I was so sure  
Are you really saying your heart's changing  
Do you really mean goodbye  
  
Don't leave me this way, no, no  
Don't tell me it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
You're leading me nowhere  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way  
  
Say what's on your mind, one thing at a time  
And I promise you we'll talk it through  
Don't walk away, there's so much more to say  
Though my words seem lost on you  
Can't believe you're talking like we're just friends  
Can't you see the tears I cry  
  
Don't leave me this way, no, no  
Don't tell me it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
You're leading me nowhere  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way  
  
Are you really saying your heart's changing  
Do you really mean it this time  
Baby  
  
Don't leave me this way, oh no  
Don't tell me it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
You're leading me nowhere  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way  
No, don't tell me that it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (don't leave me this way)  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (oh you're gonna leave me now)  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way  
  
Don't leave me this way  
If you'll just take a little bit of time  
You just might want to change your mind  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way
