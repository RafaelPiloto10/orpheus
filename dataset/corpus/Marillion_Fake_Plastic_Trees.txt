Her green plastic watering can for her fake chinese rubber plant  
In the fake plastic earth.  
That she bought from a rubber man in a town full of rubber plans  
To get rid of itself,- it wears her out.  
  
She lives with a broken man,  
A cracked polystyrene man who just  
Crumbles and burns.  
He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties but gravity always  
Wins and it wears him out.  
  
She looks like the real thing.  
She tastes like the real thing,  
My fake plastic love.  
  
But I can't help the feeling.  
I could blow through the ceiling.  
If I just turn and run.  
And it wears me out.  
  
If I could be who you wanted all the time.
