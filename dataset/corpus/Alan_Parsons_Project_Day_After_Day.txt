Lead vocal: jack harris  
  
Gaze at the sky  
And picture a memory  
Of days in your life  
You knew what it meant to be happy and free  
With time on your side  
  
Remember your daddy  
When no one was wiser  
Your ma used to say  
That you would go further than he ever could  
With time on your side  
  
Think of a boy with the stars in his eye  
Longing to reach them but frightened to try  
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday  
  
But day after day  
The show must go on  
And time slipped away  
Before you could build any castles in spain  
The chance had gone by  
  
With nothing to say  
And no one to say it to  
  
Nothing has changed  
You've still got it all to do  
Surely you know  
The chance has gone by  
  
Think of a boy with the stars in his eye  
Longing to reach them but frightened to try  
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday  
  
But, day after day  
The show must go on  
And you gaze at the sky  
And picture a memory of days in your life  
With time on your side  
  
With time on your side  
(day after day the show must go on)  
With time on your side  
(day after day the show must go on)
