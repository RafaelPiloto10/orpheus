Lonesome Number One,just call me Lonesome Number One  
Although no titles have I won,I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
Every love I've had has faded like the dew  
Every one I've wanted, has wanted someone new  
Heartaches hang around and always come  
I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
Lonesome Number One, just call me Lonesome Number One  
Although no titles have I won, I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
It seems I'm always losing, love just can't come near  
Just when love gets close it always disappears  
Sorrow always keeps me on the run  
I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
Lonesome Number One, just call me Lonesome Number One  
Although no titles have I won, I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
Just call me Lonesome Number One, here I come I'm Lonesome Number One
