Trust is a weird thing  
Make you crazy  
Make you jealous  
Make you wish you hadn't said a thing  
  
And I guess I have been mean  
But I'm only second guessing you  
'Cause you won't even let me through  
  
And I want to be happy  
And I only want you  
If you think that I'm crazy  
I'm just crazy 'bout you  
Crazy 'bout you  
  
And love is a wonderful thing  
Make you wanna  
Make you need to  
Make you wish you hadn't said a thing  
  
Baby I, I have been mean  
But I'm only second guessing you  
'Cause you won't even let me through  
  
And I want to be happy  
And I only want you  
If you think that I'm crazy  
I'm just crazy 'bout you  
Crazy 'bout you  
  
Baby I want you  
Honey I need you  
I know you want to  
I can feel you  
  
And I want to be happy  
And I only want you  
If you think that I'm crazy  
I'm just crazy 'bout you  
Crazy 'bout you
