Every night I say a prayer in the hope that there's a heaven  
And every day I'm more confused as the saints turn into sinners  
All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay  
And I feel this empty place inside so afraid that I've lost my faith  
  
Show me the way, show me the way  
Take me tonight to the river  
And wash my illusions away  
Show me the way  
  
And as I slowly drift to sleep, for a moment dreams are sacred  
I close my eyes and know there's peace in a world so filled with hatred  
That I wake up each morning and turn on the news to find we've so far to go  
And I keep on hoping for a sign, so afraid that I just won't know  
  
Show me the way, Show me the way  
Take me tonight to the mountain  
And take my confusion away  
  
And if I feel light, should I believe  
Tell me how will I know  
  
Show me the way, show me the way  
Take me tonight to the river  
And wash my illusions away  
Show me the way, show me the way  
Give me the strength and the courage  
To believe that I'll get there someday  
Show me the way  
  
Every night I say a prayer  
In the hope that there's a heaven
