Here did you come from lady  
And ooh won't you take me there  
Right away won't you baby  
Tendoroni you've got to be  
Spark my nature  
Sugar fly with me  
Don't you know now  
Is the perfect time  
We can make it right  
Hit the city lights  
Then tonight ease the lovin' pain  
Let me take you to the max  
  
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)  
Pretty young thing  
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)  
Tender lovin' care  
And I'll take you there  
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)  
Pretty young thing  
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)  
Tender lovin' care  
I'll shake you there  
  
[Background:]  
Anywhere you wanna go  
  
Nothin' can stop this burnin'  
Desire to be with you  
Gotta get to you baby  
Won't you come it's emergency  
Cool my fire yearnin'  
Honey come set me free  
Don't you know now is the perfect time  
We can dim the lights  
Just to make it right  
In the night  
  
Hit the lovin' spot  
I'll give you all that I've got  
  
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)  
Pretty young thing  
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)  
Tender lovin' care  
And I'll take you there  
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)  
Pretty young thing  
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)  
Tender lovin' care  
I'll take you there  
  
[Breakdown:]  
Pretty young things repeat after me  
(Michael) I said na na na  
(P.y.t.'s) na na na  
(Michael) na na na na  
(P.y.t.'s) na na na na  
(Michael) na na na  
(P.y.t.'s) na na na  
(Michael) I said na na na na na  
(P.y.t.'s) na na na na na  
(Michael) I'll take you there  
  
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)  
Pretty young thing  
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)  
Tender lovin' care  
And I'll take you there  
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)  
Pretty young thing  
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)  
Tender lovin' care  
I'll take you there
