Shirley I love you 'til I'm drunk  
And on and on and never to stop  
The way I see it it's sad to say it but it's true  
You're gonna be all that I need  
So sad to see her looking so rusted  
There must be more to life than this  
Or we'd be mercy killing us  
Yeah, killing us baby  
The last train's leaving, there's nothing left  
'Cept to confess to love and happiness  
The way I see it it's sad to say it but it's true  
You're gonna be all that I need  
So sad, sad to see her looking so rusted  
There must be more to life than this  
Or we'd be mercy killing us  
Oh yeah, killing us baby  
We'll slip past a graveyard  
Love me do
