I've been so many places  
In my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs  
I made some bad rhymes  
  
I've acted out my life in stages  
Ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone now  
I'm singing this song for you  
  
I know your image of me  
Is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly  
But, darling, can't you see  
There's no one more important to me?  
Oh, baby, can't you, please, see through me?  
'Cause we're alone now, and  
I'm singing this song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets  
Of the truth, withholding nothing  
You came out in front, I was hiding  
Oh, but now I'm so much better  
If the words don't come together  
Just listen to the melody  
'Cause my love's in there hiding  
Oh, oh  
  
Oh, I love you in a place  
Where there's no space or time  
Love you for my life  
You are a friend of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and  
I was singing this song for you  
We were alone  
I was singing this song for you, oh  
Singing  
I was singing, singing, singing, singing, singing this song for you  
Oh, yes  
Singing this song for you
