I've been blue all day  
My man's gone away  
He left his mama cold  
For another gal, I'm told  
I've tried to treat him kind  
I thought he would be mine  
That man I hate to lose  
That's why mama's got the blues  
  
The man that I love he has left me in this town  
The man I love has gone and left me in this town  
And if it keeps on snowin' I will be Gulf Coast bound  
Mailman passed but he didn't leave no news  
The mailman's passed but he didn't leave no news  
  
I tell the world he left me cryin' those Gulf Coast blues  
These men up north honey sure do make me tired  
These men up north they surely do make me tired  
They've got a mouth full of gimme, and a handful of much obliged
