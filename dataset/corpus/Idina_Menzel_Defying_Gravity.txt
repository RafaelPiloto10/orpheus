Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm, for once! Instead of flying off
the handle!  
  
I hope you're happy  
I hope you're happy now  
I hope you're happy how you've  
Hurt your cause forever  
I hope you think you're clever  
  
I hope you're happy  
I hope you're happy too  
I hope you're proud how you would  
Grovel in submission  
To feed your own ambition  
  
So though I can't imagine how  
I hope you're happy  
Right now  
  
Elphie, listen to me. Just say you're sorry!  
  
You can still be with the Wizard  
What you've worked and waited for  
You can have all you ever wanted  
  
I know  
But I don't want it  
No!  
I can't want it anymore  
  
Something has changed within me  
Something is not the same  
I'm through with playing by  
The rules of someone else's game  
Too late for second-guessing  
Too late to go back to sleep  
It's time to trust my instincts  
Close my eyes  
And leap  
  
It's time to try defying gravity  
I think I'll try defying gravity  
And you can't pull me down  
  
Can't I make you understand  
You're having delusions of grandeur?  
  
I'm through accepting limits  
'Cause someone says they're so  
Some things I cannot change  
But till I try I'll never know  
Too long I've been afraid of  
Losing love, I guess I've lost  
Well if that's love  
It comes at much too high a cost  
  
I'd sooner buy defying gravity  
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity  
And you can't pull me down!  
  
Glinda, come with me. Think of what we could do together!  
  
Unlimited  
Together we're unlimited  
Together we'll be the greatest team  
There's ever been, Glinda!  
Dreams the way we planned 'em  
  
If we work in tandem  
  
There's no fight we cannot win  
Just you and I, defying gravity  
With you and I defying gravity  
  
They'll never bring us down!  
  
Well, are you coming?  
  
I hope you're happy  
I hope your happy now that your choosing this  
  
You too  
I hope it brings you bliss  
  
I really hope you get it  
And you don't live to regret it  
I hope you're happy in the end  
I hope you're happy my friend  
  
So if you care to find me  
Look to the Western sky!  
As someone told me lately  
Everyone deserves the chance to fly  
And if I'm flying solo  
At least I'm flying free  
To those who ground me  
Take a message back from me!  
  
Tell them how I am defying gravity  
I'm flying high, defying gravity  
And soon I'll match them in renown  
And nobody in all of Oz  
No wizard that there is or was  
Is ever gonna bring me down!  
  
I hope you're happy  
  
Look at her  
She's wicked  
Get her!  
  
Bring me down!  
  
No one mourns the wicked  
So we got to bring her  
  
Ah!  
  
Down!
