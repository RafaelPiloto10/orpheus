1 2 Ever 5 6 7  
No good boys ever go to heaven  
Bodies moving wunderland  
Open mouth kiss and we dance  
I can't believe c-c-can't can't believe that I met you...  
  
Pink champagne!  
Merry balls spin 'round again  
In this wunderland where I met you...  
  
So dj play  
Let the record spin again  
In this wunderland where I met you...
