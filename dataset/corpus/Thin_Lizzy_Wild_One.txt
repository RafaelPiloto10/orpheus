Wild one won't you please come home  
You've been away too long, will you  
We need you home, we need you near  
Come back wild one will you  
  
How can we live without your love  
You know that could kill you  
How can we carry on  
When you are gone my wild one  
  
So you go your way wild one  
I'll try and follow  
And if you change your mind  
I will be waiting here for you tomorrow  
  
For I would beg for you  
I would steal and I would borrow  
I'd do anything, anything at all  
To end this sorrow  
  
Wild one  
The gypsies warned of the danger  
You can laugh and joke with friends  
But don't you ever talk to strangers  
  
Although their offers may be sweet  
And I'd bet and I would wager  
Away you'll stray and never come back  
To those who love and made you
