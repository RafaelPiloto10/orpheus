Of Egyptian Kings we know oh so many things,  
Cause the archaeologists have dug their tombs.  
Now we're here to show, how to treat a dead pharaoh,  
Make a mummy that can decorate you room.  
  
First your dead kings lain on a table where his brain,  
Is pull out with a wire through his nose!  
Then his guts and lungs, stomach, liver must be bunged,  
In four jars so they do not decompose.  
  
Pour out salt to dry on the body, let it lie,  
There for forty days until it mummifies.  
In the bandage wrap up the body leave a gap!  
For the mouth and pop in artificial eyes.  
  
In the coffin cold lay out prayers in little scrolls,  
That will guard him on his journey far ahead.  
Pack his tomb with wealth, Which he'll need for his health,  
If he makes it to the country of the dead.  
  
Now you've done your job, there are villains who will rob,  
So our mummy and it's coffin we defend.  
Build a pyramid high, so it points up to the sky!  
Place your dead king deep inside and that's the end.
