We're all together once again  
For the first time in I don't know when  
We were so close once upon a time  
There were five of us kids at home  
Two girls, three boys and Dad and Mom  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
Remember that old swimming hole  
Where we would swim so long ago  
And all them possum grapes and muskedines  
And do you recall the time  
We all got drunk on homemade wine  
That was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past  
Memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember how we talked as kids  
Of what we'd be when we got big  
And all the dreams that we held in our minds  
I wanted to be a singin' star  
And you all said that I'd go far  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember all the fun we had  
Back when they say times were bad  
And life was good to us and things were fine  
We had fun and we had love  
And a mom and dad to care for us  
But that was is the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past  
Memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind  
Sweet memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind
