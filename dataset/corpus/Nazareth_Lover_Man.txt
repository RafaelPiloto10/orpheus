Baby's in the back seat, it's so real  
Gotta love the feel of the automobile  
You get a certain style when you're so mobile  
And responsibility you can avoid that trial  
  
Walkin' on the wild side  
Lookin' at the down side  
Just a little crazy  
Got a kind of strange pride  
  
Standin' at the back door, mercy me  
Ain't no place for the man to be  
It's a private love, no publicity  
And the woman that he's waitin' for is bad news, he'll see  
Goin' to a go-go  
Slippin' to a life low  
Goin' for the fake tan  
Dreamin' up a fashion plan  
Loverman  
  
He's a very superficial man  
He likes the girls that go there  
He's a dude with a master plan  
So young but why should he care?  
  
Drivin' into downtown right on time  
Smokin' like a pistol aimed on line  
Waitin' for the tingles in his back  
All those dangerous feelings getting' ready to attack  
  
Walkin' on the barbed wire  
Playin' with desire  
Goin' for the night plan  
Breakin' any heart he can  
Loverman  
  
He's a very superficial man  
He likes the girls that go there  
He's a dude with a master plan  
So young but why should he care?  
  
Baby's in the back seat  
Gotta love the feel  
Baby's in the back seat  
Gotta love the feel  
  
He's a very superficial man  
He likes the girls that go there  
He's a dude with a master plan  
So young but why should he care?  
  
He's a very superficial man  
He likes the girls that go there  
He's a dude with a master plan  
So young but why should he care?  
  
He's a very superficial man  
His suit is ten years older than his last flame  
He's the dude with the master plan  
  
He's a very superficial man  
He likes the girls that go there  
He's a dude with a master plan
