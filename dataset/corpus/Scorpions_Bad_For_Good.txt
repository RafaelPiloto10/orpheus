Bad for good  
She tells it like it is  
The French word of a kiss  
She's so bad for good to me  
She's so bad for good  
She wants more of this  
You can feel it with a kiss  
She's as bad as she can be  
The thoughts in my head  
Where would they be going?  
Seems to me  
  
It's a tough call for one to imagine  
They're saying they do when I win  
I look in the mirror  
Reflect from the ceiling  
She wears next to nothin'  
Next to nothin' but only  
A touch of perfume on her skin, oh yeah  
She's so bad for good  
She tells it like it is  
The french word of a kiss  
  
She's so bad for good to me  
She's so bad for good  
She wants more of this  
You can feel it with a kiss  
She's as bad as she can be  
She's so bad for good  
She tells it like it is  
The french word of a kiss  
She's so bad for good to me  
  
She's so bad for good  
She wants more of this  
You can feel it with a kiss  
She's as bad as she can be  
If those were my fingers  
What would they be doing  
Is pouring along  
From head to toe like a stranger  
To be once again lost and found yeah  
  
She's so bad for good  
She tells it like it is  
The French word of a kiss  
She's so bad for good to me  
She's so bad for good  
She wants more of this  
You can feel it with a kiss  
She's as bad as she can be  
  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
Bad for good  
Bad for good
