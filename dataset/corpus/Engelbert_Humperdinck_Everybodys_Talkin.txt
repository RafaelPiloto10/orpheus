Everybody's talkin' at me  
Can't hear a word they're sayin'  
Only the echoes of my mind  
People stoppin', starin'  
I can't see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
Goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
In the pouring rain  
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes  
Banking off a northeast wind  
Sailin' on a summer's breeze  
Skipping over the ocean  
Like a stone  
  
Everybody's talkin' at me  
Can't hear a word they're sayin'  
Only the echoes of my mind  
People stoppin', starin'  
I can't see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
Goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
In the pouring rain  
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes  
Banking off a northeast wind  
Sailin' on a summer's breeze  
Skipping over the ocean  
Like a stone  
  
And you know I'll never leave my love behind
