Well I'm standin' on a corner  
With a bucket in my hand  
I'm waitin' for a woman

Doin' the be-bop-bee

In the boss man's yard  
  
'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it

I can't buy no beer  
  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
