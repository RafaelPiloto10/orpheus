Here I go again  
Why does the ghost of love still haunt me  
It's all been cried about before  
It's all been cried about before  
  
Yes, it's all been cried about before  
Still it's everywhere  
Is it crying to be heard  
Don't you think you've had your say  
Don't you think you've had your say  
  
Yes, don't you think you've seen your day  
I don't know  
No I don't  
Don't I know  
No I don't  
  
I don't know  
Not knowing if it's love  
Is better than no thoughts of love at all  
But it's been cried about before  
  
I guess I'll cry for it some more  
It's just the hope for love once more  
It's just the hope for love once more
