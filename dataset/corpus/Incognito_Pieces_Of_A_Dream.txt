Before you go  
I'd like to say  
You give me so much satisfaction  
Started up a chain reaction  
Tryin' to work out in my mind  
A way to let you know  
Oh darling  
  
You're asking me to be strong  
But I can't see the wrong  
In what I'm doing  
Just want to hold you every day  
Locked inside this feeling  
I want you here to stay  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
What can I do  
But to be true  
I'm getting such a strong sensation  
And it's not my imagination  
It's not me to pretend  
So try and understand  
Oh darling  
  
My heart is chosen to belong  
And I don't see the wrong  
In what I'm feeling  
I know it's time to say goodbye  
But I'm not living in a lie  
I want you here to stay  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
Oh, baby  
You're asking me to be strong  
But I still can't see the wrong  
In what I'm doing  
Just want to hold you every day  
Locked? inside this feeling  
I want you here to stay  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream
