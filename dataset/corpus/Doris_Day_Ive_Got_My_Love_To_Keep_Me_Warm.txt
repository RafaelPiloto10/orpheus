The snow is snowing  
The wind is blowing  
But I can weather  
The storm  
What do I care  
How much it  
May storm?  
I've got my love  
To keep me warm  
  
I can't remember  
A worse December  
Just watch  
Those icicles form  
What do I care  
If icicles form?  
I've got my love  
To keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat  
Off with my glove  
I need no overcoat  
I'm burning with love  
My heart's on fire  
The flame grows higher  
So I will weather  
The storm  
What do I care  
How much it  
May storm?  
I've got my love  
To keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat  
Off with my glove  
I need no overcoat  
I'm burning  
With love  
My heart's on fire  
The flame  
Grows higher  
So I will weather  
The storm  
What do I care  
How much it  
May storm?  
I've got my love  
To keep me warm  
  
Out with  
The fire off  
With the sweater  
I got a heater  
Couldn't be  
Better will be  
So confee  
All through  
The storm  
I've got my love  
To keep me warm
