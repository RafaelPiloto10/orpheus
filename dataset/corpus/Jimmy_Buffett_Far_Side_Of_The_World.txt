Ramadan is over,  
The new moon's shown her face,  
I'm halfway round the planet,  
In a most unlikely place.  
  
Following my song line  
Past bamboo shacks and shops  
Behind a jitney packed like sardines,  
With bananas piled on top.  
  
I ran away from politics,  
It's too bizarre at home.  
Away I flew, tuned into Blue  
"Maybe Amsterdam or Rome"  
  
Awakened by a stewardess,  
With Spain somewhere below.  
On the threshold of adventure,  
God I do love this job so.  
  
So while I make my move  
On the big board game  
Up and down a Spanish highway,  
Some things remain the same.  
Girls meet boys  
and the boys tease girls  
I'm heading out this morning,  
For the Far Side of the World.  
  
Oh I believe in song lines  
Obvious and not  
I'd ridden them like camels  
To some most peculiar spots.  
  
They run across the oceans  
Through mountains and saloons  
And tonight out to the dessert  
Where I sit atop this dune.  
  
I was destined for this vantage point  
Which is so far from the Sea  
I've lived it in the pages of Saint-Exupery  
  
From Paris to Tunisia  
Casablanca to Dakar  
I was riding long before I flew  
Through the wind and sand and stars.  
  
Caravan  
Ride that hump  
And Timbuktu's a jillion bumps  
Sleeping bags and battle flags  
Are coiled and furled  
That's the way you travel  
To the far side of the world!  
  
A Sunset framed by lightening bolts  
Burns a lasting memory  
And a string of tiny twinkling lights  
adorn the sausage tree.  
While the embers from the log fire  
Flicker, fly, and twirl  
Then drift off toward the cosmos  
From the Far Side of the World.  
Well it's Christmas and my birthday  
and so to that extent  
The Masai not the wise men  
Are circling my tent.  
I teach them how to play guitar  
They show me how to dance  
We have rum from the Caribbean  
And Burgundy from France.  
  
New Year's Eve in Zanzibar  
With Babu and his boys  
High up on the rooftop  
You can relish all the noise.  
  
They are dancing on the tables  
People bouncing like gazelles  
Two 0-0-1 is ushered in  
With air raid horns and bells.  
  
Time to sing time to dance  
Living out my second chance.  
  
Cobras and sleeping bags are coiled and curled  
That's the way it happens  
On the Far Side of the World.  
  
Back at home, it's afternoon  
Six thousand miles away.  
I will still be there when I get through  
Attending this soiree  
  
There are jobs and chores and questions  
And plates I need to twirl,  
But tonight I'll take my chances,  
On the Far Side of the World.  
That's the way it happens  
On the Far Side of the World.
