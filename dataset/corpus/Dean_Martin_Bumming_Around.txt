I got an ol' slouch hat  
Got my roll on my shoulder  
I'm as free as a breeze  
An' I'll do as I please  
Just a bummin' around  
  
Got a million friends  
Don't feel any older  
I've got nothin' to lose  
Not even the blues  
Just a bummin' around  
  
Whenever worries start  
To botherin' me  
I grab my coat, my ol' slouch hat  
Hit the trail again, you see  
  
I ain't got a dime  
Don't care where I'm goin'  
Where I'm as free as a breeze  
An' I'll do as I please  
Just a bummin' around  
  
I've got nothin' to lose  
Not even the blues  
Just a bummin' around  
  
Whenever worries start  
To botherin' me  
I grab my coat, my ol' slouch hat  
Hit the trail again, you see  
  
I ain't got a dime  
Don't care where I'm goin'  
'Cause I'm as free as a breeze  
An' I'll do as I please  
Just a bummin' around  
Just bummin' around
