Hey Boy Blue, can't you hear all  
the noise.  
It's for you, all the town's waiting  
there.  
Let us go, there's a show like you ain't  
seen before  
Welcome home, where you been all  
these years,  
Look around, all the crowd is in tears,  
It's so good to see you in the streets  
of your town.  
  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
  
I've seen bold knights, dropping  
down like flies,  
I've seen kings, rolling in the mire,  
I've seen God, point the finger of  
doom to our foes.  
I have fought in the holiest wars,  
I have smashed, some of the holiest jaws  
I've been jailed, been impaled, and  
been dragged through the world.  
One thing, I have learned through  
these years,  
Is that no man, should be stricken  
with fear  
It should be that he walks with no  
care in the world.  
So my friends, who are gathered here  
today,  
Hear this clear, for I'll not further say,  
That no man, shall cause me to take  
up arms again.  
  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.
