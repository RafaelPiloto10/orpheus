I know where I'm going,  
And I've got all my cards showing.  
I'm like the crow flies, a straight line  
Reaching for the other side  
  
I dig the sand they kick at me with a calm that stuns.  
Tracing time with no alibis makes me, makes me realize.  
  
It's okay it's just a dream I had.  
That there's something out there,  
Something, just out of reach  
  
Armed with time on my side  
And a field of vision miles wide.  
I'll keep searching for some meaning  
Whatever makes me feel alive.  
  
It's okay it's just a dream I had.  
That there's something out there,  
Something, just out of reach  
  
Today I felt something so strong it took my breath away.  
Now I long  
To live like this everyday.  
I'll find it some way.  
  
I'm alive with so much of life to try.  
I've got no memories of what used to worry me.  
  
It's okay it's just a dream I had.  
That there's something out there,  
Something, just out of reach  
Someday I'll reach.  
It's okay it's just a dream I had.  
That there's something out there,  
Something just out of reach  
Just out of reach, just out of reach
