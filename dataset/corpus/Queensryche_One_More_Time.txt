Behind my eyes  
I keep my truth from you.  
No one enters  
this secret place,  
the barrier only I embrace.  
Time is fleeing now they say,  
Take time to look inside and face, the change.  
  
Dig down deep  
to find the man I thought I was.  
A dog on a treadmill panting,  
the master pulls the leash, laughing.  
Now I can't remember why  
I needed to run, needed to try so hard.  
  
One more time around  
is all I ask for now,  
a star to seek by, wind to  
take me home again.  
  
"Work hard in life boy,  
there's paradise in the end."  
Year after year we struggle to gain  
the happiness our parents never claimed.  
They told us all we had to do  
was do what we're told, buy what was sold,  
"Invest in gold, and never get old."  
  
One more time around  
is all I ask for now,  
a star to steer by, wind to  
take me home again.
