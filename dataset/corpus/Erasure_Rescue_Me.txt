Love is cast ornately in your heart flame  
Chakra wheels are turning like a love train  
  
I could pray a hundred times  
Keep these demons from my mind  
Yeh I could pray a thousand times  
Stay in your lovin' arms entwined  
  
Oh that I should be ever so lonely  
Drivin' the pain right through to my heart  
Oh that I should be ever so lonely  
Ridin' the pain like a fool in the dark  
  
We shall blur the lines of definition  
Waves of love our only ammunition  
  
Tear my head out from the sound  
Throw myself upon the ground  
Take me to the burning tree  
It has this strange effect on me  
  
Oh that I should be ever so lonely  
Drivin' the pain right through to my heart  
Oh that I should be ever so lonely  
Ridin' the pain like a fool in the dark  
  
Fascination never tasted sweeter  
My desire real and soaring freely  
  
You alone can save my soul  
You alone are my salvation  
You alone can make me whole  
Rescue me from condemnation
