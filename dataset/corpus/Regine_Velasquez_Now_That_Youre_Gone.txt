Now that you're gone  
  
I close my eyes and softly ask  
What's happening to me  
I've realized I'm all alone  
Without your company  
  
But then we've shared so much  
That a part of me is me no more  
I'm caught unaware and unprepared  
For what will be in store  
  
Now that you're gone  
To wake me takes me countless hours  
Just thinking how to make another day go by  
That coffee cup just stares at me  
It turns cold and bitter sometimes as we  
The cigarette butts on the floor  
Who picks it up nothing but me  
  
Now that you're gone  
I count each time the phone would ring  
With fingers crossed expecting actually hoping  
From the other line a familiar voice  
That would say I'd be back today  
No it isn't you, its never you  
What can I do  
  
Now that you're gone  
How can I go on living  
How can I go on feeling  
An empty touch  
An empty stare  
How can I without you there  
  
Now that you're gone  
I feel like I am useless cup  
A muted violin  
A single teardrop  
  
Now that you're gone...  
  
I try to drown my thoughts with scenes  
Of places, friends we used to see  
I traced the steps we've taken  
No its useless they're unreal  
  
Now that you're gone
