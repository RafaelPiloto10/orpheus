I've gone flying, trying to meet you  
You've been hiding, riding me to a state  
Like this  
  
Give me that window to,  
Give me that window to,  
Give me that window to the world  
  
We are sailing, flailing through the ether  
You've been trailing, failing me with you're  
View of bliss  
  
Give me that window to,  
Give me that window to,  
Give me that window to the world  
  
A little more than this,  
A little less than that  
You've got magic in your hands  
  
You've conspired, inspired me to  
Find a place like this  
  
Give me that window to'  
Give me that window to'  
Give me that window to the world
