I saw it walkin' lonely down the street  
Cool like a cat, like crazy clean  
I looked twice again, I can't believe  
Oh no no no  
  
It turned around right then  
And looked at me  
I said oh no, it really couldn't be  
It was a man, it was a woman, too  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)  
  
I think it really came from far away  
I'm feeling head uptight so I have to stay  
It takes my hand and says come on, let's go  
Let's go, let's go, let's go  
We're goin' home, it's nice and warm to say  
He starts to move, she starts to play  
I need a body, why not you  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)
