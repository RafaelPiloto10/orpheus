Girl, it should be me  
Driving to your house  
Knocking on your door  
Kissing you on the mouth  
Holding on your hand  
Dancing in the dark  
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start  
  
But now when I see you with him it  
Tears my world apart  
  
Because,  
I've been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most,  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first (I loved you first, loved you first)  
  
Girl, it should be me  
Calling on your phone  
Saying you're the one, and that I'll never let you go  
I never understood, what love was really like,  
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes  
But now when I see you with him  
My whole world falls apart  
  
Because,  
I've been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first  
  
The first touch  
The first kiss  
First girl to make me feel like this  
Heartbreak  
It's killing me  
I loved you first, why can't you see?  
  
I've been waiting all this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first  
  
Baby, I loved you first  
Baby, I loved you first  
Oh, yeah  
Baby, I loved you first
