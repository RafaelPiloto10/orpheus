Coffer cafe's dizzy with city lights, concrete sidewalks busy with friendly
fights  
But that's alright baby, it's alright come go with me and you will see city
life, city life  
Loud paper boys yelling yesterday's news, a pedlar man selling what you can't
use  
That's alright baby, it's alright come go with me, you will see city life,
city life  
  
I need you when the sun goes down, you pick me up when you're around  
Come on, come on now, we can have a good time, this town ain't much unless
you're here with me  
It's like a woman, crazy just like a puppy, lazy  
Just like a pretty jealous wife, I can't get free from city life  
  
Secluded bars humming behind the scenes, hot wild guitars strumming, promising
dreams  
That's alright baby, it's alright come go with me and you will see city life,
city life  
I don't want to be alone, stay with me now, don't go home  
It's a date, we'll stay out late and party, city lifes okay when you're with
me  
  
It's like a lion sleeping just like a willow weeping,  
A melting pot for fun and strife can't get away from city life  
City life baby, city life, it's alright baby, it's alright city life, city
life....
