Let's take one more rocket to the moon  
Before we wake I'll kiss your eyes and lie between  
While you sleep is all around  
Just look up in the air and find it  
Just wish upon a star and find it  
  
It's dawning I'm gently falling  
The rhythm of water and windows are white  
Darling soft as your pillow I'm slowly drowning  
Go spiraling down as you catch your breath  
  
A key chain in your pocket just for luck  
I hold it in and close my eyes to hide a tear  
And what we need is all around us  
Just say a little prayer and find it  
Just look up in the air and find it  
  
Walking into your life love without knowing  
I'm out of my mind  
Calling straight to your heart  
I'm slowly drowning and morning is here  
As I catch my breath  
  
And what we need is all around us  
Just look up in the air and find it  
Just say a little prayer and find it  
  
Walking into your life love without knowing  
I'm out of my mind  
Calling straight to your heart  
I'm slowly drowning and morning is here
