I intrude on patience  
I intrude on young hearts  
I intrude on all such things  
That can take you by surprise  
Time and time again  
So?  
  
I've no welcome for you  
I've no welcome for talk  
I've no welcome in my house  
I've tried too long you know  
Time and time again  
  
Oh look there's a man inside  
The head's not the museum it's supposed to be  
We sleep with machines that breathe  
And some even have names the executive dream  
  
We're all so sincere  
I'll sing a song from the film that broke your heart  
Oh look at the smile that cracks  
Tomorrow we'll be civilized  
And buy the whole world clothes  
  
We don't believe in you  
We're specialized mechanics in repairing the bitch  
You bounce around my head  
You say it's a little but I'm sure it's ok
