I'm seein' red  
Don't think you'll have to see my face again  
Don't have much time for sympathy  
Cause it never happened to me  
You're feelin' blue now  
I think you bit off more than you could chew  
And now it's time to make a choice  
And all I wanna hear is your  
  
So follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When there's no place left to go  
Maybe that's when you will know  
Follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When there's no place left to go  
Maybe that's when you will know  
  
And foolish lies  
Well can't you see I tried to compromise  
Cause what you say ain't always true  
And I can see the tears in your eyes  
And what you said now  
Can't stop the words from running through my head  
And what I'd do to get through to you  
But you'd only do it again  
  
So follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When there's no place left to go  
Maybe that's when you will know  
Follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When there's no place left to go  
Maybe that's when you will know  
  
Well I can confess, I don't know what to make from all this mess  
Don't have much time for sympathy  
But it never happened to me, you're feelin' down now  
I don't know where I'll be when you come around  
And now it's time to make a choice  
And all I wanna hear is your voice
