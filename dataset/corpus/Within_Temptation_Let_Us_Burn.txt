The darkness has come to the roses  
The fire is reaching the air  
The colours that I have created  
Are suddenly flying away  
  
I'm not fighting myself, will not follow  
'Cause my choices are mine, it's my fate  
And I'll never bow down from the sorrow  
I'll face all that is coming my way  
  
The lying, the devil, the silence  
Embracing the world on the edge  
  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
The night in the skies here tonight  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
In this fire that makes us yearn  
We're fighting our fear of the silence  
We're running through walls where they stand  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
  
I'm searching no more for tomorrow  
I reach for the skies while I can  
The unknown will always be waiting  
My last day I'll jump in its hands  
  
I'm not fighting myself, will not follow  
'Cause my choices are mine, it's my fate  
And I'll never bow down from the sorrow  
I'll face all that is coming my way  
  
The lying, the devil, the silence  
Embracing the world on the edge  
  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
The night in the skies here tonight  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
In this fire that makes us yearn  
We're fighting our fear of the silence  
We're running through walls where they stand  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
  
Why, why don't you let me burn?  
Why don't you come down  
And break out and let me burn?  
  
Oh why, why don't you let me burn?  
Why don't you let me burn?  
Why don't you let me burn?  
  
Oh why?  
Chasing the demons in my mind  
Oh why me?  
Waiting for chains to throw me to the ground  
  
The darkness has come to the roses  
And the fire is reaching the air  
  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
The night in the skies here tonight  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
In this fire that makes us yearn  
We're fighting our fear of the silence  
We're running through walls where they stand  
Let us burn  
Let us burn  
Let us burn
