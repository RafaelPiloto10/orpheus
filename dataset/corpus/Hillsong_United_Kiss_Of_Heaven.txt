I'm walking a new walk  
I'll never be the same again  
Dancing a new dance in  
Your Holy Spirit Rain  
Your breath of life has overwhelmed me  
And set my spirit free  
I'm living a new life, underneath Your morning star  
Running a new race, in the shadow of Your love  
Your love is immeasurable, too deep to comprehend  
  
My Jesus, dream-maker  
My Jesus, live-giver  
I'm living under the Kiss of Heaven,  
And I'll never ever be the same again  
  
I'm singing a new song in the presence of The King  
Giving You my heart  
That is all that I can bring  
You lit a fire inside of me  
That I thought would never burn again  
I thank You, my Father, for all You've done  
And all You're going to do  
My past behind me and You before me  
I press on for more  
I'm living in the embrace of Heaven  
And I'll never ever be the same again
