I thought love was only true in fairy tales  
Meant for someone else but not for me  
Love was out to get me  
That's the way it seemed  
Disappointment haunted all my dreams  
  
Then I saw her face  
Now I'm a believer  
Not a trace of doubt in my mind  
I'm in love  
I'm a believer  
I couldn't leave her if I tried  
  
I thought love was more or less a giving thing  
Seems the more I gave the less I got  
What's the use in trying  
All you get is pain  
When I needed sunshine I got rain  
  
Then I saw her face  
Now I'm a believer  
Not a trace of doubt in my mind  
I'm in love  
I'm a believer  
I couldn't leave her if I tried
