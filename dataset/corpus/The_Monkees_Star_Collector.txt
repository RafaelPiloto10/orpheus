Think I'll let her keep on going  
Where ever it is, she's goin' to.  
Give her my autograph and tell her  
It's been nice knowin' you.  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a star collector (collector of stars)  
She only seems to please young celebrities.  
She's a star collector (collector of stars)  
How can I love her, when I just don't respect her?  
  
When everything is goin' my way,  
She wants to be close at hand.  
She moves to some other doorway  
When things don't go the way she planned.  
  
She's a star collector (collector of stars)  
She only seems to please young celebrities.  
She's a star collector (collector of stars)  
How can I love her, when I just don't respect her?  
  
It won't take much time before I get her off my mind  
  
She's a star collector (collector of stars)  
She only seems to please young celebrities.  
She's a star collector (collector of stars)  
How can I love her, when I just don't respect her?  
  
She's a star collector (collector of stars)  
She only seems to please young celebrities.  
She's a star collector (collector of stars)  
How can I love her, when I just don't respect her?
