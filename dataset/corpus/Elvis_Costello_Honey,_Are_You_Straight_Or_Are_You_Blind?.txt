Who do you see when you turn your eyes down?  
Who do you see when I'm not seeing you?  
The news is out all over town and all these girls  
Are taking turns at being you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well, well, well  
You'd better make up your mind  
Honey, are you straight or are you blind?  
  
She's coming in between us you know that she is  
I'm not holding on to her but one of us is  
My hands are in my pocket, my face is in a book  
She could walk 'round naked and I wouldn't sneak a look  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Honey are you straight or are you blind?  
  
She walked in and your eyes flew out the door  
You squeezed my hand 'til the circulation ceases  
She's just a doll like so many more  
She's the kind of doll that you'd like to pull to pieces  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, well, well  
You'd better make up your mind  
Honey are you straight or are you blind?
