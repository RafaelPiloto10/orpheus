Come on over here, baby  
Girl, I'm gonna give you a little kiss  
You're gonna feel my hands all around you  
Not a finger will you miss  
After I turn you on, baby  
I'm gonna blow your mind with some of this  
Squeezed in that mauved dress you showed me  
Child, that hemline's out of sight  
With that foxy frame you're flaunting  
It ain't no way it won't fit you right  
We're going to a rock and roll revival  
You know we're sure 'nuff gonna boogie tonight  
They'd be playing them old and golden goodies  
Used to blow my mind when I was a child  
Back when I'd got my head together  
I wouldn't walk a block, but I'd dance a mile  
Girl, you better be in good shape tonight  
'Cause we sure e'nuff gonna ball awhile  
It's been a long, long time  
Since I let me backbone bend  
Oh, for them same sweet memories  
When we didn't have nothing but time to spend  
We'd boogie and ball all Saturday mornin'  
Right back that night and ball again
