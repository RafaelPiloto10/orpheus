I got stones in my passway  
And my road seem dark as night  
I got stones in my passway  
And my road seem dark as night  
I have pains in my hearts  
They have taken my appetite  
I have a bird to whistle  
  
And I have a bird to sing  
Have a bird to whistle  
And I have a bird to sing  
I got a woman that I'm lovin'  
Boy, she don't mean a thing  
My enemies have betrayed me  
  
Have overtaken poor Bob at last  
My enemies have betrayed me  
Have overtaken poor Bob at last  
An 'ere's one thing certainly  
They have stones all in my pass  
Now you tryin' to take my life  
  
And all my lovin' too  
You laid a passway for me  
Now what are you trying to do  
I'm cryin' please  
Plea-ease let us be friends  
And when you hear me howlin' in my passway, rider  
Plea-ease open your door and let me in  
I got three legs to truck home  
  
Boys, please don't block my road  
I got three legs to truck home  
Boys, please don't block my road  
I've been feelin' ashamed 'bout my rider  
Babe, I'm booked and I got to go
