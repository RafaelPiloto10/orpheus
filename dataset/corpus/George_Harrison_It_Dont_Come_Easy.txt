(it don't come easy, you know it don't come easy)  
(it don't come easy, you know it don't come easy)  
Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues  
And you know it don't come easy  
You don't have to shout or leap about  
You can even play them easy  
Forget about the past and all your sorrow  
The future won't last  
It will soon be your tomorrow  
I don't ask for much, I only want your trust  
And you know it don't come easy  
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time  
And you know it don't come easy  
Open up your heart, let's come together  
Use a little luck, and we will make it work out better  
Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues  
And you know it don't come easy  
You don't have to shout or leap about  
You can even play them easy  
Please remember peace is how we make it  
Here within your reach, is your freedom to take it  
I don't ask for much, I only want your trust  
And you know it don't come easy  
(de de de) growing all the time  
And you know it don't come easy  
(thank you)
