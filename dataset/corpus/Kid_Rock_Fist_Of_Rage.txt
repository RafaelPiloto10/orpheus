Gotta make this money  
Gotta make this money  
This money is me  
This money is everything I do and see  
  
Who are you to judge me  
Just let me be - and let me breathe  
I see this whole world headed for damnation  
And I'm ready to leave  
  
I can't believe this whole world twisted me  
You fuckin' biggets, you fakes, you want to-be's  
I see the future and its lookin' grim  
A lake of fire lookin' like a gonks whip  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a fist of rage (one foot in the grave)  
I'm a fist of rage (far from saved)  
I'm a fist of rage (in a broken state)  
(I'm a razor blade slippin' through a bale of hay)  
I'm a fist of rage! [Repeat: x 4]  
Crack another bottle and let me knock one back  
  
Huh-huh, Slim Jim's  
And the tin men grins  
Fat heads with dreads  
And all the feds growing shark fins  
  
Huh-huh, my girls knocked up  
We're in love but she's young and I think I'm being locked up  
I couldn't cut the mustard with a Ginsu  
And a twist of brown for all the bullshit I been through  
  
I'm looking for love but it's got too many dam faces  
I can't win even with these four aces  
My place is here with the mix and the tricks and sickos  
I spend g's but only make nickels  
  
My soul tickles  
But this ain't even fun and games  
My heart bleeds from the pleasures of the pain  
My fuse is short and its lit like me I'm short  
  
It's sketchy  
It's getting hard to see  
My heart bleeds believe it every dying breath  
These people take and they take  
Until there's nothing left  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ya feeling bold with me  
Your up a creek  
And you don't know it  
Finger on the trigger but your punk ass is scared to pull it  
And I know it  
  
'Cause the fear you hide your eyes show it  
Payback on your ass cause I know I owe it  
Now when your goin' down bet I'll be blowing up  
Hear the sound of a shotgun cock and know you're fucked  
  
I hope you see my middle finger from the stage  
(Coming - Come and feel me) [Repeat: x 4]  
  
[Chorus]
