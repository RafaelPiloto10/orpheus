I walked through this place, although it wasn't really there  
And when I reached the other side, thought I didn't really care  
I moved round a bit, and started seeing people  
And the people that I met, oh were all covered in treacle  
  
Everyone was laughing, everyone except for poor old me,  
So I tried to entertain them, oh but they were hard to please  
As time went by, oh backwards I walked  
Backwards I talked, and backwards I laughed
