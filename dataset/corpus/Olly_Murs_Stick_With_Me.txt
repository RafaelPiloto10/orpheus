Too much time and too much space looking for the truth  
Mountains you have had to climb, valleys you've been through  
I don't know about where you've been or where you're going to  
I will get lost with you  
  
Oh, father don't you worry, I've never let you down  
Oh, mother when you need me, I'll always be around  
Sister, it's hard to see you struggle like you do  
I will get lost with you  
  
We all get lonely  
Trying to find a place where we should be  
Trying to find someone to set us free  
There are times a friend is all you need  
We all get lonely, so stick with me  
  
Oh yeah, so stick with me  
We all get lonely, so stick with me  
  
Too much blame and too much shame, none of it is true  
All the weight of your regrets, we all got a few  
It's not too much to carry if you let me carry too, yeah  
I will be there with you  
  
Oh, father don't you worry, I've never let you down  
Oh, mother when you need me, I'll always be around  
Sister, it's hard to see you struggle like you do  
But I'll be there with you  
  
We all get lonely  
Trying to find a place where we should be  
Trying to find someone to set us free  
There are times a friend is all you need  
We all get lonely, so stick with me  
  
We all get lonely  
We all get lonely  
We all get lonely  
Come on baby!  
  
Oh, father don't you worry, I've never let you down  
Oh, mother when you need me, I'll always be around  
Sister, it's hard to see you struggle like you do  
But I'll be there with you  
  
We all get lonely  
Trying to find a place where we should be  
Trying to find someone to set us free  
There are times a friend is all you need  
We all get lonely, so stick with me  
  
So stick with me, oh yeah
