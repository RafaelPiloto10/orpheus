Yeah, eh yeah yeah  
  
I can feel a phoenix inside of me,  
As I march alone to a different beat,  
Slowly slowing down my fear,  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I am ready for the road less traveled,  
Suiting up for my crowning battle,  
This test is my own cross to bare,  
But I will get there  
  
It's never easy to be chosen,  
Never easy to be called,  
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall,  
I can see the Heavens,  
But I still hear the flames calling out my name  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
I can feel this light that's inside of me,  
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning,  
I know one spark will shock the world,  
Yeah, yeah  
  
So I pray for favor like Ester,  
I need Your strength to handle the pressure,  
I know there will be sacrifice,  
But that's the price  
  
It's never easy to be chosen,  
Never easy to be called,  
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall,  
I can see the Heavens,  
But I still hear the flames calling out my name  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
At the end, at the end,  
Who am I living for?  
  
At the end, at the end,  
Who am I living for?  
  
Heavy is the head that wears the crown,  
Don't let the greatness get you down  
Heavy is the head that wears the crown,  
Don't let the greatness get you down  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
At the end, at the end,  
Who am I living for?  
At the end, at the end,  
Who am I living for?
