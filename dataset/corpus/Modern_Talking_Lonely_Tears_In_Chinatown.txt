A broken heart, a pillow filled with tears  
It was hot, babe, hot through all the years  
Everybody needs someone to hold  
Never thought that heaven can be cold  
When you call me baby  
I'll be there  
A penny for your thoughts, oh to care  
  
Lonely tears in Chinatown  
Are too danger, dangerous  
You can have this love for free  
Lonely tears in Chinatown  
Are too danger, dangerous  
If you're ready, go with me  
His love is  
D-d-d-danger  
D-d-d-danger  
You can have the best for free  
His love is  
D-d-d-danger  
D-d-d-danger  
Come on, take the rest of me  
  
Tonight did what  
It means to be so young  
When two hearts are beating  
Just as one  
Our love can go a long, long way  
There's nothing left for me to say  
Nobody makes me crazy, like you do  
Take the starts out of the sky for you
