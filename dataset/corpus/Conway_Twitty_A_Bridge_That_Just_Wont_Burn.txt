A Bridge That Just Won't Burn  
I threw away the pictures of those better days in Dallas  
But I can't throw away these pictures in my mind  
She's a page of precious memories  
  
I've tried hard to turn  
She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn  
If only time will heal the hurt  
Then this may last forever  
  
I may never know how it feels to forget  
Every time I think about her  
Those old feelings still return  
She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn  
  
I've burned a lot of bridges in my time  
But the one I just crossed over  
It ain't the burning kind  
She's that once in a lifetime  
  
Kind of love that never will return  
She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn  
She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn
