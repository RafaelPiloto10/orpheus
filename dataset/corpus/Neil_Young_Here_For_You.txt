When your summer days come tumbling down  
And you find yourself alone  
Then you can come back and be with me  
Just close your eyes and I'll be there  
Listen to the sound  
Of this old heart beating for you  
Yes I'd miss you  
But I never want to hold you down  
You might say I'm here for you  
  
When the winter comes to your new home  
And snowflakes are falling down  
Then you can come back and be with me  
Just close your eyes and I'll be there  
Listen to the sound  
Of this old heart beating for you  
Yes I'd miss you  
But I never want to hold you down  
You might say I'm here for you  
  
In the spring, protective arms surrounding you  
In the fall, we let you go your way  
Happiness I know will always find you  
And when it does, I hope that it will stay  
  
Yes I miss you  
But I never want to hold you down  
You might say I'm here for you  
Yes I miss you  
But I never want to hold you down  
You might say I'm here for you  
I'll always be here for you
