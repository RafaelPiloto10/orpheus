See the way the wind blows  
Lives are intertwined  
Watch the way the world goes  
The man deals out our plight  
  
Jester in the corner  
Laughs without a sound  
Jester in the corner  
Malady abounds  
In our souls  
  
See the way the sun sets  
Twilight of this life  
The man is making little bets  
Playing with our lives  
  
All that I believe now  
Anything is possible  
A simple explanation  
For the evil in this world  
And in our souls  
In our souls  
  
Come down to sorry and sable  
It's always the man  
Always keeping you down  
  
Bow down cause I see it before me  
Shadow and light  
That always keeps you running  
  
Shut up you talk too much  
Pay the man  
Shut up you talk too much  
  
Look at you and your struggle for freedom  
But you ain't nothing  
We all pay the man for living  
  
Wouldn't it be nice for a change now  
To be unchained  
My life is for me now  
But this is life  
Pay the man  
  
Shut up you talk too much  
Pay the man  
Shut up you talk too much  
Pay the man
