Come to the rescue now  
Come to the rescue and stay for a little while  
Come to the burning house  
All of the ladybug's children are screaming fire  
Come to the rescue now  
CHORUS  
Tomorrow may change--tomorrow may change  
Or it may never come  
Tomorrow may change--tomorrow may change  
But it may never come  
Turn around--turn around--turn around--what do you see  
Come to the rescue now  
Come to the rescue before all our worlds collide  
Life is a dream somehow  
LIfe is speck of dust lodged in God's eye  
Life is a dream somehow  
Come to the rescue now  
Come with a mission and come with a broken heart  
Life is a dream somehow  
Life is a dream and our lives are a world apart  
Come to the rescue now  
CHORUS  
Come to the rescue  
Life is a dream somehow  
Life is a nightmare and life is a bitter pill  
(Life is a dream somehow)  
Life is a Disneyland ride which is better still  
Come to the rescue now  
Life is a drowning pool  
Life is a circus for fools just like you and me  
Life is a mortal coil  
Wrapped in cheap tin foil on a kitchen sink  
Come to the rescue now  
CHORUS  
Dreams somehow, come to the rescue now . . .
