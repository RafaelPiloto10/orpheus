Love  
Is it true  
What they say of you  
  
Gonna call the President  
Gonna call a private eye  
Gonna get the IRS  
Gonna need the FBI  
  
There's not anymore that I can do  
All the reasons that you give  
I follow you  
So when you lead them in, that'll be the end of time it's true  
  
Wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong  
Wouldn't be the last I'm sure, I've known  
With all the rumors I can tell  
Some things didn't work so well  
  
Well anyway, it feels the same  
  
As when you first told me you were gone  
So long ago but I still held on  
Through all the emotions that I've had to take  
And that's the truth, and here's the worst yet  
  
Wouldn't even matter the things that I say  
You've made your mind up and gone anyway  
And there's no use now in dragging it on  
Should've seen it coming all along  
  
Well it's true, oh, I had  
My doubts of you  
  
Gonna call the President  
Gonna call myself a private eye  
Gonna need the IRS  
Gonna get the FBI  
  
Gonna make this a federal case  
Gonna wave it right down in your face  
Read it baby with your morning news  
With a sweet hangover  
And the headlines too, now  
  
I bet you think I'm doing this all for my health  
I should've looked again then at somebody else  
Feelin' like I've done way more than wrong  
Feelin' like I'm livin' inside of this song  
Feelin' like I'm just too tired to care  
Feelin' like I've done more than my share  
Could've been the way that I carried on  
Like a broken record for so long  
  
And I do  
Oh, oh  
I'm gonna call the President  
I'm gonna call a private eye  
Gonna get the IRS  
Gonna need myself the FBI  
  
Oh, what shall I do?  
If I gave my heart to you  
It's such a crime you know it's true  
  
Gonna call the president  
Gonna need myself a private eye  
Ooh, gonna need the IRS  
Gonna get the FBI  
  
Gonna make it a federal case  
Gonna wave it right down in your face  
Read it baby with your morning news  
With the sweet hangover and the headlines too  
  
There's not anymore that I can do
