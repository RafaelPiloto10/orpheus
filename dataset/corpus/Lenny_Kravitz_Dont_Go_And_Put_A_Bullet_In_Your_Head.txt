Yeah  
(Thank you Jesus for the song)  
Hey Hey hey hey...  
Don't do it don't do it  
  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
  
I'm gonna get it  
But workin' nine to five just doesn't let it  
I feel I'm wastin' time and I regret it  
Can't even feed my kids and my wife  
  
Oh I'm longing to find it  
A taste of the sweeter life oh my  
Only takes a little time  
(No don't do it)  
  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
  
Oh my oh my  
Ain't got no credit  
Can't even pay my rent  
Where will I get it ?  
  
There's a liquor store right down the block I'll get it  
Can't even feed the pain in my heart  
Oh I'm longing to find  
( I'm longing to find )  
  
A piece of the bigger pie, oh my  
( A different kind )  
Only it takes a little time  
( A little time )  
(No don't do it)  
  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
  
Oh my oh my oh my ...  
  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Put a bullet in your head, oh my  
  
Oh my, put a bullet in your head, oh my  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Oh my, oh my oh my.
