Up above me are the skies like the twinkle in your eyes  
These things are the colors of the blues  
In the mail your letter came the ink and paper looked the same  
Blue must be the color of the blues  
  
Bluebird's singin' in the trees seems to sympathize with me  
But he's not singing like he used to do  
The pearly waters in the sea feel as cold as you left me  
Blue must be the color of the blues  
  
There's a rainbow overhead with more blue than gold and red  
Blue must be the color angels choose  
A blue dress you proudly wore when you left to return no more  
Blue must be the color of the blues  
  
Blue days come and blue days go how I feel nobody knows  
Life is mighty empty without you  
There's a blue note in each song that I sing since you are gone  
Blue must be the color of the blues
