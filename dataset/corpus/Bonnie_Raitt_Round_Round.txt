There's a brand new dance  
That just hit this town  
Makes you feel so good  
  
This dance they call the round and round  
Round and round, up and down  
Round and round, up and down  
You know the kids got a bloodhound  
Out on the playing ground  
  
And when they want to have some fun  
They start to goin round and round  
Round and round, up and down  
Round and round, up and down  
I got an elevator man  
In the heart of town  
  
And when he's feeling right  
He will carry you round and round  
Round and round, up and down  
Round and round, up and down  
Baby don't be jealous  
When I come to town  
  
I'm just a country girl  
Everybody's tryin' to push poor me around  
Round and round, up and down  
Round and round, up and down
