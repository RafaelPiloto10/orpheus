Comatose, almost  
You've got me dreaming  
Slipping in  
And sliding out  
Of conscious feeling  
  
Take a light  
Start the flame  
Play the game  
I am lost  
In your eyes  
Hypnotized  
Here I believe  
Dreams never deceive  
  
Comatose, almost  
You've got me dreaming  
Slipping in  
And sliding out  
Life has no meaning  
  
Bodies move  
Colors change  
Girl, you're strange  
Here inside  
I'm at home  
I'm alive  
  
Don't be afraid  
I'm floating away  
  
Comatose, almost  
You've got me dreaming  
Slipping in  
And sliding out  
Of conscious feeling  
  
Comatose, almost  
Comatose, almost  
Comatose
