Born of the sun  
Crashed to the earth  
Tormented reviled  
Engorged hate from birth  
Hellion's the steed  
Blood's on the wing  
Claws set to slice  
Vengeance he'll bring  
  
Cremating the land  
In seek and destroy  
Apocalypse slays  
Napalm he'll deploy  
The beast of a god  
Regaled of his race  
Prepare to onslaught  
And bare face to face  
Across the divide  
The thresholds in flames  
The Painkiller rises again  
  
The scream of the demon  
There's evil about  
They've come to posses us  
Out, demons out  
  
Blade of the wheel  
Cuts deep in the bone  
It's Gideon's quest  
To take Satan's throne  
  
The critical mass  
And power that they wield  
Exterminates all  
When vermin rebel  
A maelstrom begins to disintegrate  
And pulverize all in it's wake  
  
Demonizer  
Out, out, out, demons out
