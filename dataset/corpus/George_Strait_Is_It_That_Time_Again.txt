Is it that time again?  
Closin' time closin' in  
Are they turnin' out the lights? Must I go home?  
'Cause her memory  
Is hauntingly  
Waiting there to see I'm not alone  
I know I just can't stand another lonely night  
This man is going out, out of his mind  
Since she left me behind  
Since she left me behind  
  
Am I the last one here?  
Please, just one more beer  
And I'll be on my way back to the blues  
Back down lonely street  
To a house that's peace  
I'm nothing but a line of bad news  
I know I just can't stand another lonely night  
This man is going out, out of his mind  
Since she left me behind  
Since she left me behind  
  
I know I just can't stand another lonely night  
This man is going out, out of his mind  
Since she left me behind  
Since she left me behind
