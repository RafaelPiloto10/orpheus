No need to wonder  
Do you belong?  
No need to worry  
You can be strong  
  
Don't disbelieve it  
Let your fears go  
There must be more to this life  
And we all know  
  
The solution  
Staring you down  
Looking for  
The solution  
Bringing you 'round  
  
Round and round we go  
Round and round we go  
  
The past can haunt your future so  
Shadows are falling look out below  
  
Voices are calling echoes unknown  
There must be more to this life than we all know  
  
Looking for  
The solution  
Staring you down  
Deep inside  
The solution  
Bringing you 'round  
  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
Do the best that you can do  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
It's all up to you  
  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
Do the best that you can do  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
It's all up to you  
  
It's all up to you  
  
Over and under and down we go  
(Down we go)  
Caught at the crossroads  
Which way to go?  
(Path unknown)  
Choosing the right path?  
Only you know  
  
Looking for  
The solution  
You hold the key  
Deep inside  
The solution  
Set yourself free  
  
Round and round we go  
Round and round we go  
  
Giving in, giving out  
Do the best you can do  
Giving in, giving out  
It's all up to you  
  
Giving in, giving out  
Do the best you can do  
Giving in, giving out  
It's all up to you  
  
It's all up to you  
It's all up to you
