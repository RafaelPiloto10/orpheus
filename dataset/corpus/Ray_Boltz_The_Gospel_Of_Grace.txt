The Gospel Of Grace  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Greg Gilpin and Ray Boltz  
They say in the harbor of heaven  
Is a ship called the Gospel of Grace  
A glorious ship, that once made a trip  
Through the oceans of time and space  
She followed a star to a stable  
She carried the Child of the King  
And when she set sail  
So goes the tale  
All of the angels would sing  
Chorus:  
The Gospel of Grace is sailing  
What a glorious sight to behold  
Her heavenly banners are waving  
Her sails are covered with gold  
They say when a man looks upon her  
The glory will shine on his face  
For therell never be  
A ship on the sea  
Like the glorious Gospel of Grace  
She sailed to the land of the lonely  
To the meek and the lowly she came  
And each one she passed  
From the first to the last  
Would never again be the same  
The voice of the Father had spoken  
A heavenly sign had come down  
And everyone knew  
His promise was true  
The heavens were filled with the sound  
Chorus  
Then one day she sank to the bottom  
At a place called old rugged cross  
But the Child of the King,  
Now her captain  
Came sailing her back to the top  
And then as they sailed  
Off toward heaven  
He called out, Get ready my friends  
I must go away, but therell come a day  
I promise youll see Me again  
And the Gospel of Grace will be sailing  
What a glorious sight well behold  
Her heavenly banners a waving  
Shes coming to carry us home  
For now we see through a glass darkly  
But then we will see face to face  
And as we climb aboard  
Well give thanks to the Lord  
For His glorious Gospel of Grace  
And as we climb aboard  
Well give thanks to the Lord  
For H
