Throughout the soft and timeless days of August  
'Til now the shadows begin to grow much longer  
The sunset's fire has deepened blood red  
I give you this, the last rose of summer  
  
A token of my unyielding love  
So when the winter's mantle stills the earth  
And all around seems dead and cold  
This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living  
  
Do not despair, mother nature simply rests  
In sleep she has well earned  
'Til one day not so very far from now  
With the opening of the first rose buds I shall return  
  
A token of my unyielding love  
So that when winter's mettle steals the earth  
And all around seems dead and cold  
This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living  
  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
In your long shadows  
The last rose of summer  
In the sunset  
The last rose of summer  
Take this rose that I give you  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
Don't worry about the winter  
The last rose of summer  
I shall return  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer  
The last rose of summer
