There's a man drinkin' whiskey in a barroom  
He's nursin' a broken heart  
There's a woman at a table  
With her own brand of misery  
Cryin' in the dark.  
  
[Chorus]  
Will two hearts make on tonight  
Will somebody lost fond someone who's lost  
Will strangers info comfort  
In the cold neon light  
Will two hearts make one tonight.  
  
Oh, there's just a waitress between them  
They're so close to finding their dreams  
They're just one dance away  
From easing the pain  
Of coming apart at the seams.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Will two hears make one tonight
