There's an old love refrain that has known the world over,  
It's sweetness both princes and peasants may calim,  
Like a bird on the wing or a bee in the clover,  
No matter the language the song is the same.  
  
Go to sleep, my baby, go to sleep,  
While the stars above begin to peep,  
They're lighting the windows of heaven, angels watch over you.  
From the windows of heaven, mother's watching you too.  
  
Sleep, my baby, sleep.  
From the windows of heaven, mother's watching you too.  
  
Sleep, my baby, sleep.
