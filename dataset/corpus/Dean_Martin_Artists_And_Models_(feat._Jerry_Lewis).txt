You can trace the mystery of ancient history  
Through art of artists and their models  
You can comb through the Rome coliseum  
And the rear of your nearest museum  
There's the Mona Lisa, the Tower of Pisa  
A cowhand's daughter out in Texas  
And there's modern art to see  
That makes you wonder  
What the heck is meant to be  
On the streets of Murmark there's a fancy kind of art that is strictly for the  
Tourists from the sticks  
And those wise Greenwich guys really open up your eyes painting portraits of  
Their pretty little chicks  
So to each creator and imitator who daubs and dabbles with the brushes  
To the guys that draw their bunnies or the Sunday morning funnies  
And brighten up the world today  
And to every girl that poses to every Grandma Moses  
We like to tip the old beret
