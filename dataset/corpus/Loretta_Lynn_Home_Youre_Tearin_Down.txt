I don't know your name I wouldn't know your face  
But you're right with the one I love out there someplace  
You have an invitation be free to come around  
Come over anytime and see the home you're tearin' down  
Once some happy faces would have met you at the door  
But since their daddy's gone so much they don't smile anymore  
There's shattered parts of broken hearts just scattered all around  
Come over anytime and see the home you're tearin' down  
[ steel ]  
I'll dry all my tears and have the coffee hot  
Cause I can't sleep a wink no more time's all I've got  
You see the price I'm payin' for happiness you've found  
Come over anytime and see the home you're tearin' down  
You've told how much you loved him you can surely tell me too  
I'd like to know just what you've done to make him turn to you  
I swallow pride and hear you sigh if you'll just come around  
Come over anytime and see the home you're tearin' down
