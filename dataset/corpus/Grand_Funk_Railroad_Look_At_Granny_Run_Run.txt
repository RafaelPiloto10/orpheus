Look at granny run, run, and grandpa runnin' close behind.  
Look at granny run, run, there's something on grand-daddy's mind.  
He went to the doctor, got a brand new pill.  
The doctor said, "son, you ain't over the hill."  
Now he can't sit still.  
Great, gosh, almighty, won't you ...  
  
  
Look at granny go, go, faster than a greyhound bus.  
Look at granny go, go, now grandpa gettin' serious.  
But he woke up in the middle of the night.  
Said, "lookie here baby, everything's alright."  
It was such a fright.  
Great, gosh, almighty, won't you ...  
  
  
Look at granny run, run ...  
  
  
Look at granny run, run, and grandpa gettin' closer now.  
No matter how she run, run, he gonna' catch her anyhow.  
He said, "mama, quit your caryin' on.  
All I want's a little love before I am gone.  
Ain't nothin' wrong."  
Great, gosh, almighty, won't you ...  
  
  
Look at granny run, run.  
Look at granny run, run.
