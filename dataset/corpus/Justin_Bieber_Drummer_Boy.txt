Come, they told me,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
Our new born king to see,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
Our finest gifts we bring,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
To lay before the king,  
Pa rum pum pum pum,  
Ra pum pum pum,  
Ra pum pum pum  
  
Ra pum pum pum,  
Ra pum pum pum pum pum,  
Yeah I'm on the drum,  
Yeah I'm on the stand drum,  
Yeah I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb,  
And they only spare heat 'cause I'm playing for the sun,  
Playing for the king, playing for the title,  
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible,  
I'm so tight I might go psycho,  
Christmas time so here's a recital,  
I'm so bad like Michael I know,  
I'm still young but I go I go,  
Stupid, stupid, love like cupid,  
I'ma drummer boy so do, do  
  
Little baby,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I am a poor boy too,  
Pa rum pum pum pum (gather round the mistletoe real quick)  
I have no gifts to bring,  
(He he matter fact let's gather round the fireplace while we get hot here)  
That's fit to give our king, (Bieber what'd up?)  
Pa rum pum pum pum, (yeah)  
Ra pum pum pum, (yeah)  
Ra pum pum pum (yeah) (I'm gonna get straight to it)  
  
At the table with the family,  
Having dinner, Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker,  
Then it gave a lil' flicker then  
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer  
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter,  
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers,  
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla,  
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla,  
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter,  
I said cool, cool,  
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little
bigger,  
Before we work I gotta get this off,  
See the other family members and drop gifts off,  
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping,  
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now,  
People everywhere and all our twitter followers,  
Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, happy Hanukkah!  
  
Mary nodded,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
The ox and lamb kept time,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I played my drum for him,  
Pa rum pum pum (yeah yeah yeah)  
I played my best for him,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
Rum pum pum pum  
Rum pum pum pum  
  
If you wanna give it's the time of year,  
JB on the beat yeah yeah I'm on the stand,  
It's crazy how some people say they don't care,  
When there's people on the street with no food it's not fair,  
It's about time for you to act merrily,  
It's about time for you give to charity,  
Rarely to people don't wanna even help at all,  
'Cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls,  
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold,  
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold,  
So I think some of you need to act bold,  
Can we give to a tribe let's change the globe,  
  
Ima drummer boy so do, do  
Ima drummer boy so do, do  
Ima drummer boy so do, do  
Ima drummer boy so do, do  
Ima drummer boy so do, do
