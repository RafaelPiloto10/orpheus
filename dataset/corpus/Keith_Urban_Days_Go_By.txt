Whoa!  
  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
I'm changing lanes and talkin' on the phone  
Drivin' way too fast.  
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me  
Afraid of comin' in last.  
But somewhere in the race we run,  
We're coming undone  
  
[Chorus]  
And days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window in the wind.  
The cars go by,  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin' right now  
'Cause days go by,  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
  
Out on the roof just the other night  
I watched the world flash by,  
Headlights, taillights,  
Running through a river of neon signs.  
But somewhere in the rush I felt,  
We're losing ourselves  
  
And days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window in the wind.  
The cars go by,  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin' right now  
Days go by,  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
Yeah the days go by  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
  
We think about tomorrow then it slips away.  
Oh, yes, it does.  
We talk about forever but we've only got today  
  
And the days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window as the cars go by  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin',  
You better start livin',  
Better start livin' right now!  
  
'Cause days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window in the wind.  
The cars go by,  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin' right now  
'Cause days go by,  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
Yeah these days go by  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
  
Oh!  
So take 'em by the hand,  
They're yours and mine.  
Take 'em by the hand,  
And live your life.  
Take 'em by the hand,  
Don't let 'em all fly by!  
  
Come on, come on now,  
Yeah!  
Come on now!  
Oh and a woo-hoo!  
Don't you know the days go by
