Ow!!  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Home grown, on the bone  
All the channels show the same old war zone  
As I walk alone in the city  
Makin' me an offer, now don't they look pretty  
New cinema  
Live action, all the noise of attraction beats up  
On the streets, the sellers do mark up  
Better than tellin' 'em off, don't stock up  
Shark, they don't bite  
All that matters is you're not here tonight  
And now that I wonder  
Am I gonna dig a hole ten feet under  
Under sea, under you, under we, undivided,  
Undecided  
  
[Chorus]  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you, make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
Up north where the snow grows colder  
I travel onward 'cross the border  
  
Looked up a girl that I once knew frozen  
To be the follower of the deity  
Make myself scarce while they  
come to plea bargain  
for my body and soul  
All the flames go around, surround me  
I won't go  
  
I need the ozone  
I want to cuddle up behind your backbone  
I never stay long where I'm not wanted  
I fell haunted  
Yo brother  
Where ya gonna go  
Back to the war zone  
To break down the walls  
  
Chorus:  
  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you, make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you, make you happy  
to make you make you happy  
  
If only I knew what i should do, yeah  
To make you make you love me  
I bared my soul to the golden traces  
went to the forest of the holy places  
And now I wonder  
Am I gonna dig a hole ten feet under  
Under sea, under me, under you, under we, undivided,  
Undecided  
Yeah ... yeah  
(vocal breakdown)  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you happy  
to make you make you happy  
If I only knew  
What I should do  
To make you make you happy  
to make you make you happy  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you, make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
If I only knew  
What I should do  
To make you make you love me  
If I only knew what I should do  
If I only knew what I should do
