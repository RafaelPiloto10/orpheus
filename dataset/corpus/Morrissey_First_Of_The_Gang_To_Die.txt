You have never been in love,  
Until you have seen the stars reflect in the reservoirs  
And you have never been in love,  
Until you have seen the dawn rise,  
Behind the home for the blind  
  
We are the pretty, petty thieves,  
And you're standing on our streets  
Where Hector was the first of the gang with a gun in his hand  
And the first to do time,  
The first of the gang to die, oh my.  
Hector was the first of the gang with a gun in his hand  
And the first to do time,  
The first of the gang to die, oh my  
  
You have never been in love,  
Until you've seen the sunlight thrown,  
Over smashed human bone  
  
We are the pretty, petty thieves,  
And you're standing on our streets  
Where Hector was the  
First of the gang with a gun in his hand  
And the first to do time,  
The first of the gang to die,  
Such a silly boy  
Hector was the first of the gang with a gun in his hand  
And the bullet in his gullet and the first lost lad to go under the sod  
  
And he stole from the rich and the poor  
And the not very rich and the very poor.  
And he stole our hearts away  
He stole our hearts away,  
He stole our hearts away...
