I was runnin' from paradise  
Busy dancin' across thin ice  
Then lookin' up  
I thought somebody called my name  
But I kept on walkin' on down  
On my own way  
  
I was livin' but not enough  
Turnin' my face  
From the face of love  
Then lookin' up  
I'm certain I saw your eyes  
And I don't know how  
And I don't know why  
But I know I'm home  
  
[Chorus]  
I am not hiding  
This time I'm deciding  
Now I'm showin' up  
To give it all my love  
I am not hiding  
Now I'm standing here  
Shoutin' out to heaven  
Runnin' no more  
  
Freedom was overdue  
I was starvin' for a dream  
And the dream was you  
Then lookin' up  
Big love was pourin' down  
'N I don't know how  
'N I don't know why  
But I know I'm home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The dream of love was more  
Than I could have  
I'd almost given it up  
But darlin' now it's back  
  
I am here  
You are real  
This time I'm learnin' to feel  
I have found  
Paradise  
Showin' up in your eyes  
  
This is all I know  
No more sad goodbyes  
Kiss it all hello  
I'm showin' up for my life  
  
Oh, love is what it's all about  
You gotta go in  
To get out  
  
For once in my life  
I've found my home  
Home in your arms, darlin'  
All I know is that I'm finally home  
Strong enough to see the truth  
You gotta go in  
To get out
