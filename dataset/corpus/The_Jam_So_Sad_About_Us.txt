So sad about us  
So sad about us  
Sad - never meant to break up  
Sad - suppose we'll never make up  
Sad about us  
So bad about us  
So bad about us  
Bad - let the music stop now  
Bad - suppose we can't turn back now  
Bad about us  
Apologies mean nothing when the damage is done  
But you can't switch off my loving  
Like you can't switch off the sun  
So sad about us  
So bad about us  
Sad - never meant to break up  
Sad - suppose we'll never make up  
Sad about us
