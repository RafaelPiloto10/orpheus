Watching the sun set so low  
Tells us that it's time, the day is too end  
Nobody cries as it leaves  
Or reaches for the light  
But soon back again  
  
But then I hear you sigh  
And wish that you could stay  
I'd like another day with you  
  
Don't want to know where it ends  
I'll live with either way  
Just tell me what I have to do.  
  
Where is the joy time forgets  
You ask me if I know  
It's still as before  
Up on a breeze soaring high  
It comes alive each day  
Whenever you call  
But now to lose your love  
The charm throughout my day  
To walk along our paths all alone  
  
I have memories enough  
To help me find my way  
To bring back all the love we've known
