I sold my piano  
It couldn't come with me  
I locked up my bedroom  
And I walked out into the air  
When nothing I needed  
Is left there behind me  
I walk out through the shadows  
Of Washington Square  
  
Now I wander the highway from Dublin to Berkeley  
And I heard the songbirds of Valley Paurine  
I love like a fountain  
And it left me like nothing  
Just the memories of walking through Washington Square  
  
Now I live in the shadows  
Where light is electric  
And time is just a number  
That rests on a wall  
Nobody knows me  
My friends and my family  
Are as far from this city  
As Washington Square  
  
So cover this warm night  
In a blanket of starlight  
I will follow this freeway  
Out into the air  
In case you should wonder  
And wanted to find me  
I'm traveling homeward to Washington Square  
In case you should wonder  
I'm in Washington Square  
Washington Square  
Washington Square
