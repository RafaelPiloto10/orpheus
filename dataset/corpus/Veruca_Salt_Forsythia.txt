Yellow baby, a yellow baby is a bad sign.  
But I don't mind, I don't mind.  
Ohhh, Forsythia.  
Spider monkey, a spider monkey is a good lie.  
But I don't know why.  
Ohhh, Forsythia, oh-ohhh.  
I don't mind sitting in the way, way back.  
I don't mind, lying to my friends.  
One thing about Forsythia,  
She comes around and I get lost  
Against her yellow, I'm no longer me.  
Yellow daisy, a dandelion or a pussy willow,  
It's a different thing.  
Oh-oh, Forsythia. Forsythia. Forsythia.  
One thing about Forsythia,  
She comes around and I get lost  
Against her yellow I'm no longer me.  
One thing about Forsythia...  
There's one thing about Forsythia...
