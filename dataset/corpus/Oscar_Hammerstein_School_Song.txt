We work and work  
From week to week  
At the Royal Bangkok Academy  
And English words are all we speak  
At the Royal Bangkok...  
[Anna interrupts then starts them over]  
From week to week  
At the Royal Bangkok Academy  
And English words  
Are all we speak  
At the Royal Bangkok Academy  
If we pay attention to our teacher  
And obey her every rule,  
We'll be grateful for  
Those golden years  
At our dear old school.  
The Royal Bangkok Academy,  
Our dear old school.
