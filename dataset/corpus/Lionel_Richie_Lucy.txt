Hey Lucy why don't you come and settle down  
I hear you're the baddest girl this side of town  
Got a little money that I wanna spend  
If you'll be my friend  
For just a little while  
  
First summer you sailed on down to New Orleans  
I was a victor, you were a Cajun queen  
You had many fellas with lots of style  
And you drove them wild  
Oh little Lucy I had to be with you  
  
Traveled around the country  
Oh and I made my way  
I never once forgot what I felt that day  
Now I think I'm ready to play my hand  
I wanna be your man which is hard to do  
Oh Lucy I'm so in love with you  
  
I've been a wandering man for such a long time  
Now I know just where I'm going  
Oh how I need you to stand by my side  
Don't you go away  
Cause I'm so in love with you  
  
I've been searchin' for you Lucy for such a long time  
Now I wanna let you know what I have on my mind  
You've been around a lonely man  
A lonely man  
I've been a lonely man  
Lucy  
I don't want to live my life without you  
There were times when I tried to get you off my mind girl  
You're the girl of my dreams  
Oh you're the girl of my dreams  
Lucy  
(Ahh my Lucy)  
So many lonely nights I need you girl  
(Ahh my Lucy)
