God, for the life of me  
I don't know why  
We hurt each other  
In the name of what is right.  
God, for the life of me  
I don't understand  
Echos everyday of man's  
Inhumanity to man.  
Man's inhumanity to man.  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a river of sorrow  
Running through my heart.  
Through the long night I will follow  
The glimmer in the dark.  
Lord, you are the human spark.  
  
God, for the life of me  
I cannot explain  
How people born of love  
Lose their way to hate.  
Oh, there's gotta be a better way.  
  
[Chorus]
