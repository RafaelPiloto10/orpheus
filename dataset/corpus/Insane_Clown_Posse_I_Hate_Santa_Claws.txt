(featuring Anybody Killa)  
(Bum)  
Change, please? Christmas change.  
(ABK)  
Happy holidays y'all, give me a gift  
Let me sing a little jingle while you drink that fifth (Jingle Bells)  
Tell Santa that he better stop frontin'  
That cookie eatin' mother fucker never leavin' nothin'  
But this year I swear I won't let it happen  
Sleighs, gifts and reindeer we Christmas jackin' (gimme that)  
Surround sound, hot chocolate for days  
Bumpin' through the neighborhood, actin' like we paid (look what we got)  
We had to get him, it was just that time  
J and I was fed up, and we wanted to shine (wanted to shine)  
But now we got anything you ever wanted  
Yeah, he was old but he had a fat wallet (cha-ching)  
Only workin' one day a year  
With a plush-red suit and a iced-out beard  
Slingin' snow in the north pole to a bunch of fiends  
Little guys with big ears that make toys for free  
Santa Claus, I hate you because (I hate you Santa)  
You gave me nothin', now I'm takin' yours (I'll take it)  
(Violent J)  
Uh, it was cold out, I seen a fat man comin'  
I hid behind a chimney  
And bust him in the skull with a bottle of Jim Beam  
I rolled him off the roof and onto the driveway  
And jumped in his sleigh ride and tried to fly away  
Rudolph bossed off on me, he wouldn't move  
I had to kick him in his ass, outta put him in groove  
Take me to the hood, to all the poor little kids  
This year, everybody about to get some good shit  
We landed on a house, I went for the chimney  
But the roof was feeble, I crashed through and smashed through the kitchen
table  
Daddy came bustin' out the bedroom strapped  
Third shot blew off my Santa hat, fuck that  
I ran out the back door and I hopped a wall  
Steady whistlin' for the reindeer, but they're like fuck off, then took off  
I almost caught a slug in the ass, and became a ghost of Christmas past over
that shit (over that bullshit)  
Santa Claus, I hate you because (I hate you Santa)  
You gave me nothin', now I'm takin' yours (I'll take it)  
Santa Claus, I hate you because (I hate you Santa)  
You gave me nothin', now I'm takin' yours (I'll take it)  
(ABK)  
Dashing through the snow, smokin' lots of dro  
Pullin' chicks with expensive gifts  
Just to get that ho ho ho, you know what I mean  
Don't get us wrong, we're gonna give to the kids  
Super Santa's hookin' up all the little shits (here ya go)  
And for the grown-up's, we gettin' to' up  
A case of malt liquor, and a sack that makes ya throw up  
(Violent J)  
Santy Claus wears panty drawers  
He never decked my halls, he can lick my balls  
I got no chimney, but I left the door unlocked  
Nothin' but pine needles and an empty sock  
Thanks a lot and fuck off fatass  
Why we need coats for kids if you so badass  
Only rich boys get big toys from Santa  
I waited all night in my pajamas mother fucker  
(ABK)  
Take your ass to bed. Fuck Santa Claus  
Santa Claus, I hate you because (I hate you Santa)  
You gave me nothin', now I'm takin' yours (I'll take it)  
Santa Claus, I hate you because (I hate you Santa)  
You gave me nothin', now I'm takin' yours (I'll take it)  
(ABK)  
It's Christmas Eve, and if he show  
He leavin' with a bullet hole, let him know  
It's Christmas Eve, and if he show  
He leavin' with a bullet hole, let him know  
It's Christmas Eve, and if he show  
He leavin' with a bullet hole, let him know  
It's Christmas Eve, and if he show  
He leavin' with a bullet hole, let him know  
It's Christmas Eve, and if he show  
He leavin' with a bullet hole, let him know  
It's Christmas Eve, and if he show  
He leavin' with a bullet hole, let him know  
It's Christmas Eve, and if he show  
He leavin' with a bullet hole, let him know
