The banks of the river run through my hometown  
'BOARDED ON THE dirt roads, and I scraped my knees  
Well they paved the roads eventually  
With neon signs and car dealerships and diners  
The soldiers fill the hotels on the weekends  
I saw the pretty women as I walked through town  
Well, I moved away soon as I turned sixteen  
Figured I was old enough to go and work a job  
Well I floated down main street, pools of car lights  
WOE BECAME me, wishing I was still back home  
The soldiers fill the hotels on the weekends  
I saw the pretty women as I walked through town  
Well, Jacksonville's a city with a hopeless streetlight  
Seems like you're lucky if it ever change from red to green  
I was born in an abundance of inherited sadness  
And .50 cent picture frames bought at a five and dime  
I ended up a soldier on the weekend  
Looking for a vacancy I was NEVER to find  
Somewhere the night sky hangs like a blanket  
Shoot it with my cap gun just to make it  
Seem like stars
