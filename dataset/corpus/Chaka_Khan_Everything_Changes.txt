Everybody wants you, you got it goin' on  
And you know it's not fair  
All the ladies want to profess their love to you  
And yet you really don't care  
You might think you have everything  
Whether you do or not, I think that you forgot that  
Everything changes, left to right, cold gets hot  
Everything changes, one day will turn to night  
Whether you like it or not  
Now, I am no authority  
But I've been around and I've seen a lot  
Love's the one priority  
Either settle down or lose the little you've got  
We don't have forever  
It's now or never so shoot your best shot  
Everything changes, left to right, cold gets hot  
Everything changes, one day will turn to night  
Whether you like it or not  
It's no good to keep on holdin' back  
All those good emotions, I'll be there for you  
You might think you have everything  
Whether you know or not, I think that you forgot that
