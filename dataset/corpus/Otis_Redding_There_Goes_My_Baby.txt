There goes my baby, man  
Movin' on down the line  
I wonder where, I wonder where  
She will bound, she will bound, man  
  
I broke her heart, man, baby  
And I made her cry  
I'm alone, so all alone  
What can I do now? What can I do now?  
  
Whoa, I want my baby  
And man, I need my baby  
I wonder where, why did she leave me?  
Why did she leave me?  
I'm so all alone, and I'm so all alone?  
  
Forgot to tell her that I love her  
And when did I believe here?  
I need her right by my side  
To be my guide  
  
I wanna know, where is my  
Where is my baby, man  
I want my baby  
I need my baby  
  
And there she goin', there she goin'  
I let go my baby, baby  
She movin' on down that line  
And I wanna know where  
And I wanna know where  
She went down, she went down  
  
Come back, my baby  
Don't go no further, I need you  
Come back baby, yeah  
Don't take another step  
I need you
