Now woman, don't you feel sad when you see your life go round  
And you realise you've been drinking all of your years like wine?  
You're gambling with time and you know you just can't win  
But still you feel that somehow you've just got to keep on trying  
And woman, it's your heart I hear crying  
Now the young man by your side is your husband, or so you say  
In reality, he's a link with a past you just can't replace  
You tell the world you're happy when you're lying in his arms  
Oh, but his youth has made you hate to see his face  
And woman, it's your heart I see crying  
Now you're standing like some tree, oh, and the blossom has blown away  
And the last leaf has gone crumbling tumbling towards the ground  
You have nothing to teach me, just have nothing at all to say  
Except to keep on telling me about all the happiness that you do think you
have found
