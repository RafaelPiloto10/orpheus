Realization comes through reaping  
Reality contained in quite  
My companions are walking corpses  
I am buried with your words  
  
Turned their backs to me  
Scared to see the ghost  
Turned and walked away  
Scared to see the ghost  
  
Time to go one last look, one last touch. A ghost to those I love  
Time to go one last look, one last touch. Goodbye to those I love  
So close  
So close to separation  
  
A ghost without a grave  
A ghost without a name  
So close
