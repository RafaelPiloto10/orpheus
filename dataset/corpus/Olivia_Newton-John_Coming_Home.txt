I've wandered far away from God  
Now I'm coming home  
The paths of sin too long I've trod  
Lord, I'm coming home  
  
I've wasted many precious years  
Now I'm coming home  
I repent with bitter tears  
Lord, I'm coming home  
  
Coming home  
Yeah, I'm coming home  
Nevermore to roam  
Open wide thine arms of love  
Lord, I'm coming home  
  
Coming home  
Yeah, I'm coming home  
Nevermore to roam  
Open wide thine arms of love  
Lord I'm coming home  
  
Coming home  
Yeah, I'm coming home  
Nevermore to roam  
Open wide thine arms of love,  
Lord I'm coming home.
