It's in the life that we lead  
Set up for money and greed  
As if it isn't enough  
We have to use it all up  
Success  
Excess  
The truth is inconvenient  
  
All in your head, the reasons, let us forget  
You kept your pride in this land  
  
How could you think nothing's wrong  
You won't be smiling for long  
When it's all gone, gone, we can never go back  
  
Gone into the end, at my spend  
Watching the rain come down  
Turn your head away, ignore the fear  
Watching the ice crash down  
  
How 'bout a justice exposure  
How could you screw us all over  
Rape, steal, and murder  
Got us the almighty dollar  
The almighty dollar  
  
Poison the air that we breathe  
Change your industrial need  
Destroy the soul that you steal, the radiation is real  
Beat fate, too late, you built and fueled the fire  
  
You killed my faith, my whole earth desecrate  
Deceived the whole human race  
I know you think nothing's wrong  
We won't be breathing for long  
When it's all gone, gone  
We can never go back  
  
Gone into the end, at my spend  
Watching the rain come down  
Turn your head away, ignore the fear  
Watching the ice crash down  
  
How 'bout a justice exposure  
How could you fuck us all over  
Rape, steal, and murder  
Got us the almighty dollar  
  
Dead human disaster  
The point of no return  
No thing like ever after  
Is it too late to learn  
  
Gone into the end, at my spend  
Watching the rain come down  
Turn your head away, ignore the fear  
Watching the ice crash down  
  
How 'bout it's just an exposure  
How could you fuck us all over  
Rape, steal, and murder, got us the almighty dollar  
The almighty dollar
