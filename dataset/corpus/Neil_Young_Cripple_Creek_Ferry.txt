Hey, hey Cripple Creek ferry  
Butting through the overhanging trees  
Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry  
The waters going down it's a mighty tight squeeze.  
  
All alone the captain stands  
Hasn't heard from his deck hands.  
The gambler tips his hat and walks towards the door.  
It's the second half of the cruise.  
And you know he hates to lose.
