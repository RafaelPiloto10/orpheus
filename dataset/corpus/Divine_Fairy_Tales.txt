Mama said you better watch yourself  
  
When you flying high on the wings of love  
  
Keep your balance or you just might fall  
  
And if you fall you gotta be strong  
  
'Cause love ain't like no fairy tale  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Every time I see you 'round the way  
  
I start thinking about yesterday  
  
A picture perfect world is what I saw  
  
A picket fence, a house, a fancy car  
  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
  
I just knew that you were heaven sent  
  
You would make all of my wishes come true  
  
You'd be my knight in shining armor some day  
  
I was your princess soon to be queen

Repeat 1 until fade
