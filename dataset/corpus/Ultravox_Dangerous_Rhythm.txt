[Chorus]  
Dangerous rhythm  
Dangerous rhythm  
Dangerous rhythm in the air  
  
Stranger to stranger  
We're both dressed for danger  
Something is generating here  
  
Oh, take off your halo  
For the all-night inferno  
Something is happening in the air  
  
It's not like anything I've ever known before  
And I don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Surging and merging  
Urgent and urging  
Soft as a footstep on the stair  
  
The red light is on now  
My gravity's gone and how  
I can feel something in the air  
  
It's not like anything I've ever known before  
And I don't care  
  
[Chorus: x2]
