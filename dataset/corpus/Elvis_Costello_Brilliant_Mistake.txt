He thought he was the King of America  
Where they pour Coca Cola just like vintage wine  
Now I try hard not to become hysterical  
But I'm not sure if I am laughing or crying  
I wish that I could push a button  
And talk in the past and not the present tense  
And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear  
Like it was common sense  
It was a fine idea at the time  
Now it's a brilliant mistake  
  
She said that she was working for the ABC News  
It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use  
Her perfume was unspeakable  
It lingered in the air  
Like her artificial laughter  
Her mementos of affairs  
"Oh" I said "I see you know him"  
"Isn't that very fortunate for you"  
And she showed me his calling card  
He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two  
He was a fine idea at the time  
Now he's a brilliant mistake  
  
He thought he was the King of America  
But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams  
A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals  
The words of love in whispers  
And the acts of love in screams  
I wish that I could push a button  
And talk in the past and not the present tense  
And watch this lovin' feeling disappear  
Like it was common sense  
I was a fine idea at the time  
Now I'm a brilliant mistake
