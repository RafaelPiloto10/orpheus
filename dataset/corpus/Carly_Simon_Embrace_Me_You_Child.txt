At night I heard God whisper lullabies  
While Daddy next door whistled whisky tunes  
And sometimes when I wanted, they would harmonize  
There was nothing those two couldn't do  
  
Embrace me you child, you're a child of mine  
And I'm leaving everything I am to you  
Go chase the wild and nightime streets sang Daddy  
And God sang, Pray the devil doesn't get to you  
  
I thought together they must sing the moon away  
I thought that they must know each other well  
For the magic that they made, when they played  
Wasn't lost between their Heaven and their Hell  
  
Then one night Daddy died and went to Heaven  
And God came down to earth and slipped away  
I pretended not to notice I'd been abandoned  
But no-one sang the night into the day  
And later night time songs came back again  
But the singers don't compare with those I knew  
And I never figured out where God and Daddy went  
But there was nothing those two couldn't do
