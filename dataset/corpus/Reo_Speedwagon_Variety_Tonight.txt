If ever you think you miss the thrill of the chase  
Or just get tired of the same old face  
I can be different honey, I can be new  
Want someone else, I can be that too  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa-oh, gonna make you feel right,  
Honey if you want it, variety tonight  
Whoa-oh, gonna make you feel right,  
Honey you got it, variety tonight  
  
The faces of love have their smiles and frowns  
And every romance has its ups and downs  
There are cases when love has been less than sweet  
Love without hate is a little like light without heat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the fire will fade if you forget it  
Cause love can't live unless you let it  
Whoa, you gotta try just a little harder with the passin' days  
You got to find some new ways, ow!  
  
[Chorus]
