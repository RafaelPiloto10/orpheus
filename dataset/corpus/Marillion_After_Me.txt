There's a line on her jeans that a ball-point made  
From a careless mistake that she can't wash away  
And there's a heart on her sleeve from a spill of red wine  
There's a piece of green in the blue of her eyes  
She named it after me  
  
There's a stray dog she feeds that she found in the street  
And he loves her to hold him, but he won't let her keep him  
And he claws at the door to be let out at night  
And she makes do without him, and she worries about him  
She named him after me  
  
So if you ever decide that you have to escape  
And travel the world, and you can't find a place  
Well, you could wind up believing  
That paradise is nothing more than a feeling  
That goes on in your mind  
So if ever find out what that is  
There's something you could do  
  
'Cause if I ever hold that golden dream again  
I want to tell you  
I'm gonna name it after you
