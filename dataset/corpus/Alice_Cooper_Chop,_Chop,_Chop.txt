Some people call me the Creeper  
'Cause they don't know my name or face  
I got 'em running in circles  
Because a homicidal genius never leaves a trace  
I'm a lonely hunter  
City full of game  
Walkin' in the neon lights  
  
[Chorus:]  
Chop, chop, chop, engine of destruction  
Chop, chop, chop, a perfect killing machine  
Chop, chop, chop, it's a symbiotic function  
Chop, chop, chop, I keep the city so clean  
Chop, chop, chop  
  
Some people call me the Ripper  
Stole my modus operandi from the movie screen  
She's just a celluloid stripper  
Just another bloody player in my splatter-filled dream  
Women on the streets  
Want money when we meet  
I take them for a little ride  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She was standing on the corner  
With her bright red lips  
Her face was so white and pale (so pale)  
She had a black leather skirt  
That was tight to her hips  
And an anklet with a name  
It spelled M-A-R-Y... Gail  
Gail, Gail, Gail, Gail  
Gail, Gail, Gail, Gail
