So she smiled at you when you saw her today  
And you're still thinking bout the things she had to say  
She said leaving you was hard to do and it's sad we had to part  
But don't let it go to your heart  
So she told you she thinks of you now and then  
Now you're thinking she might take you back again  
But it's only cause she's lonely and she's about to fall apart  
So don't let it go to your heart  
Cause I'm your heart and I can tell you that it doesn't mean a thing  
She's just like you she hangs on to a helpless hopeless dream  
She's made the break and it's hard to take  
As you watch her teardrops start  
But don't let it go to your heart  
[ guitar ]  
Cause I'm your heart...  
No don't let it go to your heart
