It's so rare to find a friend like you  
Somehow when you're around the sky is always blue  
The way we talk  
The things you say  
The way you make it all ok  
And how you know  
All of my jokes  
But you laugh anyway  
  
If I could wish for one thing  
I take the smile that you bring  
Wherever you go in this world I'll come along  
Together we dream the same dream  
Forever I'm here for you, you're here for me  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song  
  
Now every day is something new  
And any path we take I'm looking forward to  
The way we try and never quit  
The way that all the pieces fit  
The way we know the parts by heart  
And sing out loud  
  
If I could wish for one thing  
I take the smile that you bring  
Wherever you go in this world I'll come along  
Together we dream the same dream  
Forever I'm here for you, you're here for me  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song  
  
And anywhere you are you know I'll be around  
And when you call my name I'll listen for the sound  
  
If I could wish for one thing  
I take the smile that you bring  
Wherever you go in this world I'll come along  
Together we dream the same dream  
Forever I'm here for you, you're here for me  
Oh ooh oh two voices one song  
  
If I could wish for one thing  
I take the smile that you bring  
With you by my side I can go on  
Now I have all that I need  
And the sweetest sound will always be  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song  
Oh oh oh  
Two voices, one song
