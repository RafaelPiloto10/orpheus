Bring out the charge of the love brigade  
There is spring in the air once again  
Drink to the sound of the song parade  
There is music and love everywhere  
Give a little love to me (I want it)  
Take a little love from me, I want to share it with you  
I feel like a millionaire  
  
Once we were mad, we were happy  
We spent all our days holding hands together  
Do you remember, my love?  
How we danced and played  
In the rain we laid  
Wish that we could stay there, forever and ever  
  
Now I am sad  
You are so far away  
I sit counting the hours day by day  
Come back to me, how I long for your love  
Come back to me - be happy like we used to be  
Come back, come back to me  
Come back, come back to me - aah  
Oh, come back to me, oh my love  
How I long for your love - won't you come back to me, yeah  
My fine friend - take me wiz you unt love me forever  
My fine friend - forever - forever

You make me feel like a millionaire
