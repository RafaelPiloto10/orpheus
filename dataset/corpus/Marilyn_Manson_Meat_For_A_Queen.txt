Meat for a Queen  
Fornicators in wooden silence  
Throw grubsteaks on the offering plate  
Supplication congregation  
Count the creases in your face  
Prophet preaches hypocrisy  
Disemboweling heresy  
And your falsities and your falsities  
And your falsified sexuality  
  
You can't prove anything that happened yesterday... Now is the only thing
that's  
Real  
  
The sky was purple and my eyes were red  
I fell from the firmament upon my head  
Was it something something something I said?  
One day people gonna make me dead  
  
Caught in this dream  
Can't hear me scream  
It's another variation on my theme  
I'm omnipotent fiend  
I'm meat for a queen  
My hair runs black and my eyes go green  
  
You can't prove anything. You can't prove anything  
  
You don't need your worthless mortal body  
Belief is just a pitiful noose  
Your god is cerebral masturbation  
And satan is your sorry excuse  
  
Fuck fuck fuck fuck  
You can't prove anything that happened yesterday... Now the only thing that's  
Real  
  
You don't need your worthless mortal body  
Belief is just a pitiful noose  
Your god is cerebral masturbation  
And satan is your sorry excuse  
  
You don't need your worthless mortal body  
You don't need your worthless mortal body  
You don't need your worthless mortal body  
Belief is just a pitiful noose  
  
You can't prove anything
