I'm gettin' hot  
I've got to give a shot  
She wants it all  
And that's a lot  
  
I'm gettin' ready  
The love's lookin' steady  
It's gettin' sticky  
I thought she might miss me  
She looked at me and said  
  
I need a little  
Push, push  
Gonna give a little  
Push, push  
If ya take a little  
Push, push  
Then you'll get a little  
Push, push  
  
She's lookin' fine  
Flashin' like a neon sign  
She thinks it's love  
I said that comes with time  
  
I'm gettin' ready  
The love's lookin' steady  
It's gettin' sticky  
I thought she might miss me  
She looked at me and said  
  
I need a little  
Push, push  
Come and give a little  
Push, push  
If ya take a little  
Push, push  
Then you'll get a little  
Push, push  
Whoa, yea  
Push on  
  
I'm gettin' ready  
The love's lookin' steady  
It's gettin' sticky  
I thought she might miss me  
She looked at me and said  
  
I need a little  
Push, push  
Come and give a little  
Push, push  
If ya take a little  
Push, push  
Then you'll get a little  
Push, push  
  
Woo, push, push  
Mmm, keep pushin' me  
Push, push  
Push on  
Push, push  
Ooo, yea, yea  
Push, push
