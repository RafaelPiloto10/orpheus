He's a twentieth century boy  
With his hands on the rails  
Trying not to be sick again  
And holding on for tomorrow  
  
London ice cracks on a seamless line  
He's hanging on for dear life  
And so we hold each other tightly  
And hold on for tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
La, la la l-la, la, la la, l-la l-la la-la-la  
La, la la l-la, la, la la, l-la l-la la-la-la  
La, la la l-la, la, la la, l-la l-la la-la-la  
Holding on for tomorrow  
  
She's a twentieth century girl  
With her hands on the wheel  
Trying not to be sick again  
Seeing what she can borrow  
London's so nice back in your seamless rhymes  
But we're lost on the West way  
So we hold each other tightly  
And we can wait until tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're trying not to be sick again  
And holding on for tomorrow  
  
She's a twentieth century girl  
Holding on for dear life  
And so we hold each other tightly  
And hold on for tomorrow  
  
(Jim stops and gets out of the car  
Goes to a house in Emperor's Gate  
Through the door and to his room, and then he puts the TV on  
Turns it off and makes some tea  
Says modern life is rubbish)  
I'm holding on for tomorrow  
  
(Then Susan comes into the room  
She's a naughty girl with a lovely smile  
Says, 'let's take a drive to Primrose Hill  
It's windy there, and the view's so nice.'  
London ice can freeze your toes, like anyone, I suppose)  
You're holding on for tomorrow
