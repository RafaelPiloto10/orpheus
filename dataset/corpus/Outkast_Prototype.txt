I hope that you're the one  
If not, you are the prototype  
We'll tiptoe to the sun  
And do things I know you like  
  
[Chorus]  
I think I'm in love again [Repeat: x2]  
  
Today must be my lucky day  
Baby, you are the prototype  
Do sumn' outta the ordinary  
Like catch a manatee  
Baby you are the prototype  
I think I'm..  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If we happen to part  
Lord knows I don't want that  
But hey, we can't be mad at God  
We met today for a reason  
I think I'm on the right track now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The Scene  
Come here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girl, right now I want to say, I want to say  
I want to say stank you very much  
For picking me up  
And bringing me back to this world  
I can't, I'm not  
I can't afford to not record  
I thank I want to say  
I thank I want to say stank you, stank you  
Smelly much!  
For picking me up and bringing me back to this world  
Hey, hey John! Are we recording our ad libs?  
Really? Were we recording just then?  
Let me hear that, that first one  
When I first started
