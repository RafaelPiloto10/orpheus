You're gone. As suddenly as you came to me  
Like nightfall followed dawn without a day between  
You're gone and suddenly I can't see  
I'm in the shadow of you  
I'm in the shadow of you  
  
I can see you in my minds rose-tinted eye..  
Somewhere you're drifting by  
Your heels rolling sparks on the lucky street  
  
While here am I, left behind  
Stunned and blind  
But I can see you from here  
I can see you so clear  
  
You are the light  
You are the light  
You have the day  
I have the night  
But we have the early hours together  
  
You're gone, and heaven cries.  
A thunderstorm breaks from the northern sky  
Chasing you back to the daily grind  
  
You're gone. And where am I?  
A haunted life  
The ghost of your laughter  
The half-empty glass  
The half-empty glass  
  
And I wait  
'Til midnight tolls  
Two souls almost touching in the dark  
I'll be allright  
  
You are the light  
You are the light  
You have the day  
I have the night  
But we have the early hours  
We have the early hours  
We have the early hours together
