I dress myself in black  
In black from head to heels  
I take my promise back  
Cause you don't know how it feels  
No, you don't take me as I am  
No, you don't want to know at all  
Who is the face behind the mask  
I'll be the one who'll make you fall  
Beware! Beware! I'll be the one  
The one to take you under  
Beware!  
I hate the light of day  
I'm happy when it rains  
The stars shine on my way  
But the memory remains  
No, you don't take me as I am...  
Beware! Beware! I'll be the one...  
I am the night's revenge  
I've got a soul to sell  
And yet a fist to clench  
So wait for me in hell  
Beware! Beware! I'll be the one...  
Wait for me in hell  
I'll see you in hell
