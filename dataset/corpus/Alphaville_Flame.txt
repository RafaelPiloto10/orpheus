I've been searching for so long  
Now I'm chasing the shadows away  
I've been trying, yes I tried to find my way  
No more crying in the make or break decade  
There were times when I was down  
There were times I felt so low  
My whole life just seemed to be  
A senseless quest for energy  
But I carry your flame  
All through my life, I'm a believer  
Peace deep in our hearts, all things must pass  
But we'll be together again  
  
I've been walking  
I've been walking in the rain  
When the angel of my intuition whispered hello  
Well I was quite surprised to face  
That kind of incarnation  
Love comes always unexpected  
Love strikes blind and undirected  
Love is the answer  
Love is all we need my friend  
How you came and changed the weather  
How I wanna live forever  
I carry your flame  
All through my life, I'm a believer  
Peace deep in our hearts, all things must pass  
But we'll be together
