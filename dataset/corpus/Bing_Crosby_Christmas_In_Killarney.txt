The holly green, the ivy green  
The prettiest picture you've ever seen  
Is Christmas in Killarney  
With all of the folks at home  
  
It's nice, you know, to kiss your beau  
While cuddling under the mistletoe  
And Santa Claus you know, of course  
Is one of the boys from home  
  
The door is always open  
The neighbors pay a call  
And Father John before he's gone  
Will bless the house and all  
  
How grand it feels to click your heels  
And join in the fun of the jigs and reels  
I'm handing you no blarney  
The likes you've never known  
Is Christmas in Killarney  
With all of the folks at home
