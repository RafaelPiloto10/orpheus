A hero was he  
Touching all our lives  
As if he lived and died  
In a single moment  
Great were his deeds  
All his words were true  
He lived and died  
A man of honor  
He paid with his life  
For his life was the price  
To pass the gates immortal  
Thy journey begins  
With sword in the wind  
Stay thy hand rest thy command  
For odin's call was heard above them all  
Thy name shall never die!  
Long shall we remember  
He who walked the road of danger  
Master of revenge  
Death's no stranger  
Blood and death lived on his sword  
The god of war his only lord  
Into the depths of hell  
Go all he fell  
Take thy shield take thy sword  
All thy weapons to the sky  
Ye shall need them when odin bid thee rise  
For none but the brave  
Shall rise up from the grave  
To see the valkyries fly  
And so it was by the hand of odin  
Did the immortal warrior pass through  
The gates of valhalla and into legend.  
Rise brother rise pass valhalla's gates  
Here great warriors await  
Reborn from thy steel  
All thy wounds be healed  
From the earth to the sky  
Now the son of odin rise!  
Take thy place among the kings  
For thy soul shall never die!
