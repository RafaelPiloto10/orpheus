You know better and I know better, let's do it anyway  
Throw our hearts into the wind and let the music play  
  
One more time, for old time's sake where could we go wrong?  
We know every word by heart, come on, let's sing our our love song  
  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, sha la la, love song we can find the harmony and sing it
all night long  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, sha la la, love song sing it sweet and sing it low, till
all the music's gone  
  
There's no telling what could happen if it happens right  
We may just turn the record over and let it play all night  
  
It's got an old familiar feeling made you sing along  
There's no sweeter melody come sing this old love song with me  
  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, sha la la, love song we can find the harmony and sing it
all night long  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, sha la la, love song sing it sweet and sing it low, till
all the music's gone  
  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, sha la la, love song  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, sha la la, love song  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, sha la la, love song.....
