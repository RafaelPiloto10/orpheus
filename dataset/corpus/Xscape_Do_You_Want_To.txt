Hey baby, I want to know one thing.  
Do you want me as much as I want you?  
Say you do  
  
Never should have kissed you  
Never made that call  
I told myself  
In love I shouldn't fall  
Would've been a pleasure just to know your name  
Oh, look at me, silly me, now I'm back in love again  
And there's nothing you can tell me  
Nothing you can do  
I just hope that you're in love with me  
The way that I'm in love with you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Do you want to  
Like I want to be in love with you  
Say you do  
Do you want to  
Like I want  
I want to make love to you  
Say you do  
Never understand it  
Love that takes control  
Oh, I asked myself  
Girl should you let it go?  
That would be to crazy  
Love without you  
Hate to think  
Happily that you won't be around  
Now there's nothing you can tell me  
Nothing you can say  
Promise me you'll stay with me  
Until my dying day
