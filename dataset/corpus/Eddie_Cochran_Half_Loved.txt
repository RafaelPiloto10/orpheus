Well the party is through, we said our good-byes  
We had a good time, yet there's tears in my eyes  
Oh, what can it be, what's the matter with me  
You left me half loved  
We stood in the dark and you held my hand  
Why were you afraid, I can't understand  
I wanted your kiss, but it's always like this  
You left me half loved  
Well you hold me close, everytime we danced  
  
Am I a fool, to think that I had a chance  
To hope, you see, I'm your big romance  
Baby that's why I'm in the dark  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, my friends have all said  
To love you is wrong  
They say you're too young, but I'll string along  
Someday you'll wake up and then I'll make up  
For bein' half loved
