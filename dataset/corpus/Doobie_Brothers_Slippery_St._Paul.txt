Down along the river  
Where the big bulrushes grow  
You find the old frog jumpin the water  
He won't come up no more, babe  
He won't come up no more, baby  
He won't come up no more, woo  
He won't come up no more, sugar mama  
He won't come up no more  
  
Smell that burnin' fire, baby  
Burnin' in the sand  
See that devil rise, mama  
He sho' want to take yo' hand, now  
He sho' want to take yo' hand, baby  
He sho' want to take yo' hand, woo  
He sho' want to take yo' hand, sugar mama  
He sho' want to take yo' hand,  
  
Oh, harvest moon  
Keep shinin' your light down on me  
The lord reach out his hand  
My soul floats out to thee  
  
I don't feel no pain  
When they shot me down  
Lay my body out, baby  
They put me in the ground so cold  
They put me in the ground, baby  
They put me in the ground, woo  
They put me in the ground, sugar mama  
They put me in the ground
