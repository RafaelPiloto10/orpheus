I'm alive again  
Darkness far behind me  
I'm invincible  
Despair will never find me  
  
I feel strong  
I've got a new sense of elation  
Boundless energy  
Euphoria fixation  
  
Still talk to just get by  
Seems so meaningless to try  
When all I want to do is cry  
Who would ever know I felt so sad  
  
'Cause even though I get so high  
I know that I will never fly  
And when I fall out of the sky  
Who'll be standing by?  
(Will you be standing by?)
