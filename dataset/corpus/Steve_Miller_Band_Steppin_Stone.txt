I was your steppin' stone  
I was your little dog's bone  
But now you've made it without me  
You know all about me  
And that's all right  
  
You cry  
The whole night long  
I try  
Love's right and wrong  
And now the sun's sleepin' through  
And it's down on you, too  
It's just not fair  
  
Now what is right is right  
And what's done's done  
But before you come 'round my door, woman  
Gonna see where you're comin' from  
Better count up your change  
And put a smile on your mind  
Before you want away for any more of my time  
I couldn't have loved you better  
I could have loved you worse  
I know what comes last baby  
And you've known it from the first  
  
I was your steppin' stone  
I was your little dog's bone  
But now you've made it without me  
You know all about me  
And that's all right
