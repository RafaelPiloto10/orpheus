(Ben E King)  
  
Let's not fight it anymore  
Unpack the bags and close the door  
I'll never leave you, no no  
Though you lied right from the start  
I can't convince my stupid heart  
Not to believe you, no no  
You've got two good men strung out  
And there's not the slightest doubt  
That other men have loved you before  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
If I had one ounce of pride  
I'd stand up or step aside  
But girl love you (can't you tell it)  
So I'll accept the crumbs you drop  
'Cause I'm a fool and I can't stop  
Or rise above you, no no  
Let him speak up for himself  
I speak for me and no one else  
'Cause I'm a beggar knockin' on your door  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
I'm too far gone to turn around  
To lift myself up off the ground  
And start all over, over and over  
Now he or I must win or lose  
No matter which one you may choose  
You'll be in clover (you know you will)  
While you're makin' up your mind  
I'll be prayin all the time  
Prayin' that you'll never, never ever let me go  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore
