Knuckleheads spreadin' gossip all over town  
Every time I drive by you're just standin' around  
Hundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand  
Don't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man?  
L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place  
I want to take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face  
You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games  
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame  
Movies, records, goin' on tour  
Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor  
Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill  
Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill  
See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God  
I have experience in goin' all the way to the top  
It's harder harder than hard  
All the suckers are barred  
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred  
See the problem is you want what another man has  
His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz  
But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own  
Cause when you're rich you got friends  
But when you're poor you're alone  
So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul  
Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old  
Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me  
Why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree?  
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree  
Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three  
A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life  
You'll say "I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife"  
Every day is a chase, every day is a race  
And every day you're being overpowered by my bass  
Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace  
It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face  
I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed  
I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead  
I'ma lead you away from drugs and petty crime  
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme  
Lead you to that ticket line  
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine  
Get busy, not dizzy, want to teach the young  
The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung  
Not that I killed him, it's just  
He didn't want to trust  
The words of a master that's why you must  
Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear  
Don't try to say you can't hear 'cause the words are clear  
Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest  
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best  
Cause tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight  
Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right  
E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck  
If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck  
L.L. Cool J is on the microphone  
Tellin' all you punk ducks "Leave me the hell alone"  
Cause I'm rated X, born to snap necks  
Straight up and down, no special effects  
I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean  
If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens  
Cause that's where I live, and this is what I give  
Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives  
They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan  
Like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin'  
Here I am, tellin' the truth  
And I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth  
It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam  
I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans  
All you petty MC's in the state of New York  
Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still want to squawk  
Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin'  
Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'  
Your mic sounds weak, remember that sieezer  
I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar  
I'm a hit man, but I'm not for hire  
Fly girl's desire, the man you admire  
Not only on the stage, I rock in the park  
And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark  
So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound  
L.L. Cool J, the baddest around.
