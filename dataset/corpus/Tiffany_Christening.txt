Yes, yes there's a new world dawning  
Get dressed, quit dreaming you're falling  
Take notes and I'll tell you when you got it right  
No, no you can leave your attitude  
You're the only one it seems to matter to Count votes and you'll see it in a  
Brand new light  
Why can't you be a man about it  
Let me turn you into someone new  
I'm screaming in a fan  
I doubt that any of my words will make it through  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise it'll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening  
Baby, baby we're a perfect pairing  
Walk in the room and they can't stop staring  
I've gotten used to it, I've gotten used to you  
You'll never, never land another like me  
I think you're clever, please don't try to fight me  
Take notes and I'll tell you when you got it right  
Why can't you be a man about it  
Let me turn you onto something new  
I'm screaming in a fan  
I doubt that any of my words will make it through  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise it'll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise it'll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening  
Why can't you be a man about it  
(There's a new world dawning)  
We're swimming in a painted fountain  
(There's a new world dawning)  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise it'll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening...
