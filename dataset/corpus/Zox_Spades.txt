You laid your cards down on the table,  
And all your hearts have turned to spades.  
'Cause the sun ain't been seen  
Since the last time you came clean.  
I'm getting tired of so much gray.  
  
Don't you know me better than that?  
Don't you know I know you?  
Giving your words and then taking them back,  
Can't you see you're see through?  
  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You can cover your eyes and you'll still hear lies.  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
And you can cover your ears but I won't disappear. (no, no)  
  
Baby you're brimming with disaster,  
Your words spill onto the floor.  
And the only thing that's clear  
Is you're being insincere.  
So I'm not listening anymore.  
  
Don't you know me better than that?  
Don't you know I know you?  
Giving your words and then taking them back,  
Can't you see I see straight through you.  
  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
If you could cover your eyes but you'll still hear lies.  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
If you could cover your ears but I won't disappear. (no, no)  
  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You could cover your eyes but I'll still hear lies.  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You could cover your ears but I won't disappear. (no, no)  
  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You can cover your eyes but you'll still hear lies.  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You could cover your ears but I won't disappear at all.  
  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Cover your eyes and you won't hear lies.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Cover your ears so you won't disappear.
