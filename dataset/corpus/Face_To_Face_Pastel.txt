another falls in place  
you wonder if you're only human  
it's blood, dust, and paste  
we're held together by a single thread  
must be a reason for us to justify it  
but no one will defy it  
  
what is it with this place?  
or is it that I'm missing something?  
you want to see my face  
when I can't even see it for myself  
must be a reason for us to justify it  
but no one will defy it  
  
I don't want a game that I don't no how to play  
just go away  
and I don't want to know how to play  
can't I make it just go away?  
  
I don't want a game that I don't no how to play  
just go away  
and I don't want to know how to play  
can't I make it just go away?  
  
don't you understand what these problems will demand?  
make it just go away  
I don't want a game that I don't know how to play  
just go away  
  
must be a reason for us to justify it  
but no one will defy it
