Verse 1]  
How can I love someone I never touched?  
You lived under the water, but I love you so much  
You never been on land, and you never seen the sky  
You don't know what a cloud is  
Why does everything I love have to die?  
They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be  
But I couldn't let that be  
By keeping you small, by keeping you safe  
If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea  
Cause I can't bear to see  
Something so wild just die in a tank  
  
[Chorus 1]  
And Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so much  
And Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so bad  
  
[Verse 2]  
On Saturday night, we all went out to eat  
But I can never decide, so someone chose sushi  
I got soup, and I ordered rice  
But watching my friends eat my friends, ruined my appetite  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Oh, Pablow the blowfish  
If they only knew you like I do  
They'd love you too  
And Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so bad  
  
[Verse 3]  
I won't forget, even one second we had  
Cause you might be gone, but you could never be dead  
I heard of a seahorse named Sadie  
I heard she was quite the lady  
Maybe you'll find her and you could make babies  
That'd be kind of crazy  
  
[Bridge]  
If Pablow the blowfish  
Found love deep in the sea  
Then that would mean  
Pablow the blowfish  
Is better off than here with me  
  
[Outro]  
But Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so bad
