Well, I'm knocking on Death's door  
Will I take my rest, among the blessed?  
Mother, are you waiting?  
Father, are you pacing?  
I'm coming home  
  
I'm knocking on Death's door  
Will I take my rest in my Sunday best?  
Mother, are you anxious?  
Father, are you gracious?  
I'm coming home  
  
I've been away too long  
For so long you've been strong  
I've been away too long  
I know that it was wrong  
But I'm coming home  
  
Well, I'm knocking on Death's door  
Will I take my rest, have I passed the test?  
Mother, are you praying?  
Father, I am saying  
I'm coming home
