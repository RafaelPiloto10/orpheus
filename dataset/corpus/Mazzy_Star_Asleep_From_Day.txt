I know just what your mama said  
Always misunderstood  
Gotta tell you something  
I saw it in your eyes  
  
I think I left your back seat  
And now it's always good  
I fell asleep from day  
And all the promises  
  
There's a lot of people  
That let their will to say  
I've got a lot of friends  
  
And they've got beautiful eyes  
That make my heart feel surprised  
And you notice it  
And that's the truth  
That's the truth  
  
Have me to you  
I shine along underneath your view  
I'll be the one  
To let you know when you've come undone  
  
I like the stars in the sky  
And watch the moonlight go by  
I've got a lot of friends  
And they've got beautiful eyes,  
That make my heart feel surprised.  
And that's the truth,  
That's the truth (x3).
