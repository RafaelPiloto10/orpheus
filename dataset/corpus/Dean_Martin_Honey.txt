See the tree how big it's grown  
But friend, it hasn't been too long  
It wasn't big  
I laughed at her and she got mad  
The first day that she planted  
It was just a twig  
Then the first snow came  
And she ran out to brush the snow away  
It wouldn't die  
Came running in all excited  
Slipped and almost hurt herself  
I laughed till I cried  
She was always young at heart  
Kinda dumb and kinda smart  
I loved her so  
I surprised her with a puppy  
Kept me up all Christmas Eve  
Two years ago  
It would sure embarrass her  
When I came home from working late  
'Cause I would know  
That she'd been sitting there and crying  
Over some sad and silly  
Late, late show  
And Honey, I miss you  
I'm being good  
I'd love to be with you  
If only I could  
She wrecked the car and she was sad  
And so afraid that I'd be mad  
But what the heck  
Though I pretended hard to be  
Guess you could say she saw through me  
And hugged my neck  
I came home unexpectedly  
And found her crying needlessly  
In the middle of the day  
It was in the early spring  
When flowers bloom and robins sing  
She went away  
And Honey, I miss you  
And I'm being good  
I'd love to be with you  
If only I could  
Yes, one day while I wasn't home  
When she was there and all alone  
The angels came  
Now all I have is memories  
Of Honey and I wake up nights  
And call her name  
Now my life's an empty stage  
Where Honey lived and Honey played  
And love grew up  
A small cloud passes overhead  
And cries down in the flower bed  
That Honey loved  
See the tree, how big it's grown  
But friend, it hasn't been too long  
It wasn't big  
I laughed at her and she got mad  
The first day that she planted  
It was just a twig
