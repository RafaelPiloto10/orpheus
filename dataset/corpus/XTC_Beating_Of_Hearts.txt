Do you know what noise awakes you  
Every morning from your bed  
A-coming from the farthest hillside  
A-coming from inside your head  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can think of  
  
[Chorus:]  
Louder than tanks on the highway  
Louder than bombers in flight  
Louder than noises of hatred  
Dancing us from darkest night is the rhythm of love  
Powered on the the beating of hearts  
  
And did you know you had this power?  
Drumming on it always stays  
Never try to use it badly  
Tunes of good are all it plays  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can visit  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For a heart without love is a song with no words  
And a tune to which no-one is listening  
So your heart must give love and you'll find that  
You shine like rain on the leaves you'll be glistening  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can think of  
  
Louder than thoughts of dictators  
Louder than rattling swords  
Louder than loading of rifles  
Louder than screaming warlords  
  
[Chorus]
