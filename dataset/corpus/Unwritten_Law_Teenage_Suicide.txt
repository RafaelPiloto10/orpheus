Time's rollin' forward  
I'm gettin' bored  
Layin' on my back  
I'm losin' track  
Shifting patterns  
And nothin' matters  
Cause there's no one here  
I've lost my fear  
  
Well I've got no place left to hide  
I'm runnin' out of time  
Moving slowly  
The walls are closing  
In on me  
I can not see  
Appearing fine, well  
That's all a lie  
Cause I'm not alright  
  
Extinct inside  
I'm runnin' out of time  
My mother says I'm fine  
A teenage suicide  
No place to hide  
Well I've got no place left to hide  
No place to hide  
Well I'm runnin' out of time  
No place to hide  
Ya, I've got no place left to hide  
No place to hide  
A teenage suicide
