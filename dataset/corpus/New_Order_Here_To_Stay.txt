Who is this man  
That follows me  
This blue eyed boy  
Who wants to be  
  
This worthy cause  
Of human kind  
This pawn set up by time  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying  
He'll drive you away, he'll drive you insane  
But then he'll remove all of your pain  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, he'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, flying, flying  
  
This open book  
Yet to be read  
This second look  
This leap ahead  
  
The hope I held inside  
With you, was kept alive  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying  
He'll drive you away, he'll drive you insane  
But then he'll remove all of your pain  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, He'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, He'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, flying, flying  
  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, he'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, flying, flying
