My dream sonata is the music I hear  
Each night when all the world is deep in slumber  
And in my dreams, my darling, you appear.  
While the music's playing I hear you say,  
"I love you, I love you."  
  
My dream sonata has the beauty of prayer,  
A prayer my lonely heart has set to music,  
That when I wake, my darling, you'll be there.  
But when I awaken, you're gone, it seems.  
Like my sonata, you are only in my dreams.
