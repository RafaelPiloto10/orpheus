As a child Christopher was outspoken when it suited him at times he was quiet  
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are as a young man he
likes  
To do everything he liked to read he likes to be with his friends as young
kids  
Are young boys he enjoyed life everything that would make him happy are
comfortable  
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family his early  
Inspirations toward rap music were the LLs of the world the sugar hills the
Mr.  
Magic's and the fat boys of the rap channel those were all the things I heard
in  
The house even though I called it noise and banging I know now that it is a  
Accepted musical art form I was a single parent I raised my son on my own his  
Father had no influence on his decision towards the musical outlet are career
he  
Chose my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around he would have  
Turned to rap he loved music he loved rap at a point in my sons life he  
Developed paranoia about death and about the dying we are living in a world of  
I'm  
Perfect human beings we are greed jealousy and envy or manifested by what  
Others have accomplished in life my son was very very much aware of that he  
Appreciated his station in life on the directions in which he was going are  
Traveling on the other hand there were others who I should uhh use the hip hop  
Phrase player hating and I think that is what resulted in his paranoia if I
had  
To change anything in my sons life that would have allowed him to be here  
Today I would have deterred him from a career in music I'm aware that millions  
Appreciated his music millions loved his music be that it may if he hadn't  
Chosen that life style that career my son would be alive today if I could sum  
Up Christopher in one word the word would be generous th thing that my son  
Loved most about life was the fact that he was in a position to help position  
To share position to give to others who needed to others who wanted to others  
Appreciated the gifts that he gave that's what he loved most
