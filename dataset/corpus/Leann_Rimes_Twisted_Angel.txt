Ever since I was a little child  
I was told to do no wrong  
The angel in my mama's  
Precious eyes  
Could be a devil with a heart  
Of stone  
  
I couldn't help myself,  
Just had to go my way  
Now I've got hell to pay  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah I'm a twisted angel  
Flying wild and free  
Yeah I'm a twisted angel  
Flying to heaven on a  
Broken wing  
  
Back when I was daddy's little girl  
He brought me up on the  
Rolling Stones  
Thrown into the flame,  
Thrown into the world  
That's when I learned how  
To rock n' roll  
  
Look's like everything  
Has gone my way  
But I've still got hell to raise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My mama taught me right  
But the devil's up my sleeve  
It's made me kind of crazy  
But it's all right with me  
  
[Chorus]
