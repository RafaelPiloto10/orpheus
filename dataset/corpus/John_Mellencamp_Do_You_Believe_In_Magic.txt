Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart  
How the music can free her, whenever it starts  
And it's magic, if the music is groovy  
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie  
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free her soul  
But It's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll  
  
If you believe in magic don't bother to choose  
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues  
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile  
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try  
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find  
How you got there, so just blow your mind  
  
If you believe in magic, come along with me  
And we'll dance until morning till there's just you and me  
And maybe, if the music is right  
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night  
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see  
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me  
  
Yeah, do you believe in magic, yeah  
Believe in the magic of a young girl's soul  
Believe in the magic of a rock and roll  
Believe in the magic that can set you free  
Aaahhh, I'm talkin bout the magic  
  
Do you believe in magic, yeah  
Do you believe like I believe  
Now do you believe like I believe in magic  
Do you believe like I believe  
Do you believe like I believe
