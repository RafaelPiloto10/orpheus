I've made up my mind,  
Don't need to think it over,  
If I'm wrong I am right,  
Don't need to look no further,  
This ain't lust,  
I know this is love but,  
  
If I tell the world,  
I'll never say enough,  
Cause it was not said to you,  
And that's exactly what I need to do,  
If I'm in love with you,  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere  
  
I'd build myself up,  
And fly around in circles,  
Waiting as my heart drops,  
And my back begins to tingle  
Finally could this be it or  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere yeah  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if, it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?  
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere
