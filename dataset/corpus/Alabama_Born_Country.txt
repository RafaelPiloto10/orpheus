Clear creeks and cool mountain mornin's.  
Honest work out in the fields.  
Cornbread in my momma's kitchen.  
Daddy saying grace before the meal.  
Family ties run deep in this land.  
And I'm never very far from what I am.  
  
[Chorus]  
I was born country and that's what I'll always be.  
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free.  
I got a hundred years of down home running through my blood.  
I was born country and this country's what I love.  
  
Moonlight and you here beside me.  
Crickets serenadin' in the yard.  
What more could two people ask for.  
Laying here in love beneath the stars.  
Now this is where I want to raise my kids.  
Just the way my mom and daddy did.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I was born country
