"I love you," "I want you," "I need you"  
Are the lines I've heard  
I'm wanting so much to believe you  
But don't use words  
By the look in your eyes, I see you're getting weak  
Please, fight the urge to speak  
And don't say that --not now, not here  
I just want to feel your touch  
Don't say that to soothe my fear  
Show me something I can trust  
You stole my heart on the night we met  
But I'm not ready to follow it yet  
So whatever you do, don't say that  
Don't say that  
Just hold me and show me you love me  
That says it all  
These moments of tenderness  
Mean so much more  
And we'll get there eventually  
So please be patient with me  
And don't say that --not now, not here  
I just want to feel your touch  
Don't say that to soothe my fear  
Show me something I can trust  
You stole my heart on the night we met  
But I'm not ready to follow it yet  
So whatever you do, don't say that  
Don't say, "We'll last forever"  
"We'll always be together"  
Just lay here silently next to me and don't say that  
Don't say that, no  
Don't say that --not now, not here  
I just want to feel your touch  
And don't say that to soothe our fear  
Show me something I can trust  
You stole my heart on the night we met  
And I'm not ready to follow it yet  
So whatever you do  
Your kisses are all of the proof I need, yeah  
So whatever you do, don't say that  
Don't say that, oh, don't say that  
Don't speak, don't talk  
Just hold me honey  
You don't have to use words  
Just hold me honey  
No need to speak  
No, no, no, no don't use words
