Where do you go when your conscience takes over  
Do you crawl to your corner and cry,  
Did you imagine, that no one would notice  
Just a secret to take when you die.  
  
All the world is watching you, every tongue is  
Screaming sinner.  
  
How are your dreams, do they claw at your sleep  
Making darkness a place you despise,  
Where is the god, that once was your strength  
Are you sure he was there from the start.  
  
All the world is watching you, nowhere you can hide,  
Every tongue is screaming sinner, only satan hears your cries.  
  
When you sin cardinal sin, you make your bed and on it you must lie,  
And your futures looking grim, but did you ever give a damn  
About the child, he's running wild,  
When you sin cardinal sin, don't you expect the world will treat you well,  
We say oh, go to hell.  
  
We point the finger, sin cardinal sin, laugh in your face, sin  
Cardinal sin,  
We point the finger, laugh in your face,  
Cos you're no better than the rest of the human race.  
  
Oh sin cardinal sin, oh sin cardinal sin.
