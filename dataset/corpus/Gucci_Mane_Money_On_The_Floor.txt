(Chorus)  
J's at my door, I got money on the floor (repeat 3x)  
I'm a million dollar nigga on the muthafuckin low  
I got money on the floor (repeat 8x)  
Future in the club, poppin bands on them hoes  
Go ahead Gucci Mane, toss some grands on the floor  
I'm gettin a table dance by a fine ass ho  
Got me coming back, now I'm trying to find this ho  
I got money on the table, choppa on the dresser  
Financially stable, very successful  
Money on the marble(floor)  
Redder than a cardinal  
Bluer Dodger  
Blacker than a ninja  
Itineraries, calenders, baby and agendas  
Boo I'll fuck ya, hit ya when I hit ya  
Text mess(age), fax, e-mail me send a picture  
Gucci Mane, fuck ya girl, go get the pistol  
Gucci Mane fucked the world, and its sister  
Main bitch left me, I didn't even miss her  
Fucked her best friend, she sucked then you kissed her  
Fucked her best friend she sucked me then you kissed her  
Money on the floor, there's more ??? to count  
Got a lot of crack heads trying to get in my house  
This ho say she hungry, put my dick in her mouth  
If she help me hit a lick, then I'm icing her out  
Down south, gold mouth, ya them birds fly south  
Made a half a million dollars in my trap house  
I'm a million dollar man, on the low worth cake  
Every girl I meet fuck on first date  
He on 26's, baby I'm on 8's  
Bart Simpson color diamonds with the red roller skates  
Brazilian, chameleon, reptilian (Air) forces  
????, so the rest of them Jordan's  
If bitches and money was my choices  
Then I choose money and move with bosses  
If bitches and money was my choices  
Then I choose money and move with bosses  
Mojo told me step my game up  
So if I throw up man, shrimp might come up  
Cameleon paint same color the vomit  
???? all in my stomach  
I'm on the look out for a big fine woman  
Who wanna suck dick and can keep me company  
I thug this, love this, never been love sick  
But been frost bit, back back young bitch  
Orange Catalina same color as a Sunkist  
Six 12's beat every time the fuckin drum kick  
Born on the track, so you know its gon go  
I got half a million dollars on this goddamn floor
