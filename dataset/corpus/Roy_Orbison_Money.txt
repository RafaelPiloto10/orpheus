They say the best things in life are free  
But you can give them to the birds and bees  
I need money, that's what I want  
That's what I want, yeah that's what I want  
  
Money don't get everything, it's true  
Though what it won't buy I can't use  
I need money, that's what I want  
That's what I want, that's what I want  
  
Your love gives me such a thrill  
But your lovin' don't pay my bills  
I need money, that's what I want  
That's what I want, yeah that's what I want  
  
Well gimme money, I want some money  
Whole lotta money, I want some money  
That's what I want, yeah that's what I want

Whole lotta money, that's what I want
