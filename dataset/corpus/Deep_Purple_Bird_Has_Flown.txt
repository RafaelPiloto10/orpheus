Oh the beggar on his cornerstone  
Catches pity in his wrinkled hand  
But the lover whose bird has flown  
Catches nothing only grains of sand  
  
All the children in the distant house  
They have feelings only children know  
But the lover whose bird has flown  
Catches nothing only flakes of snow  
  
The sensation is not new to you  
It's something we all have known  
You get it - it goes right through you  
Yes it's something we all have known  
  
And the bird it has flown  
To a place on it's own  
Somewhere all alone  
  
Now the hermit in his lonely cave  
Has himself to keep him company  
But the lover whose bird has flown  
He has heartaches same as you and me  
  
The sensation's not new to you  
It's something we all have known  
You get it - it goes right through you  
Yes it's something we all have known  
  
And the bird it has flown  
  
Now the hermit in his lonely cave  
Has himself to keep him company  
But the lover whose bird has flown  
He has heartaches same as you and me  
  
Oh it's started snowing
