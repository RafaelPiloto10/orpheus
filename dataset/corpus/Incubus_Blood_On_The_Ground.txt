I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground  
  
Hand over my heart I swear,  
I've tried everything I could within all my power  
2 weeks and 1 hour  
I slaved and now I've got nothing to show  
Oh if only you've grown taller than a brick wall  
From now on  
Gonna start holding my breath  
When you  
Come around and you flex that fake grin  
Cause something inside me has said more than twice  
That breathing this air  
Beats breathing you at all  
  
I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground  
  
Hand over my mouth  
I'm earning the right to my silence  
In quiet discerning between ego and timing  
Good judgment is once again proving to me  
That its still worth its weight in gold  
From now on I'm gonna be so much more weary  
When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil  
Seeing you is like pulling teeth  
And hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil  
  
I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground  
  
I'm fast to a better judgment  
By saying less today  
I will gain more, gain more  
No tears to you my, my fickle friend  
You you brought the art of silent war  
  
I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground
