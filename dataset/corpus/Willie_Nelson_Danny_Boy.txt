Oh Danny boy  
The pipes, the pipes are ca-alling  
From glen to glen  
And down the mountain side  
And the summer's gone  
All the leaves are dy-why-ying  
It's you, it's you  
Must go and I must bide  
  
But come ye ba-ack  
When summer's in the mea-eadow  
Or when the valley's hushed  
And white with snow  
I'll be here  
In sunshine or in sha-adows  
Oh Danny boy  
Oh Da-a-a-anny boy  
I love you so  
  
But come ye ba-ack  
When summer's in the mea-eadow  
Or when the winter's whi-ite  
And hushed with snow  
I'll be here  
In sunshine or in sha-adows  
Oh Danny boy  
Oh Da-anny boy  
I love you so...
