Tantras: the ritual seven notes of freedom to learn and to know the ritual of  
Life. life is a fight between sources of evil and pure love. alan and chris  
Present and relay the struggle out of which comes a positive source. nous  
Sommes do soleil. we are of the sun. we can see.  
  
Nous sommes do soleil we love when we play  
Nous sommes do soleil we love when we play  
  
Open doors we find our way  
We look we see we smile  
Surely daybreaks cross our path  
And stay maybe a while  
  
Let them run, let them chase  
Let them hide between  
Constant doors will open eyes  
As life seems like  
Life seems like a  
Fight, fight, fight  
  
Maybe I'll just sing awhile  
And then give you a call  
Maybe I'll just say hello  
And say maybe that's all  
  
Hurry home as love is true  
Will help us through the night  
Till we're coming home again  
Our life seems like  
Life seems like a  
Fight, fight, fight  
  
Catch as we look and use the passions that flow  
As we try to continue  
We receive all we venture to give  
  
Maybe we'll just stand awhile  
And surely we can call  
Dreams are said to blossom courage  
Constant to the soul  
  
Change we must as surely time does  
Changes call the course  
Held inside we enter daybreaks  
Asking for asking four  
The source  
The source  
The source  
Sent as we sing our music's total retain  
  
As we try and consider  
We receive all we venture to give  
All we sai is our  
Soul constant sight listener  
We won't tender our song clearer  
Till we sail  
Then I will be there  
And I will be there  
As clearer companions  
Shall call to be near you  
They move around tell me that  
Move around surely sing  
As they don't seem to matter at all  
At all at all  
  
Hold me my love, hold me today call me round  
Travel we say, wander we chchoose love tune  
Lay upon me, hold me around lasting hours  
We love when we play  
  
We hear a sound and alter our returning  
We drift the shadows and course our way on home  
Flying home  
Going home  
  
Look me my love sentences move dancing away  
We join we receive  
As our song memories long hope in a way  
Nous sommes do soleil  
Hold, me around, lsting ours  
We love when we play  
Nous sommes do soleil  
Nous sommes do soleil  
Nous sommes do soleil
