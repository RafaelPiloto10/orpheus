However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!)  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
Aiyyo  
What y'all thought I was too busy writin songs with Whitney Houston  
Cuz "My Love's Your Love" will be my slugs wit blood  
For any thug that wanna bang and play orangutang  
Find yourself in the river with the rest of them  
Wake up, wake up, I'm in a nightmare dream  
Where I found myself loadin magazines after magazines  
Ski mask on my face, gun on my waist  
Fine pens shakin in my hand as I write this next line  
You look strange, shootin victims at close range  
And saw his vein burst from his neck, as I snatched his chain  
Is this a Bible, I used to read the Gospel  
Until I got betrayed by one of my twelve disciples  
Which one, look through the crowd son  
You could spot the traitor wit a tatto on his arm  
The symbol is a microphone, an intellectual  
A wannabe Rakim, but too extraterrestrial  
I heard he's lethal and I'm too rusty to battle him  
Me being rusty is like Biggie not being "Born Again"  
It never happen, watch who you call fam  
On MTV, he painted himself as the tin man  
Predicted platinum, way before it happened  
So that's why when you ship gold, you only sold aluminum  
  
And now you wanna tell everybody I messed up your record?  
C'mon!  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!)  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
You a thug? You aint a murderer, just an undercover caligula  
Cuz when you saw the luger became silent like Caesar  
Enough of this rap stuff, Sedeck take his watch  
If I wasn't rappin, I'd take that stash in your left socks  
Don't make me raise my voice cuz I'm masterin a coo  
So, and besides when they find you you'll be bones  
Mom say watch my peers, hangin like chandeliers  
Orderin Don P, you couldn't pay for one beer  
Perpetratin, a fraud, oh god, you aint hard  
Take thirty of y'all to murder one kid on the boulevard  
You want Wyclef Jean, bring your same thug guys  
Here's my advice, leave the ring with your bride  
Cuz you aint comin back no more  
We gon send you to a vacation for two, with crabs on the seashore  
You freeze up, hold up I really thought you was psychotic  
Is that tears in your eyes? You cryin for your life  
Kid you tellin me what you did, you didn't wanna do  
Watch what you say on record cuz it might come true  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!)  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
I say "No Woman, No Cry" like I should own a piece of the estate  
But at the tribute they didn't invite me  
So I put in a call to Halis Alassi  
He said be easy, aint no need to bust a shot (BLOW! BLOW! BLOW! BLOW!)  
Like Supercat said, yo the ghetto's red hot  
Before bling, bling, bling it was BLING, BLING, BLING!
