Candy apple lips so red  
Lips that I've made mine  
One look at you and I knew  
Honey on the vine  
  
Sugar in my coffee cup  
Sweetness in my wine  
Can't compare with love you share  
Honey on the vine  
  
When you walk in my front door  
The lemon tree cries  
It can't compare with love you've got  
Sweet honey on the vine  
  
Take a walk down lovers lane  
Your hand holding mine  
I think I'll die, getting my  
Honey on the vine  
  
When you walk in my front door  
The lemon tree cries  
It can't compare with love you've got  
Sweet honey on the vine  
  
Take a walk down lovers lane  
Your hand holding mine  
I think I'll die, getting my  
Honey on the vine  
  
I think I'll die, getting my  
Honey on the vine  
Think I'll die, getting my  
Honey on the vine
