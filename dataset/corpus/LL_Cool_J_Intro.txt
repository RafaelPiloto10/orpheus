Hey yo this is the infinite, intelligent, extravagant and eloquent  
That shit y'all talking is irrelevant  
I put it down from the gutter to the tenement  
It's LL Cool J nigga, everything I do is excellent  
And I got to represent, Q-Boro, the thorough  
Ya know what I mean? We get down, we get down baby  
Check this shit out right here, uh  
  
E Pluribus Unum is the album I'ma drop  
It'll make you bitch niggas as hard as rocks  
Giving head to the glock, pretend it's hard cock  
Splashing niggas I came slow through the block  
I'm, the original, visual, individual  
Ten times platinum your career's looking critical  
Reach for this, mother fuck being a criminal  
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal  
You wanna freestyle fuck that  
I need at least seven figures to even touch that  
But since everybody was underestimatin' my format  
I dropped Ill Bomb and now niggas want more of that  
Ain't a rapper dead or alive fucking with me  
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me  
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads  
I can talk about movies, I can talk about awards  
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four  
And 2001'll be mine, by law  
Why name the Greatest Of All Times?  
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standing in line  
Loving the way I shine and my lyrics combine  
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find  
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits  
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch  
Back in the days it was the M fast stick  
But now the Bentley is all get more whores on the dick  
This ones for Clue and my Riker's Island niggas  
That remember when I came through  
The big O B C C H D M 2 C 74  
Little Nasi and the crew, y'all niggas come home  
  
Word up, the new album goin' be the shit baby  
Ain't no doubt about it, E Pluribus Unum  
Out of many one, The G.O.A.T., Greatest Of All Time
