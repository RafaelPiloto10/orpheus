Restless heart, restless mind,  
I'm tired of wasting,  
My precious time.  
  
There are times in my life,  
I don't know witch way to turn,  
When everything I touch  
I get my fingers burned  
Dreams to ashes, ashes to dust,  
When all that glitters  
Is dull with rust  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,  
I'm tired of wasting,  
My precious time  
  
I'm torn and tattered,  
Shattered and worn,  
I've had enough  
Trying to live my life  
In the eye of the storm  
Every heartache  
Leaves a scar on my face,  
Somebody reach out  
Or throw me a line,  
Get me out of this place  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,  
I'm tired of wasting, wasting,  
My precious time  
  
Oh, so tired.  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,  
I'm tired of wasting,  
My precious time  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,  
I'm tired of wasting, wasting,  
All of my precious time  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,  
So I'm tired of wasting, wasting,  
All of my precious time, time, time  
  
Restless heart
