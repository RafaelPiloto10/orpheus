(Spoken)  
You broke my heart cause I couldn't dance  
You didn't even want me around.  
But now I'm back (ooh my bloody finger)  
To let you know that I can really shake 'em down.  
  
One, two, one, two three  
  
Do you love me? (I can really move)  
Do you love me? I'm in the groove  
Do you love me? (do you really love me)  
Now that I can dance?  
  
Watch me now (push, push)  
Shake it up, shake it up (push push)  
Shake it shake it down now (push push)  
Just a little bit of soul now  
  
Like a mashed potato (mashed potato)  
I can do the twist (do the twist)  
Will you tell me baby  
Do you like it like this?  
  
Oh tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me.  
  
Do you love me?  
(Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya wanna dance?)  
Do you love me?  
(Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya wanna dance?)  
Do you love me?  
(Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya wanna dance?)  
  
Picked her up on a friday night  
Sha le la le la la le.  
I knew everything was gonna be all right  
Sha lee la lee la la lee.  
Sha lee la lee la la lee.  
  
Took her home and I asked her again if she was gonna be  
My baby  
She looked so good when she answered me  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.  
  
Sha le la le la le la la lee

Let me see you clap your hands  
Do you love me?  
Keep in time with the band  
Do you love me?  
I hope you're feeling fine  
Do you love me?  
Sing it one more time  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me now that I can dance?
