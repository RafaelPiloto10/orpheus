Ooh I need your love babe  
Guess you know it's true  
Hope you need my love babe  
Just like I need you  
Hold me love me  
Hold me love me  
I ain't got nothing but love babe  
Eight days a week  
  
Love you every day girl  
Always on my mind  
One thing I can say girl  
Love you all the time  
Hold me love me  
Hold me love me  
I ain't got nothing but love babe  
Eight days a week  
  
Eight days a week I love you  
Eight days a week is not enough to show I care
