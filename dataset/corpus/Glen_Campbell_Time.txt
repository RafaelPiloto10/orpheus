Some people run, some people crawl  
Some people don't even move at all  
Some roads lead forward, some roads lead back  
Some roads are bathed in light and some wrapped in black  
Some people never get and some never give  
Some people never die and some never live  
Some folks treat me mean, some treat me kind  
Most folks just go their way and don't pay me any mind  
Time, oh, good, good time  
Where did you go?  
Time, oh, good, good time  
Where did you go?  
Sometimes I'm satisfied, sometimes I'm not  
Sometimes my face is cold and sometimes it's hot  
At sunset I laugh, at sunrise I cry  
At midnight I'm between and I'm wondering why  
Time, oh, good, good time  
Where did you go?  
Time, oh, good, good time  
Where did you go
