Let me in your life  
Open up the door  
Let me in your heart  
Give me the key  
  
You're the only one  
I'll ever want  
  
Show me the way  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
  
I won't let you down  
I'll never let you go  
I'll love you forever  
Give me the key  
  
You're the only one  
That knows what I need  
Take me in your arms  
  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
I don't want to wait  
  
Another second more  
I'm down on my knees  
Give me the key  
I'm over my head  
  
Too far gone  
You know how I feel  
  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
Give me the key  
Give me the key
