Glamourous stars darken the day  
The shadows of night lighten their way  
The wisdom of fools is ot easy to learn  
So go one step ahead and two in return  
I am the sense in all of your tears  
I am the reason of all your fears  
I am praised for my sadness  
I am praised for my faults  
I am praised for my madness  
Cause some like it hot  
And some like it cold  
Evening calls the sunset to rise  
I am a liar so take care of my advice  
The wheel of fortune always goes round  
Whatever goes up must always come down
