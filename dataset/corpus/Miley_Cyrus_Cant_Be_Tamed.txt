Like a Mafia  
For those who don't know me  
I can get a bit crazy  
Have to get my way yep  
Twenty four hours a day  
'Cause I'm hot like that  
  
Every guy, everywhere  
Just gives me mad attention  
Like I'm under inspection  
I always get a ten  
'Cause I'm built like that  
  
I go through guys like  
Money flying out the hands  
They try to change me  
But they realize they can't  
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan  
If you're gonna be my man understand  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't be tamed  
I can't be tamed  
I can't be blamed  
I can't can't  
I can't be tamed  
I can't be changed  
I can't be tamed  
I can't be, can't be tamed  
  
If there is a question about my intentions  
I'll tell ya  
I'm not here to sell ya  
Or tell you to go to hell  
I'm not a brat like that  
I'm like a puzzle  
But all of my pieces are jagged  
If you can understand this  
We can make some magic  
I'm wrong like that  
  
I wanna fly  
I wanna drive  
I wanna go  
I wanna be a part of something I don't know  
And if you try to hold me back I might explode  
Baby, by now you should know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I'm not a trick you play  
I'm wired a different way  
I'm not a mistake  
I'm not a fake  
It's set in my DNA  
Don't change me  
Don't change me  
Don't change me  
Don't change me  
(I can't be tamed)  
  
I wanna fly  
I wanna drive  
I wanna go  
I wanna be a part of something I don't know  
And if you try to hold me back I might explode  
Baby, by now you should know  
  
[Chorus]
