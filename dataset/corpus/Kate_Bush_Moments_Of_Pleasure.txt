Some moments that I've had  
Some moments of pleasure  
  
I think about us lying  
Lying on a beach somewhere  
I think about us diving  
Diving off a rock, into another moment  
  
The case of George the Wipe  
Oh God I can't stop laughing  
This sense of humor of mine  
It isn't funny at all  
Oh but we sit up all night  
Talking about it  
  
Just being alive  
It can really hurt  
And these moments given  
Are a gift from time  
  
On a balcony in New York  
It's just started to snow  
He meets us at the lift  
Like Douglas Fairbanks  
Waving his walking stick  
But he isn't well at all  
The buildings of New York  
Look just like mountains through the snow  
  
Just being alive  
It can really hurt  
And these moments given  
Are a gift from time  
Just let us try  
To give these moments back  
To those we love  
To those who will survive  
  
And I can hear my mother saying  
"Every old sock meets an old shoe"  
Isn't that a great saying?  
"Every old sock meets an old shoe"  
Here come the Hills of Time  
  
Hey there Maureen,  
  
Hey there Bubba,  
Dancing down the aisle of a plane,  
  
'S Murph, playing his guitar refrain,  
  
Hey there Teddy,  
Spinning in the chair at Abbey Road,  
  
Hey there Michael,  
Do you really love me?  
  
Hey there Bill,  
Could you turn the lights up?
