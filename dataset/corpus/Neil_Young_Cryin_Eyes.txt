Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?  
Who's gonna wake you up  
To that big surprise?  
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?  
  
You say that all your life  
You've been a free bird  
There's been nobody over you  
And you always have to  
Have the last word  
Because one feels better than two.  
  
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?  
Who's gonna wake you up  
To that big surprise?  
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?  
  
You say your life's  
Like riding on a fast train  
It's easy to see far away  
But right up close  
It's just a blurry haze  
Flyin' by from day to day.  
  
Who's gonna dry your cryin' eyes?
