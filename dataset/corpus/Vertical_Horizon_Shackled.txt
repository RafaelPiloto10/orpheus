For so long my life's been sewn up tight inside your hold  
And it leaves me there without a place to call my own  
  
I know now what shadows can see  
There's no point in running 'less you run with me  
It's half the distance through the open door  
Before you cut me down  
Again  
Let me introduce you to the end  
  
And I feel the cold wind blowing beneath my wings  
It always leads me back to suffering  
But I will soar until the wind whips me down  
Leaves me beaten on unholy ground again  
  
So tired now of paying my dues  
I start out strong but then I always lose  
It's half the distance before you leave me behind  
It's such a waste of time  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause my shackles  
You won't be  
And my rapture  
You won't believe  
And deep inside you will bleed for me  
  
So here I slave inside of a broken dream  
Forever holding on to splitting seams  
So take your piece and leave me alone to die  
I don't need you to keep my faith alive  
  
I know now what trouble can be  
And why it follows me so easily  
It's half the distance through the open door  
Before you shut me down  
Again  
Let me introduce you to the end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though you know you care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And my laughter  
You won't hear  
The faster  
I disappear  
And time will burn your eyes to tears
