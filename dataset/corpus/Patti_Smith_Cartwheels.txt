Come my one, look at the world Bird beast butterfly  
Girls sing notes of heaven Birds lift them up to the sky  
  
Spring is departing Spring is departing  
  
Her thoughts are darting like a rabbit Like a rabbit 'cross the moon  
Shines of light over your hair As boys croon  
  
Pretty in pink It makes me wonder  
What could ever bring you down I see tears falling  
From those eyes of brown  
  
Hearing a voice, you turn your head You vanish into the mist  
Of your thoughts And I  
Want to grasp What brings you down  
Open up those eyes of brown  
  
The world is changing Your heart is growing  
  
Hearing a voice you turn your head Girls turn by ones, by twos  
Notes pour bad and tender Eradicate your blues  
  
The good world The good world  
Come my one, look around you Bird, beast, butterfly  
Girls sing notes from heaven Birds lift them up to the sky  
  
I see brown eyes That see girls turning  
Girls turning Cartwheels  
  
The good world The good whirl  
The good world The good whirl  
  
Come my one, look at your world Don't let it bring you down  
Come on open for me Those eyes of brown  
  
I see girls turning Cartwheels  
Cartwheels Cartwheels...
