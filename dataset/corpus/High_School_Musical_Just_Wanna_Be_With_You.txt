[Hook] Mmm, mmm, yeah  
  
I got a lot of things I have to do  
All these distractions, our future's coming soon  
We're being pulled in a hundred different directions  
But whatever happens I know I've got you  
  
You're on my mind, you're in my heart  
It doesn't matter where we are  
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart  
  
All I wanna do is be with you, be with you  
There's nothing we can do  
I just wanna be with you, only you  
  
No matter where life takes us  
Nothing can break us apart  
You know it's true  
I just wanna be with you  
  
Yeah yeah  
Just be with you  
Ooh yeah yeah  
  
You know how life can be, it changes over night  
It's sunny then raining, but it's alright  
A friend like you always makes it easy  
I know that you get me every time  
  
Through every up, through every down  
You know I'll always be around  
Through anything, you can count on me!  
  
All I wanna do is be with you, be with you  
There's nothing we can do  
I just wanna be with you, only you  
  
No matter where life takes us  
Nothing can break us apart  
You know it's true  
I just wanna be with you  
I just wanna be with you
