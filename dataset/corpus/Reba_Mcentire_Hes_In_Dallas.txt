He said I'll make your dreams come true in Texas  
And he captured my Appalachian heart  
I was so naive that I believed him  
When he promised we'd never be apart  
  
So we packed and pulled a you-Haul down to Dallas  
A year went by and the baby came along  
Then his old friends and the night life came between us  
Dreams turned into sleepless nights waiting all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm staring out the window through these teardrops  
Holding on to the only dream that turned out right  
We're on a Greyhound bus bound for West Virginia  
He's in Dallas without us tonight  
  
Oh, Lord I hate to break the news to mama  
She's gettin' on in years and worries so  
Maybe I should have stayed in Dallas  
And gave him another chance right now I just don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He said I'll make your dreams come true in Texas  
He's in Dallas without us tonight
