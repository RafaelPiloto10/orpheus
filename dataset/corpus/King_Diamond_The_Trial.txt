La reymie:  
"jeanne dibasson, you stand accused before the burning court  
For practising witchcraft. Do you confess? We have ways  
To make you talk. How do you plead? "  
  
Jeanne:  
"i never did any harm to anyone. I don't believe this."  
  
La reymie:  
"lead the witch to the dungeon for the test...  
Bring out the glowing pins. Do it now! "  
  
This is rotten to the core  
Jeanne is naked on the floor  
In the dungeon they want more  
  
La reymie:  
"oh jeanne, you feel so good"  
  
La reymie is touching her body  
Wringled fingers all over her  
  
La reymie:  
"so this is how you make with the devil  
We're gonna get you, witchy woman  
We will never believe in you  
So you better repent your sins now"  
  
Sticking needles into her skin yeah  
In the dungeon blood is everywhere  
Glowing needles, needles and pins yeah  
She's getting weaker, no more pain to feel  
  
La reymie:  
"we will never believe in you  
So you better repent your sins now"  
  
"we are the servants of god, we believe in the devil  
And we've found his mark on you, confess witch"  
  
"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live  
Who soever lieth with a beast shall surely be put the death"  
  
Jeanne:  
"never did I lie with any beast of thine  
Dogs, or cats or goats, now leave my soul alone"  
  
La reymie:  
"he that sacrificeth unto any God save the lord only  
He shall be utterly destroyed"  
  
Jeanne:  
"now I hear, deceiving, lying tongues  
Never have I done no harm to anyone"  
  
But they did not turn her loose  
Horns and tails and cloven hoof  
Can you tell me where's the proof
