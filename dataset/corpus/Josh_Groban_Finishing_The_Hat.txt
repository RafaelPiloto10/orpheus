Yes, she looks for me...good  
Let her look for me  
To tell me why she left me  
As I always knew she would  
  
I had thought she understood  
They have never understood  
And no reason that they should  
  
But if anybody could, finishing the hat  
How you have to finish the hat  
How you watch the rest of the world  
From a window while you finish the hat  
  
Mapping out the sky  
What you feel like, planning the sky  
What you feel when voices that come  
Through the window go  
  
Until they distance and die  
Until there's nothing but sky  
And how you're always turning back too late  
From the grass or the stick  
Or the dog or the light  
  
How the kind of woman willing to wait  
Not the kind that you want to find waiting  
To return you to the night  
Dizzy from the height  
  
Coming from the hat, studying the hat  
Entering the world of the hat  
Reaching through the world of the hat  
Like a window  
Back to this one from that  
  
Studying a face  
Stepping back to look at a face  
Leaves a little space in the way like a window  
But to see it's the only way to see  
  
And when the woman that you wanted goes  
You can say to yourself, "Well, I give what I give"  
But the women who won't wait for you knows  
That however you live  
  
There's a part of you always standing by  
Mapping out the sky, finishing a hat  
Starting on a hat, finishing a hat  
Look I made a hat  
  
Where there never was a hat
