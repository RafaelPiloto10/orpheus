I am not passers by, I am not a white lie  
I am not left to die, I am love, I am love  
I am not feeling sad, I am not a few fad  
I am not quickly mad, I am love, I am love  
  
You can try to hide, you can try to run  
But you'll never run far enough  
This is my flesh, this is my blood  
And I am love  
You can fly up high, You can dig down deep  
You can flee to the west  
You can flee to the east  
But you can't escape what I've done  
I am love  
  
I am not standing by, i am not letting go  
I am not leaving you, i am love, i am love  
My blood feel like the rain  
I did not bleed in vain  
But from my veins  
I am love
