I could dance nightly  
Just holding you tightly  
My sweet  
I could keep right on  
Because you're so light on  
Your feet  
You're easy to dance with  
  
There is no doubt in  
The way we stand out in  
The crowd  
Though it's called dancing  
To me it's romancing  
Out loud  
You're easy to dance with  
  
Loving you  
The way I do  
Makes you easy to dance with  
That is why I'm always right on the beat  
All those charms  
In one man's arms  
Makes you easy to dance with  
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet  
  
Let's dance forever  
Come on, say we'll never  
Be through  
It's so easy to dance with you
