The disciples were assembled  
In the upper room,  
They didn't know that Jesus  
Would be leaving very soon,  
They talked about His kingdom  
As they readied for the feast,  
Who would be the greatest,  
And who would be the least.  
One said if there's a greatest,  
I hope I'm the one,  
Others talked of miracles  
They had seen and done,  
No one noticed Jesus  
As He rose up from His seat,  
Till knelt before them  
And began to wash there feet.  
Chorus  
I've come to serve you,  
I've come to serve you,  
And if you know my Father's love  
The way you say you do,  
Then you will serve each other too.  
I wish I could have been there  
To see the look each man's face,  
A single act of service  
Puts us all back in our place,  
But though we're called to minister,  
And do miracles in His name,  
Remember when you're sent by Him  
The reason that He came.  
Chorus  
Chorus  
Yes you should serve each other too
