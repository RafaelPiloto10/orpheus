by Bob Dylan and George Harrison  
  
Let me in here, I know I've been here,  
Let me into your heart.  
Let me know you, let me show you,  
Let me roll it to you.  
All I have is yours,  
All you see is mine  
And I'm glad to have you in my arms,  
I'd have you any time.  
  
Let me say it, let me play it,  
Let me lay it on you.  
Let me know you, let me show you,  
Let me grow it on you.  
All I have is yours,  
All you see is mine  
And I'm glad to have you in my arms,  
I'd have you any time.  
  
Let me in here, I know I've been here,  
Let me into your heart.  
Let me know you, let me show you,  
Let me roll it to you.  
All I have is yours,  
All you see is mine  
And I'm glad to have you in my arms,  
I'd have you any time.
