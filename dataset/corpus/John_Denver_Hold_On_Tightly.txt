Lost in a boat on the ocean  
Lost in a ship out at sea  
Lost in the dark of misfortune  
Where is a light I can see  
Where is a light I can see  
Where is the highway to heaven  
Where is the love we all need  
Where is the peace that we long for  
Where is the man who is free  
  
Here in the heart there is freedom  
Here in the heart there is peace  
Here in the heart is the answer  
To questions much deeper than these  
  
You've got to hold on tightly  
Let go lightly  
It's only surrender, it's all in the game  
If you just hold on tightly  
Let go lightly  
There's always forgiveness and no one to blame  
  
Some will take fame over fortune  
Some will take love over gold  
Some will pray only for power  
Some never want to grow old  
Some see the day that is coming  
Some only see what has passed  
Someone will always be first in line  
Someone will always be last  
  
Here in the heart there is freedom  
Here in the heart there is peace  
Here in the heart is the answer  
To questions much deeper than these  
  
You've got to hold on tightly  
Let go lightly  
It's only surrender, it's all in the game  
If you just hold on tightly  
Let go lightly  
There's always forgiveness and no one to blame
