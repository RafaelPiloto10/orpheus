Wishful crystal  
Water covers everything in blue  
Coolin' water  
Wishful sinful  
Our love is beautiful to see  
I know where I would like to be  
Right back where I came  
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue  
Water covers you  
Wishful, sinful, wicked you  
Can't escape the blue  
Magic risin'  
Sun is shinin' deep beneath the sea  
But not enough for you and me and sunshine  
Love to hear the wind cry  
Wishful sinful  
Our love is beautiful to see  
I know where I would like to be  
Right back where I came  
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue  
Water covers you  
Wishful, sinful, wicked you  
Can't escape the blue  
Love to hear the wind cry  
Love to hear you cry, yeah, yeah
