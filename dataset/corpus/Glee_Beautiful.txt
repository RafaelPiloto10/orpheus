Every day is so wonderful  
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe  
Now and then, I get insecure  
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed  
  
I am beautiful no matter what they say  
Words can't bring me down  
I am beautiful in every single way  
Yes, words can't bring me down  
Oh, no  
So don't you bring me down today  
  
No no no no  
To all your friends, you're delirious  
So consumed in all your doom  
Trying hard to fill the emptiness  
The piece is gone left the puzzle undone  
That's the way it is  
  
You are beautiful no matter what they say  
Words can't bring you down  
You are beautiful in every single way  
Yes, words can't bring you down  
Don't you bring me down today  
  
No matter what we do  
(No matter what we do)  
No matter what they say  
(No matter what they say)  
When the sun is shining through  
Then the clouds won't stay  
  
And everywhere we go  
(Everywhere we go)  
The sun won't always shine  
(Sun won't always shine)  
But tomorrow will find a way  
All the other times  
  
'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say  
Yes, words won't bring us down, oh no  
We are beautiful in every single way  
Yes, words can't bring us down  
Don't you bring me down today  
Oh oh ohhh oh  
Don't you bring me down today  
Hey, yeah, oh,  
Don't you bring me down today
