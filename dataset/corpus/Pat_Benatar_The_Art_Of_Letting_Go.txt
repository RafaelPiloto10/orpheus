Here we go again  
'Round and 'round again  
Gettin' nowhere fast  
It's the same old thing  
  
One more final scene  
Never meant to last  
Who'll be the first one who's leaving  
Who'll be the last one to cry  
  
Something just keeps me believing  
In our love tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't seem to say goodbye  
Though I've tried a million times  
The more I learn, the less I know  
About the art of letting go  
  
So we take our time  
And we make our moves  
Oh, so carefully  
Old ways seem so safe  
Habits hard to break  
When you're here with me  
  
I don't know how hard to hold you  
No easy way to be free  
Something just keeps me believing  
That we're meant to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For we all feel  
And we all know  
It's not easy  
Letting go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We got beyond letting go  
(We got beyond letting go)  
You gotta let go  
You gotta let go  
Yeah, yeah
