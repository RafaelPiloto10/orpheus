She says you're a masochist for falling for me,  
So roll up your sleeves.  
And I think that I like her, 'cause she tells me things I don't want to hear,  
Medicinal tongue in my ear.  
  
When will it stop? When will it stop?  
  
When will I feel all soft on the inside?  
When will I feel all soft on the inside?  
When will I feel soft, soft?  
  
You say that my skin feels like no one else's,  
That it's different somehow.  
But I don't understand, isn't a hand just a hand?  
No you don't understand.  
  
When will it start? My broken part?  
  
When will I feel all soft on the inside?  
When will I feel all soft on the inside?  
When will I feel soft, soft?  
  
Oooo  
  
When will I feel all soft on the inside?  
When will I feel all soft on the inside?  
When will I feel soft, soft?  
  
She says you're a masochist for falling for me.
