La la, la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la, la la la.  
  
Stand and fight we do consider  
Reminded of an inner pact between us  
That's seen as we go  
And ride there  
In motion  
To fields in debts of honor defending  
  
Stand the marchers soaring talons  
Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom  
Fighting we know,  
Destroy oppression  
The point to reaction  
As leaders look to you attacking  
  
Choose and renounce throwing chains to the floor  
Kill or be killing faster sins correct the flow  
Casting giant shadows off vast  
Penetrating force  
To alter via the war that seen  
As frictions spans the spirits' wrath ascending to redeem  
  
Wars that shout in screams of anguish  
Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver  
Surely we know.  
In glory we rise to offer,  
Create our freedom, a word, we utter a word.  
  
Words cause our banner, victorious our day  
Will silence be promised as violence display  
The curse increased we fight the pow'are and live by it by day  
Our Gods awake in thunderous roars and guide  
The leader's hands in paths of glory to the cause  
  
Listen should we fight forever  
Knowing as we do know  
Fear destroys?  
Listen should we leave our children?  
Listen our lives stare in silence  
Help us now  
  
Listen your friends have been broken  
They tell us of your poison  
Now we know  
Kill them give them as they give us  
Slay them burn their children's laughter  
On to Hell  
  
The fist will run  
Grasp metal to gun  
The spirit sings in crashing tones we gain the battle drum  
Our cries will shrill the air will moan and crash into the dawn  
The pen won't stay the demon's wings, the hour approaches  
Pounding out the Devil's sermon  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Pass within and soothe this endless night  
And wait here for you  
Our reason to be here  
  
Soon oh soon the time  
All we move to gain will reach and calm  
Our heart is open  
Our reason to be here  
  
Long ago, set into rhyme  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right  
The sun will lead us  
Our reason to be here  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right  
The sun will lead us  
Our reason to be here
