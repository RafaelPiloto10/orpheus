Be careful How you walk  
These days are evil Look how you talk  
I hear there are people that are listening  
This mystery Is up to you  
So you be careful What you do  
I know There are people who are wondering  
  
These are the days of farewell  
Halfway undecided That's our peace That's our peace  
  
Be careful The friends you keep  
He might not really Be your friend  
He belongs To the wishing and the wandering  
Be careful Too much at stake  
You don't want ever To be wronged  
Don't you ever Let the dirty business make you clean  
  
These are the days of farewell  
Halfway undecided That's our peace Amen Amen  
  
Glory be to God I will bless the Lord at all times  
His words shall continually be in my mouth with praise  
For I am here today 'cause He said that I would live  
There's no reason why hiv shouldn't have missed my daughter and my life  
But it did Through the eyes of God, he saw fit for me to be here  
I will praise the Lord at all times  
As we live in the last days the Devil will always be up under my feet  
And I will praise his name  
Hallelujah  
  
Don't you pretend To be something  
That you are not Hear me my friend  
I'll tell you what I know It will only sicken you  
Let us be grateful For what you've got  
Help me to know What I am not  
Of my friend There are people who are wondering  
  
These are the days of farewell  
It's undecided It's undecided  
Oh my friend Oh my friend Oh my friend  
My friend My friend My friend  
It's undecided  
Too much Too much Too Much  
Too much at stake for you and me
