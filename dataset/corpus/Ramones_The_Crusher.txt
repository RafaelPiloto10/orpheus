Now I want to wrestle in the garden  
I'm on my way to stardom  
I know I'm ready, I know I'm great  
But first I've got to get in shape!  
  
Cause I got my eye on the Russian Bear  
Gonna tear him up, I swear  
This guy, thinks he's the champion  
Gonna take his belt, gonna beat him!  
  
I'm the Crusher, king of the ring (4x)  
I'm ready for a match with the Russian Bear  
Gonna pile drive him, pull his hair  
I might have a foreign object in my trunks  
I might have to use, on that punk!  
  
Got the hardest hold you can put on anyone  
If you're my victim you're beaten  
I'm a lean, mean, fighting machine  
Powerful and strong, like King Kong!  
  
I'm the Crusher, king of the ring (4x)  
Started having second thoughts I was scared as hell  
The last thing I wanted was me hearing the bell  
I mean the Russian Bear, could probably tear  
Me limb from limb  
He'd probably grin be real happy with himself  
This is not, good for my health  
I'm not comin' outta this dressing room  
And get beaten up, by that goon!  
  
Go back to Russia  
Go back home  
Don't want to get a broken bone  
Or a lump on my head  
I ain't gonna hide under the bed!  
  
I'm the Crusher, king of the ring [Repeat x4]  
I'm the Crusher (Crusher!) [Repeat x2]
