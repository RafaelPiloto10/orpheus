Oh, love is like a flame, now  
Upon a candle  
Get it burnin' brightly  
And it's a-too hot to handle  
Oh, baby  
(I want your love tonight)  
Come on and satisfy me  
Baby, don't deny me  
(I want your love tonight)  
Excuses, boy don't hand me  
Just love and understand me  
  
Oh, patiently I've waited  
For your sweet kissin'  
Though we steady-dated  
You know, somethin's been a-missin', oh, oh  
(I want your love tonight)  
I don't want to sit here and talk  
(I want your love tonight)  
I don't want to go for a walk  
(I want your love tonight)  
Oh, take me up to heaven  
All the way to cloud eleven  
  
I want a-your love tonight  
Oh, yeah I do  
Come on and love me, baby  
Oh, come on and satisfy me  
Baby, don't deny me, yeah  
(I want your love tonight)  
Love me, love me, baby  
(I want your love)
