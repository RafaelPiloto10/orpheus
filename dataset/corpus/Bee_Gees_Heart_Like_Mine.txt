Night grows cold.  
I've been lonely so much  
Out of reach.  
Save it only for me.  
  
Nothing in life is the same.  
And the sooner we stop to start.  
  
And there's a heart like mine  
Somewhere in this world.  
There's a heart like mine,  
Beating but left to burn.  
  
Maybe you can hide your face forever.  
And God knows it's true  
That when you search for someone  
  
There's a heart like mine,  
There's a heart like mine  
To be heard (to be heard).  
  
Souls on fire.  
Feel her voice in your ear.  
She goes on,  
Living only for me.  
  
Nothing you say could be wrong.  
'Cause you give me the lovers sign.  
  
And there's a heart like mine  
Somewhere in this world.  
There's a heart like mine,  
Beating but left to burn.  
  
Maybe we can share it all forever,  
But not 'til we do.  
I'm gonna search for someone.  
  
There's a heart like mine.  
There's a heart like mine  
To be heard (to be heard).  
  
And baby are we waking up together.  
'Cause God knows it's you.  
If there is love for someone.  
  
And there's a heart like mine,  
Somewhere in this world  
There's a heart like mine,  
Beating but left to burn.  
  
Maybe we can share it all forever,  
But not 'til we do.  
I'm gonna search for someone.  
  
There's a heart like mine.  
There's a heart like mine  
To be heard (to be heard).  
  
There's a heart like mine.  
There's a heart like mine
