Why are my eyes always full of this vision of you  
Why do I dream silly dreams that I fear won't come true  
I long to show you the stars  
Caught in the dark of the sea  
I long to speak of my love but you don't come to me  
So I go on asking if maybe one day you'll care  
I tell my sad little dreams to the soft evening air  
I am quite hopeless it seems, two things I know how to do  
One is to dream  
Two is loving you
