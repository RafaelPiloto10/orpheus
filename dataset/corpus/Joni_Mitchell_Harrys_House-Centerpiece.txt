Heatwaves on the runway  
As the wheels set down  
He takes his baggage off the carousel  
He takes a taxi into town  
Yellow schools of taxi fishes  
Jonah in a ticking whale  
Caught up at the light in the fishnet windows  
Of Bloomingdale's  
Watching those high fashion girls  
Skinny black models with Raven curls  
Beauty parlor blonds with credit card eyes  
Looking for the chic and the fancy  
To buy  
  
He opens up his suitcase  
In the continental suite  
And people thirty stories down  
Colored currents in the street  
A helicopter lands on the Pan Am roof  
Like a dragonfly on a tomb  
And business men in button downs  
Press into conference rooms  
Battalions of paper-minded males  
Talking commodities and sales  
While at home their paper wives  
And paper kids  
Paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid  
  
Yellow checkers for the kitchen  
Climbing ivy for the bath  
She is lost in House and Gardens  
He's caught up in Chief of Staff  
He drifts off into the memory  
Of the way she looked in school  
With her body oiled and shining  
At the public swimming pool  
  
The more I'm with you, pretty baby  
The more I feel my love increase  
I'm building all my dreams around you  
Our happiness will never cease  
Cause nothing's any good without you  
Baby you're my centerpiece  
  
We'll find a house and garden somewhere  
Along a country road a piece  
A little cottage on the outskirts  
Where we can really find release  
Cause nothing's any good without you  
Baby you're my centerpiece  
  
Shining hair and shining skin  
Shining as she reeled him in  
To tell him like she did today  
Just what he could do with Harry's House  
And Harry's take home pay
