Words and Music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe  
  
From the Broadway musical "My Fair Lady"  
  
  
I'm gettin' married in the morning  
Ding dong the bells are gonna chime  
Pull out the stopper, let's have a whopper  
But get me to the church on time  
  
I gotta be there in the morning  
Spruced up and looking in my prime  
Girls, come and kiss me, show how you'll miss me  
But get me to the church on time  
  
If I am dancing, roll up the floor  
If I am whistling, whisk me out the door, for  
  
I'm gettin' married in the morning  
Ding dong the bells are gonna chime  
Kick up a rumpus but don't lose your compass  
And get me to the church, get me to the church  
For Pete's sake, get me to the church on time
