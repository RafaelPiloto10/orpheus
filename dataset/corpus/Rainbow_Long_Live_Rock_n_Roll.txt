At the end of a dream  
If you know where I mean  
When the mist just starts to clear  
  
In a similar way  
At the end of today  
I could feel the sound of writing on the wall  
It cries for you  
It's the least that you can do  
  
Like a spiral on the wind  
I can hear it screamin' in my mind  
  
Long live Rock and Roll  
Long live Rock 'n' Roll  
Long live Rock and Roll  
  
In a different time  
When the words didn't rhyme  
You could never quite be sure  
Then on with the change  
  
It was simple but strange  
And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all  
It cries for you  
It's the least that you can do  
  
Like a spiral on the wind  
I can hear it screamin' in my mind  
  
Long live Rock and Roll  
Long live Rock 'n' Roll  
Long live Rock and Roll  
  
If you suddenly see  
What has happened to me  
You should spread the word around  
  
And tell everyone here  
That it's perfectly clear  
They can sail above it all on what they've found  
It cries for you  
  
It's the best that you can do  
Like a sound that's everywhere  
I can hear it screaming through the air  
  
Long live Rock and Roll  
Long live Rock 'n' Roll  
Long live Rock and Roll
