No I'm no angel  
No I'm no stranger to the street  
I've got my label  
So I won't crumble at your feet  
  
And I know baby  
So I've got scars upon my cheek  
And I'm half crazy  
Come on and love me baby  
  
So you find me hard to handle  
Well I'm easier to hold  
So you like my spurs that jingle  
And I never leave you cold  
So I might steal your diamonds  
I'll bring you back some gold  
  
I'm no angel, no I'm no angel  
No I'm no stranger to the dark  
Let me rock your cradle  
Let me start a fire with your spark  
  
Oh come on baby  
Come and let me show you my tattoo  
Let me drive you crazy  
Come on and love me, baby  
  
So you don't give a darn about me  
I never treat you bad  
I won't ever lift a hand to hurt you  
And I'll always leave you glad  
So I might steal your diamonds  
I'll bring you back some gold  
I'm no angel  
  
No I'm no angel  
No I'm no stranger to the dark  
Let me rock your cradle  
Let me start a fire in your heart  
  
Oh come on, baby  
Come and let me show you my tattoo  
Let me drive you crazy  
Come on and love me baby  
  
Oh come on, baby  
Drive me crazy  
Drive me crazy  
Oh come on, baby  
Oh come on, baby  
Oh come on, baby
