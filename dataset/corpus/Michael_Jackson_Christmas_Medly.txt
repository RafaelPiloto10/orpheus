Santa claus is coming to town (2x)  
You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa claus is coming to town (3x)  
He's making a list  
And checkin' it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa claus is coming to town (3x)  
  
People making list  
Buying special gifts,  
Taking time to be kind to one and all  
It's the time of year  
When good friends are dear  
And you wish you could give more than just presents from the store  
Why don't you give love on christmas day (on christmas day)  
Oh, even the man who has everything  
Would be so happy if you would bring  
Give love on christmas day (on christmas day)  
No greater gift is there than love  
  
Someday at x'mas  
Men won't boys playin with bombs like kids play with toys  
One warm december our heart will see  
A world where men are free  
Someday at x'mas  
There'll be no wars when we have what x'mas is for  
When we have found what life's really worth  
There'll be peace on earth  
Someday at x'mas  
We'll see a land  
No hungry children no empty hand  
One happy morning People will share  
A world where people care  
  
I saw mommy kissing santa claus  
Underneath a mistle toe last night  
She didn't see me creep down the stairs to have a peep  
She tought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
Then I saw mommy tickle santa claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
Oh what a laugh it would have been if daddy had only seen  
Mommy kissing santa claus last night  
  
Come they told me parapapampam (rapapampam)  
A new born king to see parapapampam (rapapampam)  
Our finest gifts to bring parapapampam (rapapampam)  
To lay before the king parapapampam rapapampam rapapampam  
Soul to honor him parapapampam (rapapampam)  
When we come (when we come)
