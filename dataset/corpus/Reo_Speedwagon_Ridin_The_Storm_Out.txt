Ridin' the storm out, waitin' for the thaw out  
On a full moon night in the Rocky Mountain winter.  
My wine bottle's low, watching for the snow  
Thinkin' about what I've been missin' in the city.  
  
And I'm not missin' a thing  
Watchin' the full moon crossing the range  
Ridin' the storm out  
Ridin' the storm out.  
  
My lady's beside me, she's there to guide me.  
She says that alone we've finally found home.  
The wind outside is frightening,  
but it's kinder than the lightning life in the city.  
It's a hard life to live but it gives back what you give.
