Yeah! Ghetto to ghetto (uh)  
As we bring the drama live (y'knahmean?)  
We bout to set it! (uh) Word life son!  
Yeah! Mad flavors (yea) butters  
Ghetto to ghetto, yeah!  
  
Keep your chickenhead, I'm lookin for a dime (word up)  
Get my swerve on, make it hot, word bond  
I'm lickin on your ankle bracelet  
We'll be sippin Moet with strawberries to chase it  
I'm nasty, ask me, why I lick my lips  
so in the darkness, I can run my tongue over your tits  
It's all good sugary, you ain't leavin  
Sit up on my face and help my stash grow even  
Whipped cream taste mean from the back  
She bounce with LL now shorty's on the map  
I put away the gat, took off the hat  
Throw ya Mo's in the air if you like it like that  
No doubt boo, I keep it real girl  
Mad pleasure, blowin up your whole world  
Whatever's clever I got endless cash  
Trees from Hawaii, two pulls and pass

I'll be loungin with LL, heyyy heyyy  
I'll be loungin with LL, Cooool J

Uhh, my scenario is grand (word up!)  
A dime peice, Henessey up in my hand  
I "Turn Out the Lights" like Teddy (click!)  
I'm fiendin, starin in the darkness, now I'm ready  
Uhh, ooh yeah up in ya!  
Let it flow while I pump slow  
Then I speed it up, heat it up  
Make it mo' tasty, so you can swing low and lace me  
Use your imagination  
You do me, I'll do you, sex education  
It's all good, it's cranberry Absolut and peach scnapps  
Feelin tipsy, loungin on the rooftops  
I'm bout to spank you on that ass (oooh)  
I know you love it when it lasts (truuue)  
When you need it who you ask? (You!)

C'mon, you got to bounce with me sugar (you got to bounce) word up  
You got to bounce with me sugar (word-a-word-a-word up) word up  
You got to bounce with me sugar (you got to bounce with me sugar)  
Word up, you got to bounce with me sugar (a-word-a-word-a-word up)  
  
Warm it up sugar, make it hot  
Shorties'll swarm, make me wanna bust shots (BO!)  
We speak, daily on the regular  
Run your jibs all day chip in my cellular  
Shoot down to Jamaica, pretty white sand  
Suntan oil, pina colada in you hand  
Layin up at night, peepin out stars  
Remember - when we was at the club at the bar?  
I told ya, my status, was that of a don  
You thought I was a dog and you ain't wanna get it on  
But my mind has attractin qualities  
on the emotions of a young lady (word up)  
So here you are, smack dab up in the mix (uh-huh)  
Shorty this here's about as good as it gets  
Word up, I'ma treat you like a queen from the heart  
Crack the bubbly, and let the episode start  
  
I'll be loungin with LL, Cooool J  
I'll be loungin with LL, heyyy heyyy  
I'll be loungin with LL, Cooool J  
I'll be loungin with LL, heyyy heyyy  
  
I'll be loungin with LL, Cooool J  
I'll be loungin with LL, heyyy heyyy  
I'll be loungin with LL, Cooool J
