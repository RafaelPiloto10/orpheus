Well, well, well, seems like you pulls only yesterday  
When mama told me, don't fall in love with the first girl that comes your way  
She was pretty and nice and I took her fast and passed her by  
Years have passed and moved like love's gonna give me a second try  
More than loved than you first tells me you understand  
Could it be your love life like mine, I need a girlfriend's hand  
Well, you need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
(take it girl) I know it ain't fine and proper for a girl to talk this way  
But I can't cope with this loneliness not one more damned on day  
Everyday bringing up your clown to keeping my hopes of love  
Judging from your silence, boy you must be in the same boat  
Well, you need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you  
I can't begin to tell the many nights I set down lonely  
Come on, tell me girl, has it ever happened to you  
I'm gonna tell you something and believe me, it ain't no joke  
My love life is just like a sinking boat  
I can understand a person beeing without money  
You can show me the reason for a person to be without luck  
Listen to me now, I'm a girl and you're a guy (yes it's true)  
Come on naked and love and try (haha, yeah)  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
Finding true love is a dream everybody wants to come true  
Can't you see it's up to us to make this dream come true  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
(Well, well) You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you  
Ain't it true, ain't it true, ain't it true  
Ain't it true, ain't it true, yes it's so true  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well  
You need love too  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
(Hey, hey) You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirrow, when I'm looking at you  
Ain't it true girl  
Well, I'm in love  
I need love  
And I need you  
And I need you toooo.....au
