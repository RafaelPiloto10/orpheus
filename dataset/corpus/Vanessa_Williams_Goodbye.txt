Look at your heart ache as you try tell me  
The love we made was not enough for you  
You're walking away from all that we dreamed of  
The things you say are leading to...  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
You made you mind up but your heart can't say it  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Say anything but darling don't say goodbye  
  
You wait at the door and turn 'round to see me  
The look into your eyes says you really want to stay  
And then we touch, your hands are a whisper  
They tell my heart that you can't say  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
You made your mind up but your heart can't say it  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Say anything but darling don't say goodbye  
  
Oh baby with or without you  
I'll always love what we both knew  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
You made your mind up but your heart can't say it  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Say anything but darling don't say goodbye  
  
Don't say goobye  
Baby, let's talk about love  
Let's talk about it now  
Please baby, don't say  
Baby, let's talk about love  
Without your love I can't go on without you  
Baby, don't say  
Baby, let's talk about love
