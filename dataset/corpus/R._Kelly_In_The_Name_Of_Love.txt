I'm just bein' real, you know  
I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody  
You know what I'm sayin'  
But it's like situation after situation, you know  
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard  
Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through  
But still I got my head up just like I promised you  
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin'with  
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do  
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place  
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face  
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink  
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry  
All these questions deep inside my mind  
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama  
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why  
You were young, 45, and you had to die  
I'm always tryin' to help people out  
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth  
(Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make  
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create  
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive  
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't wanna let me live  
When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'  
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'  
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off  
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off  
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Still young tryin' to figure it out  
Heaven, I need a hug  
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug  
Feelin' like a change of heart  
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God  
So sh
