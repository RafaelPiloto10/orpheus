This world rejects me  
This world threw me away  
This world never gave me a chance  
This world gonna have to pay  
  
Well I don't believe in your institutions  
I did what you wanted me to  
I'm like the cancer in your system  
I've got a little surprise for you  
  
Something inside of me  
Has opened up its eyes  
Why did you put it there?  
Did you not realize  
This thing inside of me  
It screams the loudest sound  
Sometimes I think I could  
  
Burn  
  
I look down from at where you're standing  
Flock of sheep out on display  
With all your lies bumped up around you  
I can take it all away  
  
Something inside of me  
Has opened up its eyes  
Why did you put it there?  
Did you not realize  
Something inside of me  
It screams the loudest sound  
Sometimes I think I could  
  
I'm gonna burn this whole world down  
  
I never was a part of you  
  
Burn  
  
I was a soldier  
I am corruption  
I am the agent  
Of your destruction  
I am perversion  
Sick with desire  
I am your future  
Swallowed up in fire
