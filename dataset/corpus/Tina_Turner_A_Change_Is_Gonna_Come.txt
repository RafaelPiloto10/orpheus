I was born by the river in a little tent  
Oh, and like that river I've been running ever since  
It's been a long, long time coming  
But I know a change is gonna come  
Oh yes it is  
  
It's been too hard living and I'm affraid to die  
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky  
It's been a long, long time coming  
But I know a change is gonna come  
Oh yes it is  
  
I go to the movies and I go around in town  
Everybody there keeps telling me "don't hang around"  
It's been a long, a long time coming  
But I know a change is gonna come  
Oh yes it is  
  
Then I go to my brother  
And I say "Brother, please"  
But he just winds up, knocking me  
Back down on my knees  
  
Sometimes I thought I wouldn't last for long  
But now I think I'm able to carry on  
It's been a long, long time coming  
But I know a change is gonna come  
Oh yes it is
