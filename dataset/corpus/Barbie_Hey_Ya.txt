One, two, three go  
My baby, don't mess around because she loves me so  
And this I know for sure  
But does she really want to but can't stand to see me  
Walk out the door  
Don't try to fight the feelin' 'cause the thought alone  
Is killin' me right now  
Thank God for mom and dad for stickin' through together  
'Cause we don't know how  
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya  
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya  
You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it  
But got it just don't get it 'til' there's nothin' at all  
We get together, oh, we get together  
But separates always better when there's feelin's involved  
If what they say is, nothin' is forever  
Then what makes it, then what makes it, then what makes it  
Then what makes it, then what makes it love the exception  
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh are we so in denial?
