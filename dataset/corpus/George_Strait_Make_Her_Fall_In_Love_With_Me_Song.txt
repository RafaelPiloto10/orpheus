[chorus]  
Play me a dancer, a holder-hander, or honky-tonker,  
Pull-her-up-closer, slow romancer,  
Make her fall in love with me song.  
  
The room is swimmin' with pretty women,  
But how's a fella supposed to get close to 'em?  
The band is rockin', the joint is jumpin,  
Mr. guitar man let me tell you somethin'  
  
[chorus]  
  
I see a redhead, I see a brunette,  
And there's a blonde I love I don't even know yet.  
I'm going crazy, you got to save me.  
I need a hugger and I don't mean maybe.  
  
[chorus]  
  
Play me a dancer, a holder-hander, or honky-tonker,  
Pull-her-up-closer, get-next-to-her,sweet-enough-to-kiss-her,  
Just-a-little-softer-so-she-can-hear-me-whisper, slow romancer,  
Make her fall in love with me song.
