[Verse 1]  
You're the light, you're the night  
You're the color of my blood  
You're the cure, you're the pain  
You're the only thing I wanna touch  
Never knew that it could mean so much  
So much  
  
[Verse 2]  
You're the fear, I don't care  
Cause I've never been so high  
Follow me to the dark  
Let me take you past our satellites  
Then You can see the world you brought to life, to life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do, touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?  
  
[Verse 3]  
  
Fading in, fading out  
On the edge of paradise  
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find  
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace  
Cause I'm not thinking straight  
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more  
What are you waiting for?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do, touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?  
  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do,touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
I'll let you set the pace  
Cause I'm not thinking straight  
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more  
What are you waiting for?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do, touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?  
  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do, touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?
