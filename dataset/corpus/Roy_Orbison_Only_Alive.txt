When you happened by my open eyes could see,  
My sleeping hands awoke and almost reached,  
I was full of life till you walked on by  
Then I went right back to feeling sad and lonely  
And only alive.  
  
For a moment my heart began to beat,  
My puppet legs responded to your strings,  
And my shuffling feet started stepping high  
Then I went right back to feeling sad and lonely  
And only alive.  
  
For all the things worth living for  
Left me for someone new  
And all of those things I lost  
I was left condemned to a lonely life  
Then I went right back to feeling sad and lonely  
And only alive.
