Living on the edge out of control  
And the world just won't let me slow down  
But in my biggest picture, was a photo of you and me  
Girl U know I try, I work hard to provide all the material things  
That I thought would make U happy  
I'm confused can U make me understand  
Cause I try to give U the best of me  
I thought we we're cool maybe I was blind  
But never took time to see  
  
Will U help me  
Tell me what you want from me  
Can U help me  
Tell me why U wanna leave  
Baby help me  
Without U my whole world is falling apart  
And I? going crazy  
Life's a prison when you're in love alone  
  
I need U to come back home(U know I need U)  
I don't wanna be alone  
  
Girl I put your love up on the shelf  
And I guess I just left it to die  
And now we're not together  
'Cause I hurt U too many times  
  
And now you're not around  
I wish for every moment of time that got wasted  
We used it to make sweet love  
Baby be my guide  
  
Please take my hand  
I want U to know that I got U if you need it  
Don't wanna be on the outside looking in  
I gotta have U girl can't U see it  
  
Will U help me  
Tell me what you want from me  
Should U help me  
Tell me why U wanna leave  
  
Baby help me  
'Cause Without U my whole world is falling apart  
And without you I think I'll go crazy  
Life's a prison when you're in love alone  
  
I need U to come back home(U know I need U)  
I don't wanna be alone  
  
Please stay don't go  
I don't want it to be over  
Give me another chance  
I wanna be your man  
Girl U got me  
Down here on my knees  
Crying, beggin', pleadin'  
I'll do anything for your love  
  
Would U help me  
Tell me what you want from me  
Can U help me  
Tell me why U wanna leave  
  
Baby help me  
Without U my whole world is falling apart  
And without you girl I'm going crazy  
Life's a prison without your love  
  
Can u help me  
Tell me why, why, why, why, why  
Can u help me  
Girl I'll never stop  
  
Girl your all I've got  
Can u help me  
Help me understand
