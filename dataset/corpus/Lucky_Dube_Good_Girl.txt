When you were a little girl  
I had dreams and I had plans for you  
As a single father I knew  
There was gonna be turbulance  
Along the way  
I did not know that so soon  
I' d have to stand on the side  
Watch you go through life  
Without my guidance you see  
I wanted to be there when you cry  
I wanted to be there when you smile  
I wanted to be there when you play  
I wanted to be there all your life  
I would say it' s wrong  
She' d say it' s right  
Words got spoken since  
I live in a glass house  
I didn't want no stones to be thrown  
I didn't want no blows to be thrown  
But I would hate to see my...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Good girl go bad  
Good girl go bad  
  
The games we played  
The rhymes you taught me  
Everything we did together  
Those were the best days of my life  
I will always remember  
The little girl you were once  
I wanted to be there when you cry  
I wanted to be there when you smile  
I wanted to be there when you play  
I wanted to be there all your life  
I would say it' s right  
She' d say it' s wrong  
I would say it' s wrong  
She' d say it' s right  
Words got spoken since  
I live in a glass house  
I didn't want no stones to be thrown  
I didn't want no blows to be thrown  
But I would hate to see my...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Good girl go bad  
Good girl go bad
