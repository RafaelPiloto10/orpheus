Didn't know 'til today  
That you would love for me to say  
All of things I feel  
Though you don't doubt they're real  
Insecure, very shy  
Are the only reasons I have why  
I never say the things that you would love to hear  
All the words I try  
Disappoint me and I cry  
So they're words I don't always say, but  
It's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start  
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard for me to say why  
Kinda sad, kinda blue  
Because I wanted to tell you  
That you were in my heart  
Though we were far apart  
Didn't know how to say  
All the little things to make you stay  
And not to keep assuming  
You could read my mind  
You're the one I love  
Though it's hard for you to know  
'Cause the words I don't always say, but  
It's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start  
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard for me to say why
