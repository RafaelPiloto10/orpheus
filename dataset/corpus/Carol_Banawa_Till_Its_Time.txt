I just, can't tell  
This feeling here inside me  
I feel, so strange  
Whenever you are near me  
Everytime I see you pass I smile  
But then you never seem to realize  
Its for your eyes  
If you would say hello  
It would be nice  
Chorus:  
You're in my mind  
Almost all the time  
Every single minute all I do is think of you  
And deep inside  
In this heart of mine  
I have to go on wishing till it's time  
One day, you came  
And you are oh so near me  
I smiled, and then  
You turn and did not see me  
How am I supposed to get to meet you  
What should I do  
Your in my dreams, I feel it seems  
That you don't feel it quite the way I do  
Repeat chorus  
Yeahhh heyyyy ohhh  
Yes deep inside  
In this heart of mine  
I have to go on wishing till it's time  
Repeat chorus  
Yeaaaaahhh  
Till it's time.......
