Locked in a struggle for the right combination of words in a melody line  
I took a walk along the riverbank of my imagination  
Golden clouds were shuffling the sunshine  
  
But if I ever get back to the twentieth century  
Guess I'll have to pay off some debts  
Open the book of my vanishing memory  
With its catalogue of regrets  
Stand up for the deeds I did  
And those I didn't do  
Sit down, shut up, think about God  
And wait for the hour of my rescue  
  
We don't mean to mess things up  
But mess them up we do  
And then it's "Oh, I'm sorry"  
Here's a smiling photograph of love it was new  
At a birthday party  
  
Make a wish and close your eyes: surprise, surprise, surprise.  
  
Early December, and brown as a sparrow  
Frost creeping over the pond  
I shoot a thought into the future  
And it flies like an arrow  
Through my lifetime, and beyond  
  
If I ever come back as a tree, or a crow  
Or even the wind-blown dust  
Find me on the ancient road in the song when the wires are hushed  
Hurry on and remember me, as I'll remember you  
Far above the golden clouds, the darkness vibrates  
  
The earth is blue  
  
And everything about it is a love song  
Everything about it  
Everything about it is a love song  
Everything about it  
Everything about it is a love song
