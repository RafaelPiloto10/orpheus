Now if you love me please don't tease  
If I can hold then let me squeeze  
My heart goes round and round  
My love comes a tumblin' down  
You leave me ah  
Breathless ah!  
I shake all over and you know why  
I am sure its love honey that's no lie  
Cause when you call my name  
You know I burn like a wooden flame  
You leave me ah  
Breathless!  
Oh baby oh crazy!  
Your much to much Honey I can't love you enough  
It's alright to hold me tight  
But when you love me love me right!  
Ah come on baby now don't be shy  
This love was meant for you and I  
Wind, rain, sleet or snow  
I am gonna be wherever you go  
You have left me ah  
Breathless ah!  
  
Well  
Ooh baby mmm crazy  
Your much to much  
I can't love you enough  
Well its alright to hold me tight  
But when you love me love me right  
Ah come on baby now don't be shy  
This love was meant for you and I  
Wind, rain, sleet or snow  
I am gonna be wherever you go  
You leave me ah
