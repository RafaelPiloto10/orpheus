Daddy's on the sofa, turning up another bottle to unleash when I get home  
I pretend he doesn't hit me  
Momma just pretends that she don't know.  
  
I used to think of talking  
Talking to my preacher  
He says I should just forgive and forget.  
Now my baby brother just sits and recollects the same regrets.  
  
And I just wanna leave  
Oh, God, please help me now, I wanna leave.  
  
As if that's not enough  
We're the new family around here  
Guess that's all the reason some kids need  
'Cause they all call me names, and say I should just take it on the chin.  
  
If I'm overreacting, then why is it so cold here  
Why is it so cold here, in this hell  
Why would my friend Suzy  
Tell me I should just go kill myself?  
  
And I just wanna leave  
Oh, God, please help me now, I wanna leave  
And I, I just wanna leave  
Oh, God, please help me now, I wanna leave  
  
Oh, I wanna get out of here  
Oh, God, help me now, I really wanna leave,  
  
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, ohh)  
  
And I, just wanna leave  
Oh, God, please help me now, I wanna leave  
Oh, but I, I just wanna believe  
Oh, God, please hear me now, I wanna believe  
I just need to know, that You're really out there  
Tell me if You're really out there, 'cause I believe.
