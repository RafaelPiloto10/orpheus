I'll protect you from the hooded claw  
Keep the vampires from your door  
  
Feels like fire  
I'm so in love with you  
Dreams are like angels  
They keep bad at bay-bad at bay  
Love is the light  
Scaring darkness away-yeah  
  
I'm so in love with you  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
The power of love  
A force from above  
Cleaning my soul  
Flame on burn desire  
Love with tongues of fire  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
I'll protect you from the hooded claw  
Keep the vampires from your door  
When the chips are down I'll be around  
With my undying, death-defying  
Love for you  
  
Envy will hurt itself  
Let yourself be beautiful  
Sparkling love, flowers  
And pearls and pretty girls  
Love is like an energy  
Rushin' rushin' inside of me  
  
The power of love  
A force from above  
Cleaning my soul  
Flame on burn desire  
Love with tongues of fire  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
This time we go sublime  
Lovers entwine-divine divine  
Love is danger, love is pleasure  
Love is pure-the only treasure  
  
I'm so in love with you  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
The power of love  
A force from above  
Cleaning my soul  
The power of love  
A force from above  
A sky-scraping dove  
  
Flame on burn desire  
Love with tongues of fire  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
I'll protect you from the hooded claw  
Keep the vampires from your door
