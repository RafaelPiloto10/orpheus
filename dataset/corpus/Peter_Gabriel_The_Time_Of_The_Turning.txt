In the big house  
Where the sun lives  
With the walls so white and blue  
In the red soil  
All the green grows  
And the winds blow across your face  
They blow across your heart  
  
It's the time of the turning and there's something stirring outside  
It's the time of turning and we'd better learn to say our goodbyes  
  
All the earth breaks  
Like a stale bread  
And the seeds are folded in the soil  
Oh the sun pours  
Then the rains fall  
While the roots reach out right through the ground  
They reach out through the ground  
  
It's the time of turning and there's something stirring outside  
It's the time of turning and the old world's falling  
Nothing you can do can stop the next emerging  
Time of the turning and we'd better learn to say our goodbyes  
  
If we can stand up  
When all else falls down  
We'll last through the winter  
We'll last through the storms  
We'll last through the north winds  
That bring down the ice and snow  
We'll last through the long nights  
Till the green field's growing again  
Growing again
