Stand in the lobby in the summer, inert  
I don't know you're lost  
Too bad he answered you ripening diamonds  
Are gone  
  
Save the company from one last Sunday  
She's dead and buried  
But lets make out tonight  
  
So endlessly rescued and mayors run  
To the golf for your teeth  
It's great to be apaled for the thicker  
Applause, for me  
  
Save the company from one last Sunday  
She's dead and buried  
But lets make out tonight  
  
He froze the past  
This company notices you aren't here  
The rays are here from you  
To save the company  
  
Save the company from one last Sunday  
She's dead and buried  
But lets make out tonight
