So many times I said it was forever  
Said our love would always be true  
Somethin' in my heart always knew  
I'd be lying there beside him  
  
On my own, On my own, On my own  
  
So many promises never should be spoken  
Now you know what loving him costs  
Now you're even talking divorce  
And you weren't even married  
  
On my own  
Once again I'm  
One more time by myself  
  
No one said it would be easy  
But it once was so easy  
Well I believe in love now here I stand  
You wonder why  
  
I'm on my own  
Why did it end this way  
On my own  
This wasn't how it was supposed to be  
On my own  
I wish that we could do it all again  
  
So many times I know I could have told you  
That losing him would cut like a knife  
He walked out and there went your life  
I don't want to live without him  
  
On my own  
This wasn't how it was supposed to end  
On my own  
I wish that we could do it all again  
On my own  
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone by myself  
On my own  
You've got to find out where you belong again  
On my own  
You've got to learn how to be strong again  
On my own  
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone by myself  
  
You've got to find out where you belong again  
Your heart is saying that it's time again  
And I know that you're gonna shine again
