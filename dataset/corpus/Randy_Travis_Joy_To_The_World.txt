Joy to the world, the Lord has come!  
Let earth receive her king  
Let every heart prepare Him room  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing  
  
Joy to the world, the savior reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy  
He rules the world with truth and grace,  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of his righteousness  
And wonders of his love,  
And wonders of his love,  
And wonders, wonders, of His love  
  
Joy to the world , the Lord has come!  
Let earth receive her king  
Let every heart prepare him room  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing  
  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing
