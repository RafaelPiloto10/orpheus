When this world is caught on fire  
I wanna be caught in your will.  
No I never will give up, no, no.  
No I never will no, no.  
No I never will give up, no, no.  
No I never will no, no  
And when this world is caught on fire  
I wanna be caught in your will  
I never will give up no, no,  
No I never will, No, no, no, no, no  
  
I'll always remember, ya, ya,  
You know I always will, ya, ya,  
I'll always remember, ya, ya,  
Ya know I always will, ya, ya  
When they crucified my Lord up on Calverie's hill  
I'll always remember, ya, ya,  
Ya know I always will ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

No I never will give up, no, no.  
No I never will no, no.  
No I never will give up, no, no.  
No I never will no, no  
And when this world is caught on fire  
I wanna be caught in your will  
I never will give up no, no,  
No I never will, No, no, no, no, no  
  
I'll always keep singin', ya, ya.  
Ya know I always will, ya, ya  
I'll always keep singin' ya, ya,  
Ya know I always will, ya, ya,  
And when they crucified my Lord up on Calverie's hill
