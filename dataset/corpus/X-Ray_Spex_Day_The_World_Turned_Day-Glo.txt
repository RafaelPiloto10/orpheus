I clambered over mounds and mounds  
Of polystyrene foam  
And fell into a swimming pool  
Filled with fairy snow  
And watched the world turn day-glo  
You know you know  
The world turned day-glo you know  
  
I wrenched the nylon curtains back  
As far as they would go  
And peered through perspex window panes  
At the acrylic road  
  
I drove my polypropolene  
Car on wheels of sponge  
Then pulled into a wimpy bar  
To have a rubber bun  
  
The X-rays were penetrating  
Through the latex breeze  
Synthetic fiber see-through leaves  
The I fell from the rayon trees
