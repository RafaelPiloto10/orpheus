You were born to privilege  
Licking on a silver spoon  
Think you gotta buy all your friends  
Just so you can tear up the room  
Your kind is a dime a dozen  
I've seen it all before  
A parasite in a good disguise  
Just another wolf at the door  
  
[Chorus]  
The wolf  
Prowling in the nighttime  
The wolf  
Howling in the moonshine  
The wolf  
Gives you what you want but he ain't no friend of mine  
  
You lay it on oh, so sweet  
Just like that bad cologne  
Just smiling tooth and nail  
You gotta make your presence known  
But you are only a lonely hunter  
Some things you can't disguise  
Just to look in the hallway mirror  
Now it's howling in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Silent, slick and stealthy  
Slinking through your evils nights  
You can see in the dark they tell me  
The daylight burns your eyes  
I know you're trying to track me down now  
You're right on my trail  
Your think you're going for the big big game  
But you're chasing your own tail  
  
[Chorus]
