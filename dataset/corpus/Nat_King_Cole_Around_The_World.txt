Around the world, I've searched for you  
I traveled on when hope was gone  
To keep a rendezvous  
I know somewhere, sometime, somehow  
  
You'd look at me  
And I would see the smile you're smiling now  
  
It might have been in County Down  
Or in New York  
  
In Gay Paree or even London Town  
No more will I go all around the world  
For I have found my world in you  
  
It might have been in County Down  
Or in New York
