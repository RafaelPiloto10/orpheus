She can concentrate on workin'  
Until her work is done  
She can hold a conversation  
As well as anyone  
She'll fool you with sincerity  
And if you didn't know her well  
You would never see it  
You could never tell  
  
[Chorus]  
She's just looking for him  
She's only rememberin'  
She might look like she's ready  
To fall in love again  
But she's just looking for him  
  
She keeps one eye on the road  
And one on the other lane  
Lookin' for his car  
His memory's re-played  
She searches other faces  
Tryin' to find that spark  
But no one new can reach her  
Or fill her hollow heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh you'd better keep your distance  
Don't let her reel you in  
She's not quite herself now  
How could she be when  
  
[Chorus]
