(Food processors are great!)  
It's six o'clock on the dot and I'm half way home  
I feel foul mouthed as I stand and wait for the underground  
And a nervous disposition doesn't agree with this  
I need something to remind me that there's something else  
  
You need a holiday, somewhere in the sun  
With all the people who are waiting, there never seems to be one  
Say something, say something else  
Say something, say something else  
  
Advertisements are here for rapid persuasion  
If you stare too long you lose your appetite  
A nervous disposition doesn't agree with this  
You need fast relief from aches and stomach pains  
  
I need a holiday, somewhere in the sun  
With all the people who are waiting, there never seems to be one  
Say something, say something else  
Say something, say something else  
  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,  
12, 13, 14, 15, 16  
  
(You can have it on the rates  
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a one week only special offer.)  
  
You need a holiday, somewhere in the sun  
With all the people who are waiting, there never seems to be one  
Say something, say something else  
Go on!  
Say something, say something else  
Say something, say something else  
Say something, say something else
