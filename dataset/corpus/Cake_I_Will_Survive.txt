At first I was afraid  
I was petrified  
I kept thinking I could never live without you  
By my side  
  
But then I spent so many nights  
Just thinking how you've done me wrong  
I grew strong  
I learned how to get along  
  
And so you're back  
From outer space  
I just walked in to find you  
Here without that look upon your face  
  
I should have changed my fucking lock  
I would have made you leave your key  
If I had known for just one second  
You'd be back to bother me  
  
Well now go,  
Walk out the door  
Just turn around  
Now, you're not welcome anymore  
  
Weren't you the one  
Who tried to break me with desire?  
Did you think I'd crumble?  
Did you think I'd lay down and die?  
  
Oh not I,  
I will survive  
Yeah  
As Long as I know how to love,  
  
I know I'll be alive  
I've got all my life to live  
I've got all my love to give  
I will survive,  
  
I will survive  
Yeah, yeah  
It took all the strength I had  
Just not to fall apart  
  
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces  
Of my broken heart  
And I spent oh so many nights  
Just feeling sorry for myself  
  
I used to cry,  
But now I hold my head up high  
And you see me  
With somebody new  
  
I'm not that stupid little person  
Still in love with you  
And so you thought you'd just drop by  
And you expect me to be free  
  
But now I'm saving all my lovin'  
For someone whose lovin' me  
Well now go,  
Walk out the door  
  
Just turn around  
Now, you're not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one  
Who tried to break me with desire?  
  
Did you think I'd crumple?  
Did you think I'd lay down and die?  
Oh not I,  
I will survive  
  
Yeah  
As long as I know how to love,  
I know I'll be alive  
I've got all my life to live  
  
I've got all my love to give  
I will survive,  
I will survive  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh no
