Pounding, it starts again  
Hurting, oh where do I began?  
Screaming, they dance around my head  
Hoping, they maybe end up dead  
  
Feeling it ramble, what can I say?  
Really fucked up again (I feel that I can fight)  
I can't fucking given in (I feel that I can fight)  
Can't I ever win (I'll keep it on my mind)  
Here it comes again!  
  
Silent it goes away  
Patient oh, so really should I stay?  
Trying so hard to get ahead  
Failure, is often where I'm lead  
  
Feeling it ramble, what can I say?  
Really fucked up again (I feel that I can fight)  
I can't fucking given in (I feel that I can fight)  
Can't I ever win (I'll keep it on my mind)  
Here it comes again!  
  
Oh I must hold on  
Oh I won't be gone  
Oh I won't stop now  
Oh I don't know how  
  
Why I can't hold on?  
Why I can't be gone?  
Why I can't stop now?  
Why I'm don't know how?  
  
Here we go again (again)  
Here we go again (again)  
Here we go again (again)  
Here we go again (again)  
Here we go again (again)  
Here we go again (again)  
Here we go again (again)  
  
Feeling it ramble, what can I say?  
Really fucked up again (I feel that I can fight)  
I can't fucking given in (I feel that I can fight)  
Can't I ever win (I'll keep it on my mind)  
Here it comes again!
