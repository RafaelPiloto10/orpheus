Truth is only reality  
Nature truly is what we are  
Peace is only nature at rest  
Love is our true nature  
Love is all  
  
Truth and nature bring us peace and love  
Love is our true nature  
Love is all  
Love is our true nature  
Love is all  
  
Peace and love are all we long for  
Peace and love  
Truth is only reality  
Nature truly is what we are  
Peace and love are always our true nature  
Love is all  
  
Human nature, our true nature  
Love at peace with nature  
Human nature, human nature  
  
Therefore every one of us  
Has to find a strong foundation for a love  
Help us find a strong foundation for a love  
  
Although life sometimes is hard we still pull through  
Without truth false shades nothing else remains  
Without truth false shades nothing else remains  
But still we are able to pull through  
Even though we may have nothing else  
Nothing ever remains  
And then our feelings are threatened  
Unless we can pull through  
To the opposite side  
Nothing else remains
