I woke up this morning all cotton mouthed from drinking  
Wonderin' how I'd made it through the day  
  
Wild eyed and crazy all burnt out from thinkin'  
Wonderin' how the hell I's gonna say  
  
Goodbye marie - oh goodbye Marie  
Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me  
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie  
If I cannot keep your love  
At least I'll have your memory  
  
Wakin' up beside you in the Tijuana mornin'  
With that ocean breeze to keep us cool  
  
Three weeks of lovin' - 21 nights of heaven  
I stayed just long enough to be your fool  
  
Goodbye Marie - oh goodbye Marie  
Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me  
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie  
If I cannot keep your love  
At least I'll have your memory  
  
Por favor pour me One more tequila  
I need all the courage I can find  
  
This time tomorrow I'll be back in Houston  
Thinkin' about the girl I left behind
