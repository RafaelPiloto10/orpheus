with (Pearl Bailey)  
  
Hey, Pearl, what's bugging you, girl?  
(Too much knowledge, Frank, too much knowledge.)  
Explain it to me.  
(Well, it was down at school at the age of six.)  
One of the real quiz kids.  
(Yeah , so did reason and lightning touch.)  
Usual thought.  
(As time went on, I studied lots of, oh, the other things.)  
Uh huh, like a.  
(No, most of them didn't hurt much.)  
Well, I've had other teachers.  
(Well I got my diploma, I was real real smart.)  
In a pretty frame, huh?  
(Of my knowledge there was no doubt.)  
That's pretty obvious.  
(Yeah but lately I've had the same, like in your words too,)  
(It wasn't even a thought, let me tell you what I found out now.)  
Look at the size of my ears, pour it on.  
(You know it started with a man.)  
Uh huh!  
(And the man he was grand.)  
Ain't that the truth.  
(He had a lie that would make a bird sing.)  
This kid really came on, I can see that,  
'Cause you were much too smart to be afraid at the start.  
(Frank, a little learnin' is a dangerous thing.)  
Well, I'd like to hear some more.  
(First he only wanted two.)  
To?  
(Then he changed it to few.)  
Oh, you mean loot.  
(I even loaned that man my watch and my ring.)  
Oh, you lost your head, Pearl, completely,  
'Cause you were hip to the fact that he would pay you right back.  
(Yep, a little learning is a dangerous thing.)  
Uh huh. Yes, with his sweetheart, his so discreet heart.  
(Oh Frank, he had me doing things that I shouldn't do.)  
That cad, ain't no denying, so sense in trying.  
(Let me tell you, it is just as bad. My education's been like some book.)  
Bet you had an encyclopedia.  
(Yet now I know the score at last.)
