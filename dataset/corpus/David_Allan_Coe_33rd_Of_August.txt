Mhmm mhmm mhmm too doo doo doo mhmm  
Well today there's no salvation band's packed up and gone  
And I'm left standing with my penny in my hand  
There's a big crowd at the station where the blind man sings his song  
But he sees Lord what they can't understand  
It's the 33rd of August Lord and I'm finally coming down  
Eight days from Sunday finds me Saturday bound  
  
Once I stumbled through the darkness fell down to my knees  
A thousand voices screaming in my brain  
Woke up in a squad car busted down for vacancy  
And outside my cell it's sure as hell it looked like rain  
Now I've got my dangerous feeling under lock and chain  
I've killed my violent nature with a smile  
Though the demons danced and sang their songs within my fevered brain  
Not all my God like thoughts Lord were defiled  
It's the 33rd of August Lord...  
  
Yesterday's newspaper forecast no rain for today  
Yesterday's news was old news so I threw it away  
Sometimes at night Lord you know I can still feel the pain  
And outside my cell it sure as hell it looks like rain
