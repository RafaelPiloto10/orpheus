Hate the living, love the dead  
Smashing embryos, cut off heads  
Find the brain for my bride-to-be  
We'll bear our children, Adam and Eve  
  
Put me together with the bodies of the dead  
And I will wait for life and breathe again  
Hate the living, love the dead  
  
Scalpels, scissors, stitches, skin  
Wake this eternal sleep she's in  
And we'll breed for you, on your command  
Hate the living, love the dead  
  
Nerves steady, hands are sure  
Bride reborn to view with horror  
Blackened eyes, blood-stained hands  
Hate the living, love the dead  
  
Put me together with the bodies of the dead  
And I will wait for life and breathe again  
Hate the living, love the dead  
  
Scalpels, scissors, stitches, skin  
Wake this eternal sleep she's in  
And we'll breed for you, on your command  
Hate the living, love the dead  
  
Put me together with the bodies of the dead  
And I will wait for life and breathe again  
Hate the living, love the dead  
  
Scalpels, scissors, stitches, skin  
Wake this eternal sleep she's in  
And we'll breed for you, on your command  
Hate the living, love the dead  
  
Oh
