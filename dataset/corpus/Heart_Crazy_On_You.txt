If we still have time, we might still get by  
Every time I think about it, I want to cry  
With bombs and the devil, and the kids keep comin'  
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young  
  
But I tell myself that I was doin' all right  
There's nothin' left to do at night  
But go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
  
My love is the evenin' breeze touchin' your skin  
The gentle, sweet singin' of leaves in the wind  
The whisper that calls after you in the night  
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight  
And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine  
My love, the pleasure's mine  
  
Let me go crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhh  
  
Wild man's world is cryin' in pain  
What you gonna do when everybody's insane  
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you  
What you gonna do, ohh  
  
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)  
  
Oohh crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you  
  
I was a willow last night in my dream  
I bent down over a clear running stream  
Sang you the song that I heard up above  
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love  
  
Crazy  
Yeah, crazy on ya  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
Crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, yeah  
  
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)  
  
Crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you
