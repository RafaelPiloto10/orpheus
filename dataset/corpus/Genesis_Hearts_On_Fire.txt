In life there are those decisions  
Which direction you should take  
It's only later that you realize  
All those simple mistakes you make  
I don't like being alone  
Don't want to be by myself  
But since you've gone, that's all I can think of  
I can't think of nothing else  
  
Oh, I said I'm sorry, soon I give it up  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
My heart's on fire  
  
Whoa, can you take me there?  
Oh, come back and take me there  
'Cause I need to be with you  
Be there with you  
  
Yes, there is no denying  
Our love is not untrue  
I know I've lied so many times before  
But deep down there's only you  
I need you here by my side  
Together our love could grow  
But first you have to believe that I want you  
More than you'll ever know  
  
Whoa, I said I'm sorry, and I give it up (give it up)  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up (give it up)  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up (give it up)  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
My heart's on fire  
  
Whoa, can you take me there?  
Oh, come back and take me there  
'Cause I need to be with you  
Be there with you  
  
(Give it up, give it up, give it up)  
With it we take our chances  
What will be will be  
But I don't care what the people may think  
Just as long as you're here with me  
Don't like being alone  
Don't want to be by myself  
And since you've gone, well, that's all I can think of  
I can't think of nothing else  
  
Whoa, I said I'm sorry, and I give it up (give it up)  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up (give it up)  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
My heart's on fire  
  
Whoa, can you take me there?  
Oh, come back and take me there  
'Cause I need to be with you  
Be there with you  
You, be there with you  
  
Heart's on fire  
Heart's on fire  
Heart's on fire  
My heart's on fire  
Heart's on fire, heart's on fire...
