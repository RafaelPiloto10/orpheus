One minute to one, and you gotta go home  
And I didn't even kiss you, while we were alone  
I was sittin' there wishin', I could hold you tight  
But I reckon I waited just a little too long  
To... Kiss you tonight  
One minute to one, how did it get so late  
Even though I didn't get to kiss you  
It's really been a wonderful date  
One minute to one, and the movie was great  
But your mama's gonna worry, 'cause it's gettin' so late  
I just wanted to tell you, that I love you so  
But I reckon I waited just a little too long  
So... We'd better go  
One minute to one, how did it get so late  
Even though I didn't get to kiss you  
It's really been a wonderful date  
I want you to know now, that I think you're nice  
But I reckon I'll wait till tomorrow night  
And... I'll kiss you twice
