We won't pretend that this is the end  
We're not losers all of the time  
We march and we fall  
We're one and for all  
It's just evil all of the time...  
All the time...  
  
We are the fiend club  
We are the fiend club  
We are the fiend club  
Not you! Not you!  
  
You dress so messed up  
Your hair is too long  
But I'm changing all of the time  
We march and we fall  
We're one and for all  
It's just evil all of the time  
All of the time  
Evil all the time  
  
We are the fiend club  
We are the fiend club  
We are the fiend club  
Not you! Not you!  
  
We are the fiend club
