Look in the mirror  
You, I'm a hero  
You give me fever  
Fever  
Slowly with passion  
Boy have attraction  
Nobody's trying to stop me  
Nobody's trying to stop me  
  
But I can fall  
I can fall  
Your the reason that I'm crying  
And i dream  
I can dream that I'm with you  
  
Look in the mirror  
You,I'm a hero  
You give me fever  
Fever  
Slowly with passion  
Boy have attraction  
Nobody's trying to stop me  
Nobody's trying to stop me  
  
But I can fall  
I can fall  
Your the reason that I'm crying  
And i dream  
I can dream that I'm with you
