Time as I've known it  
Doesn't take much time to pass by me  
Minutes into days turn into months turn into years  
They hurry by me  
  
Still I love to see the sun go down  
And the world go around  
  
Dreams full of promises  
Hopes for the future  
I've had many  
  
Dreams I can't remember now  
Hopes that I've forgotten  
Faded memories  
  
Still I love to see the sun go down  
And the world go around  
  
And I love to see the morning  
As it steals across the sky  
I love to remember  
  
And I love to wonder why  
And I hope that I'm around  
So I can be there when I die  
When I'm gone  
  
I hope that you will think of me  
In moments when you're happy  
And you're smiling  
  
That a thought will comfort you  
On cold and cloudy days  
If you are crying  
  
Still I love to see the sun go down  
And the world go around  
And around and around
