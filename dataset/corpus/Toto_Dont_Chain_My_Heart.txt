Tired and frozen, I'm under your spell  
I thought I knew you, but now I know you well  
I wake up beside you, move across your killing floor  
I need my freedom and I see an open door  
The room is getting smaller and the walls are closin' in  
No one's leavin' and nobody's gettin' in  
  
I try to run, I try to hide, I try to tell you what I'm feelin' inside  
Should I stay, should I go  
You know I want to touch you, but there's nothing left to hold  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't chain my heart (don't chain my heart)  
Don't chain my soul (don't chain my soul)  
Don't chain my heart (don't chain my heart), 'cause you got to let it go  
  
Looks like trouble, the signs are everywhere  
I bend a little but you take more than your share  
Crimes of passion, crimes of mortal men  
It's a deadly attraction and I won't be fooled again, baby  
The storm is coming, the winds begin to rise  
Please release me from this house of compromise  
  
All day, all night, your love is like an outlaw waiting till the time is right  
Nobody's wrong, no one's to blame  
Maybe it's just too hot because we're standin' in the flame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a victim of your pain and jealousy  
I feel like a prisoner and you hold the lock and key  
We lost our vision, we lost our paradise  
But there's still a part of me I refuse to sacrifice  
  
I try to run, I try to hide, I need to tell you what I'm feelin' inside, baby  
Should I stay, should I go  
You know I want to touch you, but there's nothing left to hold  
  
[Chorus x2]
