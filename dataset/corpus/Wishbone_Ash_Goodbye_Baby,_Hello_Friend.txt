I'll never write another song  
For someone who just comes along -  
The very thought of losing you  
Is too much for me to.  
The other day when you got mad,  
It made you happy to see me sad.  
I wish to tell you it's still the same,  
Still playing that same old game.  
It's goodbye baby, hello friend,  
It's good to meet you after all this time.  
Goodbye baby, hello friend,  
It's good to see you again. (repeat)  
Those days and nights I lost,  
Thinking 'bout what to do -  
When all it's really down to, baby,  
Is saying that we're through.  
So give your love to the birds,  
Speaking of four-letter words.  
Do you hear what I say to you?  
I'm not in love with you.  
Goodbye baby, hello friend,  
It's good to see you again. (repeat)
