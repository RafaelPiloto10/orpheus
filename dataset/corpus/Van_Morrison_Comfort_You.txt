I want to comfort you  
I want to comfort you  
I want to comfort you  
Just let your tears run wild  
Like when you were a child  
  
I'll do what I can do  
I want to comfort you  
You put the weight on me  
You put the weight on me  
You put the weight on me  
  
When it gets too much for me  
When it gets too much, much too much for me  
I'll do the same thing that you do  
And I'll put the weight on you  
Huh  
I'll put the weight on you  
I'll put the weight on you  
  
And I'll do the same thing that you do  
I'll put the weight on you  
I want to comfort you  
I want to comfort you  
  
And I want to comfort you  
Just let your tears run wild  
Like when you were a child  
I'll do what I can do  
I just want to comfort you
