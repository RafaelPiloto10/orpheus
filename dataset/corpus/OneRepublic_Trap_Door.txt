You say you're a minute from the deep end  
You cut cold the courtesy it's sink or swim now  
and your body's aching for a breath I'll give it to you  
With a trap door to take in of all of this  
  
Come away come away now  
You won't stand from a fall  
Hear me say it  
Come away come away now  
'Cause your too close to me to come  
  
I've seen the foolish shame the ways  
You just kept crying with his own surprises  
And your Trojan horse is big enough to save them all  
And you're not a foolish one at all  
  
Come away come away now  
You won't stand from a fall  
Can you hear me say it  
Come away come away now  
'Cause your too close to me to come  
  
Yes you're too close  
  
Lost the feeling you know  
You're the victim of  
Kick start the clothes let it go  
You don't need them  
Only flesh blood and bones I'm the same old guy  
  
If I were to know today  
  
Come away come away now  
You won't stand from a fall  
Hear me say it  
Come away come away now  
'Cause your too close now  
  
Ooh, ooh  
Come away  
Oh
