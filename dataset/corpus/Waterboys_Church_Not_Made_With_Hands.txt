Bye bye shadow lands  
The term is over  
And all the holidays have begun  
Now she walks on fresh fields  
Her tracks are on the land  
She is everywhere and noplace  
When its dark and evening falls  
She moves among men  
They would seek to have her  
As a prize  
But she is in the shadows  
Ocean and the sand  
She is everywhere and noplace  
Her church not made with hands  
Not contained by man  
She dancing high as clouds  
Faster than the arrow  
Straight as any crow that flies  
Across great seas she travels  
Up through rising lands  
She is everywhere and noplace  
Her church not made with hands  
Isn't that a pretty sun  
Setting in a pretty sky?  
Will we stay and watch it darken  
The church not made with hands  
Not contained by man  
That precious place  
Unmade  
By man
