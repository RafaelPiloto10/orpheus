If you don't look into your mind and find out  
what you're running from  
tomorrow might just be another day to run  
If you just sit and waste your time you'll be  
going where you're coming from (think about that)  
tomorrow might be just another day to run  
Someone must control your mind  
you're the one  
dark confusion's what you find when you run.  
I don't want to waste your time but I'm talking  
to you like a son  
Tomorrow might be just another day to run  
Walking down the road of life looking for direction sometimes  
my mind gets so mixed up I can't tell lust from affection  
Gonna stop in to a roadside church and get my mind a rest  
and Lord Jesus, help me get my soul together in the process  
Pretty ladies stand in line waiting for inspection  
ragged old men drinking wine trying to drown rejection  
I've been wasting too much time, I'm going to lose my  
mind unless, Lord Jesus  
You help me get my soul together in the process  
I see Tony Jr. fill up his arm with dope and dream  
about a valley but he lives in an alley  
filled with papers thrown away -- Lord tell me  
He's long on dreams and short on hope and sometimes  
he goes to rallies and stops by to see Sally just  
to pass the time away  
Lord tell me Tony tell me why do you want to get high  
enough to die.
