Mr. Moonlight...shine bright  
Show me my Mr. Right  
Lights, camera, action  
I want to be his sole distraction  
  
Cupid draw your bow  
Shoot it nice and slow  
Send it straight to his heart  
Love don't let him go  
You must let him know  
This is love from the start  
  
(Chorus):  
Say a little prayer  
Say a little prayer for me tonight  
Say a little prayer  
Say a little prayer for my hear tonight  
  
Mama always told me  
(sometimes)  
What you get is not what you see  
I'm not taking any chances  
No more broken romances  
  
Cupid draw your bow fetch  
(Chorus x2)  
I promise to always love and care for him  
And I promise...to do my very best for him  
I promise...to cherish him for all of my life  
  
I promise...to always love and care for him  
And I promise...I'll always be there for him  
I promise...to love him for the rest of my life  
  
(Chorus out).
