I need your love so badly  
I love you oh so madly  
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you  
  
I thought at last I'd found you  
But other loves surround you  
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you  
  
If you'd surrender for a tender kiss or two  
You might discover that I'm the lover meant for you  
And I'll be true  
  
But what's the good of scheming  
I know I must be dreaming  
'Cause I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you  
  
So what's the good of scheming  
I know I must be dreaming  
'Cause I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
