If you're wondering why  
All the love that you long for eludes you  
And people are rude and cruel to you  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You just haven't earned it, son  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You must suffer and cry for a longer time  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
And I'm telling you now...  
  
If you're wondering why  
When all I wanted from life was to be famous  
I have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
But you wouldn't believe me  
  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You just haven't earned it, son  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You must suffer and cry for a longer time  
You just haven't earned it yet, Baby  
And I'm telling you now...  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
  
Today I am remembering the time  
When they pulled me back  
And held me down  
And looked me in the eyes and said  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You just haven't earned it, my son  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You must stay on your own for slightly longer  
You just haven't earned it yet baby  
And I'm telling you now...  
  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
Oh...  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
Oh...  
Oh
