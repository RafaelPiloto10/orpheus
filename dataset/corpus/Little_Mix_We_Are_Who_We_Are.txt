Momma, momma, momma made me the way I am  
My face, my eyes, someone turn me up, I'm speaking my mind  
And I, and I, I've been wasting a lot of time looking in mirrors  
And hating on me, but now I like what I see  
  
I know, I know, I never be perfect  
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it  
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on  
The new you on  
  
We are who we are, who we are, pretty's just a petty word  
And I'm gonna shine like a star, cause I'm the only me in this world  
Throw away the books and the magazines, I'm never gonna look like a beauty
queen  
We are who we are, who we are, and I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
Momma, momma, momma made me the way I am  
She told me I should look up on the world with my head held high  
And I, and I, I've been wasting a lot of time looking in mirrors  
And hating on me, but now I like what I see  
  
I know, I know, I never be perfect  
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it  
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on  
The new you on  
  
We are who we are, who we are, pretty's just a petty word  
And I'm gonna shine like a star, cause I'm the only me in this world

And I'm just doing me, just doing me
