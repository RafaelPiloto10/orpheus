Give me a kiss to build on and my imagination will thrive upon that kiss  
Sweetheart I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on  
  
Give me a kiss before you leave me and my  
Imagination will feed my hungry heart  
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on  
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you  
Weaving romances, making believe they're true  
  
Give me your lips for just a moment and my  
Imagination will make that moment live  
Give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on
