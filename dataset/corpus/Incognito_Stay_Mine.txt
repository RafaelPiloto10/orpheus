There were moments in my past  
I couldn't tell right from wrong  
Getting lost along the way in places I did not belong  
I couldn't see a way to turn myself around  
so deep my confusion  
Until the day you woke up my senses  
showed me happiness was not just an illusion  
Since you came into my life  
  
I've been caught in a world of ecstasy  
For the first time in all my days  
I feel like I'm walking on solid ground  
Stay mine, stay mine  
Getting by just on my own  
Always been my intention  
Now sitting here waiting by the phone  
  
I realize how much I needed this emotion  
Every time I get the chance I'm gonna let you know  
how you complete me  
I put away all my defenses  
all the love I got  
I give to you completely  
Since you came into my life  
I've been caught in a world of ecstasy  
For the first time in all my days  
  
I feel like I'm walking on solid ground  
Stay mine, stay mine, got to stay mine  
Now you've got to know, you're the top of my list  
One the one the one the one, my number one  
There's no doubt in my mind, baby you're the one  
One the one the one the one the one  
Since you came into my life  
I've been caught in a world of ecstasy  
For the first time in all my days  
  
I feel like I'm walking on solid ground  
Ever since you came into my life  
I've been caught in a world of ecstasy  
For the first time in all my days  
I feel like I'm walking on solid ground  
Stay mine, stay mine, got to stay mine  
stay mine, sugar honey baby  
One the one the one, my number one  
One the one the one the one the one
