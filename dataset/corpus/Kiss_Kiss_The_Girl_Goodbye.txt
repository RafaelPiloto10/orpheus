Kiss the girl goodbye  
It's time for me to fly  
Wipe the tears away  
I'll be home some day, baby  
So baby, please wait for me  
Don't want no one to take my place  
You're the one for me  
And that's the way love should be  
  
We've been apart so many times before  
One more time won't change things  
I'll even love you more  
  
We've been apart so many times before
