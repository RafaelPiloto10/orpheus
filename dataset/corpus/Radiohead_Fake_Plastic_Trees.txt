Her green plastic watering can for  
her fake Chinese rubber plant  
In the fake plastic earth  
  
What she bought from a rubber man  
In a town full of rubber bands  
to get rid of itself  
  
It wears her out, it wears her out  
It wears her out, it wears her out  
  
She lives with a broken man  
A cracked polystyreneman  
Who just crumbles and burns  
  
He used to do surgery  
For girls in the eighties  
But gravity always wins  
  
And it wears him out, it wears him out  
It wears him out, it wears him  
  
She Looks like the real thing  
She tastes like the real thing  
My fake plastic love  
  
But I can't help the feeling  
I could blow through the ceiling  
If I just turn and run  
  
And it wears me out, it wears me out  
It wears me out, it wears me out  
  
If i could be who you wanted  
If i could be who you wanted all the time, all the time
