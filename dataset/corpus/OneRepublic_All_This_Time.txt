Six on the second hand  
Two New Year's resolutions  
And there's just no question  
What this man should do  
  
Take all the time lost  
All the days that I cost  
Take what I took and  
Give it back to you  
  
All this time  
We were waiting for each other  
All this time  
I was waiting for you  
We got all these words  
Can't waste them on another  
So I'm straight in a straight line  
Running back to you  
  
I don't know what day it is  
I had to check the paper  
I don't know the city  
But it isn't home  
  
But you say I'm lucky  
To love something that loves me  
But I'm torn as I could be  
Wherever I roam  
  
Hear me say  
  
All this time  
We were waiting for each other  
All this time  
I was waiting for you  
We got all these words  
Can't waste them on another  
So I'm straight in a straight line  
Running back to you  
  
Yeah, all, running back to you  
All, running back to you  
Yeah  
Oh, every time is so far  
It's just so far  
To get back to where you are  
  
All this time  
We were waiting for each other  
All this time  
I was waiting for you  
We got all these words  
Can't waste them on another  
So I'm straight in a straight line  
Running back to you  
Straight in a straight line  
Running back to you  
Straight in a straight line  
Running back to you
