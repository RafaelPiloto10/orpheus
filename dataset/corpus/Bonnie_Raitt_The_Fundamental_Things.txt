Let's run baby through these city streets  
We're all victims of captivity  
Let's stop the madness without any tricks  
I'll whisper bible quotes and you can read my lips  
  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
Let's get back to the elements of style  
Let's get back to where it all began  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
  
Let's dance barefoot over broken glass  
Slither like a snake does through the wet cold grass  
Howl and tremble in a sleepless grind  
Let's do the brain drain and leave it all behind  
  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
Let's get back to the elements of style  
Let's get back to where it all began  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
  
You can sit in your room and worry  
You can contemplate the end  
Or let your house burn down behind you  
Run with me through the streets again  
  
Let's get back, I wanna go back  
Let's get back, let's get back  
  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
Let's get back to the elements of style  
Let's get back to where it all began  
Let's get back to the fundamental things  
  
You can hide out on your rooftop  
Wishing you had never been  
Or go down to Hal's Bar and Grill  
And find your innocence again  
  
Let's get back, let's get back  
Let's get back, I wanna go back  
I've got to go back
