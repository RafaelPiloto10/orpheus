Through the dust bowl  
Through the debt  
Grandma was a suffragette  
Blacklisted for her publication  
Blacklisted for my generation  
Go go go  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside  
This time  
Don't assume anything  
Just go go go  
  
Feed the fire  
And fan the flame  
I know you kids can stand the rain  
I know the kids are still upsetters  
'cause rock is cool but the struggle is better  
Go go go  
  
And raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside  
This time  
Don't assume anything  
I said this time  
Now don't assume anything  
Just go  
  
The truth is I was afraid  
I felt inferior  
I felt I excelled in competing with others and I knew instantly that these
people were not competing at all, that they were acting in a strange, powerful
trance of movement together  
And I was filled with longing to act with them and with the fear that I could
not  
  
Did they tell you it was set it stone  
That you'd end up alone  
Use your years to psyche you out  
You're too old to care  
You're too young to count  
  
Did they tell you, you would come undone  
When you try to touch the sun  
Undermine the underground  
You're too old to care  
You're too young to count  
  
I said go go go  
  
I said this time  
Don't assume anything  
Just go go go  
Go go go  
Go go go
