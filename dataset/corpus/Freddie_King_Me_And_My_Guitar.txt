When my baby leaves me, there is nothing I can do  
I pick up my guitar and then I play a little blues or two  
Now, a man needs some loving, I ain't different from the rest  
My baby, when she leaves me, ah, my whole life is in a mess  
  
Just me and my guitar  
I play the blues for you, babe  
No matter where you are  
  
I like to start out easy, just to get that feel  
When I fell me strange, you know I make it for real  
Then I put some hots on it and I play a time or two  
And love you, baby, and I don't care what you do  
  
Babe, ah, me and my guitar  
I play the blues for you, babe  
No matter where you are, alright?  
  
Listen to me  
Satisfaction don't come easy, you got to get in to make it good  
The way I make my guitar singing, just let my woman should  
She never talk right to me like some woman do  
I feel so sad and lonesome when I play this lowdown blues  
  
Hey, hey, me and my guitar  
I play the blues for you, babe  
No matter where you are, alright?  
  
Hey, baby, hey, baby, just me and my guitar  
I play the blues for me, baby  
No matter where you are
