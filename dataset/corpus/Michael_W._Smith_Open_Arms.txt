Many people in the steeple  
But no one leaves the walls  
Quick to stand and speak all of their beliefs  
Quick to leave you if you fall  
  
Tell me where's the love  
It knows no boundaries  
Tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah  
Open arms, we need to be open arms  
  
Never judge You, always loving  
Needs to be what we become  
Lifting up the lost, showing them the cross  
Shining brightly like the sun  
  
Tell me where's the love  
It knows no boundaries  
Tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah  
Open arms, we need to be open arms, yeah  
  
Tell me where's the love  
It knows no boundaries  
Tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah  
Open arms, we need to be open arms, oh yeah  
And everybody sing  
  
Open arms, we need to be open arms  
And the whole world sing  
Open arms, we need to be open arms
