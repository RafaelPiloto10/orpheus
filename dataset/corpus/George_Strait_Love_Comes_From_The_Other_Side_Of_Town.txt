When things get bad at home, you don't feel like being alone,  
And you find yourself inclined to look around.  
For the feelings we once shared are just no longer there,  
And love comes from the other side of town.  
  
Where love means just an hour with your stand in,  
And not an empty house where love just has been.  
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,  
Now love comes from the other side of town.  
  
The life I'm livin' now just don't seem right somehow,  
But it's the best way to get by that I've found.  
There's no love left at home, we're both just hangin' on,  
And love comes from the other side of town.  
  
Where love means just an hour with your stand in,  
And not an empty house where love just has been.  
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,  
Now love comes from the other side of town.  
  
Love comes from the other side of town
