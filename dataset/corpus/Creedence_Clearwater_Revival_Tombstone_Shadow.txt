Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
Ev'ry time I get some good news, ooh,  
There's a shadow on my back.  
  
Saw the gypsy man, 'way down in san berdoo.  
Said, I saw the gypsy man, 'way down in san berdoo.  
Five dollars on the table, ooh,  
Keep me 'way from my tomb.  
Oh! oh!  
  
Said I got thirteen months of bad luck,  
Bound to be some pain.  
Don't you do no trav'lin',  
Fly in no machines.  
Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
  
Every time I get some good news, ooh,  
There's a shadow on my back.  
  
The man gave me a luck charm, cost five dollars more,  
Said, "put some on your pillow, and put some on your door."  
He said, "take a long vacation, ooh,  
For thirteen months or more."  
Oh, lord!  
  
Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
Tombstone shadow, stretchin' across my path.  
Every time I get some good news, ooh,  
There's a shadow on my back.  
  
Oh, oh, lord!  
Oh, lord!
