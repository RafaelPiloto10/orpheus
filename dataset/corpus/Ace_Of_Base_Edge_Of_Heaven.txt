Fire! I can see it burning so brightly  
Fire! I can feel it calling out to me  
And as the sun goes down  
It starts to paint a picture  
  
Of an ancient town  
So far away, across the endless sea  
Lead me to the light  
And take me to the edge of heaven  
  
I'm standing in the night  
Looking for the edge of heaven  
We'll be touching the edge of heaven  
Time  
  
Close your eyes see dreams of tomorrow  
Time  
The wheels are turning till eternity  
And as the darkness comes  
  
I start to see a picture  
Of a lonely man  
So clearly now reaching out for me  
Lead me to the light  
  
And sail the endless sea  
So lead me to the light  
And take me to the edge of heaven  
The edge of heaven is near  
  
We'll sail the endless sea
