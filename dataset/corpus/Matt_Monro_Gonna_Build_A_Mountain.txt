Gonna build a mountain From a little hill  
Gonna build a mountain Least I hope I will  
Gonna build a mountain Gonna build it high  
I don't know how I'm gonna do it I only know I'm gonna try  
Gonna build a daydream From a little hope  
Gonna push that daydream Up the mountain slope  
Gonna build a daydream Gonna see it through  
Gonna build a mountain and a daydream  
Gonna make 'em both come true  
Gonna build a heaven From a little hell  
Gonna build a heaven And I know darned well  
If I build my mountain With a lot of care  
And take my daydream up the mountain Heaven will be  
  
Waiting there  
Gonna build a mountain From a little hell  
Gonna build a heaven And I know darned well  
With a fine young son Who will take my place  
There'll be a sun in my heaven on earth with the lord's good grace  
When I build that heaven As I will some day  
Gonna build a new life Throw the old away  
You and I together Gonna make life swing  
We'll fill tomorrow full of happiness  
Gonna make the whole world swing  
We'll fill tomorrow full of happiness  
Gonna make the whole world swing  
We'll fill tomorrow full of happiness  
Make the whole world swing
