I tried to tell you  
But the words always came out wrong  
You never knew it  
But I loved you all along  
Are we two worlds in collision  
Maybe it's time for you to listen to my  
  
[Chorus:]  
True confessions  
My love, I'm givin' you  
My true confessions  
Show love when you hear my  
True confessions  
  
Never meant to hurt you  
I was lonely and she was so kind  
One stolen moment  
That I can't get off my mind  
Let's end this silent suspicion  
Baby it's time for you to listen to my  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
No more hiding the rage  
Gotta let it out of this cage  
So won't you show me you care  
Ooh baby, won't you share
