Well there's a color picture  
In my mind.  
Of all the places  
That I've left behind.  
The broken windows  
Where the wind blows through  
Empty shells of houses  
That have turned to ruin.  
  
Oh, we were so young.  
We didn't realise  
Just what we'd done.  
Oh, we were too young.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I remember you.  
You were the back yard boy.  
Hiding in the wreckage  
Of broken dreams.  
Standing by the railway line.  
Standing.  
  
Oh, we were so young.  
We didn't realise  
Just what we'd done.  
Oh, we were too young.  
  
And all the sweetness  
Has been taken out of this place.  
So many memories  
Are knocked down or replaced.  
And I can't stand to see  
The shifting time  
Taking me further,  
Leaving you behind.  
  
[Chorus]
