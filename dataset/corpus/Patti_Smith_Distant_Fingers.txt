When, when will you be landing?  
When, when will you return?  
Feel, feel my heart expanding  
You and your alien arms  
  
All my earthly dreams are shattered,  
I'm so tired I quit  
Take me forever, it doesn't matter  
Deep inside of your ship.  
  
La, la la la la la landing.  
Please, oh oh won't you return?  
Feel, see your blue lights are flashing,  
You and your alien arms  
  
Deep in the forest I whirl like I did as a little girl  
Let my eyes rise in the sky looking for you  
Oh you know, I would go anywhere at all  
'cause no star is too far with you, with you  
  
La, la la la la la landing.  
Please, oh oh won't you return?  
Feel, feel my heart expanding,  
You and your alien arms  
  
All my earthly dreams are shattered,  
I'm so tired I quit  
Take me forever, it doesn't matter  
Deep inside of your ship  
Land, land  
  
Oh I am waiting for you,  
Oh I am waiting for you, oh I am waiting for you,  
Waiting for you to take me up by my starry spine  
Ohhhh ohhhh with your distant fingers  
Oh I'm waiting for you, waiting for you,  
Oh I am waiting for you
