Little child of mine  
You'll be lovin' like your little mother did  
Heard it somewhere before  
I won't leave you no not like my father did  
  
Heavy country blues keep a rockin'  
K-k-k-keep that soul beat a-sockin'  
Heavy country blues keep a rockin'  
K-k-k-keep that soul beat a-sockin'  
  
I miss you again  
I let the sunlight through my eyes  
I won't cry  
I miss you again  
I let the sunlight through my eyes  
I won't cry

I won't cry

I won't cry

I let the sunlight through my eyes  
I won't cry
