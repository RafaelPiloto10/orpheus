I, I saw a girl in my dreams  
And so it seems  
That I will love her  
Oh you, you are that girl  
In my dreams  
And so it seems  
That I will love you  
  
And I waited for your kiss  
Waited for the bliss  
Like dreamers do  
  
And I, I, I, I  
Oh I'll be there, yeah  
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you  
You, you came just one dream ago  
And now I know that I will love you  
I knew when you first said hello  
That's how I know  
That I will love you  
  
And I, I, I waited for your kiss  
Waited for the bliss  
Like dreamers do  
  
And I, I, I, I  
Oh I'll be there, yeah  
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you  
You, you came just one dream ago  
And now I know that I will love you  
Oh I knew when you first said hello  
That's how I know  
That I will love you  
  
And I waited for your kiss  
Waited for the bliss  
Like dreamers do  
Oh, like dreamers do  
Like dreamers do
