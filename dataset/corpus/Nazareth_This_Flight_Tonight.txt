Look out the left the captain said  
The lights down there that's where we'll land  
Saw a falling star burning  
High above the Las Vegas sand  
  
It wasn't the one that you gave to me  
That night down south between the trailers  
Not the early one that you wish upon  
Not the northern one that guides in the sailors  
  
You've got that touch so gentle and sweet  
But you've got that look so critical  
Can't talk to you babe you know I get so weak  
Sometimes I think that love is just mythical  
  
Up there's a heaven, down there's a town  
Blackness everywhere any little lights shine  
Blackness, blackness draggin' me down  
Come on light a candle in this heart of mine  
  
Star bright, star bright, you've got the lovin' that I like  
Turn this crazy bird around  
Should not have got on this flight tonight  
  
I'm drinkin' sweet champagne got the headphones up high  
Can't numb you, can't drum you out of my mind  
  
They're singin' "Goodbye baby,  
Baby bye-bye,  
Ooh! love is blind"  
  
Up go the flaps,down go the wheels  
Hope you got your heat turned on baby  
Hope they've finally fixed your automobile  
Hope it's better when we meet again babe
