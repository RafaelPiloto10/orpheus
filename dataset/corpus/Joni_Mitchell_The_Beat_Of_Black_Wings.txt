I met a young soldier  
He said his name was Killer Kyle  
He was shakin' all over  
Like a night-frightened child  
This is his story  
It's a tough one for me to sing  
Hard as the squawk and the flap  
And the beat of, the beat of black wings  
  
"They gave me a gun," he said  
"They gave me a mission  
For the power and the glory,  
Propaganda, piss on 'em  
There's a war zone inside me,  
I can feel things exploding,  
I can't even hear the fucking music playing  
For the beat of, the beat of black wings."  
  
He said, "I never had nothin',  
Nothin' I could believe in  
My girl killed our unborn child  
Without even grievin'!  
I put my hands on her belly  
To feel the kid kickin', damn!  
She'd been to some clinic  
Oh, the beat of black wings."  
  
"They want you, they need you,  
They train you to kill,  
To be a pin on some map,  
Some vicarious thrill,  
The old hate the young  
That's the whole heartless thing  
The old pick the wars  
We die in 'em  
To the beat of, the beat of black wings."  
  
There's a man drawing pictures  
On the sidewalk with chalk  
Just as fast as he draws 'em  
Rain come down and wash 'em off  
"Keep the drinks comin' girl  
'Til I can't feel anything  
I'm just a chalk mark in a rainstorm  
I'm just the beat of black wings."
