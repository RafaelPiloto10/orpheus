Well I feel so good I don't know what to do  
Yeah I feel so good I don't know what to do  
Well I feel so good I feel like I wanna play with you  
  
I feel so good I feel like banging my box  
I feel so good I feel like banging my box  
Well if I had me one more shot I believe I'd blow my natural top  
  
Oh yeah! (x8)  
  
Well I feel so good  
  
I'm so glad I know what's on your mind  
I'm so glad I know what's on your mind  
I'm so glad I know what's on your mind  
I'm so glad I know what's on your mind  
I'm so glad, glad, glad, glad, glad I know what's on your mind  
  
Alright now!  
  
Oh yeah! (x8)  
  
Well I feel so good
