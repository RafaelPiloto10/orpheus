O-we-o-o  
Six to go  
O-we-o-o  
Never gonna let go  
O-we-o-o  
Nothing new  
O-we-o-o  
Don't believe it's true  
O-we-o-o  
On a Sunday  
O-we-o-o  
All because of London  
O-we-o-o  
Hear the song  
O-we-o-o  
Right the wrong  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
Set a precedent  
O-we-o-o  
Try a little bit  
O-we-o-o  
Make a family  
O-we-o-o  
Set our fathers free  
O-we-o-o  
Hear the song  
O-we-o-o  
Right the wrong  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o  
O-we-o-o
