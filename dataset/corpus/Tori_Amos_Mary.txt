Everybody wants something from you  
Everybody want a piece of Mary  
Lush valley all dressed in green  
Just ripe for the picking  
  
God I want to get you out of here  
You can ride in a pink Mustang  
When I think of what we've done to you  
Mary can you hear me  
  
Growing up isn't always fun  
They tore your dress and stole your ribbons  
They see you cry they lick their lips  
Well butterflies don't belong in nets  
  
Mary can you hear me  
Mary you're bleeding, Mary don't be afraid  
We're just waking up and I hear help is on the way  
Mary can you hear me  
Mary, like Jimmy said, Mary don't be afraid  
"cause even the wind even the wind cries your name"  
  
Everybody wants you sweetheart  
Everybody got a dream of glory  
Las Vegas got a pinup girl  
They got her armed as they buy and sell her  
Rivers of milk running dry  
Can't you hear the dolphins crying  
What'll we do when our babies scream  
Fill their mouths with some acid rain  
  
Mary can you hear me  
Mary you're bleeding, Mary don't be afraid  
We're just waking up and I hear help is on the way  
Mary can you hear me  
Mary, like Jimmy said, Mary don't be afraid  
"cause even the wind even the wind cries your name"
