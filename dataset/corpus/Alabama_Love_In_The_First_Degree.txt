I once thought of love as a prison  
a place I didn't want to be  
So long ago, I made a decision  
to be footloose and fancy-free  
  
But you came and I was so tempted  
to gamble on love just one time  
I never thought, that I would get caught  
It seemed like the perfect crime  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby you left me defense-less  
I've only got one plea  
Lock me away, inside of your love  
and throw away the key  
I'm guilty...of love in the first degree  
  
I thought it would be so simple  
like a thousand times before  
I'd take what I wanted, and just walk away  
but I never made it to the door  
  
Now babe I'm not beggin' for mercy  
go ahead and throw the book at me  
If lovin' you's a crime  
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love in the first degree (oh-oh yeah)  
Love in the first degree  
Oh Yeeeaaaah!  
  
[Chorus]
