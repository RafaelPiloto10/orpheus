I'm lyin' to myself, cryin' to myself,  
Tryin' to make believe my baby's on the shelf  
But it's more than I can do  
Tryin' to find a way to bluff it through  
  
I miss my lovin' an' kissin'  
When I hear the radio playin' "I Love You So"  
That's the time, you know, I start to feel like ten below.  
I'm lyin' to myself,  
  
Tryin' to chase the blues away.  
Just because of foolish pride I tried to hide  
All feeling's for Cupid's art.  
And though I've cried out loud that two's a crowd  
  
That don't convince my heart.  
When I think of my sweet pet and the places we met  
I tell myself I'm not a doggone bit upset  
But I'm lyin' to myself,  
Tryin' to chase the blues away.
