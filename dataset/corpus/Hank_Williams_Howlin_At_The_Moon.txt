I know there's never been a man in the awful shape I'm in  
I can't even spell my name, my head's in such a spin  
Today I tried to eat a steak with a big old tablespoon  
You got me chasin' Rabbits, walkin' on my hands and howlin' at the moon.  
  
Well Sug, I took one look at you and it almost drove me mad  
And then I even went and lost what little sense I had  
Now I can't tell the day from night, I'm crazy as a loon  
You got me chasin' Rabbits, pullin' out my hair and howlin' at the moon.  
  
Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin' spree  
'Cause there ain't a hound dog in this state that can hold a light to me  
I eat three bones for dinner today, then tried to tree a 'coon  
You got me chasin' Rabbits, scratchin' fleas and howlin' at the moon.  
  
I rode my horse to town to day and a gas pump we did pass  
I pulled 'I'm up and I hollered WHOA!, said fill 'I'm up with gas  
The man picked up a monkey wrench and WHAM! he changed my tune  
You got me chasin' Rabbits, spittin' out teeth and howlin' at the moon.  
  
I never thought in this old world a fool could fall so hard  
But honey baby, when I fell the whole world must have jarred  
I think I'd quit my doggish ways if you'd take me for your groom  
You got me chasin' rabbits, pickin' out rings and howlin' at the moon.
