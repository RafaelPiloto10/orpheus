Trick or treat  
Trick or treat, baby, on a night like this,  
Trick or treat, wo, wo, an d that means a kiss.  
Trick or treat, baby, and don't let me miss  
A sweet kiss from you on a night like this.  
Trick or treat, baby, by the light of the moon,  
Trick or treat, wo, wo, don't leave me so soon.  
Trick or treat, baby, I go in a swoon  
From the sweet way you kiss me by the light of the moon.  
Trick or treat, baby, oh, what a night,  
Trick or treat, wo, wo, what a sweet delight.  
Trick or treat, baby, and hold me tight,  
And keep kissin' me sweetly, oh, what a night.  
Trick or treat, baby, in your own sweet way,  
Trick or treat, wo, wo, anything you say.  
Trick or treat, wo, wo, wo, wo,  
I just love for you to kiss me in your own sweet way.
