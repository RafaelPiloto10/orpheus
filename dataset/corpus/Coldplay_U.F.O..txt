Lord I don't know which way I am going  
Which way, the river gonna flow  
It's just seems that upstream, I keep rolling  
Still got such a long way to go  
Still got such a long way to go  
  
Then at last, it's your right, I know, I swear  
We'll find somewhere the streets are paved with gold  
But it's fly, split the sky  
But that's all right, sometimes  
The sunlight comes streaming through the holes.
