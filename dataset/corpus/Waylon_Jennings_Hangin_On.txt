It's true you have me twisted round your finger and it seems that's where I
belong  
You know how to hold me to thrill me and control me  
Just enough to keep me hangin' on  
For now tomorrow and forever I guess I'm tied to you right or wrong  
My love keeps a growing cause your love keeps a showing  
  
Just enough to keep me hangin' on  
A love that's strong as mine will make me do most anything  
Like hiding tears and heartaches and dreaming silly dreams  
You've got me where you want me you keep stringing me along  
Just enough to keep me hangin' on just enough to keep me hangin' on
