Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walkin'  
Down the stairway to the subway in the shadows down below  
Following their footsteps through the neon darkened coridors  
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul  
  
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'  
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain  
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes  
Of the clickin' of the turnstile and the rattle of his chains  
  
"Oh", she said "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"  
"Here" she said, "Just a kiss to make a body smile"  
"See" she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you"  
"Lord" she said, "Casey can you only stay awhile"  
  
Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown  
For somethin' wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones  
See'ing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men  
Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home  
  
Standing in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter,  
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by  
Then he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason  
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye  
  
"Oh" she said, "I suppose you seldom think about me"  
"Now" she said, "Now that you've a family of your own"  
"Still" she said, "It's so blessed good to feel your body"  
"Lord" she said, "Casey, it's a shame to be alone"  
  
"Oh" she said, "Casey, it's been so long since I've seen you"  
"Here" she said "Just a kiss to make a body smile"  
"See" she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you"  
"Lord" she said, "Casey, can you only stay a while"  
"Lord" she said, "Casey it's a shame to be alone"
