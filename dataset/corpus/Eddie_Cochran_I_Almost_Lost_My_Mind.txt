Well when I lost my baby  
I almost lost my mind  
Well when I lost my baby  
I almost lost my mind  
Oh well my head is in a spin  
Since she left me behind  
Oh well I passed a billion people  
Can't tell who I meet  
Oh well I passed a billion people  
Well I can't tell who I meet  
'Cause my eyes are full of tears  
Where can my baby be  
  
Oh well I went to see a gipsy  
Oh well I had my fortune read  
Oh well I went to see a gipsy  
And had my fortune read  
Oh well I hung my head in sorrow  
When she said what she said  
Oh well I can tell you people  
The news was not so good  
Oh well I can tell you people  
The news was not so good  
Well she said you're baby's quitin'  
This time she's gone for good
