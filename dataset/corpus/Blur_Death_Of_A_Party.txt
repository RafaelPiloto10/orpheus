The death of the party  
Came as no surprise  
Why did we bother?  
Should have stayed away  
Another night  
And I thought "Well, well"  
Go to another party and hang myself  
Gently on the shelf  
The death of the teenager  
Standing on his own  
Why did he bother?  
Should have slept alone  
Another night  
And I thought "Well, well"  
Go to another party and hang myself  
Gently on the shelf  
Another night  
And I thought "Well, well"  
Go to another party and hang myself  
Gently on the shelf
