(M. Greaves)  
  
You should be a singer  
I swear it's true  
No-one could make them  
Cry like you  
Billie Holliday would pale beside you  
Cos you sure got a way with the blues  
  
See you around, dressed to thrill  
Smile for me baby  
If looks could kill  
I bet your boyfriends don't have a clue  
That you've sure got a way with the blues  
  
Here I am  
With my souvenirs  
Standing in the wreckage of eight sweet years  
I bet everything in your life must be brand new  
Cos you've sure got a way with the blues  
  
You should be a singer  
I swear it's true  
No-one could make them cry like you  
Billie Holliday, Patsy Kline too  
I bet even Bessie Smith would pale beside you  
Cos you've sure got a way with the blues  
Oooh, with the blues
