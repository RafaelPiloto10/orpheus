Woke up this morning  
Put on my slippers  
Walked in the kitchen  
And died  
  
And oh, what a feeling!  
When my soul  
Went through the ceiling  
And on up into heaven, I did ride  
  
When I got there, they did say  
"John, it happened this way  
You slipped upon the floor  
And hit your head"  
  
And all the angels say  
"Just before you passed away  
That these were the very last words  
That you said"  
  
"Please don't bury me  
Down in that cold, cold ground  
No, I?d rather have 'em cut me up  
And pass me all around"  
  
"Throw my brain in a hurricane  
And the blind can have my eyes  
And the deaf can take both of my ears  
If they don't mind the size"  
  
"Give my stomach to Milwaukee  
If they run out of beer  
Put my socks in a cedar box  
Just to get 'em out of here"  
  
"Venus De Milo can have my arms  
Look out! I've got your nose  
Sell my heart to the junk man  
And give my love to Rose"  
  
"But please don't bury me  
Down in that cold, cold ground  
I?d rather have 'em cut me up  
And pass me all around"  
  
"Throw my brain in a hurricane  
The blind can have my eyes  
And the deaf can take both of my ears  
If they don't mind the size, oh man!"  
  
"Give my feet to the footloose  
Careless, fancy free  
And give my knees to the needy  
Don't pull that stuff on me"  
  
"Hand me down my walking cane  
It?s a sin to tell a lie  
Send my mouth way down south  
And kiss my ass goodbye"  
  
"But, please don't bury me  
Down in that cold, cold ground  
I?d rather have 'em cut me up  
And pass me all around"  
  
"Throw my brain in a hurricane  
And the blind can have my eyes  
And the deaf can take both of my ears  
If they don't mind the size, that's right"
