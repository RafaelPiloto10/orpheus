I could say what I mean  
(or I could dance around it)  
It would feel good to scream  
(I should quiet down)  
I could be recognized  
(or I could stay in bed)  
Look the world in the eyes  
(or just hang my head)  
  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown  
Knowing I'll lose it if I look down  
  
When my ship has come in  
(when it runs aground)  
I'll be smiling again  
(turn those corners down)  
I've got something to say  
(no one's listening)  
It's my reckoning day  
(so where's the reckoning?)  
  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown  
Knowing I'll lose it if I look down  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown  
  
My prodigy and my idiot play  
For the prize of my delicate line  
Somehow the score at the end of  
The day is still 51-49  
  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown  
Knowing I'll lose it if I look down  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown
