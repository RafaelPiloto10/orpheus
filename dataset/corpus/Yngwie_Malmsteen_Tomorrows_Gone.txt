In a dark and deserted land  
Lives a race of forgotten man  
With a will never seen before  
Do we dare to unlock the door  
  
In his world there's so much to fear  
And all the pain that he's made to bare  
One desire, that's his will to live  
  
Not destroy, but to give  
  
He's been lost for so many years  
By his choice, he has disappeared  
From a world that is closing in  
As the end of this race begins  
  
All he wants is to be left free  
No other land does he want to see  
In his heart he knows it won't be long  
He won't give up, he must stay strong  
  
As he tries to hide, from the madness  
There's no hope in hell, for tomorrow won't live on  
  
What is gone, may never have been  
Another world, now he's fallen in  
All his dreams, how they've disappeared  
Now he lives, all he feared  
  
He only wanted to be left free  
This other land that he's forced to see  
In his mind, his will always be  
A place that he'll never leave  
  
As he tries to hide, from the madness  
There's no hope in hell, it's gone  
Tomorrow won't live on ...
