[Jesse to Self]  
  
There's place where I'm  
Oh - with sorrowed lives  
And all the souls  
Oh - they're wishing they could die  
  
Take me down  
And drown this the orphan forever  
Ya know I do  
Wish away the pain  
And wash away my life  
Find me down inside a shallow pool  
Down a wishing well  
No more bleeding  
No more screaming tonight  
  
Wash away my pain  
Oh - in the well of sighs  
For I have no face - oh  
Abandoned for all, for all time  
  
[Jesse thinking of his mother]  
  
Why, why am I nothing?  
Oh mamma why, why'd you leave me  
A throw away for life  
Oh - oh why, why am I nothing  
Oh and mamma why  
Can you feel me there  
Oh God I want to die
