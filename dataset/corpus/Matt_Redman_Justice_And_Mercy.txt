You've put a new song in my mouth  
It is a hymn of praise to You  
Justice and mercy are it's theme  
And I will live it back to You  
  
The kind of fast You've chosen, Lord It must reach out  
To broken lives and to the poor So change me, Lord  
  
I know You are the orphan's hope  
I know You are the widow's song  
O Lord, You're showing me what's on You're heart  
  
Lord, I wont bring an empty song It's meaningless  
Without compassion in my life And holiness  
  
You're Father were no father lives  
And to the lonely You're a friend  
O Lord, You're showing me what's on You're heart  
  
I know You are the orphan's hope  
I know You are the widow's song  
You're Father were no father lives  
And to the lonely You're a friend  
O Lord, You're showing me what's on You're heart
