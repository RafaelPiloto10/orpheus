I'm Gonna Get You  
I'm Gonna  
Buy You A Little Horse  
You Can Ride  
You Can Play All Day  
My Little Child  
We're Gonna Go  
Out The Fields Tonight  
You'll Be Brave  
You'll Be Strong One Day  
  
Chorus:  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Can't You See It In My Face  
  
And Now I See I'm Not  
The Girl I Used To Be  
Times Have Changed  
Where's The Mercy  
And Grace  
More And More There's No  
Light Inside Of Me  
All The Pain All The Strain  
Is Killing Me  
  
Chorus:  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Don't't Walk Away  
From My Face  
  
Another Storm  
My Shoes Are Worn  
It's All Too Much  
It's All Too Long  
I Close My Eyes  
Until The Morn  
And Hope It All  
Just Goes Away  
  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Don't't Walk  
Away From My Face  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Where's The Mercy  
And Grace
