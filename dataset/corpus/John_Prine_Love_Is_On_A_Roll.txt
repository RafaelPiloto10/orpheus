I can't work late  
Although I need the money  
Gotta get home to my lovin' honey  
She'll be there waitin'  
Waitin' impatiently  
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll  
  
Ah, love is on a roll  
Ah, love is on a good roll  
  
I'm a songwriter  
A professional dreamer  
Mostly a singer but sometimes a screamer  
I should know  
If anybody knows at all  
When love is on a roll, love is on a good roll  
  
So I gotta go. I gotta get home early  
Be with my woman soft and curvy  
Makes me feel like a king and not a regular joe  
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll  
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
