Whoa, whoa, ohhhhh, whoa, oh  
  
You can only push someone so far  
You can only break so many hearts  
We used to be love one another  
Now it's lust for your lover  
Baby, I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
Yeah  
  
Chorus:  
You can only wait  
You can only wait so long  
You can only wait  
You can only wait so long  
In this game we play  
Can't tell right from wrong  
You can only wait so long  
  
Here come the memories of yesterday  
Here's the poetry  
Of all those things I couldn't even say  
You can only wait so long  
Before your flower petals are all gone  
Baby, I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
Ain't nobody crying for what used to be home  
Yeah  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
Ohhh  
  
Why couldn't you hold on to me?  
I was right here  
Laying in our bed  
Said, ohh  
All those things I didn't see  
All those things I never should of said  
  
You can only push someone so far  
You can only break so many hearts  
You can only wait so long  
Before your flower petals are all gone  
Baby, I was trying to burn bridges of stone.  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
Whoa, Whoa  
  
Why couldn't you call out for me  
It's not like I was ever far away  
Said, ohhh  
Tie me to the edge and start to leap  
There's nothing left here  
But a million words to say  
  
We all have memories  
And I have spent my time in vain  
Here's to our enemies  
And I will leave you with no pain  
We will find a way somehow  
In this running just to know goodbye  
Baby, I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
You won't find me crying for what used to be home  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
In this game we play  
We can't tell right from wrong  
Cause you can only wait so long  
In this game we play  
We can't tell right from wrong  
Cause you can only wait so long
