If every lover that you'd ever known  
Could turn around would you take one  
Or would you really rather be alone  
And full of wrath and when you might please  
Well I don't know babe if you ever have been told  
But you're a tough one to play for  
I tried to be what you were looking for  
Now I'm not sure if you ever really knew  
  
You know the world won't wait, babe you're crying too late  
And you're drinking on borrowed time  
And the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
I guess that the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
  
You sit around sticking pins in dolls  
What's there to fall down and die for?  
You're looking fine baby it's well known  
Why does your story have to be so short?  
Well pretty soon babe you're gonna show your age  
'Cause you're drinking on borrowed time  
And then the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
I guess the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
  
You know the world won't wait, babe you're crying too late  
You're drinking on borrowed time  
And the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
Yeah I guess that the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
Me and my weeping wine  
Me any my weeping wine
