Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe  
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe  
  
Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe  
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe  
  
And then here we are (here we are), in this big old empty room  
Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?  
Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it  
The only place to go is all the way  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh babe, Is that alright? Is that okay?  
Girl no need to be nervous,  
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,  
Just go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
Go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
  
Clothes are not required, for what we got planned  
Ooh, girl your my desire, your wish is my command  
Treat you like a princess, ooh girl your so delicious  
Like ice cream on a sunny day, gonna eat you before you melt away, yeah  
  
Oh babe, Is that alright? Is that okay?  
Girl no need to be nervous, no, no, no,  
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,  
Just go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
Go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
  
Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe  
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe  
  
Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe  
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe  
  
Just go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
Go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time
