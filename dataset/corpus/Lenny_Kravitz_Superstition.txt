Very superstitious  
Writing's on the wall  
Very superstitious  
Ladder's about to fall  
Thirteen-month-old baby  
Broke the looking glass  
Seven years of bad luck  
Good things in your past  
  
If you believe in things that you don't understand  
Then you suffer  
Superstition ain't the way  
  
Very superstitious  
Wash your face and hands  
Rid me of the problems  
Do all that you can  
Keep me in a daydream  
Keep me going strong  
You don't want to save me  
Sad is my song  
  
If you believe in things that you don't understand  
Then you suffer  
Superstition ain't the way  
  
Very superstitious  
Nothing more to say  
Very superstitious  
Devil's on his way  
Thirteen-month-old baby  
Broke the looking glass  
Seven years of bad luck  
Good things in your past  
  
If you believe in things that you don't understand  
Then you suffer  
Superstition ain't the way  
  
Superstition ain't the way...  
Superstition ain't the way...
