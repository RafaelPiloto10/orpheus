I look out the window every day, I see the world go by  
Watching I sit and wait for you  
Just hoping you'll catch my eye  
You see me stare but I don't care  
I like the way you smile  
One day I'll get to talk to you  
Ooh, right now well I'm too shy  
  
But in my world of make believe  
You're the one what I need, oh, oh...  
  
I could imagine me with you  
But it's an impossibility  
I'd love to try to realise, I gotta deal with reality  
But if you turn my way, I'd look away, ooh even face-to-face  
And deep inside me, inside my mind  
Someone else is trying to take my place  
  
But in my world of make believe  
You're the one what I need, oh, oh...  
Oh, come with me, I'll show you everything  
Come with me, ooh  
Come with me, I'll show you everything  
It could be, come along with me and let me take you there, oh, oh...  
  
I look out the window every day, I see the world go by  
Watching I sit and wait for you  
Ooh, just hoping that you'll walk by  
But if you turn my way, I'd look away, ooh even face-to-face  
And deep inside, ooh in my mind  
Someone else is trying to take my place  
  
In my world of make believe  
You're the one what I need, oh, oh...  
  
Come with me, ooh  
Come with me, I'll show you everything  
It could be, come along with me and let me take you there, oh, oh...  
  
All of my life, come with me, come with me, come with me...  
All of my life...  
I like the way you smile  
All of my life...
