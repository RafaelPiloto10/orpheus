Ah ah ah ah  
  
Some live for the bill  
Some kill for the bill  
She wined for the bill  
Grind for the bill  
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)  
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill  
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)  
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill  
  
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym  
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)  
High school she was  
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym  
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)  
Never thought she would come and work for the president  
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)  
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)  
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day  
All she wanna know is (where my money at?)  
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread  
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)  
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard  
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)  
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a tell you like you told me  
Cash rules everything around me  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
Causes I'm a tell you like you told me  
Cash rules everything around me  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
  
Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter  
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of  
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a thug  
For triple times the money and spending it how they wanna  
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind  
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines  
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind  
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line  
But I know there's a draught in the block  
You move slow  
You getting' pressure from cops  
you don't know not to lay low  
Because 25 to life is no joke  
To all my real gorillas thuggin'  
On top of corners every day strugglin'  
All the beautiful women getting' money  
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Money, money-money-money  
Money, money-money-money  
It drives the world crazy  
  
She used to be  
  
She used to be the sweetest girl  
She used to be the sweetest girl ever  
Now she like sour Amaretto  
She wears a dress to the T like the letter  
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather  
She used to run track back in high school  
Now she tricks on the track right by school  
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose  
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used  
And then she runs to the pastor  
And he tells her there will be a new chapter  
But she feels no different after  
And then she asks him  
Where my money at?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some live for the bill  
Some kill for the bill  
(Yeah, where my money at?)  
She wined for the bill  
Grind for the bill  
(Whoa, where my money at?)  
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill  
(Yeah, where my money at?)  
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill  
(Whoa) Where my money at?
