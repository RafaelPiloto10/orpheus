Last night I saw a movie  
And I thought about many movies I've seen at your house  
Excuse me if I'm rude  
But I'd rather that we just strike from the record ones I'd see again without
you  
Leaning on my shoulder  
Distracting me from the plot line  
  
Where can I go when I want you around  
But I' can't stand to be around you  
"Go home"  
I'll walk myself to you  
I'll walk myself away from here  
  
"Go to hell" is all I thought for seven weeks  
But I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people  
Looking glossed just like a summer ago  
  
Where can I go when I want you around  
But I can't stand to be around you  
"Go home"  
I'll walk myself to you  
I'll walk myself away from here  
  
"Call me back" I'm pleading with a cork in my head  
It wouldn't be the first time  
My pillow has been mistaken  
  
Where can I go when I want you around  
But I can't stand to be around you  
"Go home"  
I'll walk myself to you  
I'll walk myself away from here  
  
Can't stand to be around you  
Around you, around you  
Can't stand to be around you  
Can't stand, I can't stand  
To be around you  
Around you
