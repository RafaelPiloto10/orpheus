Pleasure's in my car  
Even in the bar as I'm searching  
In the love that's strong  
Breathing in the song, I'm learning  
(I am learning)  
Pleasure in the sand  
Warm within the hand she's holding  
It is on the screen  
Adventures at nineteen, I'm searching  
I am searching in my heart  
Pleasure in my heart  
Never let us part for pleasure  
Work,work today  
Never let them pay for pleasure  
Leave or lose her from my heart  
Pleasure is your name  
I accept he blame for falling  
It is down the phone  
Living in your home, I'm calling  
(I am calling)  
Pleasure is a word  
When love is left unheard,it's burning  
It is on the screen  
Adventures at nineteen, I'm searching  
I am searching in my heart.  
Why do you feel like breaking my heart?  
What made you feel like breaking my heart tonight?  
Now I am crying,now I am crying  
Pleasure in my heart  
Never let us part for pleasure  
Work,work today  
Never let them pay for pleasure  
Leave or lose her from my heart
