It is not a good day, if you are not looking good  
This is the best party that I've ever been to  
Today I asked for a god to pour some wine in my eyes  
Today I asked for someone to shake some salt on my life  
Look!  
Everything's spinning  
(We're on the ground)  
Never cheer before you know who's winning  
(Don't make a sound)  
  
Sniff the glass and let it roll around on your tongue  
Let me introduce you to someone before the party is done  
Someone to look to in need or in want or in war  
If you give him everything, he may give you even more  
  
This is the best party I've ever been to  
  
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
