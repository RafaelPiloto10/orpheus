Take these plastic people  
Read their lips, now let it linger  
Is there anything that makes them sound sincere?  
Tightly hold your hand  
Take a deep breath, give them the finger  
Are you worried  
That your thoughts are not quite clear?  
(Twitch)  
Overlooked, unfit appearance  
  
I remember falling  
I remember marching  
Like a one man army  
Through the blaze  
I know I'm coughing  
I believe in something  
I don't want to remember falling  
For your lies  
  
Unbutton your clothes  
Undress your soul, show them your vigor  
Are those inhibitions easiest to fear?  
Take this gasoline tin  
Head up high, walk like a winner  
Let the bare feet be the last sound that they hear  
  
(Twitch)  
Overlooked, unfit appearance  
  
I remember falling  
I remember marching  
Like a one man army  
Through the blaze  
I know I'm coughing  
I believe in something  
I don't want to remember falling  
For your lies  
  
Falling  
I remember falling  
I remember marching  
Like a one man army  
Through the blaze  
I know I'm coughing  
I believe in something  
I don't want to remember falling
