Looking up, again  
I'm coming back to life  
I'm coming back to life  
Looking up, to you  
If was really up to you  
You had to pull me through  
Looking up  
  
Looking up, a change is  
Coming over me  
I know now that I'm free  
Looking up, I find  
I'm walking tall and proud  
And happy all the time  
  
Looking up  
I'm looking up  
Looking up  
I see my troubles far behind  
Looking up  
(I'm looking up)  
Looking up  
I feel I'm rising to the top  
Looking up  
  
Looking up, a change is  
Coming over me  
I know now that I'm free  
Looking up, I find  
I'm walking tall and proud  
And happy all the time  
  
Looking up  
I'm looking up  
Looking up  
I see my troubles far behind  
Looking up  
(I'm looking up)  
Looking up  
I feel I'm rising to the top  
Looking up  
  
Someone that understands  
Is there until the end  
To hold the light for me  
The light that help me see  
And in my darkest hours  
Will come with sunny showers  
To help me to forget  
Oh I so glad we met  
And since that rainy day  
The clouds just stay away  
You chase them with your love  
The greatest love I've known  
'cause in the darkest hour  
You come with sunny showers  
My life is your today  
Don't ever go away  
  
Looking up  
I'm looking up  
I see my trouble far behind  
Looking up  
(I'm looking up)  
Looking up  
I feel I'm rising to the top...
