[Verse:]  
I can see Jesus, high and exalted  
My eyes are fixed upon His face  
It shines like the sun  
I can see Jesus, clothed in glory  
He is high and lifted up  
And His train fills the temple  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
And all of the angels cry Holy  
All the saints cry Holy  
All creation cries Holy  
Holy is the Lamb  
  
[Chorus:]  
All praise unto the Lamb Who sits on the throne  
Honor and power, dominion and praise  
Unto the Lamb  
Who was and is  
And is to come  
  
[Bridge:]  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
  
All Praise unto the Lamb Who sits on the throne  
Honor and power  
Dominion and praise  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah
