On your own,  
All alone and crying  
A wounded soul on an island in the blue  
Love's required  
But you're too tired from trying  
Don't Give Up  
There's love enough for you  
  
[Chorus]  
There's love enough for a broken heart  
Love enough for another start  
Love enough in the Father's arms for you  
When it feels like the tears won't end  
When loneliness is your only friend  
There's love enough  
Love enough for you  
On His own  
Allone and dying  
He gave up everything for me and you  
Hear your heart  
It's time to start relying  
On the one who had love enough for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Like a cup that's running over  
Like a well that won't run dry  
From the storm a constant cover  
For a heart, the sole supply  
Chorus (2X)  
Love enough for you  
Love enough, love enough  
Love enough for me  
Love enough for you
