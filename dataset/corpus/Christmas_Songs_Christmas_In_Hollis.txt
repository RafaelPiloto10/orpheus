It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark  
When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park  
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear  
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an illin' reindeer  
But then I was illin' because the man had a beard  
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared  
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone  
But he must have dropped his wallet smack down on the lawn  
  
I picket the wallet up then I took a pause  
Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus"  
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's  
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease  
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right  
So I was going home to mail it back to him that night  
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree  
Was a letter from Santa and the dough's for me  
  
It's Christmas time in Hollis Queens  
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens  
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese  
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees  
Decorate the house with lights at night  
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright  
In the fireplace is the yule log  
Beneath the mistle toe as we drink egg nog  
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's  
But each and every year we bust Chrsitmas carols  
  
Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it  
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit  
Jack Frost chillin, the orchids out  
And that's what Christmas is all about  
The time is now, the place is here  
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer  
  
My name's D. M. C. With the mic in my hand  
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman  
So open your eyes, lend us an ear  
We want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
