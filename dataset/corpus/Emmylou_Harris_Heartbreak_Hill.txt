Long long time ago when we were young  
You swore to me I would be the one  
I would be the one you loved  
But we had to part  
You asked me to wait for you  
To keep you in my heart  
To keep you in my heart  
  
Night after lonely night I'm waiting for you still  
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  
  
Now maybe I am the foolish kind to think of you so long  
Have you found another love  
Am I still the one  
Am I still the one for you  
But you're far away  
Do you ever dream of coming back to me someday  
Back to me someday  
  
Night after lonely night I'm waiting for you still  
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  
  
On heartbreak hill alone at night  
I think of how you held me tight  
And wonder if I ever will see you again  
On heartbreak hill  
  
Oh lord if I only could go back in time enough  
I'd hold you in my arms again  
Never let you go  
Never let you go my love  
And leave me far behind  
High upon this lonely hill were you swore to be mine  
You swore to be mine  
  
Night after lonely night I'm waiting for you still  
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  
Night after lonely night I'm waiting for you still  
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  
Here on heartbreak hill  
Here on heartbreak hill
