You are my hiding place  
You always fill my heart  
With songs of deliverance  
Whenever I am afraid  
I will trust in You  
I will trust in You  
Let the weak say I am strong  
In the strength of the Lord  
You are my hiding place  
You always fill my heart  
With songs of deliverance  
Whenever I am afraid  
I will trust in You  
I will trust in You  
Let the weak say I am strong  
In the strength of the Lord  
I will trust in You  
You are my hiding place  
You always fill my heart  
With songs of deliverance  
Whenever I am afraid  
I will trust in You  
I will trust in You  
Let the weak say I am strong  
In the strength of the Lord  
I will trust in You  
You are my hiding place  
(I will trust in You)  
You always fill my heart  
(Let the weak say I am strong)  
With songs of deliverance  
(In the strength of the Lord)  
Whenever I am afraid  
I will trust in You
