When you walked into the room,  
There was voodoo in the vibes.  
I was captured by your style,  
But I could not catch your eyes.  
Now I stand here helplessly,  
Hoping you'll get into me  
  
I am so into you  
I can't think of nothing else  
I am so into you  
I can't think of nothing else  
Thinking how it's going to be  
Whenever you get into me  
  
Its gonna be good, don't you know  
From your head to your toe  
Gonna love you all over  
Over and over  
I am so into you  
Me into you, you into me, me into you  
  
I am so into you  
I can't get to nothing else  
I am so into you  
I can't get to nothing else  
Thinking how it's going to be  
Whenever you get into me  
  
Cmon baby, drivin me crazy,  
Im so into you  
Love all the things you do.
