Enjoy it, enjoy it  
  
Never let life  
Get you down  
When your head is spinning  
Feet won't touch the ground  
For in this world  
The good time you can't plan  
You'd better take your chances while you can  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't wait 'til tomorrow  
When you should be living today  
Enjoy it, enjoy it  
Before too long it's too late  
Don't throw the good times away  
Enjoy it, enjoy it (repeat)  
  
Don't break up  
Inside  
When everything's too much  
Don't run and hide  
For nothing comes to those who will not try  
You may just as well have kissed  
Your dreams goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For nothing comes to those who hesitate  
Grab your dreams before it gets too late  
  
[Chorus until fade]
