Don't let me cross over  
Love's cheating line  
I'm tempted, my darling  
To steal you away  
Don't let me cross over  
Stay out of my way  
You know that I love you  
And I'm not the stealing kind  
But I'm faced with heartaches  
And love's cheating line  
Don't let me cross over  
Love's cheating line  
You belong to another  
And can never be mine  
I know one step closer  
Would be heaven divine  
Don't let me cross over  
Love's cheating line  
I've tried to forget you  
But what else can I do  
When your eyes keep saying  
That you love me too  
I know if I lose you  
Not a dream will be left  
I don't want to cheat dear  
But I can't help myself  
Don't let me cross over  
Love's cheating line  
You belong to another  
And can never be mine  
I know one step closer  
Would be heaven divine  
Don't let me cross over  
Love's cheating line
