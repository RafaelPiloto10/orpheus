You told me you'd always stay, you told me!  
You told me you'd never stray, you told me!  
All these things you said you said sincerely.  
Still I am leaving you in spite of what you told me.  
  
I've heard things that did not match what you told me.  
And of your love that would not last as you told me.  
Forwarned is forearmed, it hurts, I'm leaving.  
I may be wrong I can't love what I'm just hearing.  
  
Times have made me shy  
Of all the things you're saying  
Time have made me shy  
Of girls and all the games they are playing.  
  
Someday I may see the truth of what you told me.  
I may find I left too soon and that you told me.  
Only things that you were honestly feeling.  
I must have more to love than what you told me.  
  
Yes, I must have more to love than what you told me.  
Yes, I must have more to love than what you told me.
