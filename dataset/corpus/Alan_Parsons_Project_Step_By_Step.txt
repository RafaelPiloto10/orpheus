I was just a joker in a serious game  
I Didn't have the Heart to play  
But sooner or later  
I'll find a reason to throw it away  
Risin' on the crest of a natural wave  
That Never seems to break my way  
I'm livin' without it  
  
But I got to Do something about it  
Step by step little by little  
Step by step take it line by line  
Move move move, move a Little closer  
  
I was Just a runner in a one horse race  
Livin' on the don't pass line  
Sooner or later  
I Got to lose cause I'm wasting my time  
Lady luck must have been a wonderful girl  
She's never been a Friend of mine  
I'm living without her  
But I still got that mountain to climb  
  
Step by step little by little  
Step by step rake it line by line  
Move move move, move a little closer  
  
Step by step the Deal is mine
