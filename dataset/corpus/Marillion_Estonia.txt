Feeling you shake  
Feel your heart break  
Thinking if only, if only, if only, if only  
And the salt water runs  
Through your veins and your bones  
Telling you no not this way, not this way, not this way  
  
And you would give anything  
Give up everything  
Offer your life blood away  
For yesterday  
  
No one leaves you  
When you live in their heart and mind  
And no one dies  
They just move to the other side  
When we're gone  
Watch the world simply carry on  
We live on laughing and in no pain  
We'll stay and be happy  
With those who have loved us today  
  
Finding the answer  
It's a human obsession  
But you might as well talk to the stones and the trees and the sea  
'Cause nobody knows  
And so few can see  
There's only beauty and caring and truth beyond darkness  
  
No one leaves you  
When you live in their heart and mind  
And no one dies  
They just move to the other side  
When we're gone  
Watch the world simply carry on  
We live on laughing and in no pain  
We'll stay and be happy  
With those who have loved us today  
  
And we won't understand your grief  
Because time is illusion  
As this watery world spins around  
This timeless sun  
Will dry your eyes  
And calm your mind  
  
No one leaves you  
When you live in their heart and mind  
And no one dies  
They just move to the other side  
When we're gone  
Watch the world simply carry on  
It's okay, we will stay and be happy  
Stay and be happy  
With those who have loved us today
