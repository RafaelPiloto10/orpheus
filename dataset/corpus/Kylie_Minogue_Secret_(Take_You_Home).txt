Rushing up on you like a freak in the fast lane  
I'm on a mission to whip you into a hurricane  
And when I overtake I'm gonna be in pole position  
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Are you ready for the change  
  
If I let you stay, If I let you play  
Will you lose or win  
You can't kiss and tell  
Will you pass it or fail  
Let the games begin  
  
Here's my secret  
I'm a girl who likes her fun  
And if you can keep it  
Then you just might be the one  
To come and party baby  
But don't be misunderstood  
I'll be cool, would you be cool  
I wonder if I take you home  
  
Nature should explore the physical  
But don't confuse emotions with the pleasure principle  
Just let me take a ride  
And educate the corners of your mind  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
RAP:  
Buckle up baby feel my speed  
Take it from zero to sixty  
Driving so hot like a criminal  
The chase is irresistible  
Gonna twist you round and manipulate  
Watch you hyperventilate  
That's just the way I get my kicks  
So take it in baby, deal with it  
  
Here's my secret  
I'm a girl who likes her fun  
And if you can keep it  
Then you just might be the one  
To come and party baby  
But don't be misunderstood  
I'll be cool, would you be cool  
I wonder if I take you home  
  
Here's my secret  
You can keep it (keep it)  
Party baby (don't be misunderstood)  
I'll be cool, would you be cool  
I wonder if I take you home  
  
RAP:  
Buckle up baby feel my speed  
Better not brake or you'll miss me  
Driving you hard subliminal  
Cause you're so irresistible

Get your head space into a spin  
Cause that's the way I get my kicks  
So take it in baby, deal with it  
  
Here's my secret
