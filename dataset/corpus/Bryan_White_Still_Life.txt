Out on the porch swing  
Like some old painting  
He seems like he don't move at all  
And somewhere a bell rings  
And he's just remembering  
The last time that she ever called  
He picks up the phone and he says to the dial tone  
  
It's still life without you  
And I still hold on  
What it feels like  
You can't go by that  
It's still life still life without you  
  
The chances were given  
To get on with living  
The truth is that he never tried  
And no one ever sees him  
Most folks don't even  
Remember which one of them died  
But he still denies it he closes his eyes and  
  
It's still life without you  
And I still hold on  
What it feels like  
You can't go by that  
It's still life still life without you  
  
Oh, still life, still life without you  
  
Out on the porch swing  
Like some old painting  
It seems like he don't move at all
