If we don't know where we've been  
How can we figure out where we going?  
And if we don't know how we are  
We should just cover up the scars  
We did it wrong, wrong, wrong, we didn't know  
You said it all, all, all, all  
I was too slow  
I should've know, know, know  
It's harder when you gone  
  
We know the hurt it's in our hearts  
And all the pain that feels our love  
We got the pain here in our blood  
No matter what we still love, we still love  
You will go back in my heart  
We still love, we still love  
Real love will make us really how we are  
  
I don't mean for my mistakes  
I'm just a foolish man that I can change  
Before you know it is too late  
We gotta learn to love again  
  
And I was wrong, wrong, wrong, we do I know  
You said it all, all, all, all  
Then let me go  
I should've know, know, know  
  
You were too strong  
Now it's all the way, you're gone  
  
We know the hurt it's in our hearts  
And all the pain that feels our love  
We got the pain here in our blood  
No matter what we still love, we still love  
You will go back in my heart  
We still love, we still love  
Real love will make us really how we are  
  
We still love, we still love  
You will go back in my heart  
We still love, we still love  
Real love will make us really how we are  
  
And I was wrong, wrong, wrong, we do I know  
You said it all, all, all, all  
Then let me go  
I should've know, know, know  
You were too strong  
Now it's all the way, you're gone  
  
We know the hurt it's in our hearts  
And all the pain that feels our love  
We got the pain here in our blood  
No matter what we still love, we still love  
You will go back in my heart  
We still love, we still love  
Real love will make us really how we are
