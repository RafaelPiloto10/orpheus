(rosy won't you please come home)  
Rosy, won't you please come home,  
Mama don't know where you've been.  
Rosy won't you please come home,  
Your room's clean and no one's in it.  
Oh, my rosy, how I miss you,  
You are all the world to me.  
Take a look and see if you like it,  
If you like it, please, come back.  
Rosy, won't you please come home,  
Since you joined the upper classes  
You don't know us anymore,  
Live and let your trouble pass.  
Rosy, rosy, where are you, tell me,  
If you don't want to come back.  
I will sacrifice all I have  
To have a happy home once more.  
Rosy, won't you please come home,  
Two long years have passed away.  
Since you tried to change your life  
Christmas wasn't quite the same.  
Rosy, rosy, got any answers ?  
You are miles across the sea  
And I'll bake a cake if you tell me  
You are on the first plane home.  
Rosy, won't you please come home,  
Mama don't know where you've been.  
Rosy won't you please come home,  
Your room's clean and no one's in it.  
Oh, my rosy, how I miss you,  
You are all the world to me.  
Take a look and see if you like it,  
If you like it, please, come home.  
Rosy.
