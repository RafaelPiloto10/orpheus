Six o'clock I'm wasted  
She is in my bones  
[This] city's all gone dead on me, again  
May as well find my way home  
  
No one really knows me  
No one ever said  
Surely isn't free  
Surely...doesn't end, honey  
  
Like a playing song in my head  
Drifting on, here I am  
  
Heading for the blue light  
Shivered back again  
Almost in the blue light  
When you shivered back again, old friend  
  
It's coming on, in my head...  
(Playing on and on)  
Something too hard will be ok  
The things you do...  
It's coming with you...  
  
Here comes the blue light  
Here comes the blue light  
...Still playing on...  
  
Six o'clock I'm wasted  
She is in my bones again  
City's all gone right dead  
May as well find my way
