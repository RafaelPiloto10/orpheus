I took this picture in the dark  
Spinning in lights till we fell apart  
So turn it away turn it away  
You don't know what I've seen  
The youth is hollow and so are we  
They give it away give it away  
  
This is what it feels like  
This is disintegration  
This is what it feels like  
This is isolation  
  
I can't find the light  
Inside this empty room I cannot find myself  
I wont let you down  
  
I hold on by a single thread  
Sweet solitude is so complete in my head  
You watch me dangle there and become just a memory  
Like they said I would end up  
  
The youth is marching to tear us down  
We built our lives here  
We fight their calling  
  
Take sides  
Line up and take sides  
  
I'm so sick of you calling the shots (I'll tear you down from the inside)  
  
I can't find the light  
Inside this empty room I seem to loose myself  
I won't let you down  
  
So write this down  
I'm not using my lungs anymore  
This is the last time  
Write it down  
I won't be your voice anymore
