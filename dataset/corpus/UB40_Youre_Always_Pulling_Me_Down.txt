I thought I knew you well, your right and wrong  
Thought I could steal your secrets and put them in a song  
I thought that you'd be waiting patiently for me  
That only I could see  
  
You build me up and tell me lies  
You hold my hand, say close your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
You're always pulling me down  
You make me lower my expectations  
You're always pulling me down  
Why do you complicate situations  
You're always pulling me down  
  
I don't know what else to do  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I wish that I could see things through your eyes  
I want to lift the veil and penetrate your lies  
I want to take your truth and hold it in my hand  
Maybe then I'll understand  
  
You contradict in a thousand ways  
You call the tune and guess who pays
