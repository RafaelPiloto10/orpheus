Enough to cure blindness, Carolina's finest  
You knew that already  
And turned to the greatest, I proved that already  
And if you would like, I do it twice  
I just sharpen my blade for a minute but came lost in my ways  
This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves  
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days  
We used to play before your coffin was made  
Just got the call nigga got caught with a straight  
Hope he's okay  
Just got... got paid, they free OJ  
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers  
Who know a nigga fall to where
