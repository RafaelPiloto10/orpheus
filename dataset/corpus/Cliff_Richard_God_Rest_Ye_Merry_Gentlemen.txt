God rest ye, merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From god our heav'nly Father a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born the son of god by name  
  
"Fear not, then," said the angel, "Let nothing you afright  
This day is born a savior of a pure virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in him from Satan's power and might"  
  
The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind  
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind  
And went to Bethlehem straightaway this blessed babe to find  
  
But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this infant lay  
They found him in a manger where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray  
  
Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place  
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface  
  
God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign  
And many a merry Christmas may live to see again  
Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near--  
That God send you a happy New Year, happy New Year  
And God send you a happy New Year
