There's a hot hard hurt  
Burning under her skin  
And it pricks her like thorns  
And it's needles and pins  
And it twists in her body  
And I know what it is  
  
And I'm paying in pain  
But it's the cost of the high  
'Till the weight of the secret  
And the weight of the lie  
Makes my heart want to burst  
Feel the ache as time goes by  
Getting better and worse  
Getting better and worse  
  
And there's a screw that I tighten  
As I dream of the kiss  
And it twists and it cuts me  
And you know what it is?  
It's a fragment of love  
From a splintering heart  
And it tears her apart  
But not as much as this  
  
So you save up your tears  
For the moments alone  
'Till the splinters you gather  
Leave you glass-hard and numb  
And the same sun is shining  
On the old and the young  
On the saints and the sinners  
On the weak and the strong  
  
And there's a burning and freezing  
And a cross for a kiss  
So she learns to stop dreaming  
And you know how it is  
With these fragments of love  
And this splintering heart  
With the fragments  
And this splintering heart
