Hold on tight in the heat of the night  
Baby there can be no escape  
Feelings right, getting hard to fight  
Baby how much more can I take.  
  
Tell me that it's real, everything you feel  
What am I supposed to do  
Look into my eyes, touch me deep inside  
Let me feel your love cut through.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, now is the time  
Feeling your heart so close to mine  
Oh, I want your touch, need you so much  
Now is the time for our love.  
  
Drowning in the flames, in the sea of desire  
Angel with the devil's eyes  
Turn up the heat and we fall in the fire  
Can't you feel the temperature rise.  
  
Tell me that it's true, you can feel it too  
Let me be your fantasy  
Baby hold me tight, say that it's alright  
You know you can count on me.  
  
Repeat Chorus.  
  
When the fire starts-- I can feel you burning tonight  
With an open heart-- baby won't you let me inside,  
Let me inside girl.
