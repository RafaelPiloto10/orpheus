It's alright to cry even my dad does sometimes  
So don't wipe your eyes  
Tears remind you you're alive  
It's alright to die cause death the only thing you haven't tried  
But just for tonight hold on  
So live life like you're giving all  
Cause you act like you are  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path  
  
It's alright to shake  
Even my hand does sometimes  
So inside the rage Against the dying of the light  
It's alright to say that death's  
The only thing you haven't tried  
But just for today hold on  
So live life like you're giving all  
Cause you act like you are  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path  
  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path and hold on
