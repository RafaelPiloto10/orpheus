MESS OF BLUES  
WITH JOOLS HOLLAND  
WRITERS DOC POMUS, MORT SHUMAN  
I just got your letter baby Too bad you can't come home I swear I'm goin'
crazy Sittin' here all alone Since your gone I got a mess of blues I ain't
slept a week since Sunday I can't eat a thing all day Every day is just blue
Monday Since you've been away Since your gone I got a mess of blues Whoops
there goes a teardrop Rollin' down my face If you cry when you're in love It
sure ain't no disgrace Whoops there goes a teardrop Rollin' down my face If
you cry when you're in love It sure ain't no disgrace I gotta get myself
together Before I lose my mind I'm gonna catch the next train goin' And leave
my blues behind Since your gone I got a mess of blues I got a mess of blues
