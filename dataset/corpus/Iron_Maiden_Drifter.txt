Walk away!  
  
Look out now, baby won't you take me away,  
Sittin' here its gonna be a new day.  
Gotta sing my song and I can't go wrong,  
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song.  
  
What you feeling when you hold me tight?  
I'm gonna cuddle up with you tonight, gonna get you feeling so secure.  
listen child don't you see there's a cure?  
Anywhere got to get you away, feels so good think it's gonna be a new day.  
I'm gonna get my song till I can't go on,  
I'm gonna keep on roaming gonna sing my song.  
  
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.  
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.
