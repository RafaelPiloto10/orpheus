Exitin' the shower  
I forgot to wash my heart  
Now the dust has turned to mud  
Since we've been apart  
This angel whispered in my ear  
As I brushed my teeth  
She said  
"Muddy hearts work twice as hard  
And still can barely beat"  
I know it's true  
I exit through you  
  
You always did understand  
That time ticks away  
Everything you ever give  
To cure you of delay  
We've both been here so very long  
Now we just pretend  
To be head over heels in love  
Like we've been saved again  
It's true  
I exit through you  
Exit through you  
  
What use is it to wash that stuff away?  
In every place that we have run to  
All that we've begun with was here to stay  
  
(Exitin' the shower  
I forgot to wash my heart  
Now the dust has turned to mud  
Since we've been apart  
This angel whispered in my ear  
As I brushed my teeth  
She said  
"Muddy hearts work twice as hard)  
And still can barely beat"  
  
Your eyes like brandin' irons  
Make impressions on my skin  
I burn so very easy  
When I'm proud of who I am  
It feels like rigor mortis  
But it tastes like bubblegum  
All these words you need to say  
They're on the tip of your tongue  
It's true  
I exit through you  
Exit through you  
  
What use is it  
To wash that stuff away?  
In every place  
That we have run to  
All that we've begun  
With was (t)here to stay  
  
When my days have been clocked  
And all the gates  
Have been locked  
When the way is all blocked  
I exit through you  
There's only one way out  
  
(Exitin' the shower  
I forgot to wash my heart  
Now the dust has turned to mud  
Since we've been apart  
This angel whispered in my ear  
As I brushed my teeth  
She said  
"Muddy hearts work twice as hard)  
And still can barely beat"  
  
There's only one way out  
Only one way out  
  
(Exitin' the shower  
I forgot to wash my heart  
Now the dust is turned to mud  
Since we've been apart  
This angel whispered in my ear  
As I brushed my teeth  
She said  
"Muddy hearts work twice as hard)  
And still can barely beat"  
  
Only one way  
I exit through you  
  
(Exit through you)  
  
One way out
