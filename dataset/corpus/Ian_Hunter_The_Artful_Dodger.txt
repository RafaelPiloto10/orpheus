How ya doin', all right?  
I-I-I spy with my little eye  
Something beginning with you  
Drool, drool, drool, nearly fell off me stool  
I hope you fancy me too  
Now I don't wanna set the world on fire  
Any old iron, any old iron will do  
(All right)  
Smirk, smirk, smirk the G and T's work  
She can knock 'em back like a fish  
Smarm, smarm, smarm, I turned up me charm  
I think I'm on a promise  
(He thinks he's on a promise)  
Some say yes and some say no  
And my old man says "Mind, how you go"  
A little bit of this, a little bit of that  
If you can't take a joke, well, sod ya  
(Oh)  
I'm a dysfunctional chap  
And they call me the Artful Dodger  
Chat, chat, chat, it's back to the flat  
I strum my little Spanish guitar  
Gloat, gloat, gloat, she said and I'll quote  
"You can take down my particulars"  
(Take down her particulars)  
It's a funny old life if you weaken, innit?  
You gonna have a laugh, yeah, you've gotta give it  
A little bit of this, a little bit of that  
Look out for PC Plodger  
If a job's worth doin', it's worth doin' well  
And they call me the Artful Dodger  
(Get on your bike)  
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
If you can't take a joke well, sod ya  
(Oh)  
I'm a bit of a lad and they call me the Artful Dodger  
(Now)  
A little bit of this, a little bit of that  
Hoist up the Jolly Roger  
That's the way to do it, call me the Artful Dodger  
And I'm doin' all right  
Yes, I'm doin' all right  
Yes, I'm doin' all right  
Yes I'm doing very well, thank you
