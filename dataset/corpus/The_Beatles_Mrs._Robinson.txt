Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes  
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes  
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair  
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids  
  
Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)  
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)  
  
sitting on a sofa on a sunday afternoon  
Going to the candidates debate  
Laugh about it, shout about it  
When you've got to choose  
Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose  
  
where have you gone Joe Damajiou  
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you wuwuwu  
what's that you say  
Mrs. robinson  
Joe Damajiou has long left and gone away  
hey hey hey hey hey hey
