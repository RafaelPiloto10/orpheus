It don't get better if you're locked behind your door  
It don't get better if you're hiding more and more  
It may get better if you fight  
It may get better if you'd wear a mask and scream  
On Halloween  
  
Come Alive  
Come Alive  
Rise and see  
Rise and be for me  
Come Alive  
Come Alive  
From the blue  
Make it true for You  
Come Alive  
  
It don't get better if you're acting for a while  
It don't get better if you drown itself denial  
It don't get better without pain  
It'd don't get better if you turn around and flee  
To ecstasy  
  
Come Alive  
Come Alive  
Rise and see  
Rise and be for me  
Come Alive  
Come Alive  
From the blue  
Make it true for You  
Come Alive
