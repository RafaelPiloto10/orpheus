I got my first real six-string  
Bought it at the five-and-dime  
Played it till my fingers bled  
Was the summer of '69  
  
Me and some guys from school  
Had a band and we tried real hard  
Jimmy quit, Jody got married  
Shoulda known, we'd never get far  
  
Oh when I look back now  
That summer seemed to last forever  
And if I had the choice  
Yeah, I'd always want to be there  
Those were the best days of my life
