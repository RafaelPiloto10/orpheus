Well General Taylor gained the day  
Walk him along, John, Carry him along  
Well General Taylor he gained the day  
Carry him to his bury'n ground  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me where you're stormy  
Walk him along, John, carry him along  
Tell me where you're stormy  
Carry him to his bury'n ground  
  
We'll dig his grave with a silver spade  
Walk him along, John, Carry him along  
His shroud of the finest silk will be made  
Carry him to his bury'n ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We'll lower him down on a golden chain  
Walk him along, John, Carry him along  
On every inch we'll carve his name  
Carry him to his bury'n ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
General Taylor he's all the go  
Walk him along, John, Carry him along  
He's gone where the stormy winds won't blow  
Carry him to his bury'n ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
General Taylor he's dead and he's gone  
Walk him along, John, Carry him along  
Well General Taylor he's long dead and gone  
Carry him to his bury'n ground  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
