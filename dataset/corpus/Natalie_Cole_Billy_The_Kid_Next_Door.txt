I was dressed to kill, I was ready  
Oh, girl, I was stepping out, yeah  
I was on my way to meet my steady  
When this fire thing turned me right around  
At first I was frightened  
Because he took me, he took me by surprise, whoo  
But my heart knew that it was a hold-up  
I could see the love light shining in his eyes  
Right then I was held up  
Girl, I was held up  
I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
Yes, I was held up  
My heart was held up  
I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
The way he stole my affection  
Oh, girl, you know that it ought to be a crime  
Mm-hmm, and the way that he changed my direction  
I had no projection  
And I swear to you that I ain't lyin'  
Oh-hoo, love was right here among me  
I never knew that heaven could be so close  
I was on my way to meet my steady  
When right next door is what I needed most  
Oh, I was held up  
Right then I was held up  
Oh, I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was held up  
Ooh, I was held up  
My heart was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
(Guitar Solo)  
Ooh, Billy...  
At first I was frightened  
Because he took me, he took me surprise  
But my heart knew that it was a hold-up, yeah  
I saw the love light shining in his eyes  
Right then, right then I was held up  
My heart was held up  
But you know I was held up  
By Billy the Kid next door  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I was held up  
Yes, I was held up  
Ay-I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
You'd be so lonely  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
Ow, he had a love gun  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
And I know he's wanted  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
Oh, the boy is wanted  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
Oh, he's wanted, Billy the Kid next door  
On the go  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
The go for Billy  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
'Cause he's wanted, Billy the Kid next door  
I said he's wanted  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
That boy is wanted  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
Ooh, he's wanted, Billy the Kid next door  
Oh, oh, oh, Billy

'Cause he's wanted, Billy the Kid next door
