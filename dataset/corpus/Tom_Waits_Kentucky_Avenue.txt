Eddie Graces Buick got four bullet holes in the side,  
Charlie Delisle sittin' at the top of an avocado tree.  
Mrs. Stormll stab you with a steak knife if you step on her lawn.  
I got a half pack of Lucky Strikes, man, come along with me!  
Lets fill our pockets with macadamia nuts, then go over to Bobby Goodmansons
and jump off the roof! Hilda plays strip poker and her mamas across the
street,  
Joey Navinski says she put her tongue in his mouth!  
Dicky Faulkners got a switchblade and some gooseneck risers that eucalyptus is
a hunchback,  
There's a wind up from the south!  
Let me tie you up with kite string and I'll show you the scabs on my knee!  
Watch out for the broken glass, put your shoes and socks on and come along
with me!  
Lets follow that fire truck  
I think your house is burnin' down!  
Then go down to the hobo jungle  
And kill some rattlesnakes with a trowel!  
We'll break all the windows in the old Anderson place  
And steal a bunch of boysenberrys  
And smear 'em on our face!  
I'll get a dollar from my mamas purse  
And buy that skull and crossbones ring  
And you can wear it around your neck  
On an old piece of string  
  
Then we'll spit on Ronnie Arnold  
And flip him the bird  
And slash the tires on the school bus  
Now don't say a word!  
I'll take a rusty nail  
And scratch your initials on my arm  
And I'll show you how to sneak up  
On the roof of the drugstore  
  
Take the spokes from your wheelchair  
And a magpies wings  
And tie 'em to your shoulders and your feet!  
I'll steal a hacksaw from my dad  
And cut the braces off your legs  
And we'll bury them tonight in the cornfield  
  
Put a church key in your pocket  
We'll hop that freight train in the hall  
And we'll slide all the way down the drain  
To New Orleans in the fall!
