Turn your radios on, I'll be a right there, yes I will  
Turn me up real loud, I'm in your ears, ah  
'N' I'm hangin' ten now baby, as I ride your sonic, ooh wave  
(Good God, y'all)  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire  
Oh yeah, one time  
Fire, fire, fire  
Lay your bodies down, I'm in your beds, your beds  
Pull your headphones on, I'm in your heads, ah  
'N' I'm hangin' ten now baby, as I ride your sonic, ooh wave  
(Good God, y'all)  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire
