I let you down  
Let me pick you up  
I let you down  
Let me climb up you to the top  
So I can see the view from up there  
Tangled in your hair  
I let you down  
  
I have no lid upon my head  
But if I did  
You could look inside and see  
What's on my mind  
  
You could look inside and see  
What's on my mind  
I let you down, oh, forgive me  
You give me love  
  
Let me walk with you  
Maybe I could say  
Maybe talk with you, open up  
And let me through  
  
Don't walk away  
Don't walk away  
  
I have no lid upon my head  
But if I did  
You could look inside and see  
What's on my mind  
  
You could look inside and see  
What's on my mind  
I let you down  
How could I be such a fool like me  
  
I let you down  
Tail between my legs  
I'm a puppy for your love  
I'm a puppy for your love  
  
I have no lid upon my head  
But if I did  
You could look inside and see  
What's on my mind,  
  
Oh it's you  
I let you down  
  
I'm a puppy for your love  
I'm a puppy for your love  
  
Forgive me  
Forgive me  
Forgive me  
I let you down
