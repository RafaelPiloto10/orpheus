I hope your new man's good for you in bed  
Better than this whisky-drinking slob  
A weekend in Vienna, a boat trip on the Med  
I hope you've found the right man for the job.  
  
Oh he's fine, he's just fine  
He loves me just like you loved your wine  
When it comes to other women, I bet he doesn't touch a drop  
I think you've found the right man for the job.  
  
Chorus:  
Here's to then, and cheers  
Thanks for the friendship you've given these years  
Here's to him, and cheers  
He's given me some happiness where you just gave tears  
He must have a big yacht  
A nose in the air can't be all that he's got  
A good head on his shoulders isn't everything he's got  
I think I've found the right man for the job  
I thank you for the toffees that you gave  
And thank you for the flowers that didn't arrive  
I sent you a bouquet, but I sent it to your grave  
I didn't think that you were still alive  
  
Oh he's fine, he's still fine  
He likes to wine and dine and actually dine  
His roses are regular, his kisses on the dot  
I think I've found the right man for the job  
  
Chorus  
  
You'll be pleased to hear I've found a new romance  
Let me introduce you to my friends  
Seven gins for seven tonics begin a merry dance  
We're out every night til nighttime ends
