Well I'm still here  
But I'm so scared  
Got myself in trouble, so much trouble  
I know I've got to make it  
But I just can't take New York  
  
My middle name is fear  
I have a vacant stare  
And it's been so long since my body's been warm  
I know I've got to make it  
But I just can't take New York  
  
I came here  
All dreams and wide eyes in the big, big city  
No family, no money  
And I don't even know what's hit me  
  
He hasn't seen a doctor  
Since he got here in the spring  
Went to the Medicentre  
But they wouldn't let him  
Without a green card  
Life can be so hard  
Take pity on a man without a home of his own  
How could he ever have known?  
  
Every street and every corner  
Watch them drowning  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
Man and women to the slaughter  
We just stand and watch them  
Do the Crazyman dance  
  
It's been one whole year  
And it's just not fair  
For all the pushing and shoving  
I've still got nothing  
I'm never gonna make it  
And I'm stuck here in New York  
  
So people don't come near  
Unless you've a dollar to spare  
'cause you know what they say  
About madmen on the subways of New York  
Believe it  
  
Yesterday's newspapers  
I wrap them around my body  
Outside these skyscrapers  
I wait for the night to hit me  
And boy, does it hit me  
  
Every street and every corner  
Watch them drowning  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
For a nickel or a quarter  
For your pleasure  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
  
I'm coming yo London  
I'm coming to Paris  
I'm coming yo make you good clean people embarressed  
Why don't you look at my face  
Why don't you look in my eyes  
You'd rather look at your feet  
You'd rather look at the skies  
  
Oh, you'd look anywhere  
But a man whose pure existence  
Says 'I ain't got time'  
And I don't care  
You just don't care  
Care
