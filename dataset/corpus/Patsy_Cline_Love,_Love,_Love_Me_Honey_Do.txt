My love is deeper than the world's deepest sea  
My love is stronger than the mightiest tree  
My love is real, my love is true  
Darlin', you know that's the love I have for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, love me, love me, honey do  
You know I'll always be true  
Love me honey, squeeze me tight  
Hug me honey, with all your might  
Love me, love me, honey do  
  
Your love is warmer than a bright shiny day  
It makes me tingle, and I like it that way  
Your love is sweet, sweet as can be  
Darlin', please say that your love is all for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your love is warmer than a bright shiny day  
It makes me tingle, and I like it that way  
Your love is sweet, sweet as can be  
Darlin', please say that your love is all for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love me, love me, honey do  
Love me, love me, honey do
