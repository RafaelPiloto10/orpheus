I'm rotting inside  
My flesh turns to dust  
Whisper, are you dying in my ear?  
I'm so sick to death  
Tumors in my head  
Whisper, are you dying in my ear?  
Black rose of death  
In my fist I clutch  
Thorns shred my finger tips  
And drips toxic blood  
Kiss me one last time  
Wipe off my sweat  
Whisper,are you dying in my ear?  
As my bones they rust20lbs of trust  
Whisper, are you dying in my ear?  
Black rose of death  
In my fast like lunch  
Thorns shred my finger tips  
And drips toxic blood  
I'm rotting inside  
My flesh turns to dust  
Whisper,are you dying in my ear?  
Kiss me one last time  
Wipe off my sweat  
Whisper, are you dying in my ear?  
Whisper, are you dying in my ear?
