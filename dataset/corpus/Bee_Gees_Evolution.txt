There's a law in what we do  
We got a quest for something new  
Everything you witness seems to  
Let you down  
If someone gets you from behind  
I got an open mind  
And you've been thirsty for the friend you found  
  
Close your eyes and make a wish  
I don't wanna mess with mother nature  
Knowing that you're mine  
You said I could see  
You with another and we all get satisfied  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
An eternal source of pleasure  
In being the one  
When your love is for the giving  
It's a case of destiny  
You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be commital to be a little deviation  
  
So I get all wound up inside  
I can see your scene unwind  
You dance together or you dance alone  
And leave the real world in the air  
Love it in leather I don't care  
Everything is legal in the danger zone  
  
Close your eyes and make a wish  
Later we could cater to the animal  
Knowing that you're mine  
It's straight in my face  
You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed  
  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion  
In being the one  
In the storm of revolution  
What is done can be undone  
You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be committal  
To the subtle variations  
  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion  
In being the one  
If your love is for the givin'  
It's a case of destiny  
And you can find your source of pleasure  
In being with me  
  
[Chorus]
