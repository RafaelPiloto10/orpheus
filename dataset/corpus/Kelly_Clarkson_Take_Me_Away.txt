[Kelly]  
I can not find away  
To describe it. It's there  
Inside all I do is hide it. I'm  
Not sure why I feel this way  
But I have had enough. So please  
Just come and  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Take me away from the pain  
All the thoughts I have of you.  
Take me away from all the love I  
Used to have for you oh oh ohx2  
Take me away.  
  
[Kalan]  
This feeling inside just  
Won't go away. Sometimes  
I just feel like falling down  
Cause all this pain is too much  
To carry oh....  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Take me away from the pain  
All the thoughts I have of you.  
Take me away from all the love I  
Used to have for you oh oh ohx2  
Take me away.  
  
[Kelly]  
I just wanna be taken away  
Ohhh Just take take me away  
From the pain I have of you.  
Oh just take me away all the  
Love... I used to have for you...  
Take me away.  
  
[Kalan]  
I wanna be  
I wanna be  
Alone. Just take me away  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Take me away from the pain  
All the thoughts I have of you.  
Take me away from all the love I  
Used to have for you oh oh ohx2  
Take me away.
