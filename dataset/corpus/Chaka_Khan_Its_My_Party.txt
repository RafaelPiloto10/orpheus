VERSE 1:  
Everybody's having a real good time  
The man you're talking to is not yours, he's mine  
Better chill out, hear what I'm saying  
Before I stop the music playin'  
CHORUS:  
It's my party, I'll start it, I'll end it  
Baby, it's my party, I'm upset and offended  
While I'm all alone, and the party's goin' strong  
It's a celebration, to better our relation  
A sudden flash in my vision  
Rendezvousin' in the kitchen  
Kit got lost, and I found him all involved  
He was wearing a guilty face  
He had his arms around her waist  
And lipstick on his face  
CHORUS  
VERSE 1  
Say you had too much to drink  
Lost your head and couldn't think  
A sudden flash in my vision  
Rendezvousin' in the kitchen  
Then you got lost, and I found you all involved  
Wearing a guilty face  
Had your arms around her waist  
And lipstick on your face  
Cecil: Oh, tell me what it is  
Chaka: Ooh, you had lipstick on your face  
Cecil: Oh, tell me what'd you see  
Chaka: Rendezvousin' in the kitchen  
Cecil: Oh baby, what it's gonna be  
Chaka: Gonna stop this music playing  
Cecil: Oh, do you trust in me  
Chaka: It's very plain to see
