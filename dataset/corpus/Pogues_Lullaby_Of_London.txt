As I walked down by the riverside  
One evening in the spring  
Heard a long gone song  
From days gone by  
Blown in on the great North wind  
  
Though there is no lonesome corncrake's cry  
Of sorrow and delight  
You can hear the cars  
And the shouts from bars  
And the laughter and the fights  
  
May the ghosts that howled  
Round the house at night  
Never keep you from your sleep  
May they all sleep tight  
Down in hell tonight  
Or wherever they may be  
  
As I walked on with a heavy heart  
Then a stone danced on the tide  
And the song went on  
Though the lights were gone  
And the North wind gently sighed  
  
And an evening breeze coming from the East  
That kissed the riverside  
So I pray now child that you sleep tonight  
When you hear this lullaby  
  
May the wind that blows from haunted graves  
Never bring you misery  
May the angels bright  
Watch you tonight  
And keep you while you sleep
