and i sit here waiting and comb my hair  
wait in line your time will come  
says the man he waves his gun  
carpet burns beneath my name  
your finger prints i'll play your game  
i'll play your game  
just pull me under  
cast your blood to my open veins  
i won't tell them will just play your game  
i'll play your game  
i'll take the blame  
just pull me under  
close the curtains finger prints in dust  
she's been drowning and i drink her loss  
i'll take the blame  
i'll play your game  
i'll play insane
