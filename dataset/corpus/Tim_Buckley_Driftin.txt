When there's wine in your belly  
Love rhythm's on your tongue  
For you are a woman  
And each man has been too young  
  
But for me you were a lover  
Gently under your cover  
Your sheet reeks of odours  
  
Oh i came here to hold and be held for a while  
  
I've been drifting like a dream out on the sea  
I've been drifting in between you and me  
Everytime i think about you  
I can't remember what i said or did  
Was right or wrong, you know i just don't remember  
All i wanna be is what you mean to me  
All i wanna be is what you mean to me  
  
Late last night as i dreamed in dizzy sunlight  
I thought i heard your bare feet up the stairs  
Just like a fool, just like a fool  
I've been drifting  
Like a dream out on the sea  
I've been drifting in between what used to be
