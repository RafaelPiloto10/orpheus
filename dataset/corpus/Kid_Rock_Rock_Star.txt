Stuntin' in Roberto Cavalli mommy wit the dime frame  
Hotter than tamales u probably should be my wild thing  
Tell dem other chicks mind they own business n let us do our own thing

You gonna make a playa choose  
Show me what that thang'll do  
Class is in session let me sh-show you a thang or two  
I'll strip ya, I'll strip ya down to ya bare minimums  
And I'll, I'll lick ya, I'll lick ya down, you taste like cinnamon  
And ill, grab a lil' bit of that whipped cream  
Then I'll put her on her back get mean  
Then I'll get her in the matrix, cut her lasik  
Basically make her scream  
At the top of her longs  
Give her shortness of breath  
How many times can you cum before I poke ya to death  
Someone call in the ref  
Ludacris is tired of playin'  
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that you got everybody sayin

Say I'm a rockstar baby  
Fuckin' wit this weed and Patron got me hazy  
Hey I'm rockstar baby  
So put 'em up if you's a rockstar baby  
  
Girl your booty so swole  
How you get them jeans around it  
Girl your booty so swole  
Why you think I'm singin' bout it  
Hit it hard from the back  
And then I go to sleep and dream about it  
It's like that ass is crack  
The way you got me thinkin' 'bout it  
I'm tellin' you now the way fuck  
Gonna lead to child birthin'  
Rocking to this guitar  
Is 'bout to have me blouse surfin'  
Kellz'll put on a show  
Up until they close curtains  
Then right after the show  
  
Backstage ass hurtin'  
Call me Scottie, 'cause girl, 'cause girl  
I'm a 'bout to beam up  
Once I getch getcha  
Gone come on up out of those D cups  
Strokin' it hard, strokin' it hard  
While you got ya legs up  
Making ya making ya sound like ya  
Got the hiccups  
What want because I'm about to give you what you need  
Up in my room you screaming Hercules, Hercules  
Man get Kellz and Luda on a track a hit is guaranteed  
Everybody on they feet  
This is what y'all shirt should read  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say I'm a rockstar baby  
Fuckin' wit this weed and Patron got me hazy  
Hey I'm a rockstar baby  
So put 'em up if you's a rockstar baby  
  
I got my drink in my cup  
I got my hands in the air  
I'm bout to set this bitch off  
Like I'm a rockstar baby

Wanna hit the after party  
All the ladies coming with me  
Cause I'm a rockstar baby  
  
So put your hands up

Everybody in the building come on real swizzy

Say I'm a rockstar baby  
Fuckin' wit this weed and Patron got me hazy

So put 'em up if you's a rockstar baby
