Well, I was standing in line at the city bus stop  
Soaked to the skin from ev'ry rain drop  
I see you driving by just like a phantom jet  
With your arm around some little brunette  
You say you won't be home because you're working late  
Honey, I'm no fool, you've been out on a date  
The lipstick on your collar gives your game away  
It's strawberry red and mine's pink rose  
  
[Chorus]  
Have mercy on me  
You treat me so bad I'm in misery  
It's breaking my heart, can't you see  
Baby, baby have mercy on me  
Well, I called you up on the telephone  
  
I could hear you was playin' Haggard and Jones  
I knew right then that there was something wrong  
There's only one reason you play cheatin' songs  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I went to the bank with my little check book  
The cashier, he gave me the strangest look  
He said, You ain't got no money 'cause you're over drawn  
Your man took it all and he's done gone!  
  
[Chorus]
