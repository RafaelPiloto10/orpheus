I've got a question for you  
Please grant me an interview  
Don't want to read it in a magazine  
Don't want to see it on the silver screen  
Don't let the craziness tear us apart  
  
I'm down on the knees of my heart  
Down here on the knees of my heart  
  
This comes from deep in my soul  
Your sweet love has taken control  
I'll swim across the ocean if you tell me so  
I'll take you to the jump up if you want to go  
It never is too late to make a brand new start  
  
I'm down here on the knees of my heart  
Down here on the knees of my heart  
  
Oh how I will sing if you give me everything  
I live for the day when there's nothing in our way  
  
I will be waiting tonight  
You'll find my boat by the light  
I'm gonna show you what my love can do  
Out on the ocean all alone with you  
We'll find a desert island on an ancient chart  
  
Take me from the knees of my heart  
Take me from the knees of my heart  
Take me from the knees of my heart  
Take me from the knees of my heart
