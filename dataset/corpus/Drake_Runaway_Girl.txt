Hey there material girl  
The neighbors told me that you're moving out  
Leaving to witness the world  
But are you sure that's what you're doing now  
  
Are you running away for a purpose  
Do you even know what your self worth is  
The past what you carry in your purses  
The gift in the curse when you going head first is  
The atl, mia, lax, jfk  
Luggage all packed and to them I say  
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray  
  
You wander the world  
You seek what you've lost  
You're waking up every day  
The run away, run away girl  
I turn and your gone  
You're leaving to chase your fame  
The run away, the run away girl  
  
So long  
Farewell  
Good bye  
Good day  
Be on  
Your way  
Run away girl  
(X2)  
  
Watching it all through the window  
And wishing you could make is shatter now  
Now that you're here on the other side  
Are you sure it even matters  
  
Are you living the dream  
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems  
Do you strip do you model do you live in between  
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like  
  
You wander the world  
You seek what you lost  
You're waking up every day  
To run away, run away girl  
I turn and you're gone  
You're leaving to chase your fame  
You run away, run away girl  
  
So long  
Farewell  
Good bye  
Good day  
Be on your way  
Run away girl  
(X2)
