And so this is Christmas  
And what have you done?  
Another year over  
And a new one just begun  
  
And so this is Christmas  
I hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones  
The old and the young  
A very Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
  
And so this is Christmas  
For weak and for strong  
For rich and the poor ones  
The road is so long  
And so Happy Christmas  
For black and for white  
For yellow and red ones  
Let's stop all the fights  
  
A very Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
  
And so this is Christmas  
And what have we done?  
Another year over  
And a new one just begun  
And so Happy Christmas  
We hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones  
The old and the young  
  
A very Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
  
And so happy Christmas  
We hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones  
The old and the young  
We wish you a very Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear
