It's 2am we're lying in bed  
Stillness all around there's not a sound except in my  
Head  
Of happy songs children laughing  
Kids celebrating youth like it never would end  
  
Not long ago they sat on our knees  
We drew cartoons, flew to the moon, trimmed Christmas  
Trees  
But time has flown look how they've grown  
Soon she'll be you, and soon he'll be... like me...  
  
There's no rewinding no replay  
The chance you lose today will be gone when it's gone  
We'll never be quite as strong nor as young as this again  
Make them last, make these moments last... right now.  
  
But time has flown look how they've grown  
We'll never be quite as strong nor as young as this again  
Make them last, make these moments last... right now.
