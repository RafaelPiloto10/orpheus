Things may always stay the way they are,  
Still my head looks for a change  
From time to time.  
I don't really mean to look that far  
Turn on the music, strike up the music,  
Let the music change my mind.  
  
Now don't I dig the big time rock and roll.  
Sit in the darkness and be somebody else.  
A time which after all is under control  
Crank out the music,  
Give me music, let the music fill the air.  
  
My dear friend, your head's been sinking  
Like a stone.  
You must try thinking like a cloud sometime.  
Just leave a happy side out loud sometime.  
There's a symphony inside you,  
There's a thousand things for you to do,  
So come on.  
  
Let a hush fall on the movie crowd.  
Boy turns to girl and says I love you so.  
What I hear in here is violins  
Give me music, miss the music,  
Let the music be there too.  
I'll never know what to do  
Unless you let the music be there too.  
  
You see this man his head's been sinking  
Like a stone.  
You must try thinking like a cloud sometime.  
Just leave a happy side out loud sometime.  
There's a symphony inside you,  
There's a thousand things for you to do,  
So come on.  
  
Let a hush fall on the movie crowd.  
Boy turns to girl and says I love you so,  
Well, you know, what I hear in here is violins  
Strike up the music, lay on the music  
Let the music be there, too.  
Never know what to do unless you  
Let the music be there too.
