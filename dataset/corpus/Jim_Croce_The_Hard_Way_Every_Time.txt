Yeah, I've had my share of broken dreams  
And more than a couple of falls  
And in chasin' what I thought were moonbeams  
I have run into a couple of walls  
But in looking back at the places I've been  
The changes that I've left behind  
I just look at myself to find  
I've learned the hard way every time  
  
'Cause I've had my share of good intentions  
And I've made my share of mistakes  
And I've learned at times it's best to bend  
'Cause if you don't well those are the breaks  
Should have listened to all the things I was told  
But I was young and too proud at the time  
Now I look at myself to find  
I learn the hard way ev'ry time  
  
But in looking back at the lessons I've learned  
And the mountains I wanted to climb  
I just look at myself to find  
I've learned the hard way ev'ry time  
  
'Cause I've had my share of broken dreams  
And more than a couple of falls  
And in chasin' what I thought were moonbeams  
I have run into a couple of walls  
But in looking back at the faces I've been  
I would sure be the first one to say  
When I look at myself today  
Wouldn'ta done it any other way
