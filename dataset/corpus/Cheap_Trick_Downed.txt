Downed, downed out of my head  
'round, 'round out of my head  
  
I'm gonna live on a mountain  
Way down under in Australia  
It's either that or suicide  
It's such a strange strain on you  
Oh, i got a mind  
Over you it's not the first time  
Oh, i got a mind  
  
Rainbow's crawling on a midday sun  
But i've been lucky you're the only one  
Sunday's calling, you'll be number one  
It's such a strange strain on you  
Oh, you think of Jesus Christ  
You walk on water but don't bet your life, oh no  
All you walk is a fine line  
It's such a strange strain on you  
  
Downed, downed out of my head  
'round, 'round out of my head  
  
Too many people want to save the world  
Another problem is it a boy or girl  
Some say the weekend is the only world  
It's such a strange strain on you  
Oh, i've got a mind  
Over you it's not the first time  
All you walk is a fine line  
It's such a strange strain on you  
  
Downed, downed out of my head  
'round, 'round out of my head  
Downed, downed out of my head  
'round, 'round out of my head
