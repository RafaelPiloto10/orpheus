Ain't as easy as it looksto grow flowers in the dirt  
All of my friends are livin' underground  
Put away your wedding ringout on Highway 63  
All your worriestake their place in line  
They love to tear you down, down, down  
Livin' in this sweet, soul townfall into the sound,aah, ha, ound  
A place to hide and room to move my electric boogaloo  
Don't you worry,the circus is in town  
They love to tear you down, down, down  
Livin' in this sweet, soul town  
Fall into the sound,aah, ha, ound  
They love to tear you down, down, down  
Livin' in this sweet, soul town  
Fall into the sound,aah, ha, oundaah, ha, ound  
Fall into the sound
