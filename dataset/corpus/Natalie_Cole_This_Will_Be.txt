Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  
Oh, oh,  
Ooh, oh, oh, yeh  
Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm  
This will be an everlasting love  
This will be the one I've waited for  
This will be the first time anyone has loved me  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm so glad you found me in time  
And I'm so glad that you've rectified my mind  
This will be an everlasting love on me  
Oh, oh  
Loving you is some kind of wonderful  
Because you show me just how much you care  
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime  
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh  
This will be an everlasting love, oh yes it will now  
You've brought a lot of sunshine into my life  
You've filled me with happiness I never knew  
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of  
And no one, no one can take the place of you, ooh  
This will be, you and me, yes-sir-ee, eternally  
Hugging and squeezing and kissing and pleasing  
Together, forever, through rain or whatever  
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, you and me  
So long as I'm living, true love I'll be giving  
To you I'll be serving 'cause you're so deserving  
Hey, you're so deserving, you're so deserving  
Yeh, yeh, yeh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Love, love, love, love, love, love  
Love, love, love, love  
Love, love, love, love, love  
Love, love, love  
From now on, from now on, yeh  
From now on, from now on, yeh  
(repeat)
