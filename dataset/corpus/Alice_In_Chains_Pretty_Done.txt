So you got the thing you wanted  
Don't let it go  
Though it hurts your hand to hold it  
Don't let it show  
  
I'm pretty done  
Once a favored son  
I'm pretty done  
Slap me 'round for fun  
  
Finding no pleasant changes  
In old enemies  
Not a lead a bit part playing  
In my story  
  
I'm pretty done  
Once a favored son  
I'm pretty done  
Slap me 'round for fun  
  
I don't care to further amuse you  
Never had you how, could I lose you?  
Paid in full, I owe no one at all  
  
I'm supposed to smile and ignore it  
Better than some  
High roads are to fall from  
Already hung  
  
I'm pretty done  
Once a favored son  
I'm pretty done  
Slap me 'round for fun  
  
Pushing towards hopeless mission  
Curiosity, omission  
History colored since the fall  
  
I'm pretty done  
I'm pretty done  
I'm pretty done  
I'm pretty done
