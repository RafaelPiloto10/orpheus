I wanna turn back, I wanna turn back  
I wanna turn back the clock  
  
I wanna live last night again  
Hold my baby tight again  
Hickory dickory, dickory dock  
  
Hickory dickory dock, hickory dickory dock  
I'm doin' a flip, such a big flip  
Flippin' all around the block  
  
Last night at a quarter to nine  
Lover man said he'd be mine  
Hickory dickory, dickory dock  
  
He came a callin'  
We went ballin'  
Last night around a quarter to eight  
  
We went to see a show  
Don't know what I saw  
But the kissin' was great  
  
Hickory dickory dock, hickory dickory dock  
Look at me shake, look at me quake  
Look at my poor heart rock  
  
And I've got news for you  
Oh, we're gonna say, "I do"  
Hickory dickory, dickory dock
