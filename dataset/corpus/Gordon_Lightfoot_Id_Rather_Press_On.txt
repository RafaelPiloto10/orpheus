Is it my imagination or is it my iron pride  
I wonder if it matters much if time is on my side  
I'd rather press on, I don't wanta rest easy  
Anywhere I stray, I will make it a brand new day  
Anyway, that is all I've gotta say  
I'd rather be by the seaside  
Than be playing a one night stand  
I've been too wrapped up in my own dreams  
I will change things if I can  
I gotta press on, don't wanta rest easy  
Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine  
And all of the sunshine that we knew  
You will never know what blue is  
Until you have played the game  
Till you live life in solitaire where  
No one knows your name  
I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy  
Have it anyway you will  
I will be with you right up until  
The spell is broken and all is well  
If you'd rather be by the seashore  
Well, I sure can understand  
Are you too wrapped up in your own scene  
I would change things if I can  
I'd rather press on, don't want to rest easy  
Wouldn't it feel fine  
But remembering the rhythm and the rhymes  
And all of the good times makes me blue  
Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine  
And all of the sunshine that we knew
