I just thought, that you would like to know  
That I would, do anything, just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams
come true  
Well I just thought, that you would like to know, that I... I would climb the
highest tree  
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams, come true  
I know, that it seems like, I am full of hot air  
But my heart is in the right place  
I swear, I swear  
I just thought that you, would like to know, that I... I would do anything  
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams come true  
Now I know that it seems like, I'm full of hot air  
But my heart  
My heart is in the right place  
I swear, I swear  
And I just thought that you, would like to know  
That I...I'd do anything...anything, just to make your dreams  
Just to make your dreams come true  
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams...  
Come true
