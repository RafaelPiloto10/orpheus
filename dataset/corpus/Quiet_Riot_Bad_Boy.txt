C'mon!  
Yeah!  
  
I thought that I was indestructible  
But how could I imagine this  
I never gave a second thought  
Was only hit or miss  
  
While you feed me and it feel so good  
Does that mean that wrong is right?  
Guess I got the warning  
It happened overnight  
  
Honey, it's only nasty  
When it's nasty  
And you know that it hurts  
When it's right  
  
I'm a bad boy  
I'm a bad boy  
They call me nasty  
They call me bad  
'Cause I'm a bad boy  
I'm a bad boy  
There are the good ways  
To be a bad, bad boy  
  
I'm a bad, bad boy  
I'm a bad, bad boy  
I'm a bad, bad boy  
  
Well my behaviour has been in question  
Since the day that I was born  
I get on my knees to love and to please  
Now you've been warned, yeah  
  
Pay the price if you don't ignite  
Now they're trying to pick and choose  
You may be the most and know the cost  
Yes, come to you  
  
Oh your eyes are on me now  
My defence must be bad somehow  
  
Bad boy  
I'm a bad boy  
Call me nasty  
They call me bad  
But I'm a bad boy  
I'm a bad boy  
There are the good ways  
To be a bad, bad boy  
  
I'm a bad, bad boy  
  
Show me  
  
And it's only nasty  
When it's nasty  
And you know that it hurts  
When it's right, right, right, right, right  
  
I'm a bad boy  
I'm a bad boy  
I found all the good ways  
Oh show me  
  
Bad boy  
I'm a bad boy  
I found all the good ways  
To be a bad  
  
'Cause I'm a bad boy  
I'm a bad boy  
Please call me nasty  
Please call me bad  
'Cause I'm a bad boy  
I'm a bad boy  
I found all the good ways  
To be a bad, bad boy  
  
I'm so bad  
So so bad  
I'm bad  
I'm a bad, bad boy  
I'm a bad, bad boy
