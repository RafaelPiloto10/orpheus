It's one am  
And he's still not in  
You wonder when enough's enough  
'Cause this ain't new  
But what do you do  
When you can't help who you love  
  
So you drive to town  
And you ask around  
Scared of what you're thinking of  
Has he been hurt  
Has be been with her  
'Cause you can't help who you love  
  
You hear the voices calling  
As you walk among the fallen and betrayed  
And you know it's gonna break you  
Still you follow where it takes you anyway  
'Cause you ain't got no say  
It's a long ride home  
When you're all alone  
'Cause you can't help who you love  
  
You hear the voices calling  
As you walk among the fallen and betrayed  
And you know it's gonna break you  
Still you follow where it takes you anyway  
'Cause you ain't got no say  
You should leave  
But I believe  
You can't help who you love  
  
You can't help who you love
