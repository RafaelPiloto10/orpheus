You and me  
Had some history  
Had a semblance of honesty  
All that has changed now  
We shared words  
Only lover speak  
How can it be  
We are less than strangers  
  
Oh it hurts to lose in love  
Let anger and cruelty win  
It's unfair that you doubt your feelings  
And that you'll ever love again  
I know that hearts can change  
Like the seasons and the wind  
But when I said forever  
I thought that we'd always be friends  
  
You and me had some history  
Had a semblance of honesty  
All that has changed now  
We shared words  
Only lovers speak  
How can it be  
We are less than strangers  
  
I thought I saw you yesterday  
I thought I passed you on the street  
I swear I saw your face  
I was not imagining  
That you stole a glance my way  
You walked away from me  
My heart it may be broken  
But my eyes are dry to see  
  
You and me had some history  
Had a semblance of honesty  
All that has changed now  
We shared words  
Only lovers speak  
How can it be  
We are less than strangers
