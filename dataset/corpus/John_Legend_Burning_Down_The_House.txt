Watch out you might get what you're after  
Cool baby strange but not a stranger  
Ever since we came this way  
We're burning down the house  
  
Hold tight wait till the party's over  
Hold tight we're in for nasty weather  
Three hundred sixty five degrees  
We're burning down the house  
  
Here's your ticket pack your bag  
Time for jumpin' overboard  
Transportation is here  
Close enough but not too far  
Maybe you know where you are  
Fightin' fire with fire  
  
Burning down the house  
  
All night this crowd is moving something  
That's right, don't wanna hurt nobody  
This things will knock you off your feet  
We're burning down the house  
  
Here's your ticket, pack your bag  
Time for jumpin' overboard  
Transportation is here, yeah, yeah  
Close enough but not too far  
Baby you know where you are  
Fightin' fire with fire  
  
So hold tight  
Hold tight wait till the party's over  
Hold tight we're in for nasty weather  
Three hundred sixty five degrees  
We're burning down the house  
  
Do it again now  
Do it again say  
Burning down the house  
Burning down the house
