He showed you no interest, he gave you no love  
From time to time he was funny  
He loved only two things, but one was enough for him  
Was it the fame or the money?  
  
Was it fame or money?  
Lethal vice, cold as ice.  
Was it fame or money?  
Holding tight, 'til everything is all right  
Everything is all right  
  
Up to his eyeballs, always in debt  
He's suddenly off and running  
So what motivation lay at the heart of it?  
Was it the fame or the money?  
  
Was it fame or money?  
Lethal vice, cold as ice.  
Was it fame or money?  
Holding tight, 'til everything is all right  
Everything is all right  
Everything is all right  
  
We're all in the running  
With all of the money  
Take all over and over again  
  
Back in his schooldays, four-eyed and zits  
No good at games, and skinny  
Locked in the boys' room left him no choice at all  
Had to be fame and money  
  
So it's fame and money  
Lethal vice, cold as ice  
So it's fame and money  
Holding tight, 'til everything is all right  
Fame and money  
Lethal vice, cold as ice  
So it's fame and money  
Holding tight, 'til everything is all right  
Everything is all right  
Everything is all right
