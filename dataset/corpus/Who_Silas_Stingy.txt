Once upon a time there lived an old miser man  
By the name of Silas Stingy  
He carried all his money in a little black box  
Which was heavy as a rock  
With a big padlock  
All the little kids would shout  
When Silas was about  
  
[Chorus:]  
Money, money, money bags  
Money, money, money bags  
There goes mingy Stingy  
There goes mingy Stingy  
Money, money, money bags  
Money, money, money bags  
There goes mingy Stingy  
There goes mingy Stingy  
  
Silas didn't eat, which was just as well  
He would starve himself for a penny  
He wore old clothes and he never washed  
'Cause soap cost a lot  
And the dirt kept him hot  
All the little kids would shout  
When Silas was about  
  
[Chorus]  
In the back of his head  
Was a voice that said  
"Someone will steal it all  
You'll be lying in the gutter with an empty box  
The thieves will be having a ball"  
  
[Chorus]  
He bought a safe to put the box in  
And a house to put the safe in  
And a watchdog on a chain to make quite sure  
And his face was very funny  
When he counted up his money  
And he realized he hadn't any more  
  
[Chorus]
