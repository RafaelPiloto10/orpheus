[Hook:]  
Tell me the truth  
Tell me you wanna be bad  
Cause I wanna be bad all the time  
Tell me truth  
When you put your hands on my body  
Tell me you want me tonight  
  
[Verse:]  
I'm looking for my Mr. Wrong  
If that's alright then let me know  
I know exactly what you want  
But if you tell me we can go  
So put your summer hands all over my summer body  
You'll get some of this after my summer party  
I can make it hard if that's the way you want it  
If that's the way you want it
