Mommy where's daddy?  
He's been gone for so long.  
Do you think he'll ever come home?  
  
I was gone for fourteen days  
I coulda been gone for more  
Held up in the intensive care ward  
Lyin' on the floor  
I was gone for all those days  
But I, was not all alone  
I made friends with a lot of people  
In the danger zone  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it every day  
See my lonely mind explode  
Since I've gone away  
  
I think I lost some weight there  
And I, I'm sure I need some rest  
Sleepin don't come very easy  
In a straight white vest  
Should like to see that little children  
She's only four years old.. old  
I'd give her back all of her play things  
Even, even the ones I stole  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
When I've gone insane  
  
I want to get out of here  
I want to get out of here  
I, I've gotta, I've gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere  
Ya gotta let me out of here  
Let me outta her  
Etc  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
Blown up in my face  
  
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat  
And I, I ran into the street  
I saw a man that was choking there  
I guess he couldn't breathe  
Said to myself this is very strange  
I'm glad it wasn't me  
But now I hear those sirens callin'  
And so I am not free  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
(I didn't want to be)  
I see it every day  
(Leave me alone  
I didn't want to be  
Don't touch me!)  
See my lonely mind explode  
When I've gone Insane
