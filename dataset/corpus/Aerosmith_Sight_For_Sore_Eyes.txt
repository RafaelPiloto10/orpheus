Goin' downtown, goin' down, goin' down  
'neath the city, eatin' ground round  
Underground is pretty gritty  
I turned the screw she held the light  
That's when I knew she was a  
  
Sight for sore eyes  
She was a sight for sore eyes  
  
Playin' no fair, sleepin' under stairs  
Downtown's a pity, takin' fair square  
Under where it's pretty gritty  
I turned the screw, she held the knife  
  
Oh, holy jesus, she's a sight for sore eyes  
Sight for sore eyes  
She's a nitty grutty  
  
Turnin' in style, walk a mile for your titty  
Naked foul while under there  
Under where it's pretty gritty  
Hey, don't you know people  
She's a love lust hussy  
She left, oh she rust me  
Dear old girl  
She was a sight for sore eyes  
But she was sittin' pretty  
A sight for sore eyes  
She was a nitty gritty  
Sight for sore eyes  
  
Peeled back and parted  
Even at the start it was delight or demise  
I feel like a leopard king  
Sight for sore eyes  
She was a sight for sore eyes
