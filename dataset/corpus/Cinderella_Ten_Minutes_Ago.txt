Ten minutes ago I saw you  
I looked up when you walked through the door.  
My head started reeling,  
You gave me the feeling  
The room had no ceiling or floor.  
Ten minutes ago I met you  
And we murmured our how-do-you-do's.  
I wanted to ring out the bells  
And fling out my arms  
And to sing out the news.  
  
I have found her, she's an angel  
With the dust of the stars in her eyes.  
We are dancing, We are flying,  
And she's bringing me back to the skies.  
In the wings of my love I'm flying  
Over mountain and meadow and glen.  
And I like it so well  
That for all I can tell  
I may never come down again.  
I may never come down to earth again.
