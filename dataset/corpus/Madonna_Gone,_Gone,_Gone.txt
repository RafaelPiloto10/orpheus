Needing, needing  
All at once comes the silence  
Begging, pleading  
No more emotional violence  
The withdrawal into pain  
The result to never need again  
Is this love?  
I think not  
I want out  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
(This love affair)  
It's so sad  
(This love affair)  
What we had  
Gone, gone, gone  
Bleeding, bleeding  
Then comes the recognition  
Anger seething  
I don't need your permission  
And I don't know who you are  
And this thing has gone too far  
Is this love?  
I think not  
I want out  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
(This love affair)  
It's so sad  
(This love affair)  
What we had  
Gone, gone, gone  
You're in too deep  
You cannot keep  
The promises you made  
Our happiness was free  
The end of love  
The end of the dream  
Gone, gone, gone  
And I don't know who you are  
And this thing has gone too far  
Is this love?  
I think not  
I want out  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
(This love affair)  
It's so sad  
(This love affair)  
What we had  
Gone, gone, gone  
(This love affair)  
Gone, gone, gone  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone
