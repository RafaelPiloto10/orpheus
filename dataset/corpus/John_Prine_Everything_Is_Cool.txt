Everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
Why just before last Christmas  
My baby went away  
  
Across the sea to an island  
While the bridges brightly burn  
So far away from my land  
The valley of the unconcerned  
  
I was walking down the road, man  
Just looking at my shoes  
When God sent me an angel  
Just to chase away my blues  
  
I saw a hundred thousand blackbirds  
Just flying through the sky  
And they seemed to form a teardrop  
From a black haired angel's eye  
  
That tear fell all around me  
And it washed my sins away  
Now everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
  
Everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
Why just before last Christmas  
My baby went away  
  
And I find it real surprising  
For myself to hear me say  
That everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
Everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
  
Why just before last Christmas  
My baby went away.
