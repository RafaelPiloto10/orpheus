Now I ain't the best lookin' guy in the world  
And I ain't got much money at all  
But when our eyes met, I'll never forget  
And for you I could easily fall  
  
[Chorus]  
So why don't we just keep on dancin'  
While the band sings an old country song  
Well I won't be depressed  
If I ain't the best  
But will I do 'til the best comes along  
  
I ain't got a mansion on some mountain top  
And I ain't got no long limousine  
But I've got a heart as warm as the sun  
And could love you like you've never seen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, I won't be depressed  
If I ain't the best  
But will I do 'til the best comes along
