Some girls you meet seem so complete  
Like they don't need nothin' from you  
They're out to show you they don't want to know you  
When deep inside they do  
  
Well, this girl didn't want me or anyone else  
She was alone, thought I'd give it a try  
I was a young bull stompin' in the field  
I saw red when she walked by  
  
Love has taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah  
  
I had to think fast, I watched her walk past  
I knew I would have my way  
So I swaggered up, I mean I staggered up  
But I didn't have a damn thing to say  
  
Now, two handed strategy always works well for me  
So I slipped my hands around her waist  
I swore it was the right move, feelin' so smooth  
Till she backhanded me 'cross my face  
  
Love has taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah  
  
To make a long story short, she finally got caught  
I had to tell her enough is enough  
She said, "You're just what I needed", and boy  
She nearly pleaded with me not to be too rough  
  
Love has taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah  
  
Love has taken, taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah  
  
Love has taken, taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah
