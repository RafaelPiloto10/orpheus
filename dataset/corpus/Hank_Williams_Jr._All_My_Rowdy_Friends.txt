All my rowdy friends have settled down and it seems to be more in the laid
back songs.  
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud. Everybody just wants to go back home.  
I myself have seen my wilder days and I have seen my name at the top of the
page,  
But I need to find a friend just to run around. But no one wants to get high
on the town  
And all my rowdy friends have settled down.  
  
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway and
old George Jones I'm glad to see he's finally getting straight,  
And Waylon staying home and loving Jesse more these days,  
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud and all my rowdy friends have
settled down.  
  
And the hang overs hurt more then they used to and corn bread and ice tea took
the place of pills and ninety-proof,  
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do  
And nobody wants to get high on the town and all my rowdy friends have settled
down.  
  
Yeah I think I know what my father meant when he sang about his lost highway
and Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68  
And Kriss he is a movie star and he's moved off to L. A.  
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud and all my rowdy friends have
settled down  
  
Yeah me and my rowdy friends have rowdied on down.
