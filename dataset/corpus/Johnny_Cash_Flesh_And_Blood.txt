Beside a singing mountain stream  
Where the willow grew  
  
Where the silver leaf of maple  
Sparkled in the morning dew  
I braided twigs of willows  
Made a string of buckeye beads  
But flesh and blood needs flesh And blood  
And you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need  
  
I leaned against a bark of birch  
And I breathed the honey dew  
I saw a North-bound flock of geese  
Against a sky of baby blue  
Beside the lily pads  
I carved a whistle from a reed  
Mother Nature's quite a lady  
But you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.  
  
A cardinal sang just for me  
And I thanked him for the song  
Then the sun went slowly down the west  
And I had to move along  
These were some of the things  
  
On which my mind and spirit feed  
But flesh and blood need flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.  
  
So when this day was ended  
I was still not satisfied  
For I knew everything I touched  
Would wither and would die  
And love is all that will remain  
And grow from all these seeds  
  
Mother Nature's quite a lady  
But you're the one I need  
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  
And you're the one I need.
