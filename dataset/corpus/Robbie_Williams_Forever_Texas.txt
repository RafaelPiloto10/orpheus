First you say you want me  
Then you don't want me really  
Baby do I scare you  
Am I talkin' too freely  
  
I got no perspective  
On the things that you lack  
Baby I don't care  
Just lie on your back  
  
Baby I'm crazy  
But lady I'm lazy  
Amaze me  
Baby I'm fading  
My mind is all jaded  
Amaze me  
  
I'm so superstitious  
So there's something you should know  
The reason I'm doing you is  
'Cause your friend said no'  
  
I've been suicidal since  
God I don't know  
So get down on your knees  
Say your prayers Amen  
  
Baby I'm crazy  
Lady I'm lazy  
Amaze me  
Baby I'm faded  
My mind is all jaded  
  
Give me Texas wisdom  
Massive systems  
And a luscious behind  
Mother said 'Son if you do  
It too long you'll go blind'  
  
Baby I'm lazy  
But lady I'm crazy  
Amaze me  
Baby I'm faded  
One, two  
  
Everybody getting cash for the bung  
Everybody wants to know how I'm hung  
You can read it in the papers  
I'm a giver not a taker  
But it won't be the same  
  
Everybody getting cash for the bung  
Everybody wants to know how I'm hung  
You can read it in the papers  
I'm a giver not a taker  
But it won't be the same
