Oh, oh deep water, black and cold like the night  
I stand with arms wide open  
I've run a twisted line  
I'm a stranger in the eyes of the Maker  
I could not see for the fog in my eyes  
I could not feel for the fear in my life  
  
From across the great divide, In the distance I saw a light  
Of John Baptist walking to me with the Maker  
My body my body is bent and broken by long and dangerous sleep  
I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away  
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the Maker  
  
Brother John, have you seen the homeless daughters  
Standing here with broken wings  
I have seen the flaming swords  
There over east of Eden  
Burning in the eyes of the Maker  
Burning in the eyes of the Maker  
Burning in the eyes of the Maker  
  
Oh, river rise from your sleep  
Oh, river rise from your sleep  
Oh, river rise from your sleep
