This is fun day  
Yours and my day  
This is fun day, dee oh, wee oh  
  
This is fun day  
On a fine day  
When the air is filled with tweeting birds that sing  
Together in the sun  
This is your day  
Yours and my day  
When you feel the joy of children playing,  
Laughing from dust till dawn  
On a day like this you share your joy  
With everyone  
Share your peace, and share your joy,  
And share your love  
  
This is fun day  
On a fine day  
When you feel the urge of getting up to start-up  
With the break of dawn  
This is your day  
Yours and my day  
When you turn on your radio and hear the DJ  
Playing your favorite song  
On a day like this not even bad can rub  
You wrong  
'Cause you say it's okay 'cause it's your day  
  
I'm gonna go out to the park  
Where you feel the joy in every heart  
That's what I need to start each day off right  
Oh, I'll find a place for you and me  
Underneath the shade of a lover's tree  
Fun day should be each day in all our lives  
  
This is fun day  
Yours and my day  
This is fun day, dee oh, wee oh  
  
This is love day  
A celebration  
A day on every calendar that's set aside  
For everyone to give  
This is your day  
Such a fun day  
I cannot believe a day like this has come  
That's if this really is  
I'm so very proud to say that for this day I've lived  
To see your peace, to see your joy, and to  
sSe your love  
  
I'm gonna go out to the park  
Where you feel the joy in every heart  
That's what I need to start this day off right  
  
Oh, I'll find a place for you and me  
Underneath the shade of a lover's tree  
Fun day should be each day in all our lives  
  
This is love day  
A celebration  
A day on every calendar that's set aside for  
Everyone to give  
  
Let me solo, let me solo, let me solo, solo
