December's  
Rollin' around  
And it's nice  
And cold outside  
It's been  
A little while since  
I last saw your face  
  
Except for on the TV  
And I'm so proud of you  
You're doing so good  
And I'm not trying  
To stress you  
But it'd be nice  
To give you a hug  
If I could  
  
Chorus:  
I think you know that  
Nobody likes to be alone  
On Christmas time  
Christmas time is here  
And all  
I really want is you  
  
So  
If you don't mind  
If you don't mind  
Could you  
Think about me  
How much I miss you  
And how long  
You've been gone  
And please  
Find your way home  
  
The tree is set up  
In the corner  
I decorated it myself  
I sent you a picture  
Think I did pretty good  
  
And your grandma told me  
She's gonna make her  
Sweet potato pie  
And your mother had gifts  
She wanted  
To bring to the house  
Wanted to know  
If she should  
  
I told her  
I was not sure  
If you were going  
To be around  
She sounded kinda sad  
But she said  
"She would come on down  
To be with me  
And the baby"  
  
Think you know  
  
(Chorus)  
  
So  
If you don't mind  
If you don't mind  
Could you  
Think about me  
How much I miss you  
And how long  
You've been gone  
And please  
Find your way home  
  
Would you find  
Your way home?  
Would you find  
Your way  
Cause I need you  
Back here at home  
Cause I need you  
Back here at home  
Find your way home  
  
Did you know that  
Nobody likes to be alone  
On Christmas time  
Christmas time is here  
And all I really want  
Is you  
  
So  
If you don't mind  
If you don't mind  
Could you  
Think about me  
How much I miss you  
And how long  
You've been gone  
And please  
Find your way home  
  
(Chorus)  
  
So  
If you don't mind  
If you don't mind  
Could you  
Think about me  
How much I miss you  
And how long  
You've been gone  
And please  
Find your way home
