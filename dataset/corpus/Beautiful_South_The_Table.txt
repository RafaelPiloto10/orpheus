This table has four sturdy legs  
And a heart of very near wild oak  
When others would have screamed out loud my friend  
This one never even spoke  
  
I've been sat upon, I've been spat upon  
I've been treated like a bed  
Been carried like a stretcher,  
when someone thinks they're dead  
I've been dined upon, I've been wined upon  
I've been taken for a fool  
Taken for a desk,  
when they should have been at school  
  
This table's been pushed against the door  
When tempers, well tempers flare at night  
Banged upon with knuckles clenched my friend  
When someone thinks that they are right  
  
I've been sat upon, I've been spat upon  
I've been treated like a bed  
Been carried like a stretcher,  
when someone thinks they're dead  
I've been dined upon, I've been wined upon  
I've been taken for a fool  
Taken for a desk,  
when they should have been at school  
  
Tables only turn when tables learn  
Put me on a bonfire, watch me burn  
Treat me with some dignity, don't treat me like a slave  
Or I'll turn into the coffin in your grave
