You really messed up everything  
You really messed up everything  
If you could take it all back again  
Strike up what's in the box  
Why should I be good if you're not?  
  
This is a foul tasting medicine  
A foul tasting medicine  
To be trapped in your full stop  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
(All the good times)  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
(All the good times)  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
(All the good times)  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
(All the good times)  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
  
Take me back  
Take me back again  
Take me back

You really me-  
Really mess-  
You really messed up  
You really messed up  
You really messed up  
You really messed up this time  
You really messed up
