Children of Abraham, what's your story?  
Killing each other for a piece of land  
Children of Abraham, this ain't glory  
You've got to walk together hand in hand  
  
Take down the flags that just separate the people  
Take down the wire on the boundary  
Take back the words that were spoken in anger  
You've got to live just like a family  
  
Children of Abraham,I must be dreaming  
Rivers of blood running through your hands  
Children crying, mothers screaming  
It just wasn't looking like the Promised Land
