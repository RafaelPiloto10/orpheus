[Verse 1]  
What do you got?  
Mass produced in somewhere hot  
You'll have to go on the Underground  
To get things done here  
And then you have  
[?] service done  
This is a place to come to, or, well, it was  
I know a hot spot  
Crossing on the guillotine  
  
[Chorus]  
And if you have nobody left to rely on  
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift  
It's got to be that time again  
And you, you will be over soon again  
  
[Verse 2]  
So get yourself up, get past [?] on your way  
There's nothing to be ashamed of  
Taking off again  
The 514 to East Grinstead  
You've set me off  
[?]  
And talking types will let us down  
Talk, talk on your arse all night  
You wanna be there  
  
[Bridge]  
Step inside the tarmac ride  
To the land that time forgot  
Oh, we're just gonna go there  
Cracks inside the tarmac ride  
To the land that crime forgot, oh no  
  
[Outro]  
And if you have nobody left to rely on  
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street
