I'm playing at ice  
But I'm finding it hard  
She didn't break the wall  
She just caught me off guard  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
I'm just a little bit sorry  
But I haven't decided why  
Could it be my memory  
Or did I ever really cry  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
Fill my head with your false feelings  
I can't trust anything you say  
Today I missed a special friend  
That never really cared anyway  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes
