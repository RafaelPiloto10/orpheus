Locked up in the classroom waiting for the fight  
Down to the schoolyard knocking the gate  
Into the alley meet up with the boys  
Waiting for the weekend to make a little noise  
  
Thunder is strong, lightning is death  
Kicking the girls and it's starting to blast  
Sweeter than the heavens and the fate means stumble  
But it's Saturday night when heavy rock was born  
  
[Chorus]  
Like thunder and lightning  
God damn, it's so exciting  
It hits you like a hammer  
God damn  
  
It was Saturday night I was ready for the dance  
My girl walked in holding another guys hand  
He stood six foot six he looked two miles wide  
I was taking it easy till he took her outside  
  
I was madder than hell fit to burn  
This guy would break a leg before but now he's got to run  
Standing in the corner giving him a thrill  
You can keep your lover honey, but he's got to pay the bill  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well the place started rocking it was Saturday night  
I was dressed to kill I was feeling alright  
Alright in the middle of the night  
I wasn't ready for a rumble but the mood was right  
  
When he got up to leave  
I stood in his way  
I said love that's the price you have to pay  
In the doorway up against the wall  
When they play a heavy record then I'm gonna have a ball  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We started to rumble and stumble  
It is we were rocking and rolling and rolling and tumbling  
I fumbled and started to win  
When the greater than wicked then I hit him again  
  
I hit him again and I couldn't hit him anymore  
My head was all black and blue and my jaw was sore  
Sweeter than the heavens and like a frightening stumble  
It was Saturday night when heavy rock was born
