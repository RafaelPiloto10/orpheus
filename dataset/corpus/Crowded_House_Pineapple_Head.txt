Detective is flat, no longer is always flat out  
Got the number of the getaway car  
Didn't get very far  
As lucid as hell and these images  
Moving so fast like a fever  
So close to the bone  
I don't feel too well  
  
And if you choose to take that path  
I will play you like a shark  
And I'll clutch at your heart  
I'll come flying like a spark to inflame you  
  
Sleeping alone, for pleasure  
The pineapple head, it spins and it spins  
Like a number I hold  
Don't remember, if she was my friend  
It was a long time ago  
  
And if you choose to take that path  
I will play you like a shark  
And I'll clutch at your heart  
I'll come flying like a spark to inflame you  
  
Sleeping alone, for pleasure  
The pineapple head, it spins and it spins  
Like a number I hold  
Don't remember, if she was my friend  
It was a long time ago  
  
And if you choose to take that path  
Would you come to make me pay  
I will play you like a shark  
And I'll clutch at your heart  
I'll come flying like a spark to inflame you, I'll clutch at your heart and
come flying like a spark to inflame you
