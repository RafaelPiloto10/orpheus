You're insecure  
Don't know what for  
You're turning you're head when you walk through the do-o-or  
Don't need make up  
To cover up  
Being the way that you are is eno-o-ough  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby,you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell yo don't know  
Oh!Oh!  
You don't know you're beautiful  
But that's what makes you beautiful  
  
So cc-come on you got it wrong  
To prove I'm right I put it in a so-o-ong  
I don't know why you're being shy  
And turn away when I look into you're ey-ey-eyes  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but you,yeah  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell  
You don't know  
Oh!Oh!  
You don't know you're beautiful  
If only you saw what I can see  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe  
You don't know  
Oh!Oh!  
You don't know you're beautiful  
But that's what makes you beautiful!
