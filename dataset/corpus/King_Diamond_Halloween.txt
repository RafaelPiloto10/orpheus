Oh It's Halloween  
Every Night To Me Is Halloween  
Like An Ancient Scene  
You Know Just What I Mean  
  
Halloween You Are My Pride  
Halloween Not Just A Dream  
  
The Moon Is Full, Another Perfect Day Has Began  
Like A Demon's Eye, That Devil's Eye  
Will We Ever Die  
  
Halloween You Are My Pride  
Halloween Not Just A Dream  
  
Every Night Will Be Another Evil Scene  
Like In Horror Dreams I Want  
I Command You To Scream  
  
Halloween You Are My Pride  
Halloween Not Just A Dream  
  
Halloween... Halloween...
