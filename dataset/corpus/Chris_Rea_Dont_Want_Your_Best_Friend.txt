She's got her independence in a hard fast way  
She's got me chasing shadows with everything I try to say  
Some say she's far too quick, some say she's slow to learn  
But all I know is she gave me love that left afterburn  
And it's fire feeds me I'm hungry still  
So baby listen now, I'm at your will  
But I'm not a flower on your windowsill  
  
Don't want your best friend  
Don't need a Godsend  
Don't want your new trends  
I want you  
  
She's got a silver sabre with a diamond shine  
It's not an ego-trip just her frightened way  
To keep you blind  
Shadow dancing, nowhere fast  
You got to meet me half way  
Girl if it's gonna last  
  
I remember that first night  
I dream of it still  
I want that feeling and I want that thrill  
I've always loved you and I always will  
Take me home
