Frozen, forgetful again  
The part where I lose my head  
The scene where I'm supposed to speak but instead  
I sit and listen again,  
I'm stuck with these cards I guess  
  
Leaping from this cliff in my thoughts  
I fly like the stones in my heart  
Drowning in doubt for what reason  
I sit so patiently  
Drenched in what you want me to be  
I can't escape  
  
I'm ready now oh I'm ready now  
Oh I'm ready now come get me  
  
Fearless with cape in hand  
Conquer what I need to to mend  
Little girls get so broken  
But I sit so patiently drenched in what you want me to be  
I can't see no escape  
  
I'm ready now oh I'm ready now  
Oh I'm ready now come get me  
  
Through with golden roads and perfect love  
Too much of your mouth is like too much sun  
How I burn, how I burn  
I was so patient, waiting for my turn  
Fly like stone  
As I break every bone  
Come get me  
  
I'm ready now oh I'm ready now  
Oh I'm ready now come get me  
  
I'm ready now oh I'm ready now  
Oh I'm ready now come get me
