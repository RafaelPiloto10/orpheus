Waiting the hour destined to die  
Here on the table of hell  
A figure in white unknown by man  
Approaching the altar of death  
High priest awaiting dagger in hand  
Spilling the pure virgin blood  
Satan's slaughter, ceremonial death  
Answer his every command  
  
Death will come easy just close your eyes  
Dream of the friends you'll see  
Heavenly failure losing again  
Move on to a new form of life  
  
Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned  
Confronting the evil you dread  
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul  
Soon you will meet the undead  
  
Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned  
Confronting the evil you dread  
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul  
Soon you will meet the undead  
  
Enter to the realm of Satan!  
  
Blood turning black, the change has begun  
Feeling the hatred of all damned in Hell  
Flesh starts to burn, twist and deform  
Eyes dripping blood realization of death  
Transforming of five toes to two  
Learn the sacred words of praise, hail Satan  
  
A gift of powers disposed upon you  
Use them when you feel the need  
Master the forces and powers of Satan  
Controlling the creature's instinct  
Drawn to the castles that float in the sky  
Learn to resist the temptation  
Watching the angels sift through the heavens  
Endlessly searching for salvation
