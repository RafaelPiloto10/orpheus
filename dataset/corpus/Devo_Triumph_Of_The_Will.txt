It was a thing I had to do  
It was a message from below  
It was a messy situation  
It was desire for a girl  
  
I'm not a wanker or a banker  
I'm not afraid to take a risk  
It is the thing females ask for  
When they convey the opposite  
  
Before I die  
Before I die  
Before I die  
I'll get another piece of pie  
I'll get another piece of pie  
I'll get another piece of pie  
If I have to lie  
  
It was a thing I had to do  
It was a message from below  
It was a messy situation  
It was a triumph of the will  
  
Before I die  
Before I die  
Before I die  
I'll get another piece of pie  
I'll get another piece of pie  
I'll get another piece of pie  
If I have to lie  
  
When the well cries out for water  
It is a need that must be filled  
It goes beyond the laws of nature  
It takes a triumph of the will
