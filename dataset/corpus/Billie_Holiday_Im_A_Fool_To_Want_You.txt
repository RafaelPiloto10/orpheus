I'm a fool to want you  
I'm a fool to want you  
To want a love that can't be true  
A love that's there for others too  
  
I'm a fool to hold you  
Such a fool to hold you  
To seek a kiss not mine alone  
To share a kiss that Devil has known  
  
Time and time again I said I'd leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
But then would come the time when I would need you  
And once again these words I had to say  
  
Take me back, I love you  
I need you  
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong  
But right or wrong I can't get along  
  
Without you
