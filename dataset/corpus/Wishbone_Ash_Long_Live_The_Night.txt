I see she's crying  
And I hear her calling  
But I disregard her  
Just keep on walking.  
My heart is burning  
She need to work it out  
Before she leaves her innocence behind.  
I want to be there by your side  
I want to see the morning sun rise.  
Don't want to be left alone in the dark.  
Like a blind man  
I can't find my way.  
Strike a light up in your window  
So that I can see right up to your door.  
Long live the night we spent together  
Long live the night forevermore.  
Out in the streets  
In the cold light of day  
I've been reflecting on what she might say.  
I felt a shiver  
The devil passed me by.  
He said nothing  
My luck was running high.
