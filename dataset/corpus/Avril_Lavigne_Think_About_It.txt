I never wanted to run away from you  
I felt real bad, but that was what I did  
I never wanted to, I didn't hear from you  
And you weren't there for me so that is what happened.  
  
Pre-Chorus  
And I'm not sorry, cause we were boring  
I'm not ignoring anything (anything)  
  
Chorus  
There's only so much I can take  
Before I start to doubt it  
There's only so much I can give  
You should think about it  
Yeah, you should think about it  
  
It's time to have my fun, there's no way it's done  
"Take it with no regrets" and that is what I'll do  
I'll never understand where you were coming from  
And where did you go? You weren't there for me  
  
Pre-Chorus  
And I'm not sorry, cause we were boring  
I'm not ignoring anything (anything)  
  
Chorus  
There's only so much I can take  
Before I start to doubt it  
There's only so much I can give  
You should think about it  
There's only so much we can do  
Can we do without it?  
There's only so much you can say  
Did you forget about it?  
Did you forget about it?  
  
I never wanted to run away from you  
I felt real bad, but that was what I did  
  
Pre-Chorus  
And I'm not sorry, cause we were boring  
I'm not ignoring anything (anything)  
  
Chorus  
There's only so much I can take  
Before I start to doubt it  
There's only so much I can give  
You should think about it  
There's only so much we can do  
Can we do without it?  
There's only so much you can say  
Did you forget about it?  
Did you forget about it?  
  
I never wanted to run away from you  
I felt real bad, but that was what I did
