Welcome to the Grand illusion  
Come on in and see what's happening  
Pay the price, get your tickets for the show  
The stage is set, the band starts playing  
Suddenly your heart is pounding  
Wishing secretly you were a star.  
  
But don't be fooled by the radio  
The TV or the magazines  
They show you photographs of how your life should be  
But they're just someone else's fantasy  
So if you think your life is complete confusion  
Because you never win the game  
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion  
And deep inside we're all the same.  
We're all the same  
  
So if you think your life is complete confusion  
Because your neighbors got it made  
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion  
And deep inside we're all the same.  
We're all the same  
  
America spells competition, join us in our blind ambition  
Get yourself a brand new motor car  
Someday soon we'll stop to ponder what on Earth's this spell we're under  
We made the grade and still we wonder who the hell we are
