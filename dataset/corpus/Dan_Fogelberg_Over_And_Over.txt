Well I got a lover and I got a friend  
She says that she will love me, until the very end  
She knows that she's my baby, she knows she's my very best friend  
And when I'm down and broken, well she make me whole again  
All I want to do, all I want to do, all I want to do  
Is to love her, is to love that girl over and over again  
She knows when I feel lonesome, oh she knows when I feel blue  
She knows when I am tired and she knows just what to do  
She kiss me oh so tender and hold me oh so tight  
She wraps her arms around me and she make everything alright  
All I want to do, all I want to do, all I want to do  
Is to love her, is to love that girl over and over again  
All I want to do, all I want to do, all I want to do  
Is to love her, is to love that girl over and over again  
Over and over again  
Over and over  
Please little darlin' won't ya let me love ya  
Over and over again  
Over and over again
