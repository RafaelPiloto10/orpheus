On the road  
But I won't be gone for long  
Babe, I'm leavin' you tomorrow  
On my way  
And you know you make me strong  
I'll be thinkin' about you all night long  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama, shake just a little bit  
Mama, brake just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit from my heart  
All alone  
And I'm feelin' down today  
Won't let nothin' come between us  
Say the words  
And the words are meant to say  
I'll be thinkin' about you everyday  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama, shake just a little bit  
Mama, brake just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit from my heart  
From my heart  
I believe that we belong beyond a doubt  
If we have a change of heart  
We can always change our mind  
And I know we'll work it out  
I can see that it's the only way to go  
It's the only chance I get  
It's the only way you'll know  
That I love to love you  
Mighty love  
Gettin' hard to find today  
I believe in you forever  
Say the words  
And the words are meant to say  
I'll be thinkin' about you everyday  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama, shake just a little bit  
Mama, brake just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama, shake just a little bit  
Mama, brake just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit from my heart  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit  
Mama, take just a little bit from my heart
