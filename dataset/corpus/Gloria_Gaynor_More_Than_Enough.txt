My God is more than enough  
He can supply all my needs  
He is my El Shaddai  
He always looks out for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Jehovah Jirah he is my God [Repeat: x2]  
  
All of the earth is his  
And the fullness there of  
He's everything that I need  
You can be sure of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So why should I worry bout the highs and the lows  
The ups and the downs  
And by my faith I know  
My God is more than enough  
He can supply all my needs  
He is my El Shaddai  
He always looks out for me  
  
[Chorus]
