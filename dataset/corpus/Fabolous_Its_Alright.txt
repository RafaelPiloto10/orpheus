[Sean Paul]  
All you need to know is the vibe round' here we built and instill it  
Sean Paul alongside  
Fabolous, you done know we bust  
Telling them again, hey!  
Girl run away the guy that wants to "vibe kill" it  
She say a only the "topper" youth and "dapper" youth she want (to) win it  
Fabolous!  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
Lets get it ta' poppin' ma, its a little before 1  
And I'm yellin' out hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yo  
I can tell by the ring in the middle of ya tongue  
You're the kinda girl that has a little bit more fun  
I'm literally yours hun  
Cause' I never seen a ass so big with a waist as little as yours hun  
And by the expressions on them hotties grills  
I know they want to holla at somebody real  
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled  
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay
they hoe  
But I don't want to let the a.k. spray so  
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me  
I do this every year so I ain't never scared  
I do this everywhere and you ain't never there  
They sayin' this everywhere, how could you never hear  
  
[Chorus: Sean Paul]  
If you want to roll with the thugs tonight  
Lights, camera, action can you feel the hype  
Hit cruise control blazed Kryptonite  
Well its alright, baby its alright  
If you want to live up and free your life  
Come through let we kick it 'til a morning light  
If you want to roll with tha thugs tonight  
Well its alright, baby its alright  
  
[Verse 2: Sean Paul]  
So get with it, we want (to) hit it, we nah quit it  
And I like tha way you body set and how your clothes fit it  
I want you give me some of it because minute by minute  
Temperature it all a rise because you thighs and all you hips, style  
You shockin' it, you a rock it, you a kill it  
And a one thing the Dutty Paul want to predict  
Say by tha end of tha night you will be chillen' with tha click  
Flossin' it, money we tossin' it  
'Cause we a tha Boss in it  
We naw ease up...We ain't stallin', grab the girls all in  
That's my true callin'  
Ya'll freeze up.. We be flowin' it,  
Your girl knowin' it And that's why she's showin' it.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3: Fabolous]  
Over here the liquor is light blue, the chronic is light green  
They wearin' the right shoe, they put on the tight jeans  
They bringin' me right through', I walk with a slight lean  
My style excites you, I know what that might mean  
Aye, I'ma freaky scorpio  
Yo, tryna' leave with your skio  
Aye, but its mandatory tho'  
Yo' after me let shorey go  
  
But that's another story tho'  
But please don't try to bring us to the Maury show  
How cool is he?  
You don't know a fool who be crazy enough to fool with me  
You'd rather swim in a pool of pee  
Then see the one you love in the vehicle with me  
Aye  
Yo  
But the vibe is right, the girls is up to par  
We gon', drink it tonight and earl it up tomorrow  
It goes  
  
[Chorus]
