Another bride Another June  
Another sunny honey moon  
Another season, another reason  
For makin' whoopie  
  
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice  
The groom is nervous. he answers twice  
Its so killin' that he's so willin'  
To make whoopee  
  
Picture a little love nest  
Down where the roses cling  
Picture the same sweet love nest  
Think what a year can bring  
  
He's washing dishes and baby cloths  
He's so ambitious he even sows  
But don't forget folks that's what you get folks  
For makein whoopee  
  
Another year or maybe less  
What's this I hear? Well you can't you guess  
She feels neglected and he's suspected  
Of makin' whoopee  
  
She sits alone most every night  
He doesn't phone her he doesn't write  
He says he's busy but she say's "is he?"  
He's makin' whoopee  
  
He doesn't make much money  
Only five thousand per  
Some judge who thinks he's funny  
Says you'll pay six to her  
  
He says now judge suppose I fail  
The judge says budge right into jail  
You better keep her I think it's cheaper  
Then makeing whoopee  
  
You better keep her  
I know it's cheaper than makin' whoopee
