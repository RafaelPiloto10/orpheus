Four train days  
Get me back to New Orleans  
Drink more fish water there  
Than any whale's mama ever seen  
Alright tonight  
I've been fueling my dreams eatin' greens and beans  
When I get back down there  
I'm gonna drink more fish stew  
Than all the big fishes do  
  
And I still want more  
I still want more  
More  
I still want more  
  
Gimme tonight  
Gonna dream my way on back  
Spend my life down there  
Down on that bourbon street  
Watch my money, and mind my legs down in New Orleans  
Can't tell which men's turns women's there  
And which women's just turns mean  
  
And I still want more  
I still want more  
More  
I still want more
