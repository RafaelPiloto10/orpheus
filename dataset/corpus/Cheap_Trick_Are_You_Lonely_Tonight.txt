Sometimes I can tell early in the day  
Sometimes I can sense in an uncanny way  
When things aren't going right  
It looks like just another lonely night  
Wake me when it's over shake me when it's done  
Maybe when the sun comes up I'll find a place to run  
So don't lay there like a fool  
'cause all you have to do is call me  
  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say you're lonely tonight  
'travel 'round the world seen a million girls  
I know I've been around nothin' gets me down  
'cause there's someone out there just like you  
  
Someone's out there just like me too  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say you're lonely tonight  
Baby don't let it don't let it get ya  
Just say the word and I'll be your cover  
  
I'm gonna try to get there today  
Call me and tell me  
You don't need another day  
Lonely night (lonely tonight  
Sometimes I can tell you don't have to say  
  
Sometimes I can sense in an uncanny war  
When things aren't going right  
It looks like just another lonely  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say you're lonely tonight  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say you're lonely tonight
