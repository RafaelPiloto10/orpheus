Well I'm married to the good life  
I said I'd be a good wife  
When I put on this ring  
I drive a new Mercedes  
I play tennis with the ladies  
I buy all the finer things  
But all that don't mean nothing  
When you can't get a good night's loving  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh little rock  
Think I'm gonna have to slip you off  
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot  
There's more to life than what I've got  
Oh little rock  
You know this heart of mine just can't be bought  
I'm gonna find someone who really cares a lot  
When I slip off this little rock  
  
Well I wonder if he'll miss me  
He doesn't even kiss me  
When he comes home at night  
He never calls me honey  
But he sure loves his money  
And I'm the one who pays the price  
But when he finds this ring he'll see  
He keeps everything but me  
  
[Chorus: x2]
