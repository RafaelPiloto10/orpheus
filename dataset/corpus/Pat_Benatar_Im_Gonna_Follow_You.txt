I'm gonna follow you, 'till I wear you down  
I'm gonna follow you, 'cause this here's my town  
You don't know these streets the way that I do (i do, I do)  
You can't turn it on and off the way that I do (i do, I do)  
  
Oh, oh  
  
I'm gonna follow you, 'till I know your timing  
You'll turn some corner soon, and find you can't get by me  
You don't know these streets the way that I do (i do, I do)  
You can't turn it on and off the way that I do (i do, I do)  
  
You see yourself as some kind of lily of the valley  
You come around here in your ballet slippers padding on my alley  
And you know that you can't dance  
Cause you know you never had the chance  
I'm gonna dance for you!  
  
Oh, oh  
  
I'm gonna follow you, 'till I wear you down  
I'm gonna follow you, 'cause this here's my town  
You don't know these streets the way that I do (i do, I do)  
You can't turn it on and off the way that I do (i do, I do)  
  
You see yourself as some kind of lily of the valley  
You come around here in your ballet slippers padding on my alley  
And you know that you can't dance  
Cause you know you never had the chance  
I'm gonna dance for you!  
  
Oh, oh
