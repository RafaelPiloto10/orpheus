[Chorus]  
You know the world is waiting, waiting  
Waiting on 103  
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting  
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting,  
We need some motivation, vation  
So won't you come motivate me?  
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting  
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting,  
  
I done told y'all, and told y'all, and told y'all again  
Play the game, play the game, play the game yeah to win  
I ain't lose, I don't lose, I ain't lose, never lost  
Always on, keepin' on, always on, never off  
  
What the fuck is you hating for like you done something for a nigga?  
Would call you out, but that wouldn't do shit for a nigga  
I made it this far, a fool with my foolish pride  
Look at me what you see? A fool and his foolish ride  
Y'all know damn well I wasn't lettin' you niggas down  
Just to sit back and watch you led by these fuckin' clowns  
Four albums in, niggas still talking this real shit  
Three classics in nigga, and that's on some real shit  
Bitch, I'm legendary, bitch I'm a living legend  
Been through straight hell so I can get street heaven  
Bitch I'm Jeezy, the one you've been waiting for  
And them forges is off-set, don't they look like they skatin' hoe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bitch I was born high, and that's how I'm dying nigga  
Eyes Wide shut with my finger on the cold trigger  
Be hearing my word, now don't it sound like my soul bleeding  
Hearing my word, now don't it sound like my soul reading  
I do it for street niggas and every nigga that's like you  
Let's see if you can afford one, even niggas that buy two  
Can't believe what I'm hearing, can't believe what ya saying  
All that I did, god damn, this how you try to play me  
Feeling my words when I be talking that street talk  
No, you be feeling my words when I be talking that street smart  
Yeah, school of Hard Knocks, yeah bitch I graduated  
Straight to them hard blocks and nothing was barricaded  
  
[Chorus]
