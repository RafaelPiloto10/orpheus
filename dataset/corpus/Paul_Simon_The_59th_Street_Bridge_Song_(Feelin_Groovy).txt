Slow down, you move too fast.  
You got to make the morning last.  
Just kicking down the cobble stones.  
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy.  
  
Hello lamppost, What cha knowing?  
I've come to watch your flowers growing.  
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?  
Doot-in' doo-doo, Feelin' groovy.  
  
Got no deeds to do, No promises to keep.  
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep.  
Let the morning time drop all it's petals on me.  
Life, I love you, All is groovy.
