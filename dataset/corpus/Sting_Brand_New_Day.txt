How many of you people out there  
Been hurt in some kind of love affair?  
And how many times did you swear  
That you'd never love again?  
How many lonely, sleepless nights?  
How many lies, how many fights?  
And why would you want to  
Put yourself through all of that again?  
Love is pain I hear you say  
Love has a cruel and bitter way of  
Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain  
How could it be that what you need the most  
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?  
You never want to feel so sad and lost again  
One day you could be looking  
Through an old book in rainy weather  
You see a picture of her smiling at you  
When you were still together  
You could be walking down the street  
And who should you chance to meet  
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?  
Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey  
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money  
We're starting up a brand new day  
Turn the clock all the way back  
I wonder if she'll take me back  
I'm thinking in a brand new way  
Turn the clock to zero sister  
You'll never know how much I missed her  
I'm starting up a brand new day  
Turn the clock to zero boss  
The river's wide we'll swim across  
We're starting up a brand new day  
It could happen to you,  
Just like it happened to me,  
There is simply no immunity  
There's no guarantee.  
I say love is such a force if you should find yourself in it  
You need some time for reflection  
You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute  
Wait a minute, wait a minute  
Wait a minute, wait a minute  
Turn the clock to zero honey  
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money  
We're starting up a brand new day  
Turn the clock to zero Mac  
I'm begging her to take me back  
I'm thinking in a brand new way  
Turn the clock to zero boss  
The river's wide we'll swim across  
Starting up a brand new day  
Turn the clock to zero buddy  
Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy  
We're starting up a brand new day  
I'm the rhythm in your tune  
I'm the sun and you're the moon  
I'm the bat and you're the cave  
You're the beach and I'm the wave  
I'm the plough and you're the land  
You're the glove and I'm the hand  
I'm the train and you're the station  
I'm the flagpole to your nation  
I'm the present to your future  
You're the wound and I'm the suture  
You're the magnet to my pole  
I'm the devil in your soul  
You're the pupil I'm the teacher  
You're the church and I'm the preacher  
You're the flower I'm the rain  
You're the tunnel I'm the train  
Stand up all you lovers in the world  
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl  
Stand up all you lovers in the world  
We're starting up a brand new day  
You're the crop to my rotation  
You're the sum of my equation  
I'm the answer to your question  
If you follow my suggestion  
We can turn this ship around  
And go up instead of down  
You're the pan and I'm the handle  
You're the flame and I'm the candle  
Stand up all you lovers in the world  
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl  
Stand up all you lovers in the world  
We're starting up a brand new day
