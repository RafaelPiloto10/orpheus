Are you missing something?  
Looking for something?  
Tired of everything  
Searching and struggling  
Are you worried about it?  
Do you wanna talk about it?  
Oh You're gonna get it right some time  
  
There's so much to be scared of  
And not much to make sense of  
Are you running in a circle?  
You can't be too careful  
And you can't relate it  
'Cause it's complicated  
Oh You're gonna get it right some time  
You're gonna get it right some time  
  
It's how you see the world  
How many times can you see?  
You can't believe what you learn  
  
It's how you see the world  
Don't you worry yourself  
Your not gonna get hurt  
  
Oh  
  
Is there something missing?  
There's nobody listening  
Are you scared of what you don't know?  
don't wanna end up on your own?  
You need conversation  
And information  
  
Oh  
  
Gonna get it right sometimes  
You just wanna get it right sometimes  
  
It's how you see the world  
How many times have you heard?  
You can't believe a word  
  
It's how you see the world  
Don't you worry yourself  
'Cause nobody can learn  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
That's how you see the world  
That's how you see the world
