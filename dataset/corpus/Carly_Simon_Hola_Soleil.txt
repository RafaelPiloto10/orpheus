Free my eyes  
Fill the skies  
We've been dancing in your absence  
  
[Chorus]  
Da da da...  
Morning, hola, soleil  
  
We've kept the darkness light  
Dancing for the sun  
To come back and rise up shining  
  
Welcome home  
Mother sun  
Children reaching up like flowers  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We made it through the night  
Knowing you'd return  
To bless us with another morning  
  
Baking sand, shining sea  
Turning world  
Dissolving shadows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Behold the warmth of day  
Rising near the shore  
Hear the music start up playing
