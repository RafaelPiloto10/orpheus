See you moving through the square  
In your motorcycle leather  
Diamonds cascade at your feet  
In an instant we are forever  
  
See you're a rebel with a cause  
No one ever gets close to you  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You're my wild one  
  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Come on stay my little wild one  
Wild one  
Yeah  
  
And you've got a crooked smile  
That takes that chip right off my shoulder  
And though your heart is out of reach  
I know that this world will make you colder  
  
So you're escaping down the road  
Into an outlaw world that only you know  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You're my wild one  
  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Come on stay my little wild one  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You can't stay free  
  
You can't stay mine  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Come on stay my little black swan  
This town seems small and lonely  
  
And you're the property of no one  
Turn again turn around  
All roads lead to London town  
Wild one  
  
Yeah  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You're my wild one  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
  
Come on stay my little wild one  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You can't stay free  
You can't stay mine  
  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Yeah  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
  
Yeah  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Yeah  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
  
Yeah  
Wild one  
Wild one  
Yeah  
  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Yeah  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Yeah  
  
Wild one  
Oh whoa whoa whoa
