[Chorus: x2]  
I ain't no new sensation, no, no  
But I'm better than I ever been  
  
Take a look at my situation  
Tearing it down just to start it up  
I ain't no new sensation  
But I'm better than I ever been  
Used to spend time trying to chase it  
Now I spend time trying to erase it  
I ain't no new temptation  
But I'm better than I ever been  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now take a look at this reputation  
It's not what it is but what it's not  
It ain't some new sensation  
But it keeps getting better and better and  
Used to spend time thinking there's a reason  
Now I spend time knowing I'm in season  
I ain't no new temptation  
But I'm better than I ever been  
  
And I've been running away from you for way too long  
And all my trying, all your lying, all of your crying,  
I kept buying it  
I've waited too long  
  
[Chorus: x2]
