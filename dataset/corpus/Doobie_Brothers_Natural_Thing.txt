People outside my window  
Goin' everywhere  
People that are happy  
People without a care  
We all got to be loved  
It's a nat'ral thing don't you know  
The sooner we find what we need  
Gonna be feeling it, happy to show  
  
I'm gonna change my method  
Get me a big ham bone  
Gonna make all the leaders of the country  
Get it together and bring it on home  
  
We all got to be loved  
It's a nat'ral thing don't you know  
The sooner we find what we need  
Gonna be feeling it, happy to show  
  
Those men in the circus  
Those men on the wire  
Their feet hangin' fifty feet up  
Know they're countin' on their daily luck  
To bring them through the fire
