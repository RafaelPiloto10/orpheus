(Ian Hunter)  
  
Way back in the 50's - you never said a wrong word  
People were clean - people were mean  
Children should be seen, but children should be not heard  
You learned to keep your mouth shut - you did what you were told  
But then one day the radio played the sound that we'd all been waiting for  
The whole of our lives 'n'  
  
I still love Rock 'n' Roll - I play it every day  
Hummin' along, singin' the song  
It's the only way - I know how to say what's on my mind  
  
I get up in the morning - put the kettle on the stove  
Tommy Steele croons a Guy Mitchell tune  
I never felt more like singin' the blues - but if I had to choose  
You know I still love rock 'n' roll  
I still love rock 'n' roll (let me hear ya)  
  
I never been to Lubbock, Texas or Memphis, Tennessee  
I never washed dishes in Macon, Georgia  
I wasn't half as good and I wasn't half as pretty as you  
But I still got the feelings - embedded in my soul  
A rebel armada - Kettering, Granada  
It ain't my fault that I never grew up - I got bitten by your bug  
And I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock  
  
I know what you're thinkin' - it's a little bit strange to you  
I know what you're thinkin' - cause I'm thinkin' the same way too  
But oh those two little four letter words - they're all you need to know  
Cause when it all comes down to it - I don't like the sound of it  
When you mess around with it - I'm still in it for the thrill of it  
I know you tried to kill it but  
  
I still love rock 'n' roll - I play it every day  
Hummin' along - singin' the songs  
It's the only way I know how to say what's on my mind  
  
I get up every morning - I put the coffee on the stove  
The computer's gone - the turntable's on  
I can't believe it's 2001 - God, I must be knockin' on  
But I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock 'n' roll,
