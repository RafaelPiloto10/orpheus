Late that night I awoke from My sleep  
Hearing unknown voices laughing  
Insane  
Grandma' was one, Oh it's coming  
From the room next to mine  
It's Grandma' room... the invisible  
Guests  
As I stood there alone in the dark  
Peeking through the keyhole, couldn't  
Believe My eyes  
I'd never seen anything like it, only  
Grandma' was inside the room  
Speaking to no one... the invisible  
Guests  
Cups were rising in thin air and then  
Emptied on the floor  
Suddenly the door was open and  
Grandma' said  
"Do come in My little friend"  
Missy and Mother were sleeping  
Downstairs  
If they could see me in Grandmother's  
Chair  
  
  
  
  
Grandmother said "look Me deep in  
The eyes  
You will forget what You saw here  
Tonight"  
"I will let You in on the secret of this  
House  
The secret of Amon... that's what we  
Call this house  
Now I want you to go back to sleep,  
Now go back to sleep My dear"  
The invisible guests  
  
  
  
  
Cups were rising in thin air and then  
Emptied on the floor  
Suddenly the door was open and  
Grandma' said  
"Now you must go back to sleep"  
"Go to sleep"... "Go to sleep"...  
"Go to sleep"...  
Missy and Mother were sleeping  
Downstairs  
If they could see me in Grandmother's  
Chair
