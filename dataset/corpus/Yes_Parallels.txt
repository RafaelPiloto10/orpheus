When you've tried most everything and nothing's taking you higher.  
When you come to realize, you've been playing with fire.  
Hear me when I say to you, it's really down to your heart.  
  
It's the beginning of a new love in sight.  
You've got the way to make it all happen.  
Set it spinning turning roundabout.  
Create a new dimension.  
When we are winning we can stop and shout  
Making love towards perfection.  
  
I've been all around the world and seen so many faces.  
Young and old a story told, filling in my spaces.  
Now without a trce of doubt I feel it every hour.  
  
It's the beginning of a new love inside.  
Could be an ever opening flower.  
No hesitation when we're all about  
To build a shining tower.  
No explanations, need to work it out.  
You know we've got the power.  
  
Parallel our sights.  
And we will find, that we, we need, to be, where we, belong.  
Parallel our heights  
Display our rights, and wrongs, and always keep it--STRONG.  
  
It's the beginning of a new love in sight.  
Could be an ever opening flower.  
No explanations, need to work it out.  
You know we've got the power.  
  
It's the beginning of a new love inside.  
You've got the way to make it all happen.  
Set it spinning turning roundabout.  
Create a new dimension.  
When we are winning we can stop and shout  
Making love towards perfection.
