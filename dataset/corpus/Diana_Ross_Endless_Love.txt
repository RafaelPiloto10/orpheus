My love, there's only you in my life  
The only thing that's bright  
  
My first love,  
You're every breath that I take  
You're every step I make  
  
And I, I want to share  
All my love with you  
No one else will do  
  
And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
They tell me how much you care  
Ooh yes,  
You will always be  
My endless love  
  
Two hearts,  
Two hearts that beat as one  
Our lives have just begun  
  
Forever (Oh)  
I'll hold you close in my arms  
I can't resist your charms  
  
And love, oh love  
I'll be a fool, for you I'm sure  
You know I don't mind (Oh)  
You know I don't mind  
  
'Cause you,  
You mean the world to me (Oh)  
I know I know  
I've found, I've found in you  
My endless love  
  
Ohh  
Boom, boom,  
Boom, boom, boom boom, boom,  
Boom, boom, boom boom  
  
Oh, and love oh, love  
I'll be that fool for you I'm sure,  
You know I don't mind  
Oh you know I don't mind  
  
And, yes  
You'll be the only one  
'Cause no one can deny  
This love I have inside  
And I'll give it all to you  
My love, my love, my love  
My endless love
