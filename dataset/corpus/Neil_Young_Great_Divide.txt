In the canyons of the great divide  
Familiar places that we can run and hide  
Are filled with strangers  
Walking in our houses alone  
  
In the great divide  
Nothing to decide  
No one else to care for or love  
In the great divide  
You won't fit in too well  
  
On the horses of the carousel  
She rides alone with you and me  
She rides like she knows  
Wherever she goes, we'll be there  
  
On the carousel  
Life is going well  
Anyone can tell we're in love  
On the carousel  
You're gonna like the way you feel  
  
You and I, we got caught down there  
In the twisted canyons of the great divide  
We walked the floor  
Now we don't go there anymore  
  
In the great divide  
Nothin' to decide  
No one else to care for or love  
In the great divide  
I don't fit in too well  
  
In the great divide  
Nothin' to decide  
No one else to care for or love  
In the great divide  
You won't fit in too well
