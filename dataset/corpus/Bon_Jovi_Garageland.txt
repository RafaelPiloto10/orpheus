I read the paper just the other day  
About a buddy of mine who headed to an early grave  
They say he went in his sleep with a smile on his face  
Bet he was dreaming 'bout better days  
  
When the crash of the drums hit like waves on a beach  
That cheap bass and guitar and our wildest dreams  
We were searching for a savior like anybody else  
Trying to save ourselves from ourselves  
  
Just a garage band, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
  
Our parents all held jobs but we had other plans  
We acted like our heroes they just didn't understand  
And we were never afraid to fall  
It was us and those four walls  
  
Just a garage band, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
Nothing ever felt so right  
Just us, those guitars and a Saturday night  
  
'Cause with a strap on your back, you have wings on your feet  
You felt like a king when you walked down the street  
We heard those old records and knew we belonged  
When the drums hit the groove, we'd all sing along  
  
Just a garage band  
Oh, we were livin' in Garageland  
Just a garage band, oh, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
Nothing ever felt so right  
It was us, those guitars and a Saturday night
