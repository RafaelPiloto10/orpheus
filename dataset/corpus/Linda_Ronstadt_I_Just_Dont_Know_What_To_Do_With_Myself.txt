I just don't know what to do with myself  
Don't know just what to do with myself  
I'm so used to doing everything with you  
Planning everything for two  
And now that we're through  
I just don't know what to do with my time  
I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime  
Going to a movie only makes me sad  
Parties make me feel as bad  
When I'm not with you  
I just don't know what to do  
Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain  
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
Baby if your new love ever turns you down  
Come back I will be around  
Just waiting for you  
I don't know what else to do  
Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain  
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
Baby if your new love ever turns you down  
Come on back I will be around  
Just waiting for you  
I don't know what else to do  
No no no  
I don't know what else to do  
I'm just so crazy for you  
No no no no  
I don't know what else to do  
I don't know what else to do
