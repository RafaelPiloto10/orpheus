Live every moment  
Love every day  
'Cus before you know it  
Your precious time slips away  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
'Cause if you don't  
You might just throw your love away  
  
I walked for seven miles this mornin'  
Footprints in the sand  
Washed away without a warnin'  
When the water hit the land  
But I will walk on until I can no longer stand  
And I'll take you by the hand and we'll...  
  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
'Cus before you know it  
Your precious time slips away  
  
There's water in the wind tonight  
There's a chill in the air  
It's coolin down my skin tonight  
Soakin' through your hair  
There's warmth enough within tonight for both of us to share  
We can take it anywhere and we'll...  
  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
'Cus if you don't  
You might just throw your love away  
  
Sometimes I wish we could take a trip far away  
Leave all this trouble, heartache and pain for another day  
I will search for that place  
But till I find it all I can say is..  
  
Live every moment  
And love every day  
  
Oooh, sometimes I wish we could take a trip far away  
Leave all this trouble, heartache and pain for another day  
I will search for that place  
But till I find it all I can say is...  
  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
'Cus before you know it  
Your precious time slips away  
Live every moment  
Love every day  
'Cus if you don't  
You might just throw your love away  
You might just throw your love away  
You might just throw your love away  
Live every moment  
You got to move every moment  
Don't don't...throw your love away
