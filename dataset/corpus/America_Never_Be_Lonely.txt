Got you by my side,  
I'll never be lonely.  
Got you by my side,  
I'll never be afraid.  
Never be lonely anymore.  
Turn away the fools from my door.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Spent a lot of time,  
Waitin' to find you.  
Spent a lot of time,  
All on my own.  
Could've gone a thousand different ways,  
Watching my nights turn to days.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Here in the middle of now or never,  
Finally found where I belong.  
I could go on like this forever,  
Looking at you, looking at you.  
  
Wasn't I the one,  
Love never came to?  
Wasn't I the one,  
So misunderstood?  
All because my heart wasn't sure.  
Never felt a love like this before.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Here in the middle of now or never,  
Finally found where I belong.  
I could go on like this forever,  
Looking at you, looking at you.  
  
Got me by your side,  
Never be lonely.  
Got me by your side,  
Never be afraid.  
And I will not let you down.  
Keeping both feet on the ground.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.
