(Spoken)  
In the world's mighty gall'ry of pictures  
Hang the scenes that are painted from life  
There's pictures of love and of passion  
And there hangs a pictures of peace and of strife.  
  
There hangs pictures of youth and of beauty'  
Of old age and the blushing young bride  
They all hang on the wall, aw, but the saddest of all  
Are the picture from life's other side.  
  
Chorus: (Sang)  
Yes, te picture from life's other side  
Someone has fell by the way  
A life has gone out with the tide  
Aw, That may have been happy some day.  
  
There a poor old mother at home  
She's watching and waiting alone  
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear  
It's just a picture from life's other side.  
  
(Spoken)  
Now the first scene is that of a gambler  
Who'd lost all of his money playin'  
And then his draws his dead mother's ring from his finger  
That she wore long ago on her wedding day.  
  
Aw, it was his last earthly treasure, but he staked it  
And then he bows his head that his shame he might hide  
Aw, but when they lifted his head, they found he was dead  
That's just a picture from life's other side.  
  
Now the last scene is set down by the river  
Of a heart-broken mother and babe  
And as the harbor lights shine and they shiver  
On an outcast that no one will save.  
  
And yet she was once a true woman  
She was somebody's darlin' and pride  
(Sang)  
God help her, she leaps, for there's no one to weep  
It's just a picture from life's other side...
