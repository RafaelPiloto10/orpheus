I want to know when you're gonna come.  
I want to jump when you want to jump.  
I want to touch where it makes you mine.  
I want to push til I get it right.  
  
'Cause I'm free, free to do the dirty things you like.  
I'm free, free to enough to do what's on my mind.  
When you go down and freak on me.  
That's when I'm free. That's when I'm free.  
  
I want to fall so you can pick me up.  
I want to scream until it hurts.  
But when you think that I can't come up.  
I'm gonna lay you down and show you what's right.  
  
'Cause I'm free, free to do the dirty things you like.  
I'm free, free to enough to do what's on my mind.  
When you go down and freak on me.  
That's when I'm free. That's when I'm free.  
  
I know what you're thinking that you can't deny.  
Don't act like you don't want it, come on you can't lie.  
Let me read your mind so I can come inside.  
So you say you want it, say you want it one more time.  
'cause I'm free...
