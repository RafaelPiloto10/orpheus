Some girls gotta get coco chanel  
Some get the luck of the draw  
I got a girl lookin' naturally well  
Hippest chick you ever saw  
She like wearin' powder and paint  
Wheelin' in a big Seville  
She's big cheese with the maitre D's  
Down at the bar and grill  
Just a girl in a t-shirt  
Girl in a t-shirt  
Her reputation precedes her  
In every boutique around  
They get down on their knees to please her  
She's throwin' that money down  
Now don't get it wrong, please understand  
She's barely keepin' up with the rent  
But the finer labels and her car phone  
Keep her down to her very last cent  
Just a girl in a t-shirt  
Girl in a t-shirt  
Everybody digs her, everybody try  
Once you get past that femme fatale  
Everybody knows she's fine  
I had to get it and quit it and keep a cool head  
It took me a pass or two  
But her code's done cracked I want you to know  
She's my baby through and through  
Just a girl in a t-shirt  
Girl in a t-shirt
