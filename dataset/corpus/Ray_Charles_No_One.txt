(I need someone to say I do)  
No one to cry to now, no one to say goodnight  
No one to tell my troubles to  
  
I've got no one, to sigh to, no one to hold me  
Tight  
No one to cheer me when I'm blue  
  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find there's no one there  
And each night I think of you, so please answer this  
One prayer  
  
And you'll need someone, I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
Someone to whisper I love you  
  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find there's no one there  
And each night I think of you, so please answer this  
One prayer  
  
And you'll need someone, I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
Someone to whisper I love you
