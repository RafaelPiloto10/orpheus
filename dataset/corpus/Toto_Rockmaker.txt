Don't know quite what to say, haven't seen you in seven ages  
Can you tell that it's me, or is my picture on torn out pages?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And you think it's real, but it's just another future deal  
And you know you're right, 'cause you've waited for it all night  
Then you find yourself, sitting on a little shelf  
  
Don't know quite what to do, I've been acting my life in phases  
Is it really true that they're keeping us locked in cages?  
  
Rock maker
