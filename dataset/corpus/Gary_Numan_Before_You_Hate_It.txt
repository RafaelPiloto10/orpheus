Here it comes again  
That old familiar pain  
Here it comes again  
Now it has a name  
What am I to do?  
And where am I to go?  
Here it comes again  
I am not myself  
  
Do you think of me?  
Do you think of me?  
  
Here it comes again  
I'm Tortured and deceived  
Here it comes again  
If only I'd believed  
What am I to say?  
And where am I to die?  
Here it comes again  
And I am not myself  
  
Do you think of me?  
Do you think of me?  
  
I'll tell you something that you don't know  
I'll tell you something that you don't know  
  
Once is always so don't call me  
Once is always so don't call me
