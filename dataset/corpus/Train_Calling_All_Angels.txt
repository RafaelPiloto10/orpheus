I need a sign to let me know you're here  
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere  
I need to know that things are gonna look up  
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup  
  
When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head  
When you feel the world shake from the words that are said  
  
I need a sign to let me know you're here  
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear  
I want a reason for the way things have to be  
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me  
  
And I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels  
  
When children have to play inside so they don't disappear  
And private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years  
And football teams are kissing Queens  
And losing sight of having dreams  
In a world that what we want is only what we want until it's ours  
  
I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels
