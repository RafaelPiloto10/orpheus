Birthday boy  
Can't explain  
Christmas Eve  
He's born again  
  
On the line  
A broken train  
Going nowhere  
Endless rain  
  
Birthday Boy  
So afraid  
Plays the machines  
In the arcade  
  
Oh baby do you remember  
He's been through all this before?  
Spent the summer  
Getting nowhere  
Taking all of the blame  
For the city  
Calculating  
From pain comes pity  
  
Christmas Eve  
A time of joy  
If you believe  
In Birthday Boy  
  
This time around  
It's all a mistake  
Is he deluded  
Or just a fake?  
  
Oh baby do you remember  
He's been through all this before?  
Spent the summer  
Getting nowhere  
Taking all of the blame  
For the city  
Calculating  
From pain comes pity  
  
If you knew his name  
Would you feel the same?  
If you knew his name?  
  
Birthday boy  
Stands apart  
As the drama's  
About to start  
  
A quick betrayal  
A speedy trial  
As before  
Complete denial  
  
Oh baby do you remember  
He's been through all this before?  
Spent the summer  
Getting nowhere  
Taking all of the blame  
For the city  
Calculating  
From pain comes pity  
  
If you knew his name  
Would you feel the same?
