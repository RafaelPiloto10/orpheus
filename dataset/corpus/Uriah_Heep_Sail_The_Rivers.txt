Would you give me  
One more chance  
If I agree to your demands  
Or will you turn the knife  
  
Keep me in pain till  
I can't take no more  
Would you take the breath of my life  
Or are you lookin' for something  
  
I never do right  
I should be the one to let go  
I could free your body and soul  
So here we stand  
  
Like actors in a play  
On an empty stage  
Not knowin' what to say  
I tried so hard to get through to you  
  
'Cause don't you know I still need you  
Oh, I need you  
If I ask for one more night  
  
Would you let me bathe in your light  
Would you let me cover you up  
And wrap myself around you  
So you feel my love  
  
Is this just the heat of the day  
Or am I really feelin' this way  
I see your silent tears  
Before the storm  
  
I feel the breeze  
From a love that's gone  
You've always walked  
On the open sand  
  
You'd risk it all so  
I'd reach out my hand  
I tried so hard to hold on to you  
'Cause don't you know I still need you  
  
Sail the river and drift away  
Find yourself on another day  
Don't reach out  
You have to hold me in bay  
  
'Cause I will always follow you  
Take a knife and cut me down  
Spill my blood  
Watch it fall to the ground  
  
There's no way to turn me around  
'Cause I will always follow you  
Be a part of you  
If I was to offer my life  
  
I'd give it up just to  
Bathe in your light  
And you could have it  
You could have it all  
  
My heart, my body, my soul  
Is this just the heat of the day  
Or am I really feelin' this way  
I wipe away the tears  
  
Before the storm  
I feel the breeze  
From a love that's gone  
So here we stand  
  
Nothing left to say  
I give it all but you turn me away  
I tried so hard to get through to you  
Sail the river and drift away  
  
Find yourself on another day  
Sail the river and drift away  
'Cause I will always follow you  
I will always be a part of you  
  
Sail the river and drift away  
Sail the river and drift away  
Sail the river ...
