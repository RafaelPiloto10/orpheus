YOWWW! Ha!  
We look to the left and to the right.  
We need help but nobody's in sight.  
Where is the man that we all need?  
Well tell him he's to come, and rescue me.  
  
[Chorus]  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow,  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow.  
Ken is the man that we all need,  
Ken is the leader of the GLC.  
  
Now head 'em up,  
Rope 'em in,  
Move 'em out.  
Now can't you see  
That we need the leader of the GLC?  
  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow,  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow.  
Ken is the man that we all need,  
Ken is the leader of the GLC.  
  
Who is the man we all need?  
(KEN!)  
Who is the funky sex machine?  
(KEN!)  
Who is the leader of the GLC?  
(KEN!)  
Who is the man we all need?  
(KEN!)  
  
Now head 'em up,  
Rope 'em in,  
Move 'em out.  
(KEN!)  
Can't you see  
That we need ah-ah-ah-ah-ah?  
  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow,  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow.  
Ken is the man that we all need.  
Ken is the WAHWHAYEAYEAYEAYEA!  
  
Who is the man we all need?  
(KEN!)  
(KEN!)  
  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow,  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow.  
Ken is the man that we all need,  
Ken is the leader of the GLC!
