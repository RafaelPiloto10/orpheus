Search through the years  
And you wipe away the tears  
To find a woman, not a girl  
Just that feeling, like the beginning of the world  
  
Beginning of the world  
  
And your love flows down like a river  
'Til it reaches down to the sea  
And it's then you start to thinking  
Will the water, will the water cover me?  
  
Woman oh woman  
Don't bury me alive  
Just make me feel I've the right to survive  
Woman oh woman  
I hope that you can see  
This is nothing like our love was meant to be  
Love was meant to be  
  
You search through the years  
And you wipe away the tears  
To find a woman, not a girl  
But a feeling, like the beginning of the world  
  
Woman oh woman  
Don't bury me alive  
Just make me feel I've the right to survive  
Woman oh woman  
I hope that you can see  
This is nothing like our love was meant to be  
  
Woman oh woman  
Woman oh woman  
Woman oh woman  
Woman oh woman  
  
Woman oh woman  
Oh woman
