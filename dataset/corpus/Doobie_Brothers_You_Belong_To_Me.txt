Why'd you tell me this  
While you look for my reaction  
What do you need to know  
Don't you know I'll always be the one  
  
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers  
I've got lovin' eyes of my own  
You belong to me  
In this life  
  
Anyone could tell  
Any fool can see who you need  
I know you all too well  
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers  
I've got lovin' eyes and I can tell  
  
You belong to me  
Tell him you were foolin'  
You belong to me  
You belong to me  
Tell him he's a stranger  
You belong to me
