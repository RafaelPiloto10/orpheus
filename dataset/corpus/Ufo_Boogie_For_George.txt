Goin' down to George's where you just have been  
To see if you've been boogie-ing, ah you know what I mean  
My left leg's dragging my right leg's limp  
My heads so wavy and I can't feel it  
I gotta see you baby, you'll be alright  
I want to boogie baby, boogie tonight  
  
Well old George is boogie-ing he's been a boogie-ing with you  
Ah I want to boogie with you baby  
I want to boogie all night long  
I want to move with you I want to move  
I want to shake, want to boogie too  
I want to boogie...boogie
