  
What a wonderful change in my life has been brought  
Since Jesus came into my heart  
I had lied in my soul for so long I have sought  
When Jesus came into my heart  
  
Since Jesus came into my heart  
Since Jesus came into my heart  
Floods of joy fill my soul like  
When sea billows roll  
Since Jesus came into my heart  
  
Floods of joy filled my soul like when sea billows roll  
Since Jesus came into my heart
