You parting words still echo clear on the day you left me  
If you need me I'll be there, you said you'd always help me  
  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
  
L can't seem to satisfy anyone around me  
You hold my hand and see me through  
All the things that bound me  
  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
  
I'm calling you now (oh now I need you)  
Calling you now (oh how I need you)  
Please come to me now  
I need you  
I need you (oh how l need you)  
I need you (oh how I need you)  
I need you (oh how I need you)  
I need you (oh how I need you)  
Oh how I need you, oh how I need you  
  
Having learned to live with you  
It's hard to live without you  
You always said if I were down,  
To cheer me you would be around  
  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you  
L need you, l need you right now  
  
I'm calling you now  
(oh how I need you)  
Calling you now  
(oh how I need you)  
Please come to me now  
(oh how I need you)  
Please come to me now  
(oh how I need you) I need you now  
(oh how I need you)
