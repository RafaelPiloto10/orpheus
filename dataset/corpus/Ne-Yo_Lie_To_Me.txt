Lie to me [Repeat: x7]  
Lie  
  
I just want to be numb  
I don't want to feel a thing  
I don't want reality  
Actually, reality stinks  
How about we just pretend,  
  
That your cellphone didn't even ring  
And that I wasn't on the other side of the door  
Listening to everything.  
Tell me another lie  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna know what I know to be true,  
What I need you to do, tell me another lie,  
I don't wanna know what I know to be true,  
What I need you to do, tell me another lie,  
I don't wanna know what I know to be true,  
What I need you to do, tell me another lie,  
I don't wanna know what I know to be true,  
What I need you to do, tell me another lie  
  
Lie to me [Repeat: x7]  
Lie  
  
Please make me believe  
That there is nobody for you and me  
When I ask who where you talking to  
Tell me it was Kimberly  
Tell me the last night you didn't leave  
After you thought I was asleep  
Crept back in that six-forty five  
Tell me it was just a dream  
  
Baby I need, desperately, desperately  
To believe you  
Cause I won't be held responsible  
For what, what I might do  
Baby I need, desperately, desperately  
To believe you  
Cause I wont be held responsible  
For what, what I might to do tell me another lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Tell me another lie  
  
I don't wanna know what I know to be true,  
What I need you to do, tell me another lie,  
I don't wanna know what I know to be true,  
What I need you to do, tell me another lie,  
I don't wanna know what I know to be true,  
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
