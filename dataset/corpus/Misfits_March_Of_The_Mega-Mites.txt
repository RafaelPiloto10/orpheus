(Oh) We're cursed from a time so long ago  
This my son, you should know  
The quakes we've been having at night  
Is the birth of the Mega-Mites  
Centennial breeding in the midnight sun  
Caused by a war, never won  
Mistakes of a man in the past  
Results of a nuclear blast  
  
Man versus man, land against land  
Life blew apart from greed in their hearts  
  
Every hundred years they're born again  
Feeding on women, children and men  
The day of the coming is tonight  
The year of the Mega-Mite  
The live tonight, but they'll die tomorrow  
One days suffering, pain and sorrow  
The only safe place is the sea  
Just a legend of history  
  
Man verses Mite, winless fight  
Wars begun, we pray for the sun  
  
Do you feel the march of the Mega-Mites  
Crashing down cities in the distant night  
Feel the ground rumbling beneath your feet  
The march is on, now you see them start to eat  
Prepare the men for the ride, it is time to fight  
Unholy war, human race versus Mega-Mite  
Our only way to the sea, man's victory  
We mustn't fear, we must charge, it's our destiny  
  
Cursed from the start, we ride to their heart  
Fight or be damned, maybe our last stand  
  
Ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
Ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
  
With hope in our eyes, we're eaten like flies  
The menacing monsters arrive  
Killing us all, we must stand tall  
Fighting just to say alive  
Must survive, cannot hide  
  
So we ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
Yeah, we ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
  
Ride in the night, fight for your life  
Charging the mighty beasts  
Death is at hand, life is a stand  
Mega-Mites enjoying a feast, retreat  
  
So we ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
Ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
  
The war is lost, our lives it cost  
Humans head for the sea  
The Mites have won, until the sun  
Rises up over the east, no more feast, for the beasts have deceased  
  
Now my son you know of the Mega-Mites  
100 years they'll be back to live at night  
Tell your son to pass on the holy word  
Or human life will be gone, it must be heard  
Man is not the only one to rule the earth  
Like he was in the past from the day of birth  
The Mega-Mites are always in victory  
Man is not, he goes home, back to the sea  
Back to the sea, back to the sea, back to the sea
