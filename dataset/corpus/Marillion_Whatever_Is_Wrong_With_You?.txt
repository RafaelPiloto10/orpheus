We need to talk.. about the way you've been behaving  
We need to talk.. about the Christmas lights in your clothes  
We need to talk.. about the stranger in the kitchen  
We need to talk.. about the scissors and the silver foil  
I thank God..  
You're so fabulously..  
Odd  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me  
So right for me  
  
We need to talk.. about the wedding cake, and the wet-suit  
We need to talk.. about the policeman down the hall  
You're truly strange  
But it wouldn't do for us all to be the same  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me  
Just right for me  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me  
So right  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me.
