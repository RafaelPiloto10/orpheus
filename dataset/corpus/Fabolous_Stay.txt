[Chorus]  
I've got some things to say, oh  
Please don't go, oh  
So don't you turn away, oh  
Please don't go, oh  
I need you here to stay, I  
Miss you so  
  
My daddy left me, and he ain't even die  
So when he did go, I ain't even cry  
I had reason, but that ain't even why  
How could he have failed if he ain't even try  
I ask no questions, I ain't even pry  
Truthfully I wanted to I can't even lie  
Like a canceled flight, that ain't even fly  
To just walk away, like you ain't even my  
Like, like, like I ain't even your  
I cant even say it, I ain't even sure  
He shoulda gave me everything and left me even more  
But he left me without saying what he was leavin' for  
And that's when I became a man  
And that's the day he stopped bein' one  
This year I became a father  
And I'm a die bein' one, whats up son  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I have nightmares of me not bein' round  
He took his first steps and daddy couldn't be in town  
Daddy's entertaining everybody  
But missed out when it came to trainin' for the potty  
I give a fuck about hip-hops new beef  
I was more excited when my son grew teeth  
So I same the problem  
Of the famous stardom  
Just like Em and Haily  
Just like Game and Harlem  
Weezy's at the awards with Miss. Carter  
Nah not his date, i'm talkin' bout his daughter  
Now that's stuntin' like your daddy  
Cause its crazy when you wanna be nothin' like your daddy  
And if you never been a man  
That's the day you start bein' one  
This year I became a father  
And I'm a die bein' one, whats up son  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So hear the truth remain to let me go  
I wont hold that against you, I moved on  
Just look what I become since you been gone  
Now don't you turn away, oh, please don't go  
Here's what I got to say, oh  
Please don't go  
oh why'd you go away, oh  
Please don't go  
I needed you here to stay, oh  
Please don't go  
I cant believe this day, oh  
Please don't go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why did you leave me?  
Tell me why you don't care  
Daddy tell me why did you leave me  
Why you don't care?  
Tell me why did you leave me  
Daddy tell me why you weren't there  
Why did you leave me?
