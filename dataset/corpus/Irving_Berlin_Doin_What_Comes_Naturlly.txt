Folks are dumb where I come from  
They ain't had any learnin'  
Still they're happy as can be  
  
Doin' what comes naturally  
Doin' what comes naturally  
  
Folks like us could never fuss  
With schools and books and learnin'  
Still we've gone from A to Z  
  
Doin' what comes naturally  
Doin' what comes naturally  
  
You don't have to know how to read or write  
When you're out with a feller in the pale moonlight  
You don't have to look in a book to find  
What he thinks of the moon or what is on his mind  
  
That comes naturally  
That comes naturally  
  
My uncle out in Texas  
Can't even write his name  
He signs his checks with X's  
But they cash 'em just the same  
  
If you saw my pa and ma  
You'd no they had no learnin'  
Still they raised a family  
  
Doin' what comes naturally  
Doin' what comes naturally  
  
Uncle Jed has never read  
An almanac on drinkin'  
Still he's always on a spree  
  
Doin' what comes naturally  
Doin' what comes naturally  
  
Sister Sal who's mus-i-cal  
Has never had a lesson  
Still she's learned to sing off-key  
  
Doin' what comes naturally  
Doin' what comes naturally  
  
You don't have to go to a private school  
Not to pick up a penny by a stubborn mule  
You don't have to have a professor's dome  
Not to go for the honey when the bee's at home  
  
That comes naturally  
That comes naturally  
  
My tiny baby brother  
Who's never read a book  
Knows one sex from the other  
All he had to do was look  
  
Grandpa Bill is on the hill  
With someone he just married  
There he is at ninety-three  
  
Doin' what comes naturally  
Doin' what comes naturally  
  
Sister Lou ain't got a sou  
Although she goes out shoppin'  
She gets all her stockings free  
  
Doin' what comes naturally  
Doin' what comes naturally  
  
Cousin Nell can't add or spell  
But she left school with honors  
She got every known degree  
  
For doin' what comes naturally  
Doin' what comes naturally  
  
You don't have to come from a great big town  
Not to clean out a stable in an evening gown  
You don't have to mix with the Vanderbilt's  
Not to take off your panties when you're wearing kilts  
  
That comes naturally  
That comes naturally  
  
My mother's cousin Carrie  
Won't ever change her name  
She doesn't want to marry  
And her children feel the same  
  
Sister Rose has lots of beaus  
Although we have no parlor  
She does fine behind a tree  
  
Doin' what comes naturally  
Doin' what comes naturally
