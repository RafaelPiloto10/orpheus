Do you remember when (remember when)  
Do you  
Do you remember when (remember when)  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you remember when  
I met you girl everything was alright  
Do you remember when  
We got a room we was fucking all night  
Do you remember the time girl  
Like I remember the time girl  
  
Girl you my type you just right  
That blouse on you fit just right  
Them jeans she got on skin tight  
Shes sexy cool but still shy  
I'm colder than a Klondike  
Bipolar I got dumb ice  
We know each other we go together  
Like hamburgers and french fries  
Everything's all right  
We'll never have a fist fight  
But last night we had a sex fight  
Then told her have blessed night  
I'm leaning I'm meanin'  
I fall asleep might have dreams in it  
Did the club thing, brought my team in it  
Last night I bring my queen in it  
I go get it you bullshitter's  
I hit it, damn right the kid did it  
You hood critters and hood chickens  
Please stay out my business  
From south France to south Philly  
A.T.L. to north Memphis  
From my city to your city  
Think you got more swag but not really  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo yo yo  
I'ma put it down so  
Gucci gon' wake up sore  
Ironic its gon' hurt  
But when I'm gone  
It'll make you want more  
Scented aura candles  
I pull up in my Lambo  
The best sex that you never had  
Two bad streets off the main road  
You had her but she left so  
That's just the way the game go  
No one on my level  
So please get up out on my lane holmes  
I met a girl so real no need to bring no game home  
Reminisce of Gucci every time they play my same song  
I'm on her like a long john  
Short skirt with no thongs on  
Sexy naked sunbathing outside my house with frames on  
I took her from some busters?  
And that boy ain't gon' shit bout it  
Its alright we can tell that sucka to forget about it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girls to my right  
Ladies to my left  
The weathers so hot  
Snows on my chest  
When I see this fly girl  
Tried to get her number  
Then she tells me  
I already smashed last summer  
Mile high club G 5 planes  
Remember back rubs and pink champagne  
Mile high club G 5 planes  
Remember back rubs and pink champagne  
  
Do you remember when  
I met you girl everything was alright  
Do you remember when  
We got a room we was fucking all night  
Do you remember the time girl  
Like I remember the time girl  
  
Do you remember when (remember when)  
Do you  
Do you remember when (remember when)
