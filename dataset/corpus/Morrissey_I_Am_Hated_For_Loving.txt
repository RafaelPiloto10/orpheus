I am hated for loving  
I am hated for loving  
Anonymous call, a poison pen  
A brick in the small of the back again  
I still don't belong  
To anyone, I am mine  
  
And I am hated for loving  
I am haunted for wanting  
Anonymous call, a poison pen  
A brick in the ah  
A brick in the small of the back again  
I still don't belong  
To anyone, I am mine  
  
I am falling  
With no one to catch me  
I am falling  
And there's still  
No one to catch me  
Ah  
Anonymous call, a poison pen  
A brick in the ah  
A brick in the small of the back again  
I just don't belong  
To anywhere  
I just don't belong  
Mmm  
Ah
