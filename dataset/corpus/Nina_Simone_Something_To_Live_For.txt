I have almost ev'ry thing a human could desire,  
Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire  
But there's something missing,  
Something isn't there,  
It seems I'm never kissing the one whom I care for.  
I want Something To Live For  
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream  
Oh, what wouldn't I give for  
Someone who'd take my life  
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.  
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?  
My eye is watching the noon crowds  
Searching the promenades seeking a clue  
To the one who will someday be my  
Something To Live For.  
I want Something To Live For  
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream  
Oh, what wouln't I give for  
Someone who'd take my life  
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.  
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?  
My eye is watching the noon crowds  
Searching the promenades seeking a clue  
To the one who will someday be my Something To Live For.
