They got money, they got sun  
They look like they're havin' fun  
Don't it seem it's so unfair  
They know something you don't know  
They've got a better place to go  
They're thin and rich and they don't care  
  
We get the dreams that we deserve  
The magazines that we deserve  
Page one and three that we deserve  
  
The joy and the pain that we deserve  
The sun and the rain that we deserve  
The material gain that we deserve  
We get what we deserve  
  
They got tension, they got stress  
They got their lives in the press  
The whole world stares as they undress  
Sold their friends to get ahead  
They do therapy instead  
They've got demons in their bed  
  
We get the toys that we deserve  
The quiet and the noise that we deserve  
The girls and the boys that we deserve  
  
We get what we want if we really want it  
We get what we want if we're really honest  
You know what you are  
You know what you want  
You know what you deserve  
  
We get the seas that we deserve  
The flowers and the trees that we deserve  
The spores on the breeze that we deserve  
  
We get what we want if we really want it  
We get what we want if we're really honest  
You know what you are  
You know what you want  
You know what you deserve  
You deserve  
We get what we deserve  
We deserve
