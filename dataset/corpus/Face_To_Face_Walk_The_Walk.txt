I could be like you  
I could be alone and jaded  
Wondering what to do until they say  
I could be like you  
Angry and intoxicated  
Wondering what to do to make them pay  
  
And will I find a way  
Can I make them see  
And make them all believe you're wrong  
Your ill intentions don't belong  
  
I hear you talk the talk  
But I don't see you walk the walk  
And I still don't believe a thing you say
