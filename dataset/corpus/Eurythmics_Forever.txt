Forever  
Now that you're gone  
Gone forever  
But the day goes on forever  
When we were young with time to waste  
Everything was clear and good  
Thought we could live for a thousand years  
But yesterday is done and tomorrow's yet to come  
You'll never know  
Forever  
Now that you're gone  
Gone forever  
But the day goes on forever  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Forever  
And I remember when we were fools  
Everything was me and you  
Thought we were kings with time to kill  
But yesterday is done and tomorrow's yet to come  
You live and learn  
Some people never take the time to try  
The way you live's the way you die  
The stuff of life's in short supply  
And if it sometimes hits you strong  
Remembering that things go wrong  
The song of life is just a song  
And everything goes on and on  
Forever  
Now that you're gone  
Gone forever  
But the day goes on forever  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Forever
