You think it's all the same but I want you to believe I could be  
So like you  
By now you've figured out that I want you educated cause it's  
So like you  
  
Because it's all the same  
I could be something like you  
Because it's all the same  
Watch you kill for me  
  
Everytime I want to and everyday I will be  
So like you  
Hitting on the helpless smoking with the infants cause it's  
Just like you  
  
So hidden in the picture  
I'm wrapping the world around me  
They've been insisting there's no difference between us  
  
Don't listen turn around  
People might just see you  
Now make yourself a part of me  
A part of me to let you go
