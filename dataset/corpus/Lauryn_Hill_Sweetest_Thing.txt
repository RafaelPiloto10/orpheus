The sweetest thing I've ever known  
Was like the kiss on the collarbone  
Soft caress of happiness  
The way you walk your style of dress  
I wish I didn't get so weak  
Ooo baby just to hear you speak  
Makes me argue just to see  
How much you're in love with me  
See like a queen a queen upon her throne  
  
[Chorus]  
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know  
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know  
  
I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)  
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay  
Warm as the sun dipped in black  
Fingertips on the small of my back  
More valuable than all I own  
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was the, ah  
I tried to explain  
Ah, but baby, it's in vain  
  
Speaking on my mother's phone  
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)  
Sweet prince of the ghetto  
Your kisses taste like amaretto  
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating  
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end  
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone  
  
[Chorus]
