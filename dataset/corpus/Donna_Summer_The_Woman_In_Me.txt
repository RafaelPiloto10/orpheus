Dancin' close feelin' restless  
It's a slow sultry night  
It'll take a lifetime til sunrise  
If you won't stay with me tonight  
Feel your breath caress my shoulder  
As your heart reads my mind  
You don't have to tell me anything  
I can see everything in your eyes  
It's so easy with you  
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me  
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in me  
Baby there's so much no man has ever touched of the woman in me  
I might be trembling,  
But I'm not scared  
Just my desire breaking free  
I've never had a chance like this before  
To unlock all the doors to the woman in me  
It's so easy with you  
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me  
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free  
To be the woman in me  
Like the dark side of the full moon  
I've never shown what I've showing to you  
It's so easy with you  
I don't need an excuse  
To be the woman in me  
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in me  
It's so easy with you  
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me  
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in  
Me
