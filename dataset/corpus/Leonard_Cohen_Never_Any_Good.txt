I was never any good at loving you  
I was never any good at coming  
Through for you  
You're going to feel much better  
When you cut me loose forever  
I was never any good  
Never any good  
I was never any good at loving you  
  
I was dying when we met  
I bet my life on you  
But you called me and I folded  
Like you knew I'd do  
You called my ace, my king, my bluff  
Okay, you win, enough's enough  
I was never any good  
Never any good  
I was never any good at loving you  
  
I was pretty good at taking out  
The garbage  
Pretty good at holding up the wall  
Dealing with the fire and the earthquake  
But that don't count  
That don't count  
That don't count for nothing much at all  
  
I was never any good at loving you  
I was just a tourist in your bed looking  
At the view  
But I can't forget where my lips  
Have been  
Those holy hills, that deep ravine  
I was never any good  
Never any good  
I was never any good at loving you  
  
I was pretty good at taking out the garbage  
Pretty good at holding up the wall  
I'm sorry for my crimes against  
The moonlight  
I didn't think  
I didn't think  
I didn't think the moon would mind at all  
  
I was never any good at loving you  
At doing what a woman really wants  
A man to do  
You're going to feel much better  
When you cut me loose forever  
I was never any good  
Never any good  
I was never any good at loving you
