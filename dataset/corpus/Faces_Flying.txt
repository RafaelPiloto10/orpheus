I'm flying  
Across the ocean  
And I'm soaring  
Back home  
To the place I was born  
And probably raised.  
And I'm flying  
Across the mountains and valleys,  
Back home to the one that I love so happily.  
  
Can ya blame me for feeling homesick  
'Cause I've been away such a very long long time  
I served a while in the county jail  
Five years for being hungry tired and poor  
  
On and on  
Yes I will follow  
With your buttons and bows.
