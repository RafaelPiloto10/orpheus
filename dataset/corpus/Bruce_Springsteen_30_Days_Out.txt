We fell in love and I made you the world  
I spent all my time tryin' to satisfy you, girl  
Just one thing that I can't figure out  
Closer I get, farther baby I am out  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
The roof was leakin' honey where we live  
And I'm wonderin' what's that something that you won't give  
I started loving you but I gotta stop  
You got me mostly waitin' for that other shoe to drop  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
You keep me six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
Tried to talk about what's goin' on  
You just smile and tell me "Baby there ain't nothin' wrong"  
In your smile there's a sign in red  
It said "Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead"  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
Yeah I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt  
  
30 days, 30 days out  
Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out  
30 days, 30 days out  
With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt
