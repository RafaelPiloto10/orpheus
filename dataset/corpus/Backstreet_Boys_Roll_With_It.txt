Roll with it  
Roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
  
If you ever feel like no one cares  
When you try your best but you get nowhere  
Don't give in  
'Cause the times will come again  
When they criticize every move you make  
And you've had as much as you're gonna take  
Don't you worry  
Soon enough things will change  
  
Bridge  
  
And when it seems as though  
Nobody understands a man  
(understands)  
Don't let your head hang down  
You want to just stick to the plan  
  
[Chorus]  
Roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Roll with it  
Just roll, roll, roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
  
Just roll with it  
Everything will be fine  
Just roll with it  
It's gonna be alright  
Just roll with it  
Don't put yourself down  
Just roll with it  
  
If you just can't find someone to trust  
When you give your heart but you don't get much  
Don't you worry the time is gonna come  
  
The world's a school  
So much to learn  
So learn it well  
The world's a stage  
So act the fool  
No woman understands  
You've got to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Everybody just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Come on now  
Just roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Just roll with it  
Backstreet says  
Roll with it  
Come on y'all  
Roll with it  
  
All the fellas roll  
Roll with it  
All the ladies roll  
Roll with it  
Everybody roll  
You've got to roll with it  
Just roll  
Roll with it  
Just roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
You've got to  
You've got to  
You've got to  
Roll  
  
Everybody  
Anybody  
Everybody roll with it  
Everybody  
Anybody  
Everybody roll  
Everybody roll  
Everybody roll
