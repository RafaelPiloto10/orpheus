Can't believe my eyes  
Could they possibly be deceiving me on the other side  
Of the picture screen your kissing  
Somebody  
  
I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
And she's nothing like me  
  
How long must I wait for my jealousy to take a break?  
You know it's so unlike me to secretly wanna fight with faith  
It's really you that I hate  
  
But I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
And she's nothing like me  
  
I wanna know what this means  
There remains a slate to be clean  
Please don't' let this, don't let become  
The death of me  
  
Forgive me  
Forgive me
