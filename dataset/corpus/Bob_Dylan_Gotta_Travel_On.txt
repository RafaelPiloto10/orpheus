Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long  
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on  
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long  
And it seems like I've got to travel on  
And it seems like I've got to travel on  
  
Papa writes to Johnny, Johnny can't come home  
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home  
Papa writes to Johnny, Johnny can't come home  
Johnny's been out on the road too long  
So I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long  
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on  
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long  
And it seems like I've got to travel on  
  
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way  
Going home to stay, going home to stay  
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way  
And I feel like I just want to travel on  
So I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long  
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on  
Oh yes I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long  
And it seems like I've got to travel on  
  
There's a lonesome freight at 6:08 coming through the town  
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound  
There's a lonesome freight at 6:08 coming on through the town  
And I feel like I just want to travel on  
Well I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long  
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on  
Yes it is done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long  
And it seems like I almost travel on
