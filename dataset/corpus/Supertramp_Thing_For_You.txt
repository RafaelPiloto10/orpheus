Oh Lordy I got to feelin' so cold  
You know the mornin' it ain't too good for my soul  
I've been workin' an' in some faraway place  
I got to thinkin' about your sweet smilin' face  
I got a thing for you, if you want me to  
Gonna change all my ways  
I'm gonna get off the road, I'm gonna lighten my load  
I got a thing for you, can you feel it too?  
I think I better slow down  
All my wandering's done, I found my place in the sun  
Ah woman, why d'you treat me this way?  
You don't believe a single word that I say  
But it's the truth now, you know I'll be home for good  
So what's with you now, I thought that you understood  
I got a thing for you, if you want me to  
Gonna change all my ways  
Gonna get off the road, I'm gonna lighten my load  
There ain't a woman alive could ever come close to you  
I won't know how to survive, so don't you fake with my view  
You say I'm putting you on and soon you'll be on your way  
Well woman you're wrong and that is all I can say, all I can say  
I got a thing for you, an' if you want me to  
Gonna change all my ways  
Gonna get off the road, I'm gonna lighten my load  
I got a thing for you, can you feel it too?  
I think I better slow down  
All my wandering's done, I found my place in the sun  
I got a thing for you  
If you want me to, gonna change all my ways  
I'm gonna get off the road, I'm gonna lighten my load
