Now I feel the time is right  
Love will flow like wine tonite  
Give your love and it will come to you  
If you feel that you and me  
Could escape and hold the key  
To a paradise that's true and free  
  
Chorus:  
Steal away, steal away  
Steal away--the night  
You gotta steal it  
C'mon baby  
  
Now I've met your honesty  
You are here and I am free  
Broken chains have fallen all around  
Point my finger at the fools  
Broken chains and broken rules  
Let it be rebellion rules tonite  
  
Chorus:  
Steal away, you gotta steal away  
Steal away--the night  
  
Solo  
  
Can it be a dream come true  
Now that I am here with you  
Tearful eyes of joy is something new  
Runaway with me tonight  
Dream the dream and light the light  
Happiness is what you give to me  
Oooooh yeah!!  
  
Chorus:  
Steal away, steal away  
You gotta steal away--the night  
(3 times)
