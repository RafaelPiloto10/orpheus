Christopher Robin and I walked along,  
Under branches lit up by the moon.  
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore,  
  
As the days disappeared far too soon.  
Now I wandered much further today than I should,  
And I can't find my way to the three-acre wood.  
So help me if you can, I've got to get  
  
Back to the house At Pooh Corner by one.  
You'll be surprised, there's so much to be done,  
Count all the bees in the hive,  
Chase all the clouds from the sky,  
  
Back to the days of Christopher Robin,  
And Pooh.  
Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do,  
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose.  
  
He came to me asking help and advice,  
And from here no one knows where he goes.  
So I went in to ask of the Owl, if he's there,  
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear.  
  
So help me if you can I've got to get,  
Back to the house At Pooh Corner by one.  
You'll be surprised there's so much to be done,  
Count all the bees in the hive,  
  
Chase all the clouds from the sky,  
Back to the days of Christopher Robin,  
Back to the ways of Christopher Robin,  
And Pooh.
