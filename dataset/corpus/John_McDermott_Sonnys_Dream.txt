Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong  
Sonny lives on a farm in a wide open space  
Kick off your sneakers and let go the race  
And you can lay down your head by a sweet river bed  
But Sonny always remembers what it was his mama said  
Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong  
Sonny carries a load, though he's barely a man  
There ain't much to do, yet he does what he can  
He watches the sea from a room by the stairs  
The waves keep on rollin', they've done that for years  
Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong  
It's a hundred miles to town, Sonny's never been there  
Yet he goes to the highway and stands there and stares  
And the mail comes at four and the mailman is old  
But he still keeps his dreams full of silver and gold  
Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong  
Sonny's dreams can't be real, they're just stories he's read  
They're just stars in his eyes, they're just dreams in his head  
Still he longs in his mind for the wild world outside  
And I know I can't hold him though I've tried  
And I've tried, and I've tried  
Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong
