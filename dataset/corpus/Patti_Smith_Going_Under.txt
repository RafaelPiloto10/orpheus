Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing again  
Let's go under where the sun beams  
Let's go under my friend  
  
Are we sleeping  
Are we dreaming  
Are we dancing again  
Is it heaven  
Crack it open  
And we'll slide down  
Its stream  
  
We can hold on (I'm sure)  
To the sea's foaming mane  
It will serve us  
We'll surface  
And we'll plunge back again  
  
Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing like a flame  
There's no burning where the sun beams  
Oh it's such a lovely game  
  
Does the sea dream (I'm sure)  
We are here, we attend  
We are bells on the shore  
Where the tolling suspends  
  
Who will decide the shape of things  
The shift of being  
Who will perceive  
When life is new  
Shall we divide and become another  
Who is due for gift upon gift  
Who will decide  
Shall we swim over and over  
The curve of a wing  
Its destination ever changing  
  
Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing like a flame  
Let's go waltzing on the water  
Let's go under again  
  
Let's go under  
Going under
