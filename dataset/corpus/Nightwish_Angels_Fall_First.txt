An angelface smiles to me  
Under a headline of tragedy  
That smile used to give me warmth  
Farewell - no words to say  
beside the cross on your grave  
and those forever burning candles  
  
Needed elsewhere  
to remind us of the shortness of our time  
Tears laid for them  
Tears of love, tears of fear  
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows  
Oh, Lord why  
the angels fall first  
  
Not relieved by thougts of Shangri-La  
Nor enlightened by lessons of Christ  
I'll never understand the meaning of the right  
Ignorance lead me into the light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sing me a song  
of your beauty  
of your kingdom  
Let the melodies of your harps  
caress those whom we still need  
  
Yesterday we shook hands  
My friend  
Today a moonbeam lightens my path  
My guardian
