Until there was you we didn't know what to do but I don't give a fuck about
the things that I blew.  
Sucker MC don't you love me, want to have me, want to que me, one two three.
It's just a modest proposal from a boy anti-social, scraping the skin of our
culture, civilized vulture. Do me in, don't make me sin, I'm doing so good I
can't go through it again.  
  
I bomb the mic like a fascist, Mussolini comin' through with no remorse, from
the dark you won't see me. Rise up from the sea like a godzilla straight up
through your mind with my armour plated drilla. I don't give a fuck what you
think about this shit, ain't in it for the money never out to make a hit. If
you can't take it like I said get a grip 'cause I'm here to fucking stay like
the warts on your dick.  
  
Stick 'em up.  
  
So won't you make a man out of me, I've gotta be, connected computerized son
of a bitch, makes me itch, sucker for life. I can't decide darkness or light
or just a heavenly fright. Stick it, I'm tired I'm bored, I'm trying so hard
and I can't be adored. So the sound brakes through from one tone, gives me no
choice I can't be alone.  
  
Stick 'em up.  
  
Like Darth Vader I surprise you with my skills. I knock your 'ol ass out like
a bag of sleeping pills. I got to rip things up like my name was Jack the
Ripper. There's a party at your house cause your mama is a stripper. Slice
through the scene like a knife through peanut butter. Get your ears cleaned
out motherfucker I didn't stutter. S. W. A. R. E. Z! I got this whole thing
right down to a T.  
  
Stick 'em up.
