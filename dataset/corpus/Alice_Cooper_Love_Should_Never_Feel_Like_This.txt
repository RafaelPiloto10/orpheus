Somebody told me love's a beautiful thing  
And when I found it all the bells would just ring  
The sun would shine and all the birds would sing  
Then I met you  
  
I searched the planet for that magical girl  
I walked a million miles all over the world  
I found the oysters, but never the pearls.  
Then I met you...  
  
I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I feel sick  
I'm so weak  
  
Love should never feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
I've never felt this way before  
  
Walk in the bathroom and I take a deep breath  
Look in the mirror and it scares me to death  
Look like a junkie that's been strung out on meth  
Since I met you  
  
I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I feel sick  
I'm so weak  
  
Love should never feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
I've never felt this way before  
  
Love should never feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
I never felt this way before  
  
Oh, ignorance was always bliss  
Love should never feel like this  
  
Love should never, ever feel like this  
I've never felt this way before  
I must be doing something wrong  
No, Love should never, ever feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
I've never, ever felt this way before  
What's wrong with me!
