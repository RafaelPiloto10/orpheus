Momma said be careful what you do, yeah you.  
She said, don't you let just anybody talk to you, no no no  
I can't hide the way you make me feel inside  
I'm afraid if momma only knew, it feels right  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you want me, you got me,  
And if you need me, you got me all night  
And if you love me, you got me all night long  
  
I confess I love the things you do, yes I do  
Your caress keeps me coming back to you, only you  
  
[Chorus x3]
