As performed in the musical "tommy"  
With alistair robins as mr. walker  
Written by pete townsend  
  
Alistair: this can't continue  
It makes no sense  
We're getting nowhere  
I've lost all my confidence  
The boy wants something  
Unsatisfied  
He needs attention  
And care our love can't provide  
  
And then, there's the matter of us  
  
I'd like to prove  
That I don't think you've seen the best of me  
I've stood up for the boy  
And I've clung to the hopes and the lies  
  
I wished that the pain in your gaze  
Could again be a test of me  
But when I look in the mirror  
I believe my own eyes  
  
I believe my own eyes  
Now I've come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When I'm doubtful I tend  
To believe my own eyes  
  
Kim: I'd like to declare  
This devotion and care is a life to live  
That nothing has changed  
And the time isn't passing us by  
But I have to say here  
That for us there is a clear-cut alternative  
When we look at eachother  
We believe our own eyes  
  
Both: I believe my own eyes  
Now I've come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When I'm doubtful I tend  
To believe my own eyes  
  
This has gone far enough  
After all we've been through  
We can be brave  
We done all we can humanly do  
It's a time to be tough  
A time to be wise  
We must stop chasing our dreams and recover our lives  
  
I believe my own eyes  
Now I've come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When I'm doubtful I tend  
To believe...  
  
I'd like to believe  
But I don't think that we've seen the best of us  
And a way to believe is to see where the real future lies  
I hope that the pain in your gaze can again be a test of me  
And when I look in the mirror  
I believe my own eyes  
  
Let's believe our own eyes  
No we've come to the end  
All our patience is gone  
Let's admit we intend to believe our own eyes  
  
Kim: ... to believe our own eyes
