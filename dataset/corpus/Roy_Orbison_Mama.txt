Mama, just had to call, oh mama  
Your baby boy just had his heart  
Broken in two, she said were through  
But to send her best to you.  
Oh mama, I'd like to run to you mama  
I'd come home today, leave right away  
But things won't work that way  
Gotta stay, and be a man  
If I can, oh mama.  
  
No mom, I don't know I called her tonight  
No, not at home, yeah, you're probably right  
Yes I'll take care of myself. No I'll be alright  
I'll go to bed early tonight.  
Oh mama, tell dad I think of him, mama  
Hows uncle Joe, my puppy go-go  
Tell them hello, oh I'd better go  
But good gosh, I loved her so.  
  
Oh mama, don't worry so much, darling mama  
Now mama don't cry, just say goodbye  
Can't have us both in tears well mom, you know me  
Yes I'll always be your baby through all the years.
