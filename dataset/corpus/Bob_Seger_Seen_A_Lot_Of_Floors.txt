Seen a lot of walls, seen a lot of halls  
Got a lot of calls, late at night  
Seen a lot of doors, seen a lot of floors  
Done a lot of chores, late at night  
So don't come in here walkin'  
So innocent and talkin'  
Tryin' to make conversation  
Cause I know and you know  
That I know what you're here for  
Don't tell me 'bout your father  
Your sister or your mother  
Your great big brother  
Not tonight  
Don't want to hear about your hang ups  
Don't want know your favorite movies  
Don't want to hear about other rock bands  
Not tonight  
So don't come in here walkin'  
So innocent and talkin'  
Tryin' to make conversation  
'Cause you know and I know  
That I know what you're here for  
Seen a lot of floors  
Seen a lot of doors  
Done a lot of chores  
Late at night
