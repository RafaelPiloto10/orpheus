Dawn is a feeling,  
A beautiful ceiling.  
The smell of grass  
Just makes you pass  
Into a dream.  
You're here today,  
No future fears,  
This day will last  
A thousand years  
If you want it to.  
You look around you,  
Things they astound you  
So breathe in deep,  
You're not asleep,  
Open your mind.  
You're here today,  
No future fears,  
This day will last  
A thousand years  
If you want it to.  
Do you understand  
That all over this land  
There's a feeling?  
In minds far and near  
Things are becoming clear  
With a meaning.  
Now that you're knowing  
Pleasure starts flowing.  
It's true life flies  
Faster than eyes  
Could ever see.  
You're here today.  
No future fears.  
This day will last  
A thousand years  
If you want it to.
