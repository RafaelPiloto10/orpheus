Ouija board  
Would you work for me?  
I have got to say hello  
To an old friend  
  
Ouija board, Ouija board, Ouija board  
Would you work for me?  
I have got to get through  
To a good friend  
Well, she has now gone  
From this unhappy planet  
With all the carnivores  
And the destructors of it  
  
Ouija board, Ouija board, Ouija board  
Would you help me?  
Because I still do feel  
So horribly lonely  
  
Would you, Ouija board  
Would you, Ouija board  
Would you help me?  
And I just can't find  
My place in this world  
  
She has now gone  
From this unhappy planet  
With all the carnivores  
And the destructors of it  
  
Oh hear my voice ("hear my voice")  
Oh hear my voice ("hear my voice")  
Hear my voice ("hear my voice")  
Hear my voice ("hear my voice")  
The table is rumbling...  
The table is rumbling  
The glass is moving  
"No, I was not pushing that time"  
It spells : S.T.E.V.E.N  
  
The table is rumbling  
The glass is moving  
"No, I was not pushing that time" :  
P.U.S.H.O. double F.  
  
Well, she has now gone  
From this unhappy planet  
With all the carnivores  
And the destructors of it
