I don't care about the way that ya treated me  
And I ain't crying 'bout the love I'm paying for  
No, I ain't bitching 'bout the things  
You putting down here in the street  
No, I ain't going 'round saying things  
About you I can't repeat  
Hey it ain't gonna change overnight  
No, and it ain't going away without a fight  
No, now I ain't saying that I'm never gonna beg you, oh baby come back  
But right now, baby  
I don't really want to see your face  
Yeah and that's a fact  
Right now, honey  
All I know is what I'm feeling inside  
Right now, honey  
I'm alone and I'm swallowing a lot  
Of pride  
And it ain't gonna change  
Overnight, no  
And it ain't goin' away without  
A fight  
Living with the aftershock  
Why, why, why, I never thought  
She'd walk  
But now I'm living with the  
Aftershock  
And it ain't gonna change  
It ain't goin' away, no  
Yeah, she opened up my eyes  
Seeing what I want to see  
She kinda took me by surprise  
Showed me what I hadn't seen  
Yeah, yeah  
Living with the aftershock  
Yeah, yeah living with the aftershock  
My, my, my, I guess that I never  
Thought she'd walk  
Living with the aftershock  
And it ain't gonna change  
It ain't goin' away  
I said it ain't gonna change without  
A fight  
I'm living with the aftershock  
I'm living with the aftershock  
Never gonna change
