I try, not to panic,  
I hold on to the pieces,  
It's hard to stop my heart from breaking.  
If I could stand to take the long road,  
If I could reach to where I've never been.  
There's a mirror facing me.  
  
I don't want to be here.....take me with you  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me there, take me there,  
Until I die, until I die.  
Take me with you,  
Take me there, take me there,  
Until I die, until I die  
Take me with you.  
  
I chose to be careful,  
Hold on to the reason,  
It's hard to stop my head from spinning,  
If I could sleep until tomorrow,  
If I could see the things I've never seen,  
It's a matter of dreaming.  
  
I don't want to be here take me with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to hurt inside,  
I feel like I'm losing time,  
Take me with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With you
