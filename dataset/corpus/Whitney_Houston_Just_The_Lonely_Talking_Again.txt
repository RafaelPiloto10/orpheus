Yeah  
It's the second time around  
For you and I boy  
And believe me it's confusing me  
I'm afraid to say "let's make up" and "All's forgiven"  
But somethin' tells me it's heading for heartbreak  
So darling please I'm praying that  
This time yeah this time will be different  
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me are you really ready for love boy  
Or is it just the lonely talking again  
Are you really ready for love boy  
Or is it the lonely talking again  
  
Now the time before  
When we got together  
You promised you'd be forever true to me  
But all I got from you  
Was lots and lots of talking  
Lonely nights filled with misery  
  
So baby please please tell me now  
That when I fulfill your needs  
You won't up and leave me  
Even though you know  
I'll let you come back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Really need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me now  
want to know  
Really gotta know  
Are you ready?  
Are you ready  
Are you ready?  
Tell me are you ready  
Are you ready?  
Are you ready?  
  
Need to know  
Really want to know  
Really want to know  
Really need to know  
Are we gonna talk?  
Are we gonna talk?  
  
don't want to talk no no no no  
I need to know  
I really want to know  
You tell me now  
Are you ready?  
No no no Need to know
