Hear our praises  
Hear your people sing  
Hear our hearts cry  
Your love is everything  
  
And all will hear this shout  
As the nations turn to you  
And this will be your anthem  
  
'cause we're all about you  
And the world you promise  
And all we have will give you praise  
'cause we're all about you  
And the world can't stop us  
Living your way, always  
  
Let our hearts break as we praise your name  
Let the earth shake  
This is the sound of faith  
  
And the walls will fall down  
And religion will break  
And the nations will hear this shout  
Can you hear the sound of faith?  
  
All the walls are falling down  
As all the nations praaise  
And all the world will hear this shout  
Can you hear the sound of faith?
