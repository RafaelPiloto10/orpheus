Sometimes I'm walking down the street, with my head in the clouds  
I can't see what stands before me, I can't feel the walls around me  
I'm lost in a daydream  
A place where every child could be runnin' wild, running free  
It feels so natural, could it be possible for this to be?  
Make a wish on a star, that our troubles won't last forever  
Now that we've come so far, I believe that we can make it all the way  
A place where everyone can feel love happiness  
I know, can't be far away  
  
Where every woman child and man need never be oppressed  
I know there will come a day  
There will come a day, there comes a day, there will come a day  
Yes I've been down on my Knees, with my head to the sky  
Hoping this world divided, will make a stand united  
Oh happy day  
We've seen the future within' the past, the price of closin' our eyes  
Let's turn this situation, with love and education  
Let's find a way  
  
Make a wish on a star, that our troubles won't last forever  
Now that we've come so far, I believe that we can make it all the way  
A place where everyone can feel, love happiness  
I know, can't be far away  
Every woman, child, and man, need never be oppressed  
I know, there will come a day  
A place where everyone can feel, love and happiness  
I know, can't be far away  
  
Where every woman, child and man won't be oppressed  
I know, there will come a day  
There will come a day, there comes a day, there will come a day  
There will come a day, there comes a day, there will come a day  
We got to know and understand , we are vital to the master plan  
So get ready for the fight as we proceed into the light  
Get ready for the fight, for what is right
