Hung around with big shots  
Never knew love was in the sights  
I guess, I missed the target  
Caught up in a different line of fire  
  
But I know since I've been aiming  
For the sweetness in your soul  
Your name is on the bullet  
And it's gettin' ready to explode  
  
There's been a change inside my life  
And I just wanna let you know  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
Mama used to tell me  
Girl, you better load your gun up right  
She said ya, ya gotta come out smokin'  
Hit it with your best shot every time  
  
Well I, I didn't understand her  
'Til you walked right into range  
I saw your love at twenty paces  
And I knew I'd won the game  
  
You better raise your heart up high  
Or love will blow you right away  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
Leave off that safety catch  
There ain't no risk we're gonna have some fun  
I've got cha, love's begun  
So stay with me until the mornin' sun  
  
You're super bullet number one  
  
There's been a change inside my life  
And I just wanna let you know  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go
