Oh yes,  
Say it now  
  
Morning has broken,  
Like the first morning  
Blackbird has spoken,  
Like the first bird  
  
Praise for the singing,  
Praise for the morning  
Praise for them springing  
Fresh from the world  
  
Sweet the rain's new fall,  
Sunlit from heaven  
Like the first dewfall,  
On the first grass  
Praise for the sweetness  
Of the wet garden  
Sprung in completeness  
Where his feet pass  
  
Mine is the sunlight,  
Mine is the morning  
Born of the one light,  
Eden saw play  
  
Praise with elation,  
Praise every morning  
God's re-creation  
Of the new day
