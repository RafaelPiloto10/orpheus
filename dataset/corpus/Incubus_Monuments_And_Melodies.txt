My hands are trembling  
And my eyes are on fire  
This house is crumbling  
Left brain, left out on the wire  
  
You make me happy  
You magnify my better half  
You make me certain  
That all I have today is your photograph  
  
My past is perilous  
And each scar I bear sings  
Monuments to where I have been  
And melodies to where I am going  
  
You make me happy  
You magnify my better half  
You make me certain  
That all I have today is your photograph  
  
When will I see you again?  
A still life can only go so far  
  
I need you in front of me  
Saying my name  
Saying to me  
Saying to me  
Saying to me  
I want you the way you are  
The way you are  
  
You make me happy  
You magnify my better half  
You make me certain  
That all I have today is your photograph  
  
You make me happy  
You make me happy  
You make me happy
