I come from a genius, I am my father's son  
Yeah, too bad he was a psychopath and now I'm the next in line  
Lonely nest dear mother, yes, surely she's a work of art  
I never got top dollar, but she gave us all a star  
  
Can I get a reprieve?  
This gene pool don't hurt me  
Can I beg a release  
From the volunteer amputee?  
From the moment I fell  
I called on DNA  
Why such betrayal  
Got me tooth and nail  
  
Yeah, how's about one conversation with nothing else left to be had  
Oh, is this your long lost son, and he's never had dear old dad  
I forget the insemination and for that I'm supposed to be glad  
What a pity you left us so soon to climb your mountain of regret  
  
Can I get a reprieve?  
This gene pool dark and deep  
Can I beg a release?  
Can I volunteer amputee?  
From the moment I fell  
I called on DNA  
Why such betrayal?  
Oh I gotta set sail  
  
Oh real bright light shining as you're trying to breathe in thin air  
Cannot forget you're hiding collected wounds left unhealed  
When every thought you're thinking sinks you darker than the new moon sky  
The faraway lights rising in the whites of your eyes  
  
Now father you're dead and gone and I'm finally free to be me  
Thanks for all your dark gifts for which I've got no sympathy  
I'm living in a walled-up place in the bounds of fifth symphony  
Thanks for this and thanks for that, I gotta let go, learn to see legacy  
  
Can I get a reprieve?  
This gene pool don't hurt me  
Can I beg a release?  
Can I volunteer amputee?  
From the moment I fell  
I called on DNA  
Why such betrayal  
Oh I gotta set sail
