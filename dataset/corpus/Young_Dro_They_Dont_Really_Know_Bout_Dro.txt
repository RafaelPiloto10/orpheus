While them hoes watchin' me and while them hoes jockin' me  
Feds tried to rocket me and knock me out properly

Niggaz tried droppin' me them slugs bounced off of me  
Murder niggaz softly, the judge still walkin' me

Twelve gauge shell heat I [?] don't like to bury  
Knock a nigga teeth out his mouth for the tooth fairy
