Dis empowered, the scattering flock  
Dances in a fever at the castle rock  
Dust-devil cypress and ripening fruit  
Ascending quick into the author's bathroom  
Fawn, Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire  
Lettuce-toothed junkies all full of desire  
Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude  
And there's nothing I can do  
Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude  
And there's nothing I can do  
And there's nothing I can say to you  
I've got a lot of work to do  
I guess I'll leave it up to you  
Uninvited, we'll stay if we want  
Searching through your closets for your grandfather's gun  
We will swim in your kidney, kidney-shaped pool  
Scratching at the bottom for another clue, yeah  
Fawn, Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire  
Lettuce-toothed junkies all full of desire  
Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude  
And there's nothing I can do  
Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude  
And there's nothing I can do  
(Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude)  
And there's nothing I can say to you  
(Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude)  
And there's nothing I can do  
And there's nothing I can say to you  
I've got a lot of work to do  
I guess I'll leave it up to you
