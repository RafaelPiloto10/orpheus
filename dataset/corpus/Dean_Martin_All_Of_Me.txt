All of me  
Why not take all of me  
Can't you see  
I'm no good without you  
Take my lips  
I want to lose them  
Take my arms  
I'll never use them  
Your goodbye  
Left me with eyes that cried  
How can I  
Go on dear without you  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me  
Left me with eyes that cried  
Go on dear without you  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me
