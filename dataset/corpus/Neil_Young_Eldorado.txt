In the crystal ball  
The gypsy sees the villa  
The riders on the hill  
The fire in the fields  
She sees the mission bell  
Swinging in the silence  
Now the shooting starts  
The bullets pierce the hearts  
The senoritas crying at the well.  
  
Up in the Gold Hotel  
The money hits the table  
The heavies all are there  
That's why the deal's goin' down  
Beautiful women all dressed in  
Diamonds and sable  
Down upon the street  
Beside a garbage heap  
A Mariachi band begins to play.  
  
Somewhere a blues guitar  
Plays echoes in the alleyway  
The Tijuana dawn  
Claims another day  
The golden sun  
Rises on the runway  
The pilot understands  
The money changes hands  
Inside the jet the briefcase snaps. Goodbye.  
  
In Eldorado town  
There lives a great bullfighter  
His eyes are screaming blue  
His hair is red as blood  
And when the gate goes up  
The crowd gets so excited  
And he comes dancin' out  
Dressed in gold lame  
He kills the bull and lives another day.
