Well come on and tell us Johnny  
What's the secret of success  
You gotta take a tip from the king of hip  
Cuase you know that he's the best  
  
We're going prowlin, we're going prowlin tonight  
I see you hungry for a lover  
Gotta find a chick who'll give you more  
Well, there's a spot that I've discovered  
Where a guys guaranteed to score  
  
I'm gonna show you cats some action

We're gonna get some satisfaction  
Down at the Grocery Store

Prowlin (Walk, talk like T-Birds)  
Prowowowlin tonight  
  
There's a female butcher at the luncheon meat display  
Got the best tongue in town, she delivers night and day  
See the apple of your eye, stackin peaches in a five foot pile  
Just waitin on some guy to come and take her rollin down the aisle  
  
(Spoken)  
Louis: Well, I like a debutante, who comes across-- now that's what I call

Goose: You know what I like, I like a girl that's really smart, you know,
provided that she's really stacked
