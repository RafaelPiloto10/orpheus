You give up on yourself  
Somehow you got betrayed again  
Thin ice and luck runs out  
Who will you blame it on this time?  
  
Due to lack of interest in you  
The light at the end of the tunnel  
Was turned off  
And something I noticed  
Beating you is thrilling me  
I've got a secret for you  
  
If you took your own direction  
If only you practice what you preach  
If you follow your advice  
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time  
  
Don't close your eyes to injustice  
Listen, being brave ain't chicken shit  
A man without any valor  
Has nothing worth living for  
  
Due to lack of interest in you  
The light at the end of the tunnel  
Was turned off  
And something I noticed  
Beating you is thrilling me  
I've got a secret for you  
  
If you took your own direction  
If only you practice what you preach  
If you follow your advice  
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time  
  
If you took your own direction  
If only you practice what you preach  
If you follow your advice  
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time  
  
If you took your own direction  
If only you practice what you preach  
If you follow your advice  
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time
