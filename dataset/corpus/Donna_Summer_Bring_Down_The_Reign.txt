[Chorus]  
Whats the point of crying  
Angel of Joy  
Angel of Joy  
Angel of life.  
  
Tears will hold holy water  
Crying for us all  
Every son and every daughter  
Rise up before we fall  
  
Dark boy dark boy  
The grace of god be with you  
Waiting for all the mercy  
To surround us all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open the doors, heavens  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
  
Oh  
  
Let me do it again  
  
One boys lack of choir  
Singing sacred words  
Brake the wall of his sisters  
Till it bans the universe  
  
Dark boy dark boy  
The grace of god be with you  
Waiting for all the mercy  
To surround us all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open the doors, heavens  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
  
Oh  
  
Let me do it again  
  
Its a broken heart  
Of the wounded child  
Covered with scabs  
Growing out of love  
What will it take  
Open your heart  
Before his last breath  
Before he departs  
  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
  
Oh  
  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign
