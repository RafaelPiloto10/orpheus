Thank you  
This is our last one today  
Hope we get into a bit of a groove with it  
  
Get back, get back again and again  
I've been here since I can remember when  
My life is a boat, being blown by you  
With nothing ahead, just the deepest blue...  
  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
  
Come back, come back again and again,  
I've been here since I can remember when  
Your world just spins whilst mine stands still  
Nothing's changed in my gravity grave  
  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
But I want my life  
So bright it burns my eyes  
Sounds like the perfect way  
To end my life  
To me you're like a setting sun...  
To me you're like a setting sun...  
  
Get it on  
Get it on  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
I'm gonna get me somehow  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
I'm gonna get me somehow  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
I'm gonna get me somehow  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on...  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
Load up  
Load up  
Load up  
Load up  
Nothing's changed in my gravity grave  
My own world's stopped  
Your's still spins  
We could go up one more time  
We could go up one more  
One more  
One more  
One core  
One more  
One more  
One more  
Come on  
But we gotta go  
We got one minute left  
Come on  
We got one minute left  
Come on  
One minute  
One minute...  
Thank you  
Have a good weekend, all right?
