Homicide on the edge of town, and no one said it be easy  
Sure has its ups and downs, and Garfield is laughing  
Sitting in a dark room, making love with Sylvannia  
No so called friends around, cigarettes and champagne  
Gonna make me a big star, oh haven't you heard yet  
Don't know how its going to go, too young to tell  
And if its just my name, well hell I can change it  
And if its for the fame, I guess I better grab it fast  
But its just a dangerous game, that you're playing, oow  
And you play it so well, so lets play it again  
  
Sidewalks and Streetlights, sure make a pretty picture  
Strangers in the night, are you going my way  
You can drop me off at the corner, I can walk the rest of the way  
Its not that far to the nearest star  
And if its for the money, hey why can't I have it  
And if its for the glory, I guess I better grab it fast  
But its just a dangerous game, that you're playing, oow  
And you play it so well, so lets play it again, oow  
Lets play it again
