By (D. Allman)  
  
Upon my word what does it mean  
Is it love or is it me  
That makes me change so suddenly  
From looking out to feeling free  
  
I sit here lying in my bed  
Wondering what it was I said  
That made me think I'd lost my head  
When I knew I lost my heart instead  
  
Chorus:  
  
So won't you please read my signs be a gypsy  
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me  
And because you can't find my mind please be with me  
  
And of all the better things I've heard  
Loving you has made the words  
And all the rest seem so absurd  
Cause in the end it all comes out I'm sure  
  
Chorus:  
  
So won't you please read my signs be a gypsy  
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me  
And because you can't find my mind please be with me
