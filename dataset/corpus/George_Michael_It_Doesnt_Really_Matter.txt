It doesn't really matter that I loved you  
How many reasons call  
It doesn't really matter at all  
It doesn't really matter that I failed to  
Break down your father's wall  
It doesn't really matter at all  
  
Why tell me you don't understand when you do  
I thought I had something to say  
  
But it doesn't really matter at all...  
I changed my name to be rid of the things that I want from you  
It's strange but the name is a name and the truth is a truth  
  
Oh, there is always, always someone there to remind me  
So I learn to live with shame  
I tell myself I feel no pain  
But I do and if I have to tell you  
  
Then it doesn't really matter at all...  
And it's no good looking back  
Because time is a thief and I believe that I'm too old for that  
We're just saying the things that we have said forever  
  
It doesn't really matter that I loved you  
How many reasons fall  
It's too bad  
It really doesn't matter at all
