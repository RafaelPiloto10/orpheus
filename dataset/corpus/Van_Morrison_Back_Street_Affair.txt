You didn't know I wasn't free  
When you fell in love with me  
And with all your young heart  
You learned to care  
  
It brought you shame and disgrace  
The world has tumbled in your face  
Because they call our love  
A back street affair  
  
They say you wrecked my home  
I'm a husband that's gone wrong  
They don't know the sorrow  
That we had to bear  
  
While the one I was tied to  
Was the first to be untrue  
How can they call our love  
A back street affair  
  
Well, we have each other now  
That's all that matters anyhow  
While the judgment  
Of gossips never fair  
  
We'll just be brave and strong  
Then someday they'll see they're wrong  
So, let them call our love  
A back street affair  
  
We'll be free to love someday  
When all the talk has died away  
And the happiness we hoped for  
Then we'll share  
  
And I'll climb a mountain high  
And the world will hear me cry  
That our love is not  
A backstreet affair
