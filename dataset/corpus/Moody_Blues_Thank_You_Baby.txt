Thank you, baby,  
You stood by me when times are blue.  
Thank you, baby,  
And now I'll make it up to you.  
Gonna make time stand still,  
You know I will,  
Gonna make time stand still.  
And every day I'm gonna say,  
And every day, oh babe,  
And every day, I'm gonna say  
Thank you, baby,  
You give me love and pull me through  
Thank you, baby,  
For the time I needed you.  
I'm gonna make time stand in one place,  
I'm gonna make time stand still.  
And every day I'm gonna say  
The little sad man's gonna help me [well, that's what it sounds like to me]  
No, every day, I'm gonna say,  
Thank you, baby,  
Even though they're not too long ago  
I saw my troubles grow,  
Grow and grow.  
Wiith you by my side, little baby,  
You've made them run and hide,  
Never, yeah, to show -ow -ow -ow, to show

Oh, you give me love and pull me through,  
Thank you, baby,  
For the time I needed you,  
Yeah I'm gonna make time stand in one place,  
I'm gonna make time stand still,  
And every day, even every nght, I'm gonna say  
And every day I'm gonna say,
