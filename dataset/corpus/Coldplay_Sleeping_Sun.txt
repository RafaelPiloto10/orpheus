Climb up your mountain, nineteen and countin'  
You have got seven, I have got one  
Blinded and hurtin', this I'm deserving  
I've got my secrets, you've only got the sleeping sun  
When you've got a secret then you've got to keep it  
When you have a question, answers will come  
Running and hiding, take and dividing  
You've got your secrets, I've only got a sleeping sun  
Sleeping sun  
Singing  
Ooh, ooh, ohh, ohh  
Ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh  
And you, as I saw, a piece in a jigsaw  
Run up and around it and jump up real tall  
Run round the houses north and the south is  
You've got your answers, we've only got a sleeping sun  
Sleeping sun  
Singing  
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh  
Ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh
