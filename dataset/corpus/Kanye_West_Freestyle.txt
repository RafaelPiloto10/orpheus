Yo Hip-Hop Is niggaz still talkin bout I can't rap Come On Now  
  
Look for me Young K  
Took Tupac beat and got paid  
My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z  
Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me  
Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend  
He could get his head bust nigga ain't my friend  
Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying  
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks  
When they suggested they was made by Majestic  
My answers cost three-hundred-fifty ya naw mean  
Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team  
You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match  
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch  
I got my business manager erasing my debt  
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit  
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it  
My girl come over try to help me shine  
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine  
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line  
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying  
You better grow up before I blow up  
Have weed rolled up when I show up  
Matter fact we broke as fuck  
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up  
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend  
So I promise to never pick up smutts  
In my Cadillac pick-up truck  
They need to get they sit-ups up  
They always be colder than you  
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you  
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels  
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college  
So you can be where they at two years from now  
But for now bartender two beers for now  
The second one is for my girlfriend

I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such  
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch  
Greater man could prob picture like there go us  
No styles just good times like they're so nuts  
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much  
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch  
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon  
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room  
We ain't got to go back to my room there's only one bedroom  
That I call my lair  
We was V.I.P. Very Imaginary Playaz  
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend
