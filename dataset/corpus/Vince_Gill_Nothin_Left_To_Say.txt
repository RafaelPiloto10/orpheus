I work my fingers to the bone  
Just trying to keep up with the Jones  
You call me on the telephone  
Say baby hurry hurry home  
  
Pour me a little splash of red  
You look like you could raise the dead  
Have you got something on your mind  
Come on girl we're wasting time  
  
(Chorus)  
Just let your body do the talking  
Don't let the words get in the way  
Yeah I can tell the way you're walking  
That you got nothing left to say  
  
Ain't gonna watch the evening news  
Cause I don't care who's shooting who  
You're putting on my favorite shoes  
About to do that thing you do  
  
Ah let's do it all night long  
Cause in the morning I'll be gone  
If everything works out all right  
Same place, same time tomorrow night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't got nothin' to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah I can tell the way you're walking  
That you got nothing left to say  
Nothin' baby
