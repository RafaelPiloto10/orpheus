Listen up  
I wanna tell you, tell you something  
Listen up  
I wanna tell you, listen, listen up  
I want you to know we're serious  
Listen  
Listen up  
Listen  
From us, to you  
  
For a little grip now, we been rocking your ass  
The future ain't scary cause we got the past  
Can't nothing ever take away the Gatherings  
You can take what's happening now,  
Not what I'm rapping about  
And I remember every Hallowicked to a T  
And every Project Born, Marz, Esham, and Myzery  
And even though I don't remember your name  
From the in store  
Swear to God, I couldn't love you anymore  
Do you mention the Abyss at Virginia Beach?  
And out of state you're so hot, Juggalos reach  
(Juggalos reach)  
And what about the Bronco Bowl in Deep Ellem?  
And that crazy ass house club in Houston? (Tell them)  
Twenty thousand websites, hotlines, and clubs  
Gang bangers, codes, nobody's and scrubs  
To every last Juggalette that turned me out  
Thank you much, and I hope to see you on the next route  
You know everybody hates on this world of ours  
And if you learn one thing from the Joker Cards  
Let it be the other shit is six different views  
Diamond any way you choose  
And we love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess it's time  
That I told you  
How great you are  
I guess it's time  
That I told you  
How great you are  
  
They told me to sing it any way I could bring  
Hurry up  
Pay attention  
Stop  
Mike P  
One, two  
Stop, stop  
Open up your earlobes  
ICP  
Stop, stop  
Rubber game  
  
Listen  
  
Me and Krayzie Bone, we marinade in the flats  
Representing Cleveland, and we could press your stats  
I rock trees, frog shop  
I rock the octave  
Nautica and Theo four times ten (Who?)  
Every time we play Denver, cars get rolled over  
Juggalos get pissed when the show's over  
Even cities that I leave, they not letting me in  
They let me know if they a Juggalo  
Through thick and through thin  
I like Twiztid  
Independent  
Free standing  
And always down to give a helping hand in  
And to everybody else out there, do your thing  
'Cause it ain't no ducking when the hatchet swings  
We try to sing, we try to rap  
We try to rock and spit  
(Can't get enough of this wicked shit!)  
Even if we foggy and we still ain't clear  
In three years later, you'll look back and tip us a beer  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I wanna tell you I love all the letters ya'll  
Got them hung up on the fridge  
And all up on the garage wall  
What about these mini-gatherings we hear?  
Ya'll don't be surprised when we walk up in there  
With Vampiro and Sabu flying above  
Representing the Juggalos with nothing but love  
On TV, they make them try to hide their shit  
But real Juggalos always bear the hatchet  
And all the fresh titty bars DJ's with mullets  
All nuts while we there, but you hate us and love them  
Yes, you groupie as fuck, and good to go  
But don't get excited thinking makes you a Juggalo  
Yes, we gather once a year, big top above  
We give shit like Big Silva nothing but love  
But you gotta be fresh and with open mind  
Or your ass get left behind  
That's why I love ya'll  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
