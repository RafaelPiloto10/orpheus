Down, down, down came the world  
I went round, round, round in a whirl  
I built every dream around one girl  
Then down, down, down came the world  
She must have loved a little  
Just to keep me hanging on  
How could lips that kiss so sweet  
Lie and be so wrong?  
Our love was just a pattern  
Of the perfect boy and girl  
The only dream I own  
In this world  
Down, down, down came the world  
I went round, round, round in a whirl  
I built every dream around one girl  
Then down, down, down came the world  
I built every dream around one girl  
Then down, down, down came the world  
Down, down, down came the world
