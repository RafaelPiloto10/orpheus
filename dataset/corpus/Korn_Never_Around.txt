Hate is all around  
If you see what I see  
Definitely something's going on  
These fingers  
Pointed at me  
  
The lying  
The cheating  
The hellish nights alone  
While I am weeping  
Just searching  
Love is never around  
All the waiting  
Betraying  
The one thing I hold sacred in my life is  
Left hanging  
And I'm never around  
  
Let go  
And I will truly be free  
Just let go  
Her mind really is the disease  
So just go  
Enjoy everything I received  
So let go  
And I will kill this unease  
  
Let's turn this around  
I'll look down on me  
Now I see what's going on  
Warned about you all and not me  
  
The prying  
The cheating  
The hellish nights alone  
While I am weeping  
Just searching  
Love is never around  
All the waiting  
Betraying  
The one thing I hold sacred in my life is  
Left hanging  
And I'm never around  
  
Let go  
And I will truly be free  
Just let go  
My mind is really the disease  
So just go  
Enjoy everything I received  
So let go  
And I will kill this unease  
  
Hate is all around  
If you see what I see  
Definitely something's going on  
These fingers  
Pointed at me  
Pointed at me  
These fingers  
Pointed at me  
  
Let go  
And I will truly be free  
Just let go  
Her mind is really the disease  
So just go  
Enjoy everything I received  
So let go  
And I will kill this unease
