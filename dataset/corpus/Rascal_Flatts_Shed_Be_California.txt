She got the long blond hair  
Got the red sports car  
And you know she's got the  
Top laid back  
She got the movie star smile  
Got the sun kissed tan  
Santa Barbara in summer  
Yeah, she feels like that  
  
Hey she's like a canyon drive  
In a midnight sky  
Those eyes are deep enough  
To get lost  
Her legs are palm tree tall  
The way she walks  
Like the heat on a runway  
When the cameras go off  
  
She's small town from the country  
She ain't big time but she could be  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, Hollywood never looked this good  
Bright as the big screen burns  
Hey, I bet drivin' down sunset  
They're lookin' for a face like hers  
Yeah, I've been all around this world  
And she'd be California  
If California was a girl  
  
She's like a red, red wine  
Like a righteous wave  
She's a day at the beach in Corona del Mar  
She's never been out there  
Felt the bright spot light  
But she could have her own star  
On that dreamer's boulevard  
  
I've driven down that coastline  
And I've stood there under that big sign  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd chase that wild sunset  
I'd be gone on my way,  
Way out west  
Yeah, I've been all around this town  
  
Hey, Hollywood never looked this good  
Bright as the big screen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now she'd be California  
Hey, California  
  
She got the long blonde hair  
Got the red sports car  
And you know she's got the  
Top laid back  
She got the movie star smile  
Got the sun kissed tan  
Santa Barbara in summer  
Yeah, she feels like that  
  
Yeah, she'd be California  
Hey, Hollywood.
