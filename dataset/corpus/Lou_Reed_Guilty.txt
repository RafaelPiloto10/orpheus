Guilty, guilty  
Guilty, I'm paralyzed with guilt  
It runs through me like a rain through silk  
Guilty, my mind won't leave me alone  
My teeth are rotted  
My lips start to foam  
Cause I'm so guilty  
Guilty, guilty  
Ooohhh guilty  
What did I say  
What did I say  
What did I do  
Did I ever do it to you  
Don't turn your back, ah  
I can't look you in the eye, ah  
Eye eye eye eye  
I guess I'm guilty as charged  
I guess I'm guilty as charged  
Guilty, huh, guilty ah, guilty ah, guilty  
Guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty  
Don't do that  
Don't do that  
Don't do what  
  
Oh you're such a child  
Real fool child  
Guilty  
What can I do  
I do it to you  
But I do it to me too  
  
Cut off my head  
Cut off my head  
Cut off my head, ah  
Hang me from the yardarm  
Guilty, I'm paralyzed with guilt  
I've got bad thoughts  
I've got an evil clit  
  
Guilty  
  
Guilty, my mind won't leave me alone  
I've got a bad mind  
I've got a bad bone  
Guilty guilty guilty as charged  
Guilty  
Don't do that  
Don't do what  
Don't do that  
Oh you're such a reckless child  
You remember when you were a baby  
Do you remember when you were a baby  
Do you have a jury, yeah  
Do you have a verdict  
Guilty as charged  
Guilty guilty guilty as charged  
Do you have a verdict  
Do you have a verdict  
I'm guilty  
You're guilty  
Oh you're such a reckless child  
I should beat you  
I should hit you  
I'll put you in therapy, ah
