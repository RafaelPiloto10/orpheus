It's so long since I sang songs to you  
I forget all the words I once knew  
I could look back  
But I can't waste the time  
  
Did it matter  
They sometimes didn't rhyme  
It's so long since I sang songs for you  
  
It's so long since you smile just for me  
Now your smile's just an old use to be  
Does it matter  
That I can take the time  
  
Would you rather  
I write you one more line  
Can my songs once again be for you  
  
Claudie made a fool out of me  
Made me find another place to be  
I've been living alone  
In a house that wasn't my home  
With Claudie is the place I want to be  
  
When I left did you think of me crying  
Did you care that I felt I was dying  
I pretended  
That I don't give a damn  
All along  
I've know what I really am  
I'm a fool little Claudie just for you  
  
Claudie made a fool out of me  
Made me find another place to be  
I've been living alone  
In a house that wasn't my home  
With Claudie is the place I want to be
