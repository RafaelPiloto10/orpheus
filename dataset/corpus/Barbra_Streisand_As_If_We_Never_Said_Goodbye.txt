I don't know why I'm frightened  
I know my way around here  
The cardboard trees, the painted seas, the sound here  
Yes, a world to rediscover  
But I 'm not in any hurry  
And I need a moment  
  
The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always  
Feel the early morning madness  
Feel the magic in the making  
Why, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
  
I've spent so many mornings just trying to resist you  
I'm trembling now, you can't know how I've missed you  
Missed the fairy tale adventure  
In this ever spinning playground  
We were young together  
  
I'm coming out of make-up  
The lights already burning  
Not long until the cameras will start turning  
And the early morning madness  
And the magic in the making  
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
  
I don't want to be alone  
That's all in the past  
This world's waited long enough  
I've come home at last!  
  
And this time will be bigger  
And brighter than we knew it  
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it  
Could I stop my hand from shaking?  
Has there ever been a moment  
With so much to live for?  
  
The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  
So much to say not just today but always  
We'll have early morning madness  
We'll have magic in the making  
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
We taught the world new ways to dream!
