There is a demon among us whose soul belongs in hell  
Sent here to redeem us, she knows it all to well  
He comes and goes, he comes and goes  
she knows it all too well  
But when all is said and done  
The sun goes down  
  
She tries her best to leave him, but she is still captured by his spell  
She knows now she must deceive him, he knows it all to well  
She comes and goes, she comes and goes, he knows it all too well  
But when all is said and done  
The sun goes down  
  
She comes and goes, she comes and goes,  
he knows it all too well  
But when all is said and done  
The sun goes down  
  
There is a demon within us  
The sun goes down  
She tries her best to deceive him  
The sun goes down
