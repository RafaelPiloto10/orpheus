All the people that you know, they say you're ready to break down  
All the people that you know, they say you're ready to fall  
I hope you know that you are better than you think you are  
I hope you know you that you will never really try  
I hope you know you that you are never unknown  
You got a good friend on the inside  
Whoa-oh  
I just want to be there when you need to find your feet on the solid ground  
Whoa-oh  
I just want to catch you when you fall down  
(when you fall down)  
  
All the people that you know say you live in white noise  
Yeah, all the people that you know they say you're living in hell  
They don't know anything  
I hope that you know that you are better than they say you are  
I have to say that you are stronger than you know  
I have to say that you are smart enough to handle any stunt anyone could pull  
Whoa-oh  
I just want to be there when you need to find your feet on the solid ground  
Whoa-oh  
I just want to catch you when you fall down  
Catch you when you fall down  
Catch you when you fall down  
Catch you when you fall down  
I want to catch you when you fall down  
When you fall down  
  
All the people that you know, say you're ready to break down  
All the people that you know, say you're ready to fall  
I have to say that you are better than they think you are  
Have to say that you are better than them all  
Have to tell you that you never need the answer  
When you need someone to call  
Whoa-oh  
I just want to be there when you need a hand to help you turn it all around  
Whoa-oh  
I just need to be there when you need to come down  
Woah-oh  
I just want to be there when you need to find your feet on the solid ground  
Whoa-oh  
I just want to catch you when you fall down  
Catch you when you fall down  
Catch you when you fall down  
I want to catch you when you fall down
