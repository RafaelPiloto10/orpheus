Ahh... Don't let me go.  
This is a Jlack track man.  
  
[Verse:]  
  
If you listen to nothing else that I say,  
Hear me when I say this to you,  
That little voice in the back of your mind,  
Just do what it tells you to do,  
I saw her there,  
Crying in two empty shot glasses,  
Cheers to herself then drink them down,  
I should've just walked away,  
But there was something about her,  
(Beautifully tragic)  
Took a seat and said,  
(So, you from outta town?)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I should've known she was crazy,  
I've seen it in her eyes,  
She's crazy, (wohohoo)  
I should've known she was crazy,  
I did not realize  
She's crazy, (wohohoo)  
I should've known she was crazy,  
(She's crazy)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
  
She looked at me,  
And I swear the blood froze in my veins,  
Her eyes pierced my heart and made it stop,  
The room started spinning,  
All of a sudden my vision was blurred,  
And it got cold as I felt the temperature suddenly drop,  
I'm getting scared now,  
But I don't show it,  
But it's like she's looking through me,  
So I think that she know it,  
That's when she pulled me close,  
Holding me so tight,  
Said I don't care about tomorrow,  
But your mine tonight,  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I should've known she was crazy,  
I've seen it in her eyes,  
She's crazy, (wohohoo)  
I should've known she was crazy,  
I did not realize  
She's crazy, (wohohoo)  
I should've known she was crazy,  
(She's crazy)  
  
[Harmonizing]  
  
Crazy (crazy)  
What you do to me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I should've known she was crazy,  
I've seen it in her eyes,  
She's crazy, (wohohoo)  
I should've known she was crazy,  
I did not realize  
She's crazy, (wohohoo)  
I should've known she was crazy,  
(She's crazy)
