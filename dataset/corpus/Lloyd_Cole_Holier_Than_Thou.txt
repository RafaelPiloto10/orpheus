Holier than thou, yes it's true  
I'm too good for you  
Higher than heaven, taller than jesus  
Charlie knows just what you need is  
We're going down, down, underground  
We're going down, down, underground  
Trust me I know what is true  
What is good for you  
Here in your heaven, in your hell  
Are you living, pray tell  
We're going down, down, underground  
We're going down, down, underground  
Now you're leaving all your friends behind  
All damnations to the family  
Are you ready to be born again  
Should you awake  
Down, down, down  
Down, down, underground  
Holier than thou, yes it's true  
I'm too good for you  
Higher than heaven, taller than jesus  
Charlie knows just what you need is  
We're going down, down, underground  
We're going down, down, underground  
We're going down, down, underground  
We're going down, down, underground
