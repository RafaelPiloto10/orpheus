"Sure God's all powerful, but does he have lips? Whoa..."  
Dear God, how have you been then?  
I'm not fine, fuck pretending  
All of this death your sending  
  
Best throw some free heart mending  
Invite you in my heart, then  
When done, my sins forgiven?  
This God of mine relaxes  
  
World dies I still pay taxes  
Can I be as my God am  
Can you be as God am  
Can I be as my God am  
  
God of all my God am  
So Lord, I see you grinnin  
Must be grand always winning  
How proud are you being able  
  
To gather faith from fable  
Can I be as my God am  
Can you be as God am  
Can I be as my God am  
  
God of all my God am  
God am  
My God am  
God am  
  
God  
All the respect I'm giving  
Shared strength acquired by living  
All blooming life you're feeding  
  
Can't hide sick ones you're weeding  
Can I be as my God am  
Can you be as God am  
Can I be as my God am  
  
God of all my God am  
God am  
God am  
God am  
  
God am
