I am confident, but  
I still have my moments.  
Baby, that's just me.  
  
I'm not a supermodel  
I still eat McDonald's.  
Baby, that's just me.  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, some may say I need to be afraid  
Of losing everything.  
Because of where I  
Had my start and,  
Where I made my name.  
But everything's the same  
In a la la land machine. Machine.  
  
Who said I can't wear my  
Converse with my dress?  
Oh, baby, that's just me!  
  
And who said I can't be single  
I have to go out and mingle  
Baby, that's not me.  
No, no.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me do you feel the way I feel  
Cause nothing else is real  
In the la-la land appeal.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I'm not gonna change  
In a la la land machine  
Well I will stay the same  
In la la land  
  
Machine  
  
I won't change anything of my life  
(I won't change anything of my life)  
I'm staying myself tonight  
(I'm staying myself tonight)
