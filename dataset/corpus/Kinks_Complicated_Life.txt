Well I woke this morning with a pain in my neck,  
A pain in my heart and a pain in my chest,  
I went to the good doctor and the good doctor said,  
You gotta slow down your life or you're gonna be dead,  
Cut out the struggle and strife,  
It only complicates your life.  
  
Well I cut down women I cut out booze,  
I stopped ironing my shirts, cleaning my shoes,  
I stopped going to work, reading the news,  
I'm sitting twiddling my thumbs 'cause I got nothing to do,  
Minimal exercise,  
To help uncomplicate my life,  
Gotta stand and face it life is so complicated,  
Ladi dah di dahdah, ladi dah di dah dah,  
Got to get away from the complicated life son,  
Life is overated, life is complicated,  
Must alleviate this, complicated life.  
  
Like old Mother Hubbard  
I got nothin' in the cupboard,  
Got no dinner and I got no supper,  
Holes in my shoes I got holes in my socks,  
I can't go to work 'cause I can't get a job,  
The bills are rising sky high,  
It's such a complicated life,  
Gotta stand and face it,  
Life is so complicated.
