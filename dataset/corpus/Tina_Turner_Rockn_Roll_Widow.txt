I'm sitting at home and the phone doesn't even ring  
I'm all alone again  
Not a sound in the house save the radio  
FM DJ filling up the emptiness  
Baby's on the road again  
Six weeks nation-wide opening the show  
  
And I'm making it on my own like a rock'n roll widow  
Get my news from the Rolling Stone, wake by the telephone  
Wonder if he's alone  
Or is my man on a permanent loan to rock'n roll  
Rock'n roll  
  
Outdoor concert, watching him play for me  
I fall in love again  
He says his music is everything  
Helpless, caught by the melody  
When he begins to sing  
Go on, tell me he's like all the rest  
  
And I'm making it on my own like a rock'n roll widow  
Get my news from the Rolling Stone, wake by the telephone  
Wonder if he's alone  
Or is my man on a permanent loan to rock'n roll  
Rock'n roll  
  
Watching him run  
I've got the feeling that he's already lost in the life  
  
So I'm making it on my own like a rock'n roll widow  
Get my news from the Rolling Stone, wake by the telephone  
Wonder if he's alone  
Or is my man on a permanent loan to rock'n roll  
To rock'n roll
