I met a girl a wonderful girl  
Who's really got a lot to recommend her for a girl  
Fabulous creature without any doubt  
Hey what am I getting so excited about  
She's just a girl an everyday girl  
And yet I guess she's really rather special for a girl  
For once you've seen her the others are not  
Hey what am I getting so excited about  
But so what what has she got others have not  
Two eyes two lips a nose all girls have some of those  
But when she looks up at me what do I see  
The most enchanting face my pulse begins to race  
Hey I met a girl a marvelous girl  
She rarer than uranium and fairer than a pearl  
Found me a treasure and I want to shout  
Hey what am I getting so excited about  
But so what what has she got others have not  
Two eyes two lips a nose all girls have some of those  
But when she looks up at me what do I see  
The most enchanting face my pulse begins to race  
(I got a girl a marvelous girl)  
(She rarer than uranium and fairer than a pearl)  
Found me a treasure and I want to shout  
This is what am I getting so excited about  
(He met a girl) and I fell in love today
