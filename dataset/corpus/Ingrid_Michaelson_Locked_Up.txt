I have taken a wrong turn?  
When will I learn? When will I learn?  
Shall I show them all my scars?  
Cherry red bleeding burn  
  
Like an angry apple tree  
I throw my apples if you get to close to me  
But if I look to my right  
Will I see the one I fight for?  
If I look to my right or if I turn to my left  
Will I see that I've kept my heart locked up?  
Locked up so tight  
  
Love, love, love, love is everywhere  
But not a drop for me to drink  
Tie me up and bind my feet  
Drop me in and watch me sink  
  
Like an angry apple tree  
I throw my apples if you get to close to me  
But if I look to my right  
Will I see the one I fight for?  
If I look to my right or if I turn to my left  
Will I see that I've kept my heart locked up?  
Locked up  
  
If I was 17 I could find it in between  
The cushions of somebody's couch  
I could find it, I could find it  
If I was 17 I could find it in a dream  
A dime a dozen kind of love  
I could find it I could find it  
  
But I'm not 17  
And I lost it in between the birthday cakes  
And past mistakes that roll on by  
  
But if I look to my right  
Will I see the one I fight for?  
If I look to my right or If I turn to my left  
Will I see that I've kept my heart locked up?  
Locked up so tight
