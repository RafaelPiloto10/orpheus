He left Maine 'cause he needed a change  
And he was desperate to rearrange priorities  
And he thought the sea would be the best place to be  
So he saved his money, sold his car  
And with his eye set on a Southern star  
Got the courage to follow his heart  
Set out for a brand new start  
  
He's an island boy  
Now he's an island boy  
Living his life where stress is the enemy  
Now he's an island boy  
A stone's throw from St. Croix  
He's finally found his piece of serenity  
  
Now he tends bar at the Old Mango  
And he sees tourists come and go  
With their pressed pants and camera case  
Too much sun burned on their face  
Now he watches the snow on CNN  
With all of his dope-smokin' friends  
Just look at the hell they must be in  
Swears he won't go back again  
  
He's an island boy  
Now he's an island boy  
Living his life where stress is the enemy  
Now he's an island boy  
A stone's throw from St. Croix  
He's finally found his piece of serenity  
  
You know the love of his life has always been Emily  
She loves the man she sees  
In her island boy  
Now he's an island boy  
Living his life where stress is the enemy  
Now he's an island boy  
A stone's throw from St. Croix  
He's finally found his piece of serenity  
  
Island boy  
A stone's throw from St. Croix  
Island boy  
Island boy  
Island boy
