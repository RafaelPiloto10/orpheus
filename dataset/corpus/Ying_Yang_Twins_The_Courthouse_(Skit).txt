Thank you...this is Wes Johnson comin' live from the streets of the ATL  
Gettin' the view of the public about the Brian Nichols case...  
  
Excuse me miss what's your outlook?  
  
"Well I personally think it's very sad that someone decided to kill someone  
Because they don't wanna take responsibility for what they've done  
And for this to happen to the courthouse  
It just doesn't feel safe anymore"
