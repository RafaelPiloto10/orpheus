By Bob Dylan  
  
If you getcha one girl, better get two  
Case you run into Gypsy Lou  
She's a ramblin' woman with a ramblin' mind  
Always leavin' somebody behind.  
Hey, 'round the bend  
Gypsy Lou's gone again  
Gypsy Lou's gone again.  
  
Well, I seen the whole country through  
Just to find Gypsy Lou  
Seen it up, seen it down  
Followin' Gypsy Lou around.  
Hey, 'round the bend  
Gypsy Lou's gone again  
Gypsy Lou's gone again.  
  
Well, I gotta stop and take some rest  
My poor feet are second best  
My poor feet are wearin' thin  
Gypsy Lou's gone again.  
Hey, gone again  
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend  
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend.  
  
Well, seen her up in old Cheyenne  
Turned my head and away she ran  
From Denver Town to Wichita  
Last I heard she's in Arkansas.  
Hey, 'round the bend  
Gypsy Lou's gone again  
Gypsy Lou's gone again  
  
Well, I tell you what if you what if you want to do  
Tell you what, you'll wear out your shoes  
If you want to wear out your shoes  
Try and follow Gypsy Lou.  
Hey, gone again  
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend  
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend.  
  
Well, Gypsy Lou, I been told  
Livin' down on Gallus Road  
Gallus Road, Arlington  
Moved away to Washington.  
Hey, 'round the bend  
Gypsy Lou's gone again  
Gypsy Lou's gone again  
  
Well, I went down to Washington  
Then she went to Oregon  
I skipped the ground and hopped a train  
She's back in Gallus Road again.  
Hey, I can't win  
Gypsy Lou's gone again  
Gypsy Lou's gone again  
  
Well, the last I heard of Gypsy Lou  
She's in a Memphis calaboose  
She left one too many a boy behind  
He committed suicide.  
Hey, you can't win  
Gypsy Lou's gone again  
Gypsy Lou's gone again
