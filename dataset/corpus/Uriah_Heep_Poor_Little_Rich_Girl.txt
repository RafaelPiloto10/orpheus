You say you're gonna testify  
Lie away, lie away  
So you're gonna gun me down  
Go ahead, fire away  
You say you'll bring the curtain down  
Turn around, walk away  
You're gonna close this theater down  
Go ahead, stop the play  
Your money talks, you pull the strings  
Someone waits, in the wings  
You flick the switch, the dancer falls  
You deal the cards, the dealer calls in your game  
  
[Chorus]  
Poor little rich girl  
Your money talks, you pull the strings  
It's a shame, poor little rich girl  
Your money burns, we all have wings  
You say you're gonna leave this town  
Fly away, fly away  
So you gonna shoot me down  
  
Go ahead  
Your money burns  
Your money stings  
Another script, left on the floor  
Another face is shown the door in your game  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Poor little rich girl  
Your money talks, you pull the strings  
It's a shame, poor little rich girl  
Your money burns, we all have wings  
In the game, poor little rich girl  
It's easy come, it's easy go  
It's a shame, poor little rich girl  
You lock the door, close the show
