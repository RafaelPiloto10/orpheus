There was a place in East St. Louis, it was in  
Nineteen fifty nine, when they played they filled  
The streets with music, that lonely blue note music  
That takes your cares away, far away  
They packed the place when the band was playin'  
To get some joy from a smoke filled room, through that door  
You could see the bodies swayin', the blue note band  
Was playin' some lonely blue note song all night long  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
No place I'd rather stay  
If you should ever make it to St. Louis on some hot  
And lonely night, if you listen you can hear  
That blue note music, they fill the streets with music  
It carries you away, far away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
No place I'd rather stay
