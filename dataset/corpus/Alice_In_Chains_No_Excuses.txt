It's alright  
There comes a time  
Got no patience to search  
For peace of mind  
Layin' low  
Want to take it slow  
No more hiding or  
Disguising truths I've sold  
  
Everyday it's something  
Hits me all so cold  
Find me sittin' by myself  
No excuses, then I know  
  
It's okay  
Had a bad day  
Hands are bruised from  
Breaking rocks all day  
Drained and blue  
I bleed for you  
You think it's funny, well  
You're drowning in it too  
  
Everyday it's something  
Hits me all so cold  
Find me sittin' by myself  
No excuses, then I know  
  
Yeah, it's fine  
We'll walk down the line  
Leave our rain, a cold  
Trade for warm sunshine  
You my friend  
I will defend  
And if we change, well I  
Love you anyway  
  
Everyday it's something  
Hits me all so cold  
Find me sittin' by myself  
No excuses, then I know
