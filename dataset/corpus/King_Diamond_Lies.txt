Yesterday I spent an hour  
A full hour in therapy  
My favourite Doctor Landau  
My God I hate his breath  
  
He asked me questions  
That kind of fool deserves a lie  
I gave him answers  
The kind of answers Doctor like  
Yes, I gave him a bunch of lies  
  
I told him all My nightmares  
Were dead and gone  
"These days I sleep like a baby  
And there never ever was a "THEM"  
  
He asked me questions  
That kind of fool deserves a lie  
I gave him answers  
The kind of answers Doctors like  
  
The Doctor looked at My eyes  
Landau: "No trace of insanity  
Maybe the time is right now  
To have a visit from the family  
I'm thinking of Your Mother  
What does My little patient say?"  
  
I should have taken his stethoscope  
And then forced it down his throat  
My Mother was at stake  
So I behaved  
  
That night I cleaned the entire house  
For everything but the memories  
No dust, no tea, ah stupid me  
I even took the axe away  
The sun is up and it's time for bed  
I'm so tired  
I can't wait no more
