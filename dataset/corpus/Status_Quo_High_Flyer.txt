Here we go another twenty four hours  
Every one of them away from you  
I'm laughing when I ought to be crying  
Baby tell me are you crying too  
You see a room in a five-star hotel  
It never really meant much to me  
Who needs a bottle of '57  
When the water back home is free?  
  
I'm just a flyer, getting higher  
Yeah I'm getting higher, a high flyer  
  
I've got no time on the highway  
And too much time on the road  
I've got no time on the highway  
(On the highway)  
  
Here we go another twenty four hours  
Making money for the GPO  
When we oughtta be taking it easy  
We're getting ready for another show  
And every day when you're all a-sleeping  
And in the night you see the sun  
I'm just a face in a crowd of people  
Who want to tell me I'm the only one  
  
I'm just a flyer, getting higher  
Yeah I'm getting higher, a high flyer  
  
But do I, do I, do I need to  
I'm getting down when I've gotta get back to you  
But do I, do I, do I want to  
I'm getting down when I've gotta get back to you  
  
I'm just a flyer, getting higher  
Yeah I'm getting higher, a high flyer
