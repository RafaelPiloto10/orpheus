Runnin' through this business of life  
Raisin' sand if I'm needed to.  
Ain't so funny when things ain't feelin' right.  
Then daddy's hand helps to see me through.  
Sweet as sugar, love won't wash away.  
Rain or shine, it's always here to stay.  
All these years you and I've spent together.  
All this, we just couldn't stand the weather.  
  
Like a train that stops at every station,  
We all deal with trials and tribulations.  
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years.  
Entangled in yellow and cries all his tears.  
Changes come before we can grow.  
Learn to see them before we're too old.  
Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy.  
Understand, it's time to get ready for the storm.
