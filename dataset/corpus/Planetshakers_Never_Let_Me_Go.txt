You pick me up when  
I am down and on my own  
You hold my hand and lead me on  
Into Your plans  
  
Whenever I cry out You hear me  
Whenever I fall down You hold me  
  
I want to live for You  
My God You are my all  
God help me stand for  
You each day and be Your voice  
  
Whenever I cry out You hear me  
Whenever I fall down You hold me  
Whenever I stand up You're with me  
I know Your Spirit's living in me  
  
Hold me, never let me go  
Change me, I want the world to know  
You are living in me  
God I know You'll never let me go  
  
You'll never let me go  
You'll never let me go  
  
Hold me, Hold me  
Hold me, Jesus never let me go  
  
You'll never let me go
