Well I've been waiting so long  
I've been waiting so patiently  
Out of the blue you call  
You're leaving him to be with me now  
  
Now maybe I'm right, or maybe I'm wrong  
Oh, I gotta know now  
I'll take what you got, so you'd better hold on  
You'd better believe it  
  
Cos that's how I feel when I'm in your arms  
That's how I feel when I'm with you  
You make me feel like never before  
That's how I feel when I'm with you  
  
He doesn't treat you good  
He doesn't say the things that I say  
So when he turns around  
You're gonna stab him in the back and then walk away  
  
Now maybe I'm right, or maybe I'm wrong  
Oh, I gotta know now  
I'll take what you got, so you'd better hold on  
You'd better believe it  
  
Cos that's how I feel when I'm in your arms  
That's how I feel when I'm with you  
You make me feel like never before  
That's how I feel when I'm with you  
  
You've been away too long  
And now you're coming home  
But I won't believe it until  
I'm holding you tight, tight, tight tonight  
  
Now maybe I'm right, or maybe I'm wrong  
Oh, I gotta know now  
I'll take what you got, so you'd better hold on  
You'd better believe it  
  
Cos that's how I feel when I'm in your arms  
That's how I feel when I'm with you  
You make me feel like never before  
That's how I feel when I'm with you  
  
That's how I feel when I'm in your arms  
(That's how I feel when I'm with you) ooh, yeah  
That's how I feel when I'm in your arms  
That's how I feel when I'm with you  
That's how I feel when I'm with you
