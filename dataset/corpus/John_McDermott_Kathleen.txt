Kathleen : to pan and terry  
Blown like a leaf on a warm summer breeze  
A vision approached me as cool as you please  
With her strawberry hair and a wink in her eye  
To say I was smitten would not be a lie  
Gathering courage I started to speak  
To ask of her name but my heart felt too weak  
Like I'd gone to heaven before I had died  
I mumbled the question she calmly replied 'kathleen'  
Well I remember my first motorbike  
With her riding pillion I'd not heard the like  
Of her giggles and squeels as we leaned left and right  
And feeling her arms round my chest holding tight  
Whilrwind romances were never my speed  
But this one took off like a runaway steed  
When she said she was having the time of her life  
I knew then this vision would soon be my wife, kathleen  
Oh kathleen the memories you've left me  
They'll be with me through all of my days  
Thinking there's safety in numbers no doubt  
Acounts for the fact that the wholw town turned out  
To behold how serenely she walked down the aisle  
But trembled and blushed as I kissed her sweet smile  
Picnics on beaches and punts on the lake  
Luck seemed to serve us a slice of life's cake  
That was more than enought to sustain us through years  
When laughter would somehow give way to some tears kathleen  
Oh kathleen the memories you've left me  
They'll be with me through all of my days  
Then at the ball she looked ever so sweet  
Heavy with child but still light on her feet  
Every head turned our way as we whirled o'er the floor  
And I love her more than I'd loved her before  
(instrumental)  
Two caring children siobhan and marie  
A grand little grandchild to bounce on my knee  
They're a fine testimonial to all that was right  
In keeping our candle of love burning bright, kathleen  
Now as my life nears it's own eventide  
It's almost as though she were here by my side  
Such a presence an aura so perfectly made  
My beautiful vision that never will fade kathleen
