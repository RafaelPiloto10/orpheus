Ooh, I've been dirt  
And I don't care  
Ooh, I've been dirt  
And I don't care  
  
'Cause I'm burning inside  
'Cause I'm burning inside  
I'm the fire of life  
Yeah alright  
  
Ooh, I've been hurt  
And I don't care  
Ooh, I've been hurt  
And I don't care  
  
'Cause I'm burning inside  
'Cause I'm burning inside  
  
And do you feel it  
Said do you feel it when you touch me  
I said do you feel it when you touch me  
  
I'm a fire  
Well there's a fire  
Yeah, alright  
  
It's just a burning inside  
It's just a burning inside  
Said do you feel it  
Said do you feel it when you cut me  
Said do you feel it when you cut me  
  
There's a fire  
There's a fire  
A fire  
Inside  
  
It was just a dreaming
