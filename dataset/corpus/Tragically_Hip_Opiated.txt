He bought two-fifths of lead free gasoline  
Said, the bottle is dusty, but my engine is clean  
He bought a nice blue suit with the money he could find  
If his bride didn't like it, St Peter wouldn't mind  
  
Now I lie here so out-of-breath  
And over-opiated  
Maybe I couldn't catch up, no but  
Maybe he could have waited  
  
Well the medicine man started seeing red  
You think the snake just dreams up the poison in his head  
Addicted to approval, addicted to the air  
It was see if you like it or see you up there
