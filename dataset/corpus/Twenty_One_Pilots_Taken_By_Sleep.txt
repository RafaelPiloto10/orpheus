This is a story about a scarlet letter... yeah.  
  
It just hit me as I lay my head down,  
No one around,  
In the dark cold night, I hear a sound  
In my head keeping track of everything you've ever said.  
Must be something, but it's nothing, so I just go back to bed.  
  
It's four, crack the door to the hallway of my dreams,  
But it seems that my hallway keeps closing in on me,  
Forcing me out,  
Making me think about you and how you're gone.  
I see four o'five with teary eyes and then I write this song.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I just can't believe that it has to be this way,  
You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day,  
I saw your face, I saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight,  
But now it's all being torn down for me tonight.  
  
And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say,  
But I need to know if you thought of me at all today,  
'Cause everyday, I walk past the place you left five days of the week,  
And now it's ten after four, and I am taken by sleep.  
[End Chorus]  
  
Spending hours on end  
Deciding what I'd say to a friend  
If I ever saw 'em again,  
  
'Cause I don't know if I know, and don't wanna come across the wrong way.  
'Cause I don't know if I know, but I know I wanna see your face today.  
  
Then somebody told me they saw you cry and break down.  
Do you know how hard that is to get around and think about?  
It's not like you to let emotions get the best of things,  
Especially when everything is hanging in the air we breath.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.  
I'll sing a song to you, my- Let's go!  
  
Friend. Yeah(3x)  
  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.(4x)
