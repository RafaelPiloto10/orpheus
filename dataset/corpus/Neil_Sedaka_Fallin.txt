I got the feeling I'm fallin'  
Like a star up in the blue  
Like I was fallin off Niagra  
In a paddle boat canoe  
I got the feeling I'm a fallin'  
And it's all because of you  
Like I was walking on a tight rope  
Swinging in the breeze  
And though I tried to keep my balance  
When I weaken in my knees  
I got the feeling I'm a fallin'  
Lover, help me please  
Like a leaf falls from the branch  
Like a rock from an avalanche  
Like the rain on a stormy day  
I never thought I'd fall this way  
I thought that love could never touch me  
Yeah, I was riding high  
And then my ivory tower toppled  
And I tumbled from the sky  
I got the feeling that I'm fallin  
And you're the reason why  
Like a life that he married for  
Like the walls of Jericho  
Like Delilah's holy town  
And Samson tore it down  
I thought that love could never touch me  
Yeah, I was riding high  
And then my ivory tower toppled  
And I tumbled from the sky  
I got the feeling that I'm fallin  
And you're the reason why
