I hear that train a-commin', it's rollin' around the bend  
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
I'm stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps draggin' on  
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone  
When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die  
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me  
  
Well if that freed me from this prison  
and that railroad train was mine  
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line  
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
