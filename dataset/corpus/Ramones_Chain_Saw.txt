Oh, oh, oh  
Sitting here with nothin' to do  
Sitting here thinkin' only of you  
But you'll never get out of there  
She'll never get out of there.  
Texas chain saw massacre  
They took my baby away from me  
But she'll never get out of there  
She'll never get out of there  
I don't care, wohoho  
  
When I saw her on the corner  
She told me told me told me told me  
She wouldn't go far  
Ooh, now I know I'm so much in love  
Cause she's the only girl that I'm ever thinking of
