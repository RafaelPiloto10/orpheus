[Verse 1]  
I've been thinking 'bout you  
Yeah, I been missing you  
Where the hell are you, oh, when I need you?  
I could still hear your voice  
I ain't got no choice, cause I'm here all alone  
I know I can't wait 'til you get home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, I don't have you here with me  
But at least I have the memory  
I tried to make it through the night  
But I can't control my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Got these thoughts in my head  
Ain't no way to forget  
Got me losing my breath  
Nobody got me the way that you did  
Had my eyes rolling back  
Had me arching my back  
Now you love me so good  
I wish you would hurry up and come back  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, I don't have you here with me  
But at least I have the memory  
I tried to make it through the night  
But I can't control my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you, baby  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
  
[Bridge]  
Baby, I don't want no one, no one else  
So hurry, cause I need some, need some, need some help  
And I'll be waiting patient, patiently  
Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me  
But at least I have the memory  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
