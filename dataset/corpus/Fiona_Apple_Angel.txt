(Jimi Hendrix)  
  
Angel come on down from heaven yesterday  
Stayed with me just long enough to rescue me  
And she told me a story yesterday  
About the love between the moon  
And the deep blue sea  
Then she spread her wings high above me  
And she said she gonna come back tomorrow  
  
And I said  
Fly on by, sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on, my sweet angel  
Tomorrow I will be right by your side  
  
Sure enough, this woman came home to me  
Silver wings, silhouette against a child's own prize  
Oh, angel, she said unto me  
Today is the day for you to rise  
Take my hand, take my hand  
You're gonna rise  
And then, she took me high over yonder  
  
And I said  
Fly on by, sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on, my sweet angel  
Forever I will be right by your side  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo, ooh  
I, uh-huh, I, uh-huh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
I, I, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
