No sleep  
Today  
Can't even rest when the suns down  
No time  
There's not enough  
And nobody's watchin' me now  
  
When we were children we'd play  
Out in the streets just dipped in fate  
When we were children we'd say  
That we don't the meaning of  
Fear, fear, fear,  
Fear, fear, fear  
We don't know the meaning of  
  
When we were children we'd play  
Out in the streets just dipped in fate  
When we were children we'd say  
That we don't the meaning of  
Fear, fear, fear,  
Fear, fear, fear  
We don't know the meaning of  
  
Wish I  
Didn't know the meaning of
