Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm drivin'  
Gettin' higher than the Bee Gee's, sayin' we both just stayin' alive and  
Watchin' the time go by, climbin'  
Told you I did enough hash, to make a mountain  
And you could sit right on your ass, doubtin'  
While I'm somewhere rollin' up grass, going up where the clouds is  
Some niggas say they get so high that I ain't fuckin' wit' 'em  
I say if them niggas get that high man I ain't fuckin' wit' 'em  
Doing nothin' wit' 'em, rollin' up or puffin wit' 'em'  
Goin' on the road, doin' shows or gettin' duckies wit' 'em'  
I been smokin' in my pictures since Myspace  
You niggas extra-curricular, bitch I fly straight  
  
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell 'em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)  
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)  
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing homie I'm
straight (homie I'm straight)  
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same
way  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
  
Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm rappin'  
And my homies smoke like I smoke so we both just make it happen  
Niggas sayin' they be smokin', they be actin'  
'Cause you ain't yet really smoked unless you smoked one with the captain  
High as fuck, choked up in my cabin  
Got some OG from a fan and it was rolled up in a napkin  
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers  
Never smokin' that bullshit with them fucked up names of them flavors  
I remember puttin' weed in my videos, niggas thought I was insane  
Now every time I turn on a video, I see the exact same thing  
'Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool  
You niggas ain't got it naw, you niggas just ain't you  
That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose  
Lil homie I gotta ball, it's something you can't do  
So suckas hate  
  
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell 'em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)  
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)  
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing homie I'm
straight (homie I'm straight)  
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same
way  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
