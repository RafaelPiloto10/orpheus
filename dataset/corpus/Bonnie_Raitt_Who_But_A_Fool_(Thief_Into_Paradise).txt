Paradise  
I got man who loves me  
In his life  
He puts no one else above me  
It's paradise  
With everything I ever wanted  
Paradise  
It's just like love should be  
  
Now you're a thief  
Everybody I know knows it  
You're indiscreet  
Anybody on the street knows  
That you cheat  
The damage that you're doin' doesn't  
Cross your mind  
Steal the heart just like a thief  
  
[Chorus]  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Tell me, tell me, tell me who  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Tell me, tell me  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
  
You got me  
Thinkin' I want what you're givin'  
You got me  
Wonderin' what I'm missin'  
I can see  
It's the same old fascination  
What a deadly game  
That sends them all right into your flame  
  
[Chorus]
