We said we'd walk together  
Baby come what may  
Back from the twilight  
Should we lose our way  
As we were walking  
A hand should slip free  
I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
  
Swore we'd travel together  
Darlin' side by side  
We'd help each other  
Stay in stride  
Each lover steps on  
So differently  
So I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
  
Everyone dreams of  
A love lasting and true  
You and I know what this world can do  
So let's make ourselves be  
That the other may see  
And I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
  
There's a beautiful river  
In the valley ahead  
There need be no drought  
Soon we will wed  
Should we lose each other  
In the shadow of the evening dreams  
Oh, I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Darlin' I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
  
Wait for me  
If I should fall behind wait for me  
Wait for me
