Your love is infectious,  
Your rotten to the core,  
Every body knows what you got,  
But they still come back for more,  
Your everybody's favorite,  
You give them all a good time,  
Your loves a total disaster,  
But when they sign the dotted line they're,  
  
Poisoned  
One night with you and you've got me,  
Poisoned,  
Making love with the devils daughter,  
Poisoned,  
One night with you and you've got me,  
Poisoned,  
That dirty little bitch has got me,  
Poisoned.  
  
Sitting close beside me,  
Hand upon my zip,  
Don't bother to take it down, honey,  
It's about to rip,  
She's mammy's little virgin,  
Her daddy's all in pride,  
But she welcomed me with opened legs,  
Kept me satisfied.  
  
Tell me that you love me,  
Say you'll never leave,  
The more I give the more you take,  
The more that you receive,  
I got you down beneath me,  
Open wide (ha ha),  
I'm gonna make you pay for all,  
The times you've cheated and lied.
