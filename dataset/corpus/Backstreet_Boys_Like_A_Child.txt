If I could right the wrongs that made you cry  
I make a promise not to say good-night  
"Cause I'm holding on  
With a love so strong  
And I can't take a day without you by my side  
  
Girl if i could change  
If I could change your mind  
Baby you could help me wipe these tears from my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl don't stop  
The sun from shining down on me  
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile  
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me  
The I might break down and cry just like a child  
  
Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free  
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me  
So I'm pressin' on  
I hope you understand  
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands  
  
So if I could change  
And it won't hurt your pride  
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a child  
Just like a child  
With the spirits running free  
She showed my why  
Oh, she did  
  
Like a child(oh baby)  
Just like a child  
Think of what our love could be  
If our hearts could set us free  
Like a child  
  
[Chorus]
