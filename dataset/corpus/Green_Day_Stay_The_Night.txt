Well I ain't got much time so I'll get to the point  
Do you wanna share a ride and get the fuck out of this joint?  
I've got an impulse so impulsive that it burns  
I wanna break your heart until it makes your stomach churn  
  
I got to know if you're the one that got away  
Even though it was never meant to be  
  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
  
I'm just sick and tired of feeling so alone  
I don't understand the point if you have to go home  
So won't you stay and count the circles 'round my eyes?  
And we can watch the stars until the sun begins to rise  
  
I got to know if you're the one one that got away  
Even though it was never meant to be  
  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
  
I got to know if you're the one one that got away  
Even though it was never meant to be  
  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye
