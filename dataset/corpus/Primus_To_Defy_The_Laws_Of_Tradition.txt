What if Christmas didn't come this year  
And no one paid for Christmas cheer?  
Who would cry the biggest tear,  
The child or the store?  
Why do brides wear virgin white?  
Most do not deserve that right.  
But to choose a color of their delight  
Would surely bring on the frowns.  
To defy the laws of tradition  
Is a crusade only of the brave.  
Suppose the taxman, he comes to town,  
And you don't lay your money down.  
Yet Mr. Jones he killed Mr. Brown the other day.  
Well I wonder, who's gonna go to hell.
