[Chorus]  
You're such a pretty little thing  
I want to put a wedding ring on your finger  
Baby can't you see that we were meant to be together  
Yeah the joinin' of our hearts is written in the stars  
We've got a love made in heaven  
So baby take my hand I want to be your man forever  
  
Well I can't think of anyone else it's true  
All day long there's no one on my mind but you  
And I have loved you since you were a little girl  
You mean everything to me and you're all I'll ever need in this world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time I look into your eyes I see  
The one I want beside me for eternity  
You could make me the happiest man alive  
By settin' up a date and takin' my name for life  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Baby take my hand I want to be your man forever
