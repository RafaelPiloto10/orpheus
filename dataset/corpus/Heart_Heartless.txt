The doctor said "Come back again next week, I think that you need me."  
All she did was cry  
She wanted to die "Doctor when can you see me?"  
There's a guy out there!  
Seems like he's everywhere!  
It just ain't fair!  
  
Heartless Heartless! Never out of control  
Heartless Heartless! Sin in the name of rock and roll  
Heartless Heartless! He thinks it's so cool to be cold  
Never realize the way love dies when you crucify it's soul  
  
Late night in the penthouse room, the fire is burning  
Shadows are warm, laying in his arms she answers his yearning  
Her eyes are filled with sand  
  
Heartless Heartless! Never out of control  
Heartless Heartless! Sin in the name of rock and roll  
Heartless Heartless! He thinks it's so cool to be cold  
Never realize the way love dies when you crucify it's soul
