There is a house in New Orleans  
They call the risin' sun  
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And, God, I know I'm one  
  
I cried to my daddy on the telephone  
How long now?  
Until the clouds unroll and you come down  
The line went  
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent  
  
I cried to my daddy on the telephone  
How long now?  
Until the clouds unroll and you come home  
The line went  
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent  
  
Lo-cha-hey!  
  
The saints are coming  
The saints are coming  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize there's no reply  
The saints are coming  
The saints are coming  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize there's no reply  
  
A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief  
How long now?  
Until the weather change condemns belief  
How long now?  
When the night watchman lets in the thief  
What's wrong now?  
  
Boom! Cha! Hey!  
  
The saints are coming  
The saints are coming  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize there's no reply  
The saints are coming  
The saints are coming  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize there's no reply  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize there's no reply  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize there's no reply
