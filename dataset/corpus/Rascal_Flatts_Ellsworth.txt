Grandma burned the biscuits  
Nearly took the house down with it  
Now she's in assisted livin'  
We all knew that day would come  
  
We knew she was too gone to drive  
The day she parked on I-65  
Found her on the shoulder cryin'  
She didn't know where she was  
  
It's like her mind just quit  
Oh, but bring up Grandpa  
It's like someone flipped a switch  
  
A front porch light and a blue DeSoto  
Couple of straws in a Coca-Cola  
You could see it all goin' down  
A handsome boy in army green  
  
A tear on his face, down on a knee  
Shaky voice, a diamond ring  
She'll put you in that town  
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today  
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas, 1948  
  
She takes out his medals  
A cigar box of letters  
Sits and scatters pictures  
Black and whites of days gone by  
  
We started losing her when she lost him  
But to hear her carry on  
You'd swear she's seventeen again  
  
Football games and leaves are cracklin'  
Walking her home in his leather jacket  
You can see it all goin' down  
A perfect night on a front porch glider  
  
Sayin' goodnight for the next three hours  
Her tired eyes grow wide and bright  
When she talks about that town  
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today  
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas, 1948  
  
While the world is fading all around her  
Sharin' a sundae at the counter  
He's goin' on and on about her  
  
Bet she's right there right now  
Tomorrow she won't remember what she did today  
But just ask her about Ellsworth, Kansas, 1948
