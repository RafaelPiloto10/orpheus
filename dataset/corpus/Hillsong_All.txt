You're the one who give shelter  
And you're the light that leads me home  
You're the love that gave forever...  
Lord you're all that I know  
  
And all that I am... Unto you I surrender....  
Lord there is none like you  
And I know that I stand.... In the arms of forever...  
Lord there is none like you  
  
There is none like you  
  
With the world upon your shoulders....  
Lord you gave your life away  
If the world I know was over....  
I know I'd have life in the price you paid  
  
And I will stand.... And I will worship you forever...  
For all you are  
And I will stand.... And all to you I will surrender...  
I'll worship you forever
