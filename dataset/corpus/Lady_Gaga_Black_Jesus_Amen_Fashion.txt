I grew up in New York City  
Since I was born on Broadway, baby  
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen  
To start a new life on the New York scene  
  
There's no way I could be stopped  
Was taking my best shot  
I had better plans there's no way I could be stopped  
Was coming for your spot I met a better man  
  
Amen, on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion, on the runway  
Work it, black Jesus  
  
Amen, on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion, on the runway  
Work it, black Jesus  
  
Dancing in my revelation  
Underground pop civilization  
Concrete poetry to feed my mind  
Old symbolism was left behind  
  
There's no way I could be stopped  
Was taking my best shot  
I had better plans, there's there's no way I could be stopped  
Was coming for your spot, I met a better man  
  
Amen, on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion, on the runway  
Work it, black Jesus  
  
Amen, on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion, on the runway  
Work it, black Jesus  
  
Put it on, amen fashion  
Celebrate, oh oh, a new compassion  
Put it on, amen fashion  
Celebrate, ooh ooh, style your passion  
  
Put it on, amen fashion  
Celebrate, oh oh, a new compassion  
Put it on, amen fashion  
Celebrate, oh oh, wear out your vision  
  
Black Jesus, black Jesus, black Jesus  
Jesus is the new black, oh  
  
Amen, on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion, on the runway  
Work it, black Jesus  
  
Amen, on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion, on the runway  
Work it, black Jesus  
  
Amen, on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion, on the runway  
Work it, black Jesus  
  
Amen, on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion, on the runway  
Work it, black Jesus
