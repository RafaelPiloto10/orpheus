Chillun', listen here to me  
This is my philosophy  
To see me through the day  
To scare my cares away  
  
All God's Chillun Got Rhythm  
All God's Chillun got swing  
Maybe haven't got money  
Maybe haven't got shoes  
All God's Chillun Got Rhythm  
For to push away the blues  
Yeah !  
  
All God's Chillun got trouble  
Trouble don't mean a thing  
When they start to go ho ho ho de ho  
Troubles bound to go 'way, say!  
  
All God's Chillun Got Swing.
