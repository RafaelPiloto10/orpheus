Lowell: Years ago in Germany when I was a very small boy, zere was a lot of
people standing around on ze corners asking questions: "Why are you standing
on ze corner, acting ze way you act, looking like you look? WHY DO YOU LOOK
THAT WAY?" And they ask me and I only would say: "I don't . . . I don't know,
I'm just standing 'round ze corner waiting here . . . just in . . . in ze
evening, and . . . and it's so nice outside . . . the night is so nice . . .
why . . . are you just asking these questions . . . "
