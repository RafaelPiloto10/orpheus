Morning came and so did they, flying  
Questions from the police  
I'm waiting here in an ambulance for  
Dr. landau  
To return and tell me why they're  
Taking me so far away  
"I did what I did and I'm glad I did,  
'Cause I could have been the...  
I could have been the next in line"  
  
Nobody found a trace of missy  
I'd be the last to tell them anyway  
How could I ever ever explain  
  
Now I hear "them" again, singing  
Twilight symphony, twilight  
I hear "them" again, singing  
Twilight symphony, twilight  
  
Grandma' was dead with an open neck  
Blood still running from my open  
Mouth  
I knew they would blame it, they  
Would blame it all on me  
How could I ever ever explain  
  
Now I hear "them" again, singing  
Twilight symphony, twilight  
I hear "them" again, singing  
Twilight symphony, twilight  
  
Dr. landau returned, and I told him the  
Story  
"Are you mad or just insane?"  
I tried anyway  
"You can take him away now, the boy  
Has lost his mind"  
Oh no no  
  
I haven't seen my mother since they  
Took me away  
And dr. landau wouldn't tell me  
He wouldn't tell me anything  
Oh I'm back on the outside  
  
Time has caught up with me, and I  
Must leave for the old house  
Yes I must leave now  
Grandma'... I'm coming  
I'm coming home now  
I'm coming home now
