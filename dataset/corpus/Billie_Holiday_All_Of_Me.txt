You took my kisses and all my love  
You taught me how to care  
Am I to be just remnant of a one side love affair  
  
All you took  
I gladly gave  
There is nothing left for me to save  
  
All of me  
Why not take all of me  
Can't you see  
I'm no good without you  
Take my lips  
I want to lose them  
Take my arms  
I'll never use them  
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry  
How can I go on dear without you  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me
