[Intro: Drake]  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Jheeze, yeah  
Right, look, look  
  
[Verse 1: Drake]  
Tell me how you really feel, tell me how you really feel  
I would ask you what's the deal but y'all don't even got a deal  
Most niggas with a deal couldn't make a greatest hits  
Y'all a whole lot of things but you still ain't this  
I don't know no one that could tell me what to do  
Heard you never claimed the hood, heard the hood claimed you  
That can't sit well, oh well, ship sailed  
Still mine, all mine, cosign, cosign  
I pull up in yachts so big that they try to hit me with boat fines  
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah, just like the old times  
Same niggas from the old days, lot of sides on the same side  
OVO we a gold mine but I'm goin' gold in no time  
Doing plat, plat only, boys better back off me  
Hall of fame, hall of fame, like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off  
Like I'm shirt off shorty, whole city goin' crazy  
Whole city goin' crazy, top 5 no debating  
Top 5, top 5, top 5 and the whole city rate me  
And I'm back inside a matrix and I said that we would make it  
Aim squad with some traitors, knew my niggas from the basement  
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit, we done really put some days in  
  
[Interlude: Future]  
Hey why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?  
What happened?  
Did you win the Grammy? God damn  
You acting like you fucking won a trophy and shit  
This nigga turnt the fuck up  
  
[Hook: Future]  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
Swervin' out the Panoramic  
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me

I'm err off, can't stand me  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
  
[Verse 2: Future]  
Gonna peel off like a bandit  
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax  
Get pissed off, start airin' it  
Get a head start, ain't friendly  
I stand out, I don't blend in  
When I say that I meant that  
I don't want to talk to you has-beens  
I don't want features from nan them  
I don't want features or nothin'  
You can't even get on my guest list  
They want me to go to the Met Gala  
I want a Percocet and a gallon  
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter  
We sittin' right on the courtside  
I know the players on both side  
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign  
I wear the chain like a bowtie  
I wear the ring like a fo'-five  
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys  
Black tints, low profile  
Celebratin' everyday cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house  
Countin' up every single day  
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out  
  
[Hook: Future]  
They gon' think I won a Grammy
