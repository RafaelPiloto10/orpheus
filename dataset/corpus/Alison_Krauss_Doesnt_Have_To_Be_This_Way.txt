Sometimes I wonder where you're coming from  
When you roll in like thunder just to turn around and run  
It's a good thing I don't need you to stay  
  
You smell like moonlight and early morning rain  
Pray til a fool but surrender to your pain  
Or find a cure for your decay  
  
Chorus:  
You're at your best with an ache in your chest  
And that worn out old song that you play  
Only Jesus and you who long to teach us  
Should know and be left to betray  
  
I don't know the answer but I know who to blame  
You can choose the dancer if you could choose the flame  
I think you'll find they're one in the same  
It doesn't have to be this way  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't know the answer but I know who to blame  
Pray til a fool but surrender to your pain  
It's a good thing I don't need you to stay  
  
Sometimes I wonder where you're coming from  
When you roll in like thunder just to turn around and run  
It's a good thing I don't need you to stay  
It doesn't have to be this way
