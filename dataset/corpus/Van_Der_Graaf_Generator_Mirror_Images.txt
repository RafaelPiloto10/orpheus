If I'm the mirror and you're the image  
Then what's the secret between the two  
These me's and you's, how many can there be  
Oh, I don't mind all that around the place  
As long as you keep it  
Well away from me  
  
I've begun to regret that we ever met  
Between the dimensions  
It gets such a strain to pretend that the change  
Is anything but cheap  
With your infant pique and your angst pretensions  
Sometimes you act like a creep  
  
And now I'm standing in the corner  
Looking at the room and the furniture  
In cheap imitation of alienation and grief  
And now we're going to the kitchen  
Fix ourselves a drink and a cigarette  
Getting no closer to being the joker or thief  
  
Still, I reflect, this nervous wreck  
Who stands before me can see as well  
Can surely tell that he's not yet free  
He can turn aside, but can no more ignore me  
Than know which one of us is he  
Than tell what we are going to be  
Than know which one of is me  
  
And now we're going to the kitchen  
Fix ourselves a drink and a cigarette  
Getting no closer to being the joker or thief  
  
These mirror images  
These mirror images  
Won't stay, go away, are no help  
  
In these mirror images of myself  
There are no secrets
