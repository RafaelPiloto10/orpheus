On judgment day, the moon lights the way.  
And those with open eyes will see...  
Hail the avenger, midnight defender.  
The end will never be.  
  
You look to the light...  
Dawn of a new day.  
Hail the avenger...  
He who lights the way.  
  
Away with your fear, I've cried all my tears,  
Delivered from the night...  
Hail the avenger, laughing at danger.  
Shed blood, bring life.  
  
If you live by the sword...,  
You die by the sword.  
All hail! the avenger..,  
Accept our new lord.  
  
The defeated lay, lifeless in the pit.  
His face reflects the horror of his victems in tenfold.  
A death of deaths,  
All evil fear his name!  
  
Struck down, by a man!  
His severed limbs ooze oceans of our blood.  
... man stands, oh knee deep, within..!  
Paused to scream, this is not a sin,  
  
I have done your will, I've delivered.  
From this day forth, known as the avenger...  
  
Guarding the weak, and those who seek,  
Asylum from a world of wrong....!  
Hail! the avenger, midnight defender.  
Silent bold and strong.  
  
You echo our cry, so ends war.  
All hail! the avenger.  
Victory hour  
Ooo, Victory ours.  
  
Our vengeance recall, those starting to fall.  
Oh victory hour!!!
