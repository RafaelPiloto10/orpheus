Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?  
Donde esta Santa Claus?  
And the toys that he will leave.  
Mamacita, oh, where is Santa Claus?  
I look for him because it's a Christmas Eve.  
  
I know that I should be sleeping,  
But maybe he's not far away,  
Out of the window I'm peeping,  
Hoping to see him in his sleigh.  
  
I hope he won't forget to clack his castinet,  
And to his reindeer, say,  
Oh! Pancho, Oh! Vixen, Oh! Pedro, Oh! Blitzen,  
Ole! Ole! Ole! Cha cha cha.
