Everybody's talkin' bout something  
A lot of static and a lot of nothin'  
Pollutin' the air with who the hell cares kinda gossip  
Headlines to spare in our pockets in our pockets  
It's a shame but we could all stop it  
Tell a neighbor tell a friend it ain't a 60's thing  
We still need a little help  
  
[Chorus]  
Rumor bout a revolution  
Spread a little soul solution  
Let it stir in the wind  
Come on let a chance begin  
Raise a hand not a fist  
Yeah ignorance ain't bliss if it leaves us in ruins  
Rumor bout a revolution  
  
Ain't it easy passing judgment  
Just to entertain ourselves  
I'm not here pointing fingers  
Been guilty myself  
You see there's a bigger picture  
With a million point of views  
Well love ain't a color  
It's a damn strong mother  
And it ain't gonna lie  
  
Rumor bout a revolution  
Spread a little soul solution  
Let it stir in the wind  
Come on let a chance begin  
Raise a hand not a fist  
Yeah ignorance ain't bliss if it leaves us in ruins  
Rumor bout a revolution  
  
Tell a neighbor tell a friend it ain't a 60's thing  
We still need a little help  
  
[Chorus]
