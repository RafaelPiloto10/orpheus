Poor puppy, you look so sad, I guess you think that no one ever felt so bad
before.  
Everybody has the blues, everybody has the blues.  
Everybody knows the way that you feel today.  
  
Everybody gets to sit and cry, everybody gets to wonder why.  
Everybody gets to watch the sky turn grey.  
  
Maybe you lost your job, maybe you lost your girl,  
Maybe you feel like you're losing your mind that's not the end of the world.  
  
Everybody gets to feel some pain, everyone got to get to caught out in the
rain.  
Everybody got some days that they can't explain.  
  
Everybody got the blues, everybody has the blues.  
Everybody knows the way that you feel today
