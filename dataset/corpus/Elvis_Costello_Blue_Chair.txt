Now it's just you and me, my blue friend  
And you say that it's you that she's thinking of and our affair must end  
But if it's you that she's thinking of  
I think my broken heart might mend  
  
Well, it's my turn to talk, your turn to think  
Your turn to buy, my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry, my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
  
Now I've made up my mind, I've made my mistake  
And I know that she cries for you when she's barely awake  
Well, she's going to bend your mind  
Well, I hope it don't break  
  
Now it's my turn to talk, your turn to think  
Your turn to buy, my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry, my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
We can watch our troubles rise  
Like smoke into the air and drift up to the ceiling  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
You can feel just like a boy or a man  
And next minute you can find yourself kneeling  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
They're boasting of loving the daylights  
Right out of her in the small hours  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
You say, that your love lasts forever  
When you know the night is just ours, oh  
  
And still I want her right now  
Not in a minute, hour or day  
And wherever she is tonight, I want her anyway  
I suppose, she never said to you, you were just in the way  
  
Now it's my turn to talk, your turn to think  
Your turn to buy, my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry and my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue  
Blue becomes you  
Down in the blue chair
