I can't believe what is happening to me  
My head is spinning (Spinning)  
The flowers and the trees are encapsulating me  
And I go spinning (Spinning)  
  
He was the baby of the class you know  
He really didn't know that one and one was two  
Two and two were four  
He was the baby of the class you know  
He really didn't know that  
Really didn't know that  
Oh what a poor soul  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
I close my eyes and I try to imagine  
What you're dreaming  
Why can't you see what you're doing to me  
My world is spinning (Spinning)  
  
He was the baby of the class you know  
He really didn't know that one and one was two  
Two and two were four  
You were the baby of the class you know  
You were so young and so uncertain  
Suffer little children  
Oh what a poor soul  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
He was the baby of the class you know  
He really didn't know that one and one was two  
Two and two were four  
He was the baby of the class  
He was so young and so uncertain  
Suffer little children  
Oh what a poor soul  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel
