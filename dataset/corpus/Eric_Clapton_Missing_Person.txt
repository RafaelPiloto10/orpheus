I've been asking some people, if they remember  
A girl they forgot, with brown eyes, hair cut, red dress  
Have you seen her? I think she's much leaner  
I guess she is missing, it's true  
  
She has gone out there somewhere  
Disappeared into thin air, I'd just like to find her  
I'd like to remind her the good times we had then  
More than just good friends, I guess she is missing, it's true  
  
I've been asking around and what I have found  
She moved on farther this time  
I've been checkin' it out, there ain't no doubt  
That woman used to be mine  
  
She is a missing person  
She's hidin' away you see  
She is a missing person  
She's so much lighter than I'll be  
  
She is a missing person  
She's got a new rider, she's so much tighter  
Missing person  
She's hidin' away from me  
  
She up and she left, now she's gone  
She didn't even give me a clue  
Didn't write me no notes, send me no letters  
It's true  
  
She is a missing person, where are you?  
A missing person, where are you?  
  
Missing person, hidin' away from me  
Missing person, missing person  
Missing person, missing person  
Missing person
