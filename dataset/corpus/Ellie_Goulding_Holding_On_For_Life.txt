[Verse 1]  
Enemy, used to be  
Part of you, bittersweet  
But now you tell me lies  
Up and down, cold and hot  
Swear to God, got to stop  
Because I can't sleep at night  
  
[Refrain]  
If you wanted love like this  
Blowing up with every kiss  
Should've known better  
Because you find yourself alone  
Chilling you right to the bone  
No, should've known better  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me just  
Running towards the light  
Giving up the fight  
Hoping we survive  
You and me just  
Strangers in the night  
Giving up the fight  
Waiting to ignite  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
  
[Verse 2]  
Lost in you, lost in me  
Afraid of love, in too deep  
So we just run and hide  
Lightning fast, felt the crash  
Scared to lose, fear attacks  
We only know goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me just  
Running towards the light  
Giving up the fight  
Hoping we survive  
You and me just  
Strangers in the night  
Giving up the fight  
Waiting to ignite  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
  
[Refrain]  
If you wanted love like this  
Blowing up with every kiss  
Should've known better  
Because you find yourself alone  
Chilling you right to the bone  
No, should've known better  
  
[Bridge]  
Hopelessly holding on  
To all those perfect nights  
Let's pretend it's not gone  
And say we'll never die  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me just  
Running towards the light  
Giving up the fight  
Hoping we survive  
You and me just  
Strangers in the night  
Giving up the fight  
Waiting to ignite  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
  
[Outro]  
Hopelessly holding on  
To all those perfect nights  
Let's pretend it's not gone  
And say we'll never die  
Say we'll never die
