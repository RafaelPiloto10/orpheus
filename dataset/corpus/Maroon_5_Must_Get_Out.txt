I've been the needle and the thread  
Weaving figure eights and circles around your head  
I try to laugh but cry instead  
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said  
  
Fumbling through your dresser drawer  
Forgot what I was looking for  
Try to guide me in the right direction  
Making use of all this time  
Keeping everything inside  
Close my eyes and listen to you cry  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm lifting you up  
I'm letting you down  
I'm dancing till dawn  
I'm fooling around  
I'm not giving up  
I'm making your love  
This city's made us crazy and we must get out  
  
"This is not goodbye," she said,  
"It's just time for me to rest my head."  
She does not walk, she runs instead  
Down these jagged streets and into my bed  
  
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer  
Forgot what I was looking for  
Try to guide me in the right direction  
Making use of all this time  
Keeping everything inside  
Close my eyes and listen to you cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's only so much I can do for you  
After all of the things you've put me through  
  
[Chorus]
