One big happy family  
Together the rest of our lives  
As far as our friends were concerned  
Everything seemed right  
  
But that's when she told me  
She said me it was time to move on  
Just something that she kept inside  
That told me the thrill was gone  
  
And now I can't believe  
I can't believe it's over  
Suddenly it's plain to see  
She's leaving me and  
  
Even a fool can see  
There's nothing left between us  
I knew all along something was wrong  
But I did my best to deny it  
And now I can't go home  
She wants to be alone so  
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright  
Even a fool can see  
  
There were times we had nothing  
And somehow we laughed through it all  
There are moments I'll never forget  
And some I wouldn't care to recall  
  
And still I can't believe  
I can't believe it's over  
Suddenly it's plain to see  
She's doesn't need me  
  
Even a fool can see  
There's nothing left between us  
I knew all along something was wrong  
But I did my best to deny it  
And now I can't go home  
She wants to be alone so  
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright  
Even a fool can see  
  
Nothing more to talk about  
It's over when it's over  
In the end you both stop trying  
In the end it's oh so sad  
And you are crying  
  
And now I can't go home  
She wants to be alone so  
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright  
Even a fool can see  
  
Won't ya tell me that I'm alright  
Even a fool like me  
  
Woo ooo I'm alright  
Even a fool can see  
Whoa ooo ooo ooo
