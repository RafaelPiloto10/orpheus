[Mack 10]  
Whassup Cube dog?  
I got this bitch-ass nigga right here  
Y'know, fuckin with this tramp-ass bitch  
Puttin her before the scrill' all the time, yaknowhati'msayin?  
Man I got this nigga transcripts, and every-mother-fuckin thang  
Tellin this bitch all my mother-fuckin business  
Puttin ass over cash everyday  
Nigga fuck that, this Westside  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Be gone you fuckin peon, got the Don furious  
Talkin on the phone got the Federal curious  
I'm serious! I don't give a fuck where he is  
Snatch him out the factory, bring his ass back to me  
How the fuck you think I got the name Bossalini? Punk  
Mack God Rap Genie, you can't see me  
Up in this game ever since you was a lame  
Y'all train at my school, nigga I rule  
You never make me holla, smokin on a fifteen dollar  
From across the water, watch your daughter  
She might catch the Holy Ghost from this rap sermon  
While you vermin smokin Sherman, I'm rollin somethin German, bitch  
Money earnin makin mo' money (ching ching)  
Enemies look so funny, with they clothes bummy  
Don't need no honey, that's right  
Cause I'm thinkin with my big head, fuck what my dick said!  
  
Chorus: Ice Cube  
  
We puttin cash over ass, each and every day  
Go on let the players play.. (the hustlers)  
(We some money makin motherfuckers.. I know that you love us!)  
We puttin cash over ass, each and every day  
Go on let the players play.. (the hustlers)  
(We some money makin motherfuckers.. I know that you love us!)  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Now who's that nigga got these bitches lookin silly? Me!  
I'm the Big Willie for rilly, the real dilly  
You can ask Phillie cause I got a year's supply (Yup!)  
You must want to die, don't get the lye  
After dark up at Griffith Park, shallow grave  
For the mark check his heart, the game about to start  
Big thangs automatic pu-tang (automatic)  
Keep your mind off them bitches, eyes on your riches  
If it twitches give it stitches  
If it jiggles or switches, fuck and take pictures, now  
I'm livin in a two-point zone, and I'm still bumpin  
Call me in the clutch, ain't lost my touch  
Nigga what? On the microphone  
If I drove it in the video, bitch, I can drive it home  
Tight as a Corleone  
You got to get your own, baby get on, now  
  
Chorus  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Get your ass up and go to work, cause you know  
On payday, nigga that shit gon' hurt  
Fuckin with a skirt instead of handlin your bizness  
Rich dude, now you got to make three wishes  
I'm suspicious, of any motherfucker puttin fuck over finance  
'Specially fuckin up my plans  
I'm the boss, I can be late  
But you'll never see her and me, over currency  
Givin you the third degree, cause you got  
Too many broke bitches and you like bankin for a penny  
Stop fuckin on them dum-dums  
Find one with some ass and some income  
Who wanna win? Who wanna spin?  
Who wanna make, twenty-five eight? Me  
Ice Cube the great.. Pushin rhymes like weight  
  
Chorus 2X  
  
Never put that hoe, in front of that dough nigga  
For what? (Never... Fuck a bitch nigga)  
For what? She ain't gon' love you if you ain't got no dough fool  
(bitch fuckin with me got to be workin, gettin paid yaknahmsayin?)  
Gotta come up, scrilla scrilla y'all (Never ass over cash nigga)  
Scrilla scrilla y'all (We greedy)  
  
Cha-ching! (She can get some cd's, push some keys)  
Cha-ching! (Ha ha ha, make the bitches shake they tit-ties)  
Cha-ching, cha-ching! (Over my knee)  
Cha-ching, cha-ching! (Never ass over cash)  
Never ass over cash
