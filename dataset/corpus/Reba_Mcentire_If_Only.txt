If only I'd have thought to send you roses  
For no reason just to send you roses  
And if only I thought to say more often I love you  
But I just assumed you knew  
  
[Chorus]  
And if only I'd have tried a little harder  
If only we'd have talked a little more  
If only I'd have held you closer  
Then maybe I'd be holding you tonight  
If only you, if only I  
The saddest words are not goodbye  
They're if only  
  
If only we hadn't just pretended there was nothing wrong  
It might not have ended  
If only we'd have given more attention  
To the small things  
We might have it all today  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Instead of silence  
There'd been angry words  
If we had only listened  
We just might have held our hearts  
  
[Chorus]
