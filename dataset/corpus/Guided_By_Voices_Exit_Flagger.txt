I don't know where I've come from  
I don't know where I'm off to  
And I need to find a way out  
And he's here to help me find it  
  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
I'm not going to race you today  
  
I need a life the same as  
And I don't believe in anything  
I promise to leave you one of these days  
I promise it'll be real soon.  
  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
I'm not going to race you today  
  
I promise to leave you  
I promise to leave you  
I promise to leave you  
I promise to leave you
