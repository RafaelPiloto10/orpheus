Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn cop pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say  
He was made out of snow  
But the children know how he came to life one day  
There must of been some magic in  
That ol' silk cap they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day  
So he said lets run and have some fun before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand  
Runnin' here and there all around the square  
Sayin' catch me if you can  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin' please don't cry  
I'll be back again some day
