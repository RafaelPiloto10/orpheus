(I've been looking, I've been looking)  
(I've been looking, I've been looking)  
I've been looking  
For a woman  
To save my life  
Not to beg or to borrow  
A woman with a feeling  
of loosing once or twice  
Who knows how it could be  
Be tomorrow  
  
I've been waiting for you  
And you've been coming to me  
For such a long time now  
For such a long time now  
A woman with a feeling  
Of loosing once or twice  
Who knows how it could be  
Be tomorrow  
  
I've been waiting for you  
And you've been coming to me  
For such a long time now  
For such a long time now  
For such a long time now  
For such a long time now
