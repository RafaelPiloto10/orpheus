There's a part of my heart  
Wide and open for you  
The key to my heart  
It could be you  
And if you got the key to my heart  
You got to unlock the door  
And to unlock the door  
You got to find the right floor  
You can try you can try  
To get to my heart  
You can try you can try  
To find the right floor  
Go ahead and dream  
Dream as far as you want  
The key to my heart  
Is not a dream come true  
You can try ...  
If you happen to try  
You could do fine  
But if you happen to fly  
Don't fall and cry  
Please don't cry please don't cry  
You're breaking my heart  
Please don't cry please don't cry  
You're breaking my heart  
There's a part of my heart ...  
You can try ...
