Have you heard about trouble throughout the land  
With the fascists and the left wing militants  
Out of work executives are killing themselves  
And the I.R.A. are killing everybody else  
Don't panic, don't lose control  
Keep your head, keep ahold  
Act normal there's nothing wrong  
Stay cool, just carry on  
  
You gotta live life and be yourself  
You can't live life for anyone else  
You gotta live life that's all you do  
Nobody gonna live your life for you  
  
Don't get depressed when you read in the press  
About world revolution and social unrest  
Try not to panic when you switch on the news  
And see crooked politicians and the unemployment queues  
It's only life it's really fine  
So don't you believe all you read in the headlines  
Live life see it through  
Carry on it's all you can do  
  
You gotta live life for yourself, can't live for anyone else  
You gotta live life, that's all you do  
Nobody gonna live their life for you  
  
Extra verse from long version  
Trendy intellectuals always take action  
For every cause that's ever been in fashion  
Weekend revolutionaries protest and sing  
Because they're dedicated followers of any old thing  
They got every solution for every revolution  
They live in the slums just like the poor people do  
But they'd rather sniff coke instead of glue  
Right-wing fascists beat up the blacks  
Then they salute the Union Jack  
You can't pretent there's nothing wrong  
It's not the end, so just carry on  
  
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother  
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother  
  
You gotta live life for yourself, can't live life for anyone else  
You gotta live life
