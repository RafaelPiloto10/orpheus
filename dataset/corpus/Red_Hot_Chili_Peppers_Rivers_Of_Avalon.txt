Deep inside these sleeping shallows  
Far away where no-one goes now  
Take my place in golden space  
Of TV stars that no-one knows now  
Deep deep mystery is talkin' to me  
She's the giver of constant animation  
All around and ready to make a new formation  
You're the reason I'm in this world...  
I don't believe in everything I see  
Rivers of Avalon  
Your supernatural energy  
Part of my scenery  
What I belong to is you ecstacy  
Rivers of Avalon  
Your faith unwavering is king  
The clone of my own loneliness has got to fade  
What am I known to?  
Little garland in your starling  
Loving waves that I've succumbed to  
Deep deep mystery is talkin' to me  
She's the giver of constant adulation  
All around and ready to make a new formation  
You're the reason I'm in this world...  
I don't believe in everything I see  
Rivers of Avalon  
Your supernatural energy  
Part of my scenery  
What I belong to is your ecstacy  
Rivers of Avalon  
Your faith unwavering is king  
What do you see in me?  
Deep deep mystery is talkin' to me  
She's the giver of constant animation  
All around and ready to make a new formation  
You're the reason I'm in this world...  
I don't believe in everything I see  
Rivers of Avalon  
Your supernatural energy  
Part of my scenery  
What I belong to is your ecstacy  
Rivers of Avalon  
Your faith unwavering is king  
I don't believe in everything I see  
Rivers of Avalon  
Your supernatural energy  
All that it means...
