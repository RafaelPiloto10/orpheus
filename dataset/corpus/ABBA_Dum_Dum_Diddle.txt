I can hear how you work, practising hard  
Playing night and day, wo-oh  
And it sounds better now, yes you improve  
Everytime you play, wo-oh  
But it's bad  
You're so sad  
And you're only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle, your darling fiddle  
  
But I think, you don't know that I exist  
I'm the quiet kind, wo-oh  
From the day when I first listened to you  
You've been on my mind, wo-oh  
You don't care  
It's not fair  
And you're only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle, your darling find
