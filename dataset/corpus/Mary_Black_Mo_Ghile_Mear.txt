Chorus  
He is my hero, my dashing darling  
He is my caesar, dashing darling.  
I've had no rest from forebodings  
Since he went far away my darling.  
Every day I am constantly sad  
Weeping bitterly and shedding tears  
Because our lively lad has left us  
And no news from him is heard alas.  
The cuckoo sings not pleasantly at noon  
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-filled woods,  
Nor summer morning in misty glen  
Since he went away from me, my lively boy.  
Noble, proud young horseman  
Warrior unsaddened, of most pleasant countenace  
A swift-moving hand, quick in a fight,  
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.  
Let a strain be played on musical harps  
And let many quarts be filled  
With high spirit without fault or mist  
For life and health to toast my lion.  
Dashing darling for a while under sorrow  
And all ireland under black cloaks  
Rest or pleasure I did not get  
Since he went far away my dashing darling.  
For a while I was a gentle maiden  
And now a spent worn-out widow  
My spouse ploughing the waves strongly  
Over the hills and far away.
