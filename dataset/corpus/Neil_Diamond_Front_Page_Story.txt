She wakes up  
She's leaving  
She sets out so assured  
That she can find  
The life that she believes in  
She's glad now  
It's over  
She never should of gotten so involved  
At least that's what she told him  
And it' ain't a Front Page Story  
Won't even make the papers  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
And it happens much too often  
Won't ever make the headlines  
Somebody's broken heart ain't new  
Except when it happens to you  
He wonders  
What happened  
He thinks of all the things  
He might have done  
Why shouldn't she believe him  
He wakes up without her  
And never really knows  
Just what went wrong  
But it's all wrong without her  
And it ain't a Front Page Story  
Won't even make the papers  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
And it happens much too often  
Won't ever make the headlines  
Another broken heart ain't new  
Except when it happens to you  
It ain't a Front Page Story  
Won't even make the papers  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
And it happens much too often  
Won't ever make the headlines  
Somebody's broken heart ain't new  
Except when it happens to you  
No no no  
Won't make the headlines  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
No no no  
Oh no no  
Somebody's broken heart ain't news  
Except when it happens to you  
No no no  
Won't make the headlines  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
No no no  
Oh no no  
Somebody's broken heart ain't news
