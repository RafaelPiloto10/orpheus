I have been to Hell and back - kissed satanic Queen  
Traveling at the speed of light - saw thing never seen  
Arm in arm with Lucifer - Belial on my back  
I have swam the lake of flames - walked forbidden tracks  
To Hell - and back  
To Hell - and back  
I've made love to Lilleth fair - danced the zombies dance  
I have shook the reapers hand - broke his deathly trance  
Present at ungodly births - mutants writhe in pain  
I'm possessed by Hell itself - I'm the man insane  
To Hell - and back  
To Hell - and back  
Ride with me  
To Hell - and back  
You can take a trip with me - Hell's my final home  
If you wish to live at night - watch the demons room  
Holding high the Southern Cross - watch the mortals bleed  
Drink the blood and feel my wrath - watch the mutants breed  
To Hell - and back  
To Hell - and back
