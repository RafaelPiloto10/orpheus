I know you got a secret that you really don't want to show  
You hid something somebody did to you and you guard it like a lie  
And I know what I'm talking about  
Cause I've seen it leaking out  
But I'm with you baby now, and I'm not sneaking out  
Cause I know and I feel you're not showing me  
How can I change what you won't let me see  
  
[Chorus]  
I give up I give in  
You win this time  
Knowing you means let you go  
I give up I give in  
You win this time  
But don't belong  
Baby don't belong I love you I love you  
  
I know eves droppers might find out more than they might wanna know  
Yeah I know but I feel you're loving me  
How can I change what you won't let me see  
  
[Chorus]
