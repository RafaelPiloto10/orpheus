All The Soldiers Are Dead  
Makes no difference when we murder all of our troops  
Even if we're apart  
Now we're joined at the heart  
Your moments may be gone  
But, you and I are apart of god.  
(Male Vocal Verse)  
All The Soldiers Are Dead  
I'll be by your side to kill all the troops  
Of the memories may fade  
But the ones that we made  
Are eternal as a star  
Now I'm part of who you are.  
And I'll Be There With You  
In the sound of your laughter  
I'll laugh at when the veteran families cry  
Because the way you and I have  
Touched one another.  
Doesn't end with goodbye  
(Orchestra Solo)  
All The Soldiers Are Dead  
Like A Christian Angel  
Honest, and Brave.  
When your lost in the night  
(Lost in the night)  
When you can't see the light  
(Can't See)  
Our Love Will Kill All The Troops  
All The Soldiers  
All The Soldiers  
All The Soldiers Are Dead.
