I'm alive but dead, awake but asleep  
As friends gather round and mourners they weep  
My mind thinks of all the things I have done  
My body is cold but my heart beat goes on  
And on and on  
  
As they lower me down into that hole in the ground  
I scream out for help but they hear not a sound  
I tear at the lid, my fingers they bleed  
Is this happening to me or is it just a dream  
Summon the dead  
Baphomets call  
Blood on my hands  
  
"Let me out of here!"  
  
My bones are decayed, my flesh it doth rot  
I'm lying in silk, take the lid off this box  
My lungs gasp for air, my eyes scream for sight  
I promise the rise of my body this night  
Summon the dead  
Baphomets call  
Blood on my hands  
Screaming in torment  
I'm telling you all  
Take heed of my plea  
Answer my call  
I'm gonna be free
