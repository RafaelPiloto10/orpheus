I heard you crying  
Somebody stole my soul  
How could I be dying?  
I turned twenty five days ago yeah  
Were all on the ground just crying out  
Would somebody save me please.  
I won't, sit around just thinkin' bout, the troubles that tomorrow brings yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm dying to be alive yeah  
I'm dying to be alive yeah  
Lets not go through our lives  
With out just dying to be alive  
  
The people you've touched  
They way you've touched them  
I hope they'd've touched you too.  
'cause in this life, its hard to tell  
What's false and what is true yea  
Were all on the ground just cryin' out  
Would somebody save me please  
I won't sit around just thinking about  
The troubles that tomorrow brings  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we all come tumbling down  
No matter how strong we all return to the ground  
Another day gone  
A day closer to fate  
And soon we'll find it's a little bit too late  
  
The things you see, the way you see them  
Will never be seen again  
Let's go through life livin' on luck  
Betting ten thousand to ten  
Mistakes I've made in this life  
I can't say why or when  
But the thing that's strange is you only live once  
I'll never look back again yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we all come tumbling down  
No matter how strong  
We all return to the ground  
In the days to come you'll say why did I wait  
You can't just leave your life up to fate.  
You've gotta turn it around before it's too late.
