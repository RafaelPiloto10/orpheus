I tried to do a little bit of big time moving  
I played the clubs and stayed out late at night  
I tried to lose the memory of a lover  
When someone said, 'Two wrongs don't make a right'  
Well, I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
I said I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
I tried so hard to really get to understand you  
You took advantage of me from the start, oh baby  
But now it seems that you have found another  
And just like me you're gonna end with a broken heart  
Oh no, listen to me  
'cause I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
I said I had too much baby, of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
Call me if you're all alone and blue  
Say you love me and I'll come running to you  
And I will, you know I will do anything for you, oh  
'cause I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
Listen baby, I had too much honey, of this and that  
And this and that is no good, no good  
One time  
I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good, no good, no good  
I said I had too much baby, of this and that
