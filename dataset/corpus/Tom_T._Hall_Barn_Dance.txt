One night as I was sleeping something awakened me  
There was a light on in my barn so I went down to see  
I peeked through a big ole crack in the door and what do you think I saw  
The animals were havin' a barn dance right in the horses' stall  
And there was a chicken doing the chicken reel and the muskart rambled on  
The ole cow did a cow-cow boogie and the rooster crowed a song  
A mouse came out of his hidin' place and he danced on one leg  
The ole hen got so tickled that she almost laid an egg  
[ banjo - guitar ]  
They were all dressed up for the barn dance it made me want to laugh  
The rabbit wore a big bowtie and the pig was a lookin' in a lookin' glass  
And the goose danced with the gander 'til an old dog butted in  
The horse was horsing around a lot till the mare got mad at him  
And there was a chicken doing...  
And there was a chicken doing...
