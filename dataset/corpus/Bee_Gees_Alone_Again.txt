'leaving' that's all you ever seem to say and I'm tired  
The wants you have me for have expired  
Sleeping and reading every book I can find to get my mind off  
In all I was a soul you were using  
I am alone again  
You can't believe the tears that I've shed  
I'm on a bound down train  
Don't desert me now or I am dead  
  
People, the sun is going down on your heads so read your paper  
There's no one there for you to confide in  
It's instinct to always to have a shoulder to cry on  
And to rely on  
Someone there to share and to shine on  
I am alone again  
You can't believe the tears that I've shed  
I'm on a bound down train  
Don't desert me now or I am dead  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I am alone again  
You can't believe the tears that I've shed  
I'm on a bound down train  
Don't desert me down or I am dead
