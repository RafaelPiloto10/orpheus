If you never had to count  
A million cheap,  
Then youve never been blue,  
Never been blue.  
If youve never had to cry  
Yourself to sleep,  
Then youve never been blue,  
Never been blue.  
I know I could go on laughing at trouble,  
Plain trouble,  
But when it concerns my heart  
The pain seems double.  
Oh, no one ever knows what I go through,  
While someone at home is babying you.  
If you never had to miss a good night kiss,  
Then youve never, no, youve never been blue.
