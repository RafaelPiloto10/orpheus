By the way did I hear you say  
If some night I seem too lonely  
You would stay  
Oh and by the way  
Have I told you yet that only recently  
He moved out on me  
Took the towels we stole  
From some motel in tennessee  
He was gone long before he really left  
I knew it ...  
By the way he began to say:  
Love takes time, I'm in a hurry  
Anyway that's all yesterday  
Let's get back to us  
Why worry?  
If you try calling by and by  
Oh, and by the I thought I mention  
You can't stay...  
Neath the lights  
You don't look a thing like he did  
And it's time to play  
It's another day  
Why can't we make love fall  
By the way?
