Won't do no good to hold no seance  
What's gone is gone and you can't bring it back around  
Won't do no good to hold no searchlight  
You can't illuminate what time has anchored down  
  
Oh, honey I've gone away  
Honey I've gone away  
I've gone away  
  
Won't do no good to sing no love song  
No sound could simulate the presence of a man  
Won't do no good asking no questions  
Your divination should acquaint you with the plan  
  
Oh, honey I've gone away  
Honey I've gone away  
Honey I've gone away  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel for you boy,  
Is decaying in front of me  
Like the carrion of a murdered prey  
And all I want is to save you honey  
Or the strength to walk away  
  
Won't do no good to go no distance  
The space between us is a boundless as the dark  
Won't do no good to throw no fist, babe  
You can't intimidate me back into your arms  
  
'Cause, honey I've gone away  
Honey I've gone away  
I've gone away  
  
I feel for you boy,  
Is decaying right in front of me  
Like the carrion of a murdered prey  
And all I want is to save you honey  
Or the strength to walk away  
  
[Chorus: x3]
