Seems like years since I've been home  
Living this dream on the endless roads  
Faces in the crowd, they stare at me  
Yours is the only one I wanted to see  
My heart cries out for sympathy  
But I need to hold you next to me  
And it won't be long, baby  
Maybe tomorrow  
These hotel rooms they're all the same  
Only the number on the door will be changed  
Lord I gotta do me one more show  
Then it's into the bus and off we go  
Should have talked to you  
Well I don't have to try  
When I find the music in your eyes  
And I'm telling myself that we'll take that ride, baby  
Maybe tomorrow  
I should've talked to you  
Well I don't got to try  
Where I can find the music in your eyes  
We're all blind, two lovers, into the night  
Maybe tomorrow  
Maybe tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Maybe tomorrow
