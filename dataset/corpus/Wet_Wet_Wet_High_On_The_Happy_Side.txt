Everything seemed the same tonite  
And then the moon went out  
In the middle of the sky  
And the rain goin' up again  
Let it all come down, let it all come down  
You want to hear how the story goes  
You want to see how you're never told  
Where lies this fool's gold  
  
Everytime that you say goodbye, I sit and wonder why  
Why all this happiness, now there's nothing goin' on  
Everytime that you say goodbye, I'll sit and I'll get high  
High on the happy side again  
  
I hear the songs on the radio  
But they don't turn me on  
I hear the world's been shakin' up again  
And the deals been done, and the storm it has begun  
You want to hear how the story goes  
You want to see but you're never told  
Where lies this fools gold
