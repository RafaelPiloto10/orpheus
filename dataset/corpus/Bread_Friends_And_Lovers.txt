Friends and lovers  
Saying goodbye to each other  
Their way  
Your way  
  
Gathered in garden and parting in doorways  
And it's over  
Anyway that's what the papers said.  
And I wonder  
  
What was going on inside your head  
You were there  
You were there  
I'd like to ask  
  
Did anybody touch you?  
Come and go it went so fast  
Did anybody touch you?  
Friends and lovers  
  
Turning away from the others  
Your way  
Their way  
Closing their doors and then climbing their  
  
Stairways  
And it's over  
Anyway that's what the people say and I wonder  
Does it really have to be this way  
  
You were there  
You were there I'd like to ask  
Did anybody touch you.  
Come and go it went so fast  
  
Did anybody touch you.  
Come and go it went so fast  
Did anybody touch you?  
Or did you stand alone until the darkness came  
  
Just one more room where everybody knew  
Your name.  
Friends and lovers  
Ever apart from others  
  
Endless hallways  
Just say goodbye and it's over for always  
And it's over  
Didn't you believe me when I said and I wonder  
  
What was going on inside your head  
You were there  
You were there I'd like to ask  
Did anybody touch you?  
  
Come and go it went so fast  
Did anybody touch you?
