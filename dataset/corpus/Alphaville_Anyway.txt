Welcome, or should I say goodbye  
It's a question how close we are apart  
Are you going back home after this show  
Or leaving for the wild  
And when you passing the wardrobe  
What will you take  
Your worn out hat of hopes  
Or someone else's attractive furs to make it through  
The playgrounds of your life  
  
All is shown  
All shut down  
All the world is gone  
All the pieces came together  
  
Finally, but not too late  
All is shown  
All shut down  
All the world is gone  
  
Just pretend that I'm not there  
Make your choice  
I love you anyway  
Just make your choice  
Pretend that I'm not there  
  
All the world is gone  
All the world is gone  
  
Just take it  
Just take it  
And you'll make it  
Alright, yeah  
Ride on, ride on
