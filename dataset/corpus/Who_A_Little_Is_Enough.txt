They say that love often passes in a second  
And you never can catch it up  
So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned  
But it's clear that the match is rough  
Common sense 'd tell me not to try 'n continue  
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you  
  
So keep an eye open  
My spirit ain't broken  
Your love's so incredible  
Your body so edible  
You give me an overdose of love  
Just a little is a enough  
  
I'm connoisseur of champagne cognac  
The perfume nearly beats the taste  
I eat an oyster, and I feel the contact  
But more than one would be a waste  
Some people want an endless line, that's true  
But all I have's a little time with you  
  
A smile sets me reeling  
A kiss feels like stealing  
Your love is like heroin  
This addict is mellowing  
I can't pretend that I'm tough  
Just a little is enough  
  
Just like a sailor heading into the seas  
There's a gale blowing in my face  
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze  
And I can't head for any other place  
Life would seem so easy on the other tack  
But even a hurricane won't turn me back  
  
You might be an island  
On the distant horizon  
But the little I see  
Looks like heaven to me  
I don't care if the ocean gets rough  
Just a little is enough  
  
Common sense 'd tell me not to try and continue  
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you  
So keep an eye open  
My spirit ain't broken  
Your love's so incredible  
Your body so edible  
You give me an overdose of love  
A little is enough
