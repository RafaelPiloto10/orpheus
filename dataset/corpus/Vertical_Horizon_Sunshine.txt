Sometimes I can't get enough  
Ooh, of you  
This friendly game keeps getting rough  
Think I'm breaking through  
I cannot hide this well  
This well as I should  
There's always something left to tell  
Tell me is it good?  
  
I see you  
Do you see me too?  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
Come on through  
I will find you  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
  
I guess you chose a different road  
I am not aware  
I got the one that's been closed  
Shut down for repair  
I hold a highway in my head  
Ruling of a king  
Driving away the things I've said  
And I've said everything  
  
I see you  
Do you see me too?  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
Come on through  
I will find you  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
  
Meet me in the sunshine  
Meet me in the, sunshine  
  
There's something better in this heat  
Getting it on  
I feel the warmth, I feel the greed  
And I fear the fall  
I hold this window wide enough  
To keep the whole world  
I want to spit out all this stuff  
And keep the girl  
  
I see you  
Do you see me too?  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
Come on through  
I will find you  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
  
Meet me in the sunshine  
Meet me in the sunshine
