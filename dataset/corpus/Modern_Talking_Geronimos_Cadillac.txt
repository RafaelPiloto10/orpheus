I want to share my dreams  
Want to share with you  
On the wings of love  
Like Dreamers do  
  
Touch your heart -  
You're the queen of broken hearts  
Oh we are daytime friends and nightime fools  
Want to play this game  
  
And break the rules  
Tears of love are frozen tears  
  
Geronimo's Cadillac  
Is making all girls turn mad  
Geronimo has a heart - Oh it's a drag  
Geronimo's Cadillac  
Is making all girls turn sad  
Geronimo has a heart - Oh it's a drag  
  
Geronimo's Cadillac It's tossing oh in your head  
It's tossing - It's turning  
It's burning - It makes you mad  
Geronimo's Cadillac  
Oh baby I'll hold you back  
It's tossing and turning  
It's burning - It makes you sad  
  
I'm looking through the eye's  
The eye's of love  
Made a fool of me - Can't get enough  
Touch my heart - Boulevard of broken dreams  
  
Another time for love - Other place to be  
Don't let him take your love  
Your love from me  
Tears of love are frozen tears  
  
Geronimo's Cadillac - Is making all girls turn mad...
