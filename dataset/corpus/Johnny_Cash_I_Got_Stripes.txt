On a Monday,  
I was arrested (uh huh)  
On a Tuesday,  
They locked me in the jail (oh boy)  
On a Wednesday,  
My trial was attested  
On a Thursday,  
They said guilty and  
The Judge's gavel fell  
  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
I got chains,  
Chains around my feet  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
And them chains, them chains,  
They're about to drag me down  
  
On a Monday,  
My momma come to see me  
On a Tuesday,  
They caught me with a file  
On a Wednesday,  
I'm down in solitary  
On a Thursday,  
I start on bread and water for a while  
  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
I got chains,  
Chains around my feet  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
And them chains, them chains,  
They're about to drag me down  
  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
I got chains,  
Chains around my feet  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
And them chains, them chains,  
They're about to drag me down
