The sea wants to kiss the golden shore  
The sunlight warms your skin  
All the beauty that's been lost before wants to find us again  
  
I can't fight you any more, it's you I'm fighting for  
The sea throws rocks together but time leaves us polished stones  
  
We can't fall any further if  
We can't feel ordinary love  
And we can not reach any higher,  
If we can't deal with ordinary love  
  
Birds fly high in the summer sky and rest on the breeze.  
The same wind will take care of you and I.  
We'll build our house in the trees.  
  
Your heart is on my sleeve  
Did you put it there with a magic marker?  
For years I would believe that the world couldn't wash it away  
  
'Cause we can't fall any further if  
We can't feel ordinary love  
And we can not reach any higher,  
If we can't deal with ordinary love  
  
Are we tough enough for ordinary love?  
  
We can't fall any further if  
We can't feel ordinary love  
And we can not reach any higher,  
If we can't deal with ordinary love  
  
We can't fall any further, if  
We can't feel ordinary love  
And we can't reach any higher,  
If we can't deal with ordinary love
