If I could just get it on paper  
The things that have happened tonight  
But that seems to me to be the big key  
I'm having too good a time to ever turn  
Out the lights.  
  
Go to bed wake up with a clear head  
Recalling what made it a ball  
If I could just get it on paper  
I might make some sense of it all  
  
If I could tell half of the stories  
The funny way most things begin  
Figure ways to disguise all the half truths and lies  
Find the heart of my song with the point of a pen  
Simple words can be come clever phrases  
And chapters could turn into books  
Yes if I could just get it on paper  
But it's harder than it ever looks.  
  
All alone in the edge of the water  
Hiding out by the Sea of Cortez  
With my sketch pads and Flairs  
Tapes and battery spares  
  
It's just no comprehend to what everyone says  
  
Time alone seemed to work well for Faulkner  
Time away seems to work for the kid  
Life and ink they run out at the same time  
Or so said my old friend the squid  
  
Yes if I could just get it on paper tonight  
I could tell you what I think I did.
