Well, let me tell you about my girlie  
She goes by the name of sleepy shirley  
She become a real life wiro  
Since she learned how to do the cairo  
And she go  
  
Up up down down  
Up up down down  
  
She pours out the sand on the kitchen floor  
Then we start to camel through the living room door  
She was cool to me, but now her heart's afiro  
Since she learned how to do the cairo  
And she go
