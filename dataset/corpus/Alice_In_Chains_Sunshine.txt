One, a-one time, yeah  
  
Am I too contagious  
Full of sick desire  
Am I that I promise  
Burning corpsed pyre  
  
Then some dude came down to touch the Mother  
Mother touched, and dude ain't here no more  
Suck your woman down  
  
Am I your reflection  
Melting mirror smile  
Am I worth the value  
Do my love defile  
  
Then some dude came down to touch the Mother  
Mother touched and dude ain't here no more  
Ain't no day the sun don't crack  
  
Then to brand some name across my back so you care?  
Find someone to tell you  
Sunshine...sweet love my labor  
Don't mind...I don't care no more  
  
Memory, set me free, yeah  
I don't care no more  
Mother please, come for me  
  
Can you face the question?  
Is my soul entire?  
Sunshine...sweet love my labor  
  
Don't mind...I don't care no more [Repeat: x2]
