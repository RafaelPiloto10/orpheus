This dead city  
Longs to be  
This dead city  
Longs to be free  
Seven screamin' horses  
Melt down in the sun  
Buildin' scenes on empty dreams  
And smokin' them one by one  
Hee haa  
The dead city  
Longs to be, yea, yea  
This dead city, yea  
Longs to be livin', ohh  
Is it any wonder  
There's squalor in the sun?  
With their broken schemes and their lotteries  
They never get nowhere  
Haa haa  
Is it any wonder  
They're spittin' at the sun?  
God's parasites in abandoned sites  
And they never have much fun  
Yeah  
Haa  
You don't need me?  
You don't need me?  
Yea I  
You don't need me?  
Well  
Mika I'll take you [incomprehensible]  
You know, you just try  
If I was a blind man  
Would you see for me?  
Or would you confuse the nature of my blues  
And refuse a hand to me  
Or is it any wonder  
Cryin' in the sun?  
Is it any wonder  
I'm cryin' in the sun?  
Well I built my dreams on your empty scenes  
Now I'm burnin' them one by one  
Haa hmm  
Oh this a damn city  
Oh this a dead city  
Immortal city  
Motor city  
Success city  
Longs to be  
Longs to be  
Longs to be  
Free  
Free  
Free
