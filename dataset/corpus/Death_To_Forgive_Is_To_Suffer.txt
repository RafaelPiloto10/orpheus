Throughout our time a thought  
Escapes us to enforce a word, no  
Holding on to pain it may seem to some  
  
The easy way to say o.k., twist your  
Knife a little deeper  
Words to sharp actions dark  
Hide the blade of the deceiver.  
  
Enforce the words no more, be free  
Alone you might just find serenity.  
  
To accept another day we choose  
To give away another piece of life  
To forgive is to suffer  
  
Once or twice is kind  
Three or four is blind  
It is not the end yet a way to begin  
The power of words both good and bad.
