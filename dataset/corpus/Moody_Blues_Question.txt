Why do we never get an answer  
When we're knocking at the door  
With a thousand million questions  
About hate and death and war?  
'Cause when we stop and look around us  
There is nothing that we need  
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed  
  
Why do we never get an answer  
When we're knocking at the door  
Because the truth is hard to swallow  
That's what the war of love is for  
  
It's not the way that you say it  
When you do those things to me  
It's more the way that you mean it  
When you tell me what will be  
And when you stop and think about it  
You won't believe it's true  
That all the love you've been giving  
Has all been meant for you  
  
I'm looking for someone to change my life  
I'm looking for a miracle in my life  
And if you could see what it's done to me  
To lose the love I knew  
Could safely lead me through  
  
Between the silence of the mountains  
And the crashing of the sea  
There lies a land I once lived in  
And she's waiting there for me  
But in the Grey of the morning  
My mind becomes confused  
Between the dead and the sleeping  
And the road that I must choose  
  
I'm looking for someone to change my life  
I'm looking for a miracle in my life  
And if you could see what it's done to me  
To lose the love I knew  
Could safely lead me to  
The land that I once knew  
To learn as we grow old  
The secrets of our soul  
It's not the way that you say it when you do those things to me  
It's more the way you really mean it when you tell me what will be  
  
Why do we never get an answer  
When we're knocking at the door  
With a thousand million questions  
About hate and death and war  
'Cause when we stop and look around us  
There is nothing that we need  
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed  
  
Why do we never get an answer  
When we're knocking at the door
