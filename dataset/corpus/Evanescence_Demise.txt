Please don't ask me how  
I ended up at my wits end and breaking down  
Pages torn from books we never read  
Because we're plugged into this grid  
Don't pull this plug right now or then we'd really have to live  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I haven't done?  
It's not the end that I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to
death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Let's take this one day at a time  
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive  
  
Your words won't save me now  
I'm at the edge feeling the sweat drip from my brow  
Get a grip on yourself is what they say  
Every hour every day  
Hands over my ears, I've been screaming all these years  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I haven't done?  
It's not the end that I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to
death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Let's take this one day at a time  
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive  
  
We came in search of answers  
We left empty handed again  
Shots fired into the sky are now returning  
Where the fuck will you hide?  
  
Hiding from the laughter in the closet of our lives  
But the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light  
And now a hand's extending outward, quiet comfort they invite  
Do we dare take what they offer, do we step into the light?  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I haven't done?  
It's not the end I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Let's take this one day at a time  
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive
