Why are there so many  
Songs about Rainbows  
And whats on the other side  
Rainbows are visions  
But only Illusions  
Rainbows have nothing to hide  
  
Whats so amazing  
That it keeps us star gazing  
And what do they think we might see  
Oh, someday we'll find it  
The Rainbow Connection  
The lovers, the dreamers, and me  
  
Have you been half asleep  
And have you heard the voices  
Well, I've heard them calling my name  
Is this the sweet sound  
That calls the young sailors  
The voice might be one and the same  
  
I've heard it too many, many, many times to ignore it  
Oh, who did I think it could be  
Oh, someday we'll find it  
  
The Rainbow Connection  
The lovers, the dreamers and me [Repeats]
