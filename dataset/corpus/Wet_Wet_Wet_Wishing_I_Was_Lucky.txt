He would swear by his mouth almighty  
  
I was living in a world of make believe  
When my best friend wrote and told me  
That there may be a job in the city  
I was living in a world of make believe  
When my best friend wrote and told me  
That there may be a job in the city  
And you never told me  
  
He would dream about another scheme  
About another sordid hall of dreams  
About a man who's king of industry  
He would swear by his mouth almighty  
He would buy the best  
But never something new  
And he never told me  
  
I like kicking in the gutter and  
Wishing I was lucky  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
Oh, I like kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
  
It's the only life I know  
  
Lie, lie , lie is all you ever do  
To make me want to push on through  
Cry, cry, cry is all I ever do  
Say you want to make me push on through  
  
I like kicking in the gutter and  
Wishing I was lucky  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
Oh, I like kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky, I was wishing I was lucky  
Kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
  
It's the only life I know  
  
My best friend wrote and told me so  
He said, that there may be a job in the city, yeah, yeah yeah, oh baby  
I like kicking in the gutter and wishing I was lucky  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
I like kicking in the gutter, wishing I was lucky  
I was wishing I was lucky,  
Kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
  
Hey son go, hey son go, to the city [Repeat: x4]
