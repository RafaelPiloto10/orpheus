You can count on a number of things  
Like tomorrow the sun's gonna shine  
There'll be flowers in spring time  
Poets will make rhymes  
Couples in moonlight are so ripe to fall  
  
Fallin' in love, such a natural thing  
There's a look in that one person's eyes  
And the moment we know it  
We don't want to blow it  
So we get way too careful and it all slips away  
  
You've always told me  
You can do better  
And something would always come along,  
And so I listened, down to the letter  
'Til somebody better came along  
  
You, you can do better  
Talkin' to you, you, you, you  
You gotta do better!  
  
Now I feel like I'm swimming upstream  
When the current is running so strong  
I'm a fish out of water  
The first time I saw you  
Couldn't keep it together  
Don't care if I'm wrong  
But it seems like forever  
Since we got along  
  
You've always told me  
You can do better  
And something would always come along  
And so I listened, down to the letter  
'Til somebody better came along  
  
You said it so often  
You thought I'd believe it  
That I was always doin' it wrong,  
But you always said that  
You could take it or leave it  
So, somebody better came along!  
  
Now I feel like I'm swimming upstream

You, you can do better, better.  
Talkin' to you, you, you  
You gotta do better!
