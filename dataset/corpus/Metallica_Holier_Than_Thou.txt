No more!  
The craps rolls out your mouth again  
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin  
Little whispers circle around your head  
Why don't you worry about yourself instead  
Who are you? where ya been? where ya from?  
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue  
You lie so much you believe yourself  
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself  
  
Holier than thou  
You are  
Holier than thou  
You are  
You know not  
Before you judge me take a look at you  
Can't you find something better to do  
Point the finger, slow to understand  
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand  
It's not who you are it's who you know  
Others lives are the basis of your own  
Burn your bridges build them back with wealth  
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself  
  
Holier than thou  
You are  
Holier than thou  
You are  
You know not
