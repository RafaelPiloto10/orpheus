More than the greatest love  
The world has known  
This is the love I'll give  
To you alone  
  
More than the simple words  
I try to say  
I only live to love you  
Every day  
  
More than you'll ever know  
My arms long to hold you so  
My life will be in your keeping  
Waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping  
  
Longer than always  
Is a long long time  
But far beyond for ever  
You'll be mine  
  
I know I've never lived before  
And my heart is very sure  
No one else  
Could love you more  
  
Longer than always  
Is a long long time  
But far beyond for ever  
You'll be mine  
  
I know I've never lived before  
And my heart is very sure  
No one else  
Could love you more
