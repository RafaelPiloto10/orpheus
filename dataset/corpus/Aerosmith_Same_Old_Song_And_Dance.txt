Get yourself cooler, lay yourself low  
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show  
When the judge's constipation go to his head  
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
  
Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun  
No smoothy face lawyer to getcha undone  
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town  
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
It's the same old story, same old story  
Same old song and dance  
  
Fate comes a-knockin', doors start lockin'  
Your old time connection, change your direction  
Ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it  
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend  
  
When you're low down and dirty, from walkin' the street  
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet  
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town  
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
It's the same old story, same old story  
Same old song and dance
