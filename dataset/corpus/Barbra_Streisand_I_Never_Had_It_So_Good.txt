I never had much money  
I never won a race  
My jokes don't end that funny  
And I had door slammed on my face  
But I think you've charmed me  
I always hoped that someone would  
I never had a love like this before  
  
No, I never had it so good  
I'm not the type that's trusted  
Always tripping over logs  
And often I've been busted  
And chased by friendly dogs  
But I think you've charmed me  
I always hoped that someone would  
I never had a love like this before  
  
No, I never had it so good  
Hm,  
But I think you've charmed me  
I always hoped that someone would  
I never had a love like this before  
No, I never had it so good
