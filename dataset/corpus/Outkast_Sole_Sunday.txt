[al pacino]  
"I'll fight for you 'til the day I die"  
[gipp]  
Yeah.. yeah.. yo  
Gipp keep it slow poke, hang out the side with no rope  
Sit in the tub, flick the remote and soak  
Pull up, jump out, and then I strut for em  
And if anybody got problems, I'ma cut for em  
In this atmosphere now you can disappear smoke thick  
Shells bail like tailbacks lookin for hoes  
Drag my ass down the air like I care  
Scar that ass, leave your shirt open like an arab  
Makin money off these breakdown slabs  
We got this zone, get your own  
Better move on before your folk get split, you won't forget  
The df put it down, now get down, or sit down  
[outkast]  
Sunday mornin, makes me feel  
So godly, pardon me, if I shake your soul..  
[khujo]  
I tackle my problems, never run from my foes  
Stiff-arm facemask, hit the juke but it didn't leave a sucka froze  
Like he just tried to stuff a whole ki up in his nose  
On all fo's  
You hit em high I hit em low, for this dough  
Yo heart gon' bust out here, cause we comin full speed  
We deep and take you lift you up off of your feet  
At the lift, of the glass, sippin victory  
Clean cut but I stay dirty  
Uhh, you play fair, I teach  
I spot this pig in yo' face like you never stopped eatin pork  
Or beast, ? ? ? ?  
Tenacious on his grill, uhh, all-pro hall of famer  
With no fears, blood sweat and tears, uhhh, uhh, ohh shit  
[outkast]  
Sunday mornin, makes me feel  
So godly, pardon me, if I shake your soul..  
[andre]  
The rich boy got it bad cause he is rich  
The po' boy got it bad cause he is po'  
The bad boy got it bad cause he won't grow  
The good gul got it good cause she got game  
It runs in no undeveloped fellas considered lame  
Same like mechanics do it, baby who need her buick  
Repaired don't have no knowledge of what a brake shoe is  
Make woo it, turns a nigga, sperm it tickle  
We wiggle, ? ? emotions like dill pickle  
In autumn, fall, into the bottom of black, holes  
Make a left on nothingness cause that's where I'm at  
Cold as summer, I got yo' number, you got my number  
Let's add em, see what we come with maybe we can slumber  
Like uhh, babies in homes and uhh, retarded ones, uhh  
Dolphins and whales, uhh, the smartest ones, so  
Nothing you can do can be new up under the sun  
Depending what sun you live under you can be the one on  
[outkast]  
Sunday mornin, makes me feel  
So godly, pardon me, if I shake your soul..

Sunday mornin, makes me feel

Sunday mornin, makes me feel
