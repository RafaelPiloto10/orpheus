Baby our love is our love is like a runaway train  
Baby it won't stop, won't stop, won't slow down for anything  
Baby it's big, so strong, love is a powerful thing  
Baby our love is our love is like a runaway train  
Baby our love reminds me, reminds me of a runaway train  
Baby our love is our love is like a hurricane  
Baby it won't stop, won't stop, won't slow down for anything  
Baby it's big, so strong, love is a powerful thing  
Baby our love is our love is like a hurricane  
Baby our love reminds me, reminds me of a hurricane  
Our love is red hot, non-stop all the way to the top  
Now that I been in the middle of this thing  
Ain't no way I'm ever gonna go back  
Seen everything, I been everywhere, I didn't leave nothin' that I want back  
There  
Come on, baby lets move this thing a little farther down the track  
Baby our love is our love is like a jet airplane  
Flying so high above all the pouring rain  
Baby it's big, so strong, love is a powerful thing  
Baby our love is our love is like a jet airplane  
Baby our love reminds me reminds me of a jet airplane  
Our love is red hot, non-stop all the way to the top  
Now that I been in the middle of this thing  
Ain't no way I'm ever gonna go back  
Seen everything, I been everywhere, I didn't leave nothin' that I want back  
There  
Come on, baby lets move this thing a little farther down the track
