Good morning girl, how you been?  
Good morning girl, is love within?  
  
I see your face every where.  
I see your smile your golden hair.  
I see your eyes shinin' through.  
Those gentle eyes silver blue.  
  
Good morning girl, how you been?  
Good morning girl, is love within?  
Good morning girl, it's been long.  
Good morning girl, to you this song.  
  
I sing it girl from the heart.  
I'll sing it girl from the start.  
Good morning girl, how you been?  
Good morning girl is love within?
