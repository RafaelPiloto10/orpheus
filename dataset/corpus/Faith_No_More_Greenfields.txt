Greenfields  
(The Brothers Four)  
Once there were greenfields...kissed by the sun  
Once there were valleys...where rivers used to run  
Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above  
Once they were part of an everlasting hope  
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields  
Greenfields are gone now...parched by the sun  
Gone from the valleys...where rivers used to run  
Gone with the cold wind that swept through to my heart  
Gone with the lovers who let the dreams depart  
Where are the greenfields where we...used to roam?  
I'll never know what made you run away  
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?  
I only know there's nothing here for me  
Nothing is now left for me to say  
But I keep on waiting...until you return  
I keep on waiting until the day you learn  
You can't be happy when your heart's on the roam  
You can't be happy until you bring it home  
Home to the greenfields...and bleed once again (?)
