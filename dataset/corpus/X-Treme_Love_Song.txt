This is a love song for you  
To make my dreams comin' true  
Let me be by your side  
I'll be yours all the time.  
I sing a love song for you  
Because my heart going boom!  
You're the one I desire  
Tell me now that you're mine  
This is a love song for you  
To make my dreams comin' true  
Let me be by your side  
I'll be yours all the time.  
I sing a love song for you  
Because my heart going boom!  
You're the one I desire  
Tell me now that you're mine
