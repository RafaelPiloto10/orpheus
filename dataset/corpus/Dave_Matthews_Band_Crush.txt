Crazy how it feels tonight  
Crazy how you make it all alright love  
You crush me with the things you do  
I do for you anything too  
Sitting, smoking, feeling high  
In this moment it feels so right  
  
Lovely lady  
I am at your feet  
God I want you so badly  
I wonder this  
Could tomorrow be  
So wondrous as you there sleeping  
Let's go drive 'til morning comes  
  
Watch the sunrise  
To fill our souls up  
Drink some wine 'til we get drunk  
It's crazy I'm thinking  
Just knowing that the world is round  
  
Here I'm dancing on the ground  
Am I right side up or upside down  
Is this real or am I dreaming  
  
Lovely lady  
Let me drink you please  
I won't spill a drop, I promise you  
Lying under this spell you cast on me  
  
Each moment  
The more I love you  
Crush me  
Come on  
It's crazy I'm thinking  
  
Just knowing that the world is round  
Here I'm dancing on the ground  
Am I right side up or upside down  
Is it real or am I dreaming  
Lovely lady I will treat you sweetly  
  
Adore you  
I mean  
You crush me  
It's times like these  
When my faith I feel  
And I know  
How I love you  
Come on  
Lady  
  
It's crazy I'm thinking  
Just as long as you're around  
And here I'll be dancing on the ground  
Am I right side up or upside down  
To each other we'll be facing  
By love we'll beat back the pain  
  
We've found  
You know  
I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside  
My friend  
With each moment the more I love you  
Crush me  
Come on  
Lady  
  
So much you have given love  
That I would give you back  
Again and again  
Meaning I'll hold you  
And please  
Let me always
