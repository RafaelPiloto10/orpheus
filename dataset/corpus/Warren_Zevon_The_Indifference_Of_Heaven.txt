Written by Warren Zevon 1993 Zevon Music BMI  
Time marches on  
Time stands still  
Time on my hands  
Time to kill  
Blood on my hands  
And my hands in the till  
Down at the 7-11  
Gentle rain  
Falls on me  
All life folds back  
Into the sea  
We contemplate eternity  
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven  
The past seems realer than the present to me now  
I've got memories to last me  
When the sky is gray  
The way it is today  
I remember the times when I was happy  
Same old sun  
Same old moon  
It's the same old story  
Same old tune  
They all say  
Someday soon  
My sins will all be forgiven  
Gentle rain  
Falls on me  
All life folds back  
Into the sea  
We contemplate eternity  
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven  
They say "Everything's all right"  
They say "Better days are near"  
They tell us "These are the good times"  
But they don't live around here  
Billy and Christie don't--  
Bruce and Patti don't--  
They don't live around here  
I had a girl  
Now she's gone  
She left town  
Town burned down  
Nothing left  
But the sound  
Of the front door closing forever  
Gentle rain  
Falls on me  
All life folds back  
Into the sea  
We contemplate eternity  
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven
