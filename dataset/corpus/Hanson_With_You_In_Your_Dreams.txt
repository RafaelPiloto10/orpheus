If I'm gone when you wake up  
Please, don't cry  
And if I'm gone when you wake up  
It's not goodbye  
Don't look back at this time as a time  
Of heartbreak and distress  
Remember me, remember me  
'Cause I'll be with you in your dreams  
Oh, I'll be with you, oh, oh  
  
But If I'm gone when you wake up  
Please, don't cry  
And if I'm gone when you wake up  
Don't ask why  
Don't look back at this time  
As a time of heartbreak and distress  
Remember me, remember me  
'Cause I'll be with you in your dreams  
Oh, oh  
  
Don't cry  
I'm with you  
Don't cry  
I'm by your side  
Don't cry  
I'm with you  
Don't cry  
I'm by your side  
  
And though my flesh is gone, whoa  
I'll still be with you at all times  
And although my body's gone, oh  
I'll be there to comfort you at all times  
Oh, oh  
  
But If I'm gone when you wake up  
Please, don't cry  
And if I'm gone when you wake up  
Don't ask why  
Don't look back at this time  
As a time of heartbreak and distress  
Remember me, remember me  
'Cause I'll be with you  
I'll be with you in your dreams  
  
Oh, I'll be with you  
Oh  
I'll be with you in your dreams  
I'll be with you  
I'll be with you  
  
I don't want you to cry and weep, oh  
I want you to go on living your life  
I'm not sleeping an endless sleep, oh  
'Cause in your heart  
You have all of our good times  
Oh, all of our good times  
Oh, oh, you have  
  
And if I'm gone when you wake up  
Don't ask why  
Don't look back at this time  
As a time of heartbreak and distress  
Remember me, remember me  
'Cause I'll be with you in your dreams  
  
Oh  
I'll be with you in your dreams  
I'll be with you  
Oh  
I'll be with you  
I'll be with you in your dreams  
I'll be with you in your dreams
