Gotta hold on easy as I let you go  
Going to tell you how much I love you  
Though you think you already know  
I remember I thought you looked like an angel  
Wrapped in pink, so soft and warm  
You've had me wrapped around your finger  
Since the day you were born  
  
[Chorus:]  
Beautiful baby, from the outside in  
Chase your dreams but always know  
The road that will lead you home again  
Go on, take on this old world but to me  
You know you'll always be my little girl  
  
When you were in trouble that crooked little smile  
Could melt my heart of stone  
Now look at you  
I turned around and you've almost grown  
Sometimes when you're asleep  
I whisper I love you in the moonlight at your door  
As I walk away, I hear you say  
Daddy love you more  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Someday some boy will come and ask me for your hand  
But I won't say yes to him  
Unless I know he's the half that makes you whole  
He has a poet's soul and the heart of a man's man  
I know he'll say that he's in love  
But between you and me, he won't be good enough  
  
[Chorus:]
