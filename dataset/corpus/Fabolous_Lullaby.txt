Street fi di di di di damn  
  
La la la,  
La la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la.  
  
Let's go  
  
And I ain't gotta tell y'all who I be,  
Because these hundred dollar bills are like baller I-D.  
And I get under niggas skin,  
They should call me I-V.  
But if you try me nigga,  
I will be your caller I-D.  
And that means I got your number.  
Please don't make me dial it,  
That could land your fly ass on the ground just like a pilot.  
So just do me a solid.  
Y'all stay in pocket like wallets,  
'cause you can't see me.  
Close eye-lids.  
Huh, nitey night.  
I'm with a model chick.  
Tyra thick, Heidi's height,  
Body suits, body tight.  
Yeah, I clean up nice.  
Catch me on a tidy night,  
Might be Gucci'd down to the tidy whites.  
OK it's loso,  
Everybody knows so.  
My son is the heir to the thrown,  
Prince Joso.  
So daddy need money,  
Mummy need new truies.  
Baby needs new shoes,  
Preferably the new Louis.  
The swaggers in his jeans,  
He was born fly.  
Them Philly bitches say the ball keep his jaunt fly.  
Then Reggie Kush shot us up in Californi.  
  
[Chorus]  
La la la la la la la.  
Sing them a lullaby,  
Sing them a lullaby,  
Sing them a lullaby,  
Sing them a lullaby.  
Rock a by baby  
Rock a by baby  
Rock a by baby  
Rock a by baby  
La la la la la la la,  
La la la la la.  
  
Hush little lame niggas don't say a word,  
Y'all don't know the half, not even a third.  
Put a dick in your ear and fuck what you heard.  
She tried to pull my fly south,  
I ain't want the bird.  
Because I been killin' these hoes,  
These niggas just drop dead.  
In the drop head,  
All we do is bop heads.  
To the side,  
Like busta in the Pepsi add.  
With my Columbiana mamma,  
Yep she bad. (she bad)  
She in the latest shoe that Giuseppe had.  
Blow game like the late dizzy Gillespie had.  
That's some good jaw.  
Pop quiz,  
Good score.  
She call her pussy Medellin,  
That good raw.  
For you little cheap fucks,  
Hood whores.  
You niggas soft in the middle,  
Call them hood smalls.  
Everybody on the block going cuckoo.  
Phantom doors open like the clock that goes cuckoo.  
Birds poppin' out.  
Sittin' on the hood,  
Check my bird droppings out.  
I'm shittin' on the hood.  
Sleepin' time, niggas.  
The hand that rocks the cradle for you nursery rhyme niggas.  
Its bed time.  
Nice  
  
La la la,  
La la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la,  
La.  
La.  
La.  
  
Sing 'em a lullaby,  
Sing 'em a lullaby,  
Sing 'em a lullaby,  
Sing 'em a lullaby. (la la la)  
  
Rock a by baby  
Rock a by baby  
Rock a by baby  
Rock a by baby
