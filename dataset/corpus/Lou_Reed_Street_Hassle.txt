Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet  
The sexy boy smiled in dismay  
She took out four twenties 'cause she liked round figures  
Everybody's a queen for a day  
Oh, babe, I'm on fire and you know how I admire your  
Body why don't we slip away  
Although I'm sure you're certain, it's a rarity me flirtin'  
Sha-la-la-la, this way  
  
Oh, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la  
Hey, baby, come on, let's slip away  
  
Luscious and gorgeous, oh what a hunk of muscle  
Call out the national guard  
She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her means  
From off of the formica topped bar  
And cascading slowly, he lifted her wholly  
And boldly out of this world  
And despite people's derision  
Proved to be more than diversion  
Sha-la-la-la, later on  
  
And then sha-la-la-la-la, he entered her slowly  
And showed her where he was coming from  
And then sha-la-la-la-la, he made love to her gently  
It was like she'd never ever come  
And then sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la  
When the sun rose and he made to leave  
You know, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la  
Neither one regretted a thing  
  
Street hassle  
Hey, that cunt's not breathing  
I think she's had too much  
Of something or other, hey, man, you know what I mean  
I don't mean to scare you  
But you're the one who came here  
And you're the one who's gotta take her when you leave  
I'm not being smart  
Or trying to be cold on my part  
And I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve  
But you know people get all emotional  
And sometimes, man, they just don't act rational  
They think they're just on TV  
  
Sha-la-la-la, man  
Why don't you just slip
