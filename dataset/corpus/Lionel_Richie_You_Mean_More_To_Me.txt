You mean more to me,  
Than words can ever say  
Just to hold your hand  
And to know our love will stay  
Feels so right  
You're in my arms, my love  
Tonight  
  
Oh you,  
You mean more to me  
Than any love I've ever known  
And i want to give you all my love  
Just you alone  
  
Oh  
You're all my dreams come true  
There's so much joy in your eyes  
And all the love you give  
You've finally made me realize  
You're all i need  
  
Oh you  
You mean more to me  
Than words can ever say.
