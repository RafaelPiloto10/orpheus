I went out fishing on a sandy beach  
Cast my line out as far as it would reach  
Looking for something from the frying pan  
I kick back with a beer in my hand  
  
I must've got a big one cause it's bending my pole  
I'm having to fight just to keep my hold  
It could be a whale (oh) God only knows  
Whatever it is it's not wearing any clothes  
  
She's larger than life  
Made from holy water  
She's covered in green  
She's got little scales upon her  
She's larger than life  
She's a mermaid in the night  
  
She's got a set of gills, like no fish I've ever seen  
Long blonde hair and a tail in between  
I'm in love with a creature from the sea  
And she's bringin' out the crustacean in me  
  
Her voice is a temptation it's a siren song  
When we kiss there could be no wrong  
I ask her to marry me, to be my wife  
And we could do the backstroke for the rest of our lives  
  
She's larger than life  
Made from holy water  
She's covered in green  
She's got little scales upon her  
She's larger than life  
She's a mermaid in the night
