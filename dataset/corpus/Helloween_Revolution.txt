Only a few steps ahead  
You'll see chances you can't ignore  
Only a few days ago  
Life seemed useless and sad  
Now you can see what it's like  
When you know what you're fighting for  
Now you can see what it's worth  
To believe in your faith  
  
[Chorus:]  
Revolution, revolution  
Tear it once apart  
For a brand new start  
Revolution, revolution  
Let me guess what's in your mind  
And lies in your heart  
  
Now you can see things much clearer  
As long as you understand  
How you can use your conviction  
And build something new  
Follow your visions  
Keep being suspicious and curious  
Never accept an excuse  
And learn how to say "no"  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
In the midnight hour  
Making future plans  
Selfless with the tragedy in your eyes  
Feel the mighty hunger  
Deep inside your soul  
Keeps you fighting for justice  
And for the truth  
  
[Chorus:]
