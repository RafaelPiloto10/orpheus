Oh my baby, hold me, there is only you and me  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - no I cannot wait forever  
Tell me there's a heaven and there is a destiny  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - so I cannot wait forever  
I will tell you baby, oh my love is real  
Can't you feel it lady - feeling what I feel?  
  
I will follow you - oh, every time and every minute  
I will follow you - see my love is true  
I will follow you - every time and every minute  
All I want to do - is making love to you.....  
  
There's no me without you, why an angel breaks my heart  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - no I cannot wait forever  
Please send me a rainbow, and we'll try a brand new start  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - so I cannot wait forever  
And beyond my tears girl - I will see your smile  
Baby I can't wait - or wait a while  
  
I will follow you.....
