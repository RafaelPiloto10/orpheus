And when I have some words  
This is the way I'll sing  
To a distortion box  
To make the music sing  
then, I'm gonna have to write a chorus  
Gonna need to have a chorus  
And this seems to be as good as any other place to sing it till I'm blue in
the face, yeah, were gonna need to have a chorus, gonna have to write a
chorus, and this seems to be as good as any other place to sing it till I'm
blue in the face.  
Happy with what you have to be happy with to be happy with what you have you
have to be happy with what you have, happy with what you have to be happy with
you have to be happy with what you have, to be happy with what you have, you
have to be happy with what you have to be happy wiiith
