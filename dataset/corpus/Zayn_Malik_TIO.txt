[Verse 1]  
I can taste it on your mouth and I can't leave it  
You're a freak like me, can't you see?  
We can work this something out and I'm believin'  
You get off on me, it's like cheating  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I just wanna watch you when you take it off  
Take off all your makeup, baby take it off  
I just wanna watch you when you take it off  
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Take it off, take it off  
Baby just take it off  
Take it off, take it off  
Baby just take it off  
  
[Verse 2]  
Push me up against the wall, don't take it easy  
You like it hard like me, it's what you need  
Let's get naked and explore our inner secrets  
For what it is, it's what it is  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off  
Take off all your makeup, baby take it off  
I just wanna watch you when you take it off  
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Take it off, take it off  
Baby just take it off  
Take it off, take it off  
Baby just take it off  
Take it off, take it off  
Baby just take it off  
Take it off, take it off  
Baby just take it off  
  
[Bridge]  
I just can't wait to see it all  
I'm so turned on and it's all mine  
I just can't wait to see it all  
I'm so turned on  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I just wanna watch you when you take it off  
Take off all your makeup, baby take it off  
I just wanna watch you when you take it off  
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off  
I, I, I, I just wanna watch you when you take it off  
Take off all your makeup, baby take it off  
I just wanna watch you when you take it off  
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
