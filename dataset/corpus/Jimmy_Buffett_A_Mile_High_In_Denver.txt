1970  
Sittin' on a pocket full of hard earned wages  
Lookin' at the world through magazine pages  
I heard a lot about the mountains and the colorado range  
Made this stop for personal reasons  
Didn't know I'd catch the changin' of the seasons  
Winter dictates everything from frost to naked trees  
Chorus:  
I'm about a mile high in denver  
Where the rock meets timberline  
I've walked this ground from town to town  
Just to finally call it mine  
Lookin' for the cloud with a styrofoam lining  
Hopin' that the sun will keep on shinin'  
Leading me to distant peace that waits so patiently  
Need a little love to try some givin'  
Try a little love and then start livin'  
Things I feared so long ago  
When everything was wrong  
Chorus:  
I'm about a mile high in denver  
Where the rock meets timberline  
I've walked this ground from town to town  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Sittin' on a pocket full of hard earned wages  
Lookin' at the world through magazine pages  
I heard a lot about the mountains and the colorado range  
Need a little time to try some livin'  
Try a little love and then start givin'  
Things I feared so long ago  
When everything was wrong  
I'm about a mile high in denver  
Where the rock meets timberline  
Where God and trees create the breeze  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine  
Tonight I'll call it mine
