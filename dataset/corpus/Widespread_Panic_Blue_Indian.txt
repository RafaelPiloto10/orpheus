Oh, Pappy left a chair like he's still sittin' there  
Once I almost saw him make his move  
Brave Indian who never changes his mood  
In a painting on the wall right there  
  
Oh, how long 'til the morning wakes  
Oh, how long 'til the medicine takes  
  
Oh, Sally buffalo in the apartment just below  
Just a bein' without a care  
Oh, children from my brood they come and bring me food  
Maybe open up a window for air  
  
Oh, just now I smell the cornbread bake  
Oh, now, now, now I feel the medicine take  
  
Just like home  
Where the stray dogs go through it all  
Still right here, still just here,  
Brave little friend  
  
Well, we got a party goin' on many spirits strong  
Ain't preacher just a happy to meet ya  
Half a bottle 'neath the bed keep our spirits fed  
My hat's off to you, to you and you  
  
And now our brave friends, too, dancing circles through the room  
And a broom and a radio and a twistin out a dos-e-do  
Brand new day, the whole world's goin'  
Whole room's goin' so  
  
Just now, don't hesitate (hesitate)  
Oh, taste the morning break (morning break)  
Sweet, sweet, young honeycomb (honeycomb)  
On, now, now, now just like home (just like home)  
  
Oh, just like, just like home  
Where the stray dogs go  
Oh, oh, rest my bones  
Like a fresh skipped stone to it all  
  
Still right here, still just here,  
Still just here, brave, brave friend
