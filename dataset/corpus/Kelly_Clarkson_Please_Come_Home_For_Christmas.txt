:  
  
Well won't you listen baby  
To what I wanna say  
I'm so crazy 'bout you  
I don't wanna play  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
  
You clawed your way to the top  
I don't care if you're a flop  
I'll do what I gotta do  
To take care of you  
  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]  
  
You can change my eye  
You can change your time  
You can do what you want  
You better read between the lines  
  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]
