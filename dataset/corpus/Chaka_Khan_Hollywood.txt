He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood  
He's bussin' it to Hollywood  
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood  
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood  
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood  
He's bussin' it to Hollywood  
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood  
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood  
He's waited at bus stops all his life  
He's been in and out of those spaces  
Seein' eyes that spoke to him  
From sad and gifted places, sad and gifted places  
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood  
He's bussin' it to Hollywood  
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood  
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood  
You know he's gonna be dressed to kill  
He's gonna find some brand new thrills  
Whatever he's been looking for  
Tell him that there's so much more in Hollywood, Hollywood  
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood  
He's bussin' it to Hollywood  
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood  
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood  
Painted faces, sunburnt skin  
Fixed expressions, smiles worn thin  
Caught in the blink of neon of Hollywood  
Bending battles, maneuvering schemes  
False expressions, washed up dreams  
Everybody makes believe in Hollywood, Hollywood  
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood  
He's bussin' it to Hollywood  
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood  
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood  
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood  
He's bussin' it to Hollywood  
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood  
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood  
He's on his way, he's goin' to Hollywood  
He's bussin' it to Hollywood  
Show him the way, he's movin' to Hollywood  
He's hoppin' it to Hollywood  
...
