By the cathedral into the sun  
The pilgrims are singing  
Their journey done  
I look at my short life  
And think of all the champagne  
That I drink  
With all the faces I know  
And how much further can one go?  
And if I decide to step aside  
I will try to replay  
To the feelings I hide  
I look from my window  
Down to the square  
At workers still queuing there  
For market forces to provide  
What history's so far denied  
For a different kind of fate  
Than to labour long and always wait  
And if I decide to step aside  
I will try to return  
To the person inside  
Will I always need you?  
Would you want me to?  
Can you love me for good  
The way you thought you could?  
Or will spring bring rain  
And summer burn?  
Will tears at last precede  
The turn from summer warmth  
To sudden cold  
As certainly as growing old?  
And if I decide to step aside  
I will try to forget all the tears  
I'll have cried
