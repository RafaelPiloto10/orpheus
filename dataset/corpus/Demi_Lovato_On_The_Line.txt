I didn't wanna say I'm sorry  
For breaking us apart  
I didn't wanna say It was my fault  
Even though I knew it was  
  
I didn't wanna call you back  
Cause I knew that I was wrong  
Yeah, I knew I was wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
One in the same  
Never to change  
Our love was beautiful  
We got it all  
Destined to fall  
Our love was tragical  
Wanted to call  
No need to fight  
You know I wouldn't lie  
But tonight  
We'll leave it on the line  
  
Listen baby,  
  
Never would've said forever  
If we knew it ends so fast  
Why did you say I love you  
If you knew that it wouldn't last?  
  
Baby, I just can't hear what you're saying  
The line is breaking up  
Or is that just us?  
Or is that just us?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I try to call again, I get your mailbox  
Like a letter left unread  
Apologies are often open ended  
But this one's better left unsaid  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We'll leave it on the line  
Yeah, oh yeah  
We'll leave it on the line, tonight
