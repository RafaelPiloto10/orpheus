I'm gonna go out tonight  
Gonna feel alright  
If it tears me right in two  
'Cause I just can't stay feeling this way  
With a heart that's full of you  
I'm gonna go right down  
To a part of town  
Where I've never been before  
And in some small place  
Find a brand new face  
And step out on the floor  
  
And I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
And I'll be satisfied if I can just hold my ground  
And if he helps me to keep your memory down  
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
  
Well you put some distance 'round you  
I know I meant to see  
There's a space inside for someone  
But I know it isn't me  
So among the boys who are searching  
And the girls who hope they're found  
If you look for me, I'm the one you'll see  
Who's dancing 'round and 'round  
  
And I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
And I'll be satisfied if I can just hold my ground  
And if he helps me to keep your memory down  
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
  
Come on music, wash my tears away  
Come on darkness, cover up the day  
  
Dancing 'round and 'round  
And I'll be satisfied if I can just hold my ground  
And if he helps me to keep your memory down  
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round
