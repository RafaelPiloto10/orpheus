You can find things meant to be  
If you look hard into the sea  
As the waves land on the beach  
I feel her eyes fixed on me  
Through the wind in the trees  
Mother nature she speaks  
Take what she says  
Let your heart do the rest  
It's in the wind  
It's in the trees  
It's in the way you smile  
At me  
It's in the waves up from the sea  
It's in the way you feel  
When you're pleased  
And it's all meant to be  
And it's all meant to be  
Your heart knows where to go  
But your mind can take it slow  
It's okay to rest your mind  
Let your heart seek and find  
It's in the wind  
It's in the trees  
Listen hard and you  
Will see  
It's in the waves up from the sea  
It's in the way you feel  
When you're pleased  
And it's all meant to be  
And it's all meant to be  
These are things just meant to be  
These are things like you and me  
It's all meant to be  
It's all meant to be  
These are things just meant to be  
These are things like you and me  
Mother nature sings and breathes
