Grey mist drifts upon the water  
The mirrored surface moves  
Awakened of this presence  
Dispelling legends proof  
  
A beastly head of onyx  
With eyes set coals of fire  
It's leathered hide glides glistening  
Ascends the heathered briar  
  
This legend lives through centuries  
Evoking history's memories  
Prevailing in eternities  
On and on and on  
  
Loch Ness confess  
Your terror of the deep  
Loch Ness distress  
Malingers what you keep  
Loch Ness protects monstrosity  
Loch Ness confess to me  
  
Somehow it heeds the piper  
From battlements that call  
From side to side it ponders  
In passion in the skirl  
  
This highland lair of mystery  
Retains a lost world empathy  
Resilient to discovery  
On and on and on  
  
This legend lives through centuries  
Evoking history's memories  
Prevailing in eternity  
Your secret lies safe with me  
  
This creature's peril from decease  
Implores to mankind for release  
A legacy to rest in peace  
On and on and on
