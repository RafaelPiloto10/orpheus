Destiny, destiny protect me from the world  
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world  
Here we are, with our running and confusion  
And I don't see no confusion anywhere  
  
And if the world does turn  
And if London burns  
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar  
I want to be in a band  
When I get to heaven  
Anyone can play guitar and they won't  
Be a nothing anymore  
  
Grow my hair, grow my hair I am Jim Morrison  
Grow my hair, I want to be want to be want to be Jim Morrison  
  
Here we are, with our running and confusion  
And I don't see no confusion anywhere  
  
As the world does turn  
And if London burns  
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar  
I want to be in a band  
When I get to heaven  
Anyone can play guitar and they won't  
Be a nothing anymore
