If you're traveling to north country fair  
Where the winds hits heavy on borderline  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine  
Hope you see her hairs hanging long  
It flows and rolls all down her breast  
Please see for me that if her hair is hanging long  
Ohh that is the way I remember her best  
If you go when the snowflakes fall  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
See for me she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howling winds  
So if you're travelin' in the north country fair  
Where the winds hits heavy on the borderline  
Remember me the one who loves that  
She once was a true love, true love of mine
