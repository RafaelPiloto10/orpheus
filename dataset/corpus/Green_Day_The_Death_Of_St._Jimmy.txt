My heart is beating from me  
I'm standing all alone  
Please call me only  
If you are coming home  
  
Waste a year it flies by  
Waste a night or two  
You taught me how to live  
  
In the streets of shame  
When you've lost your dreams in the rain  
There's no signs of hope  
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope  
  
There's a glow of light  
The Saint Jimmy is the spark in the night  
Bearing gifts and trust  
A fixture in the city of lust  
  
What the hells your name  
Whats your pleasure, what is your pain  
Do you dream too much?  
Do you think what you need is a crutch  
  
In the crowd of pain  
Saint Jimmy comes without any shame  
He says "We're fucked up but we're not the same"  
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame  
  
Jimmy died today  
He blew his brains out into the bay  
In the state of mind  
Is my own private suicide
