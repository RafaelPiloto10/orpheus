Words and music by bob seger  
  
Wally's getting' anxious thinkin' 'bout tonight  
Bruce is all spiffy lookin' wicked lookin' right  
Eddie's getting' spruced  
And donna's getting' loose  
They're passin' round the bottle  
And they're gettin' good and juiced  
B. G. 's winin' dinin' checkin' talent at the club  
Skippers hauntin' second lookin' forward to his rub  
The busters from the country  
And the hitters from the shop  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop  
  
Someone bring the records  
Someone get the brew  
Someone get a house  
Buddy we'll know what to do  
Someone tell the ladies  
Someone make a deal  
If we can't find a house  
Then someone better find a field  
  
Grass is good as carpet  
Anyplace is fine  
Its time to get to rockin'  
Babe it's time to make it shine  
Tell 'em we'll be dancin'  
Dancin' till we drop  
It's time to get down and do the horizontal bop  
  
They're fillin' up the corners  
They're fillin' up the streets  
You can feel the tension  
You can almost feel the heat  
The music's gettin' louder  
The beat's gittin' fast  
Summers finally made it  
Yeah it's finally here at last  
  
The pony cars are cruisin' on woodward avenue  
Go and try to pass'em  
They'll smoke you if you do  
The whole town's shakin' from the bottom to the top  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop  
The busters from the country  
And the hitters from the shop  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop  
Tell 'em we'll be dancin'  
Dancin' till we drop  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop
