(Si bon si bon)  
See'est si bon (Si bon si bon)  
Lovers say that in France (Si bon si bon)  
When they thrill to romance (Si bon si bon)  
It means that it's so good  
Ah see'est si bon (Si bon si bon)  
So I say it to you (Si bon si bon)  
Like the French people do (Si bon si bon)  
Because it's oh so good  
Every word every sigh every kiss dear  
Leads to only one thought and it's this dear  
Oh it's on so good (Si bon si bon)  
Nothing else can replace (Si bon si bon)  
Just your slightest embrace (Si bon si bon)  
And if you only would  
Would be my own for the rest of my days  
I would whisper this phrase  
See'est si bon (Si bon si bon)  
The river Seine (Si bon si bon)  
The Left Bank (Si bon si bon)  
The Eiffel Tower (Si bon si bon)  
The meatballs, pizzas, school cheating, now that's stuffs pretty good too  
(En voyant notre mine ravie)  
I have only one thought and it's this dear  
Oh it's so good (Si bon si bon)  
Nothing else can replace (Si bon si bon)  
Just your slightest embrace (Si bon si bon)  
And if you only would  
Be my own for the rest of my days  
I would whisper this phrase  
My darling see'est si bon (Si bon si bon)  
Gigi si bon (Si bon si bon)  
Mimi si bon (Si bon si bon)  
And all those mademoiselles that are si bon  
In fact you'd be surprised how much good stuff there is around here Frank (Si
bon si bon)
