Like a warrior that fights  
And wins the battle  
I know the taste of victory  
Though I went through some nights  
Consumed by the shadows  
  
And was crippled emotionally  
Somehow I made it through the heartace  
I escaped  
I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith  
Kept my faith  
  
[Chorus]  
And the river was deep I didn't falter  
When the mountain was high  
I still believed  
When the valley was low  
It didn't stop me  
I knew you were waiting  
  
Knew you were waiting for me  
With and endless desire  
I kept on searching  
Sure in time our eyes would meet  
And like the bridge is on fire  
  
The hurt is over  
One touch and you set me free  
I don't regret a single moment  
Looking back, when I think of all those disappointments  
I just laugh, I just laugh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So we were drawn together through destiny  
I know this love we share was meant to be  
It's only love
