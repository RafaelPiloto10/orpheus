Hangin' out on the avenue  
Lookin' for something to do  
Didn't know when we first met  
That you would be such a pest  
Don't go callin' on the phone  
I don't need your dial tone  
You've been treatin' me so bad  
You're the best girl that I ever had, so  
Oh, oh, oh baby  
Don't go, don't go, honey  
Oh, don't you know  
You make me wanna smash you  
Fightin' on the avenue  
I'd knock some sense into you  
But I know it's not enough  
You think you're so damn tough  
All this talk about suicide  
Too many pills, too many lies  
Baby, you're no good you see  
Run, run, run, get away from me  
Oh, oh, oh baby  
Don't go, don't go, honey  
Oh, don't you know  
You make me wanna smash you  
Fightin' on the avenue  
You make me wanna smash you  
Fightin' on the avenue  
You make me wanna smash you, oh  
Hangin' out on the avenue  
Lookin' for somethin' to do  
Didn't know when we first met  
That you would be such a pest  
I ripped up all your photographs  
They make me wanna smash your head  
You've been treatin' me so bad  
You're the best girl that I ever had, so  
Oh, oh, oh baby  
Don't go, don't go, honey  
Oh, don't you know  
You make me wanna smash you  
Oh, oh, oh baby  
Don't go, don't go, honey  
Oh, don't you know  
You make me wanna smash you  
Smash you
