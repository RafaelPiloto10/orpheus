As I walked down the street  
Seems everyone I meet  
Gives me a friendly Hello!  
Guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
Birds in every tree  
Seem all so near to me  
They sing wherever I go  
Guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
[Chorus]  
If you should ask me the amount  
In my bank account  
I would have to confess  
That I'm slipping  
But, that don't worry me  
Confidentially, I got a dream that I'm tip in  
  
And when the days through  
Each night, I hurry to  
Home where love ways I know  
Guess, I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when the days through  
Each night, I hurry to  
Home where love ways I know  
Guess, I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
Woo!  
Just a lucky so and so.
