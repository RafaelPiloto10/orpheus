I was once a broken man  
I was once a broken fool  
Lost my wife and children  
To one basic broken rule  
Now I live my life in silence  
Tho' I'm not quite in a shell  
Drink and listen to that song  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale  
  
I was good shad tree mechanic  
So I send myself to school  
They smoothed off my rough edges  
In my hands they put new tools  
The instructor once he told me  
I could work on any line  
I could tend and make any diesel sing  
Just like Patsy Cline  
Just like Patsy Cline  
  
Well I met my wife to be  
Through my mother's best friend's son  
She had been a bar room singer  
She was as good as anyone  
But I ask her to stop singing  
And the girl she did not flinch  
Next day she went and bought that man  
A brand new crescent wrench, ohh  
A brand new crescent wrench  
  
We had three fine children  
As eight years went on by  
And earned a silver visor  
The knuckles stayed bone dry  
But after supper I kept hearin' her  
By the kitchen radio  
Singing sweet but desperate harmony  
A little bit to low, ohhh  
A little bit to low  
  
She left three months later  
I'd just come home for lunch  
Note said "easy come, hard go"  
I still love you so much  
She said I don't know if I'll be there  
Or if you'll want me when I come  
But if and when that Abbott steer  
You better  
Let my sweet dream run, ohhh  
Let my sweet dream run  
  
Ohhhh...ohhh...ohhh...ohhh  
  
I was good shad tree mechanic

But now the diesels aren't the only thing that sing  
Just like Patsy Cline  
Just like Patsy Cline

I was once a broken fool  
Lost my wife and children  
To one basic broken rule

A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale
