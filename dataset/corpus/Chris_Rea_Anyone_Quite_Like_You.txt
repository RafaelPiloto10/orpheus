Ten Thousand princes  
I've seen them all  
I've seen them come  
And I see them fall  
I've watched them win  
I've watched them loose  
Since you've been around  
No-one gets to choose  
Because when the game begins  
And the time is now  
When there is no more talking  
Only here and now  
There is only here and now  
I ain't seen anything quite like you  
Ain't been anyone quite like you  
  
Ten thousand princes  
All backs against the wall  
Then Thousand losers  
When the winner comes to call  
How they scream in frustration  
Then thousand reasons why  
The rhetoric is endless  
I see the laughter in your eyes  
Because when the game begins  
And the time is now  
When there is no more talking  
Only here and now  
Only here and now  
I ain't seen anything quite like you  
Ain't been anyone quite like you
