Here's a rose from my garden  
Where the bloom of romance grows  
But I'll keep on a part near my aching heart  
Just a petal from a faded rose  
Love'd be sweet in the morning  
When the breeze of summer blows  
But will fade and die when the wind is nigh  
Like a petal from a faded rose  
  
Now our love is a memory  
Where it's gone nobody knows  
But I'll hold so dear as a souvenir  
Just a petal from a faded rose  
(I will live with the roses Where the sea of memory flows)  
And each time I dream then a tear will gleam  
On this petal from a faded rose
