Found found found  
Found found found  
Someone who's worth it  
In this murkiness  
Someone who's never  
Seeming scheming  
I've  
Found found found  
Found found found  
Someone who's worth it  
In this murkiness  
Someone who's never  
Seeming to be scheming  
  
(Oh, but if I'd never found)  
(Oh, but if I'd never found)  
Oh, but if I'd never found  
  
I do believe that  
The more you give your love  
And I do believe that  
The more you give your trust  
The more you give your trust  
And the more you give your love  
The more you're bound to lose  
The more you're bound to lose  
  
(Oh, but if I'd never found)  
(Oh, but if I'd never found)  
Somebody who wants to be  
Who wants to be with me  
All the time
