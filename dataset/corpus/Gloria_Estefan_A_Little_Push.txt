Funny how you never know  
Where your heart is gonna go  
Suddenly you're being pulled  
Into a rising undertow  
What started as a little rain  
Grows into a hurricane  
Ridin' on a wave, desire flowin'  
Crashin' through your veins  
What you want, I know  
What you need  
I think you need a little push in my direction  
If you're gonna fall in love  
All you need's a little nudge  
And I will catch you when you fall  
I think it's only fair to bring to your attention  
You're about to fall in love  
Yes, you're gonna fall in love  
You're opening a different door  
Curious to know the score  
So afraid that once inside  
You won't be leaving anymore  
And while your hesitation burns  
You're gonna be surprised to learn  
How easy it'll be to get you to  
The point of no return  
What you want, I know  
What you need  
I think you need a little push in my direction  
If you're gonna fall in love  
All you need's a little nudge  
And I will catch you when you fall  
I think it's only fair to bring to your attention  
You're about to fall in love  
Yes, you're gonna fall in love  
You fear love that's real love  
Expecting ideal love  
It's hard to conceal love, oh  
Deny what you feel love, you feel love  
I think you need a little push in my direction  
If you're gonna fall in love  
All you need's a little nudge  
And I will catch you when you fall  
I think it's only fair to bring to your attention  
You're about to fall in love  
Yes, you're gonna fall in love
