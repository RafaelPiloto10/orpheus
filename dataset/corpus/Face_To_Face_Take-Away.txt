I'm not what you've sized me up to be inside your head  
No way you could ever see me how I really am  
Be careful what you say  
Because some things never change  
It's such a waste of time, but it's so strange  
You're only right when something's wrong  
  
You've tried to give me everything that I could never have  
I thought that you were trying to improve upon yourself  
Be careful what you say  
Because some things never change  
It's such a waste of time, but it's so strange  
You're only right when something's wrong  
  
Are you ready to do something about it?  
Or is it already too late?  
I've given up everything  
It hasn't changed a single thing  
Are you ready to do something about it?  
Or will you take the easy way?  
I can already see you start to disappear  
The take-away
