I guess there's nothing to do  
And nothing to say,  
But simply go on my way  
And call it a day.  
  
I guess I'm ready to go  
Right back on the shelf,  
Because at last I've learned  
Where you're concerned,  
I've just been fooling myself.  
  
I never had a chance,  
I thought you cared for me,  
But now I see I never had a chance.  
I never had a chance.  
Though you never told me so,  
Somehow I know I never had a chance.  
  
I knew we'd have to part,  
For I could always reach your lips  
But I could never reach your heart.  
My dream about romance  
Ended in a friendly chat.  
But more than that,  
I never had a chance.  
  
I never had a chance,  
I thought you cared for me,  
But now I see I never had a chance.  
I never had a chance.  
Though you never told me so,  
Somehow I know I never had a chance.  
  
I knew we'd have to part,  
For I could always reach your lips  
But I could never reach your heart.  
My dream about romance  
Ended in a friendly chat.  
But more than that,  
I never had a chance.
