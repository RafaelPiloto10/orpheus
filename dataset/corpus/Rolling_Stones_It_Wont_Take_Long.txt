Baby it won't take long to forget you  
Time it passes fast  
It'll all be over in a minute  
You'll be in the past  
  
You can lose the love of a lifetime  
In a single roll  
You can gain a fortune in an instant  
Or you can lose your soul  
  
[Chorus]  
And it won't take long to forget ya  
You know I'm never wrong  
It'll all be over in a minute  
And it won't take long  
  
And it won't take long to forgive ya  
But it's hard to forget  
Cause it seems like it's yesterday  
The day that we first met  
  
When you give me a smoldering look and  
Put out your cigarette  
And I saw your sultry look  
You wore a pale blue dress  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Life is short, one look and it's over  
Comes as quite a shock  
All I got is some memories  
Stuck in an old shoebox  
  
And it won't take long to forget ya  
You know I'm never wrong  
It'll all be over by Christmas  
No, it won't take long  
  
It won't take long
