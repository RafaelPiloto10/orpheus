When I was six, I had my first lady  
When I was eight, my first drink  
When I was fourteen, I was speeding in the street  
What could anybody say to me?  
  
[Bridge]  
You can call me Mister, you can call me Sir  
But don't you point your finger at me  
  
[Chorus]  
I want a mistrial to clear my name  
I want a mistrial in front of the people  
I want a mistrial to clear my name  
I want to bring my case to the people of New York City  
  
When I was thirty, my attitude was bad  
If I said differently, it'd be a lie  
But there's some smarts you learn down in the street  
That a college education can't buy  
  
[Bridge]  
  
I want a mistrial to clear my name  
I want a mistrial in front of the people  
I want a mistrial to clear my name  
I want to bring my case in front of the people at New York City  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I said: "M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L", mistrial  
In front of all the people  
I said: "M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L", mistrial  
In front of the people of New York City  
  
Mistrial  
The people of New York City  
I said mistrial  
"M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L"
