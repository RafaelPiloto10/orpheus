Dreamed I was an Eskimo  
Frozen wind began to blow  
Under my boots 'n around my toe  
Frost had bit the ground below  
It was a hundred degrees below zero  
  
And my mama cried  
And my mama cried  
Nanook, a-no-no  
Nanook, a-no-no  
Don't be a naughty Eskimo  
Save your money, don't go to the show  
  
Well I turned around and I said oh, oh oh  
Well I turned around and I said oh, oh oh  
Well I turned around and I said ho, ho  
And the northern lights commenced to glow  
And she said, with a tear in her eye  
Watch out where the huskies go, and don't you eat that yellow snow  
Watch out where the huskies go, and don't you eat that yellow snow
