Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair  
Talkin' to some rich folk that you know  
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company  
Hell, you know I could never be alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
  
Well when you're sitting back in that rose pink Cadillac  
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day  
I'll be in my room with my needle and my spoon  
And another girl she gonna take my pain away  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
And, I won't forget to put roses on your grave
