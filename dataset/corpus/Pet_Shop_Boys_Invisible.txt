After being for so many years  
The life and soul of the party  
It's weird  
I'm invisible  
Whatever I  
Have said and done  
Doesn't matter in this chatter  
And hum  
I'm invisible  
  
I'm here  
But you can't see me  
I'm invisible  
It's queer  
How gradually  
I've become  
Invisible  
  
Look at me  
The absentee  
Disappearing finally  
Goodbye  
Is it magic or the truth?  
Strange psychology?  
Or justified  
  
Can you hear me?  
Can you see me?  
Am I really even here?  
  
It's too late  
To find an excuse  
The party's over  
And I'm not much use  
Tonight  
Am I tragic or a joke  
Wrapped in my invisibility cloak?  
Well, quite.  
  
I'm here  
But you can't see me  
I'm invisible  
It's queer  
How gradually  
I've become  
Invisible  
  
It's a journey so they say  
But in this desert I was only a hazy, lazy mirage anyway
