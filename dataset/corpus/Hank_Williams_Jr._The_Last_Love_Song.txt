I know it's over cause I don't keep you satisfied anymore  
  
But before you move along let me sing you the last love song  
  
Tomorrow when I'll wake what will take the place  
  
Of smiles on your face and black hair against white lace  
  
And I wonder if I'll be thinking of our early morning love  
  
All the sweet things that you'd say that's brighten up my darkest day  
  
And tomorrow night what do use the chest to take the place of your breast  
  
Breast against my chest oh how I'll miss your tenderness but there's no use to
cryin'  
  
Cause love's a grown up game a little pleasure then a lot of pain  
  
First we call each other bad names then what we have was never quite the same  
  
I wish I could find eyes that won't cry lips that won't lie and love that
won't die  
  
Hmm hmm hmm hm and a love that won't die
