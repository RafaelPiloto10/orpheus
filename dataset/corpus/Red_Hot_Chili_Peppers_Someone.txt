Someone  
There are no worries for  
Someone  
Life's in no hurry for  
Someone  
There are no worries for  
Nothing major or too complicated  
Just a friendly wager that we orchestrated  
For someone  
Someone  
  
Cut my heart out  
With a feather  
And put an end  
To any extra pressure  
  
For someone  
There are no worries for  
Someone  
Life's in no hurry for  
Someone  
There are no worries for  
  
Ride around on mellow waves of mercy  
And fill the space with lack of controversy  
  
For someone  
Someone  
  
Set it up to follow you  
On my aeroplane  
Here's a present  
For the future memory lane  
  
Someone  
There are no worries for  
Someone  
Life's in no hurry for  
Someone  
There are no worries for  
  
Light it up the room  
She sang into any twane  
In the month of June i'll be  
A moth to your flame  
  
Someone  
There are no worries for  
Someone  
Life's in no hurry for  
Someone  
There are no worries for me  
For me  
For me  
For me
