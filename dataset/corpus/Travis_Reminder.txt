Celebrate, don't be late  
Finish what's on your plate  
Be the change you wanna see  
Seek the truth, set it free  
  
And I wanna tell you  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
  
Why does time move so fast?  
Precious things never last  
Figure out, don't forget  
Only love, no regrets  
  
And I gotta tell you  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
  
All of the things you never noticed  
All of the lines you cling to that don't mean a thing  
All of the dates that you were late for  
All of the rounds you should've paid for  
  
And I wanna tell you  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder
