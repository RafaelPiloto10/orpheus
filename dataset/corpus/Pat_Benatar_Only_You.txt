I lost faith in myself, in everyone and everything around me  
I thought I'd disappear, maybe you'd be better off without me  
You showed me I was wrong, everybody needs someone  
And love is not about perfection  
You made no promises  
Life is hard enough you said, without you  
  
Only you, only you  
You're all that matters  
Only you, only you, only you  
Only you give me strength  
When my world is shattered  
Only you, only you, only you  
  
I've walked this road some many times before  
You'd think I'd know the way  
But like the fool that I am, it always ends the same  
You said that everyone deserves a little happiness  
No one should have to be alone  
Me, I'd be satisfied with just a little tenderness,  
With you  
  
Only you, only you  
You're all that matters  
Only you, only you, only you  
Only you break the chain  
When my world is shattered  
Only you, only you, only you  
  
Only you, only you  
You're all that matters  
Only you, only you, only you  
Only you give me strength  
When my world is shattered  
Only you, only you, only you
