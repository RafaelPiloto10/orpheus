Been together for so long my friend  
Now you tell me that you'll be going away  
So many people in so many ways  
Drawn by you in all the things you've had to say  
  
And now I know where you're going to  
Hope you find your way  
I'll say  
  
What's forever if you're gone?  
Give me the strenght to carry on  
When you see me walking by  
I'll hold my head uphigh  
And think of the times when we were young  
When our love had just begun  
Only you can stop the pain  
But our love will always remain  
  
Sit and wonder about the things we've said  
And times we've had and the games we played  
Look back now and remember the days we laughed  
The moments we cried and the love we made  
And now I know where you're going to  
I'll see you there someday  
I'll say  
  
What's forever if you're gone?  
Give me the strenght to carry on  
When you see me walking by  
I'll hold my head uphigh  
And think of the times when we were young  
When our love had just begun  
Only you can stop the pain  
But our love will always remain  
  
Every time that I'd see you smile  
My whole world would be bright  
If I just had the power I'd keep you a while  
Then I'd know it's all right  
And I know where you're going to  
I'll see you there someday  
I'll say  
  
What's forever if you're gone?  
Give me the strenght to carry on  
When you see me walking by  
I'll hold my head uphigh  
And think of the times when we were young  
When our love had just begun  
Only you can stop the pain  
But our love will always remain
