Non-commercial lyrics run like Hershel  
Walkin' fast cause I'm a smooth talker  
Appeal the feel, but don't praise and kneel  
Just heal  
  
And always look for the seal that's real  
Top Dog, lookin' up to say what is this  
Kid Rock serious and I mean business  
Ascending up and up I keep boosting  
  
Makin' hit records like Whitney Houston  
With a mind of violence, right, I might  
Blow the show teachers speakin' yo, I cut MP's  
To release to each and be friends of  
Every single, individual  
  
Everybody all over the world, it's time for understandin'  
Come together  
  
Jumbo, yo that's how I'm movin'  
I'm the new kid in, here's what I'm givin'  
A jammed, slammin', command that take authority  
'Cause too many MC's appear apsrt of me  
  
Name and they claim me, yo, that they're winnin'  
A lotta just came in, sound the same in  
Thinkin' they swift and can get with these young men  
But I keep the crowd swingin' like Tarzan  
  
'Cause I'm a wise man here to teach and speak  
And if you step out of line your up shits creek  
So come with it, Kid Rock's gonna get it  
His style ain't dope, its a throat, and I slit it  
  
I'm raw like cowhide, smooth like a plane ride  
No half steppin', I always take a full stride  
Who came played and they say I'm concrete made  
I used to come correct in the projects  
  
New Port, Oxford, deep in the basement  
House and parties like real estate agent  
So on, so strong, and everyone got along  
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song  
  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin  
Come together  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin  
Come together  
  
Now as I said my prayers through the years I shed a few tears  
'Cause it's unjust when I see my peers get shot  
And dropped and forgot, now that's hot  
Too many can't score as victims of a drug war  
  
Cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out  
The press finds out, then the public is tripped out  
New tax the acts and half the drug industry  
Uncle Sam is my man, are you kiddin me  
  
Me in the Whitehouse, now that's fucked up  
For one to get over, one must get stuck up  
One will roll up, another will smoke up  
Two more thrown in jail, who picks the toll up  
  
Tell her to beware if she's gonna stand there  
Eyes bugged out and hands in the air  
'Cause there comes an onlooker, lookin for a hooker  
And act like the doors overlooked her and took her  
  
For a place to hide and when he got his ride  
He let the nice slide and the girl, she died  
Her family cried over this homicide  
And why they pondered, why she wandered  
  
Left her own spot, her home, her mom and pop  
All to smoke a little cooked up rock  
So on and so strong, she couldn't get along  
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song  
  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'  
Come together  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'  
Come together  
  
From the outskirts with a mind like Albert Einstein  
Maybe I'm ahead of my time  
Imaginate, create, spectate, elevate from the states  
Surrounded by the Great Lakes  
  
I was once out cold at 15 years old  
Rolled and sold, you, me, and Bo  
Sittin' in Jackson infested with rats  
With a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks  
  
I was a young bad mother in my own eyes  
But now I realize it wasn't too wise  
So now I teach, I'll reach to each  
And every single individual  
  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin  
Come together  
Come together  
Come together  
Come... come... come... come together
