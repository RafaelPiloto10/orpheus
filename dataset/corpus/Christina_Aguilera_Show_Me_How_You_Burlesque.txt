Underneath the city lights  
There is a world few know about  
Where rules don't apply, no  
And you can't keep a good girl down  
  
She going through the club  
Looking for a good time  
Gonna make that  
Shake that  
Money on the dime  
Don't need a sugga daddy  
Shell be working it just fine  
Up on the table  
Shell be dancing all night (hee-ey)  
  
Baby doll just come alive  
Under the spotlight  
All the girls wanna fall in line
