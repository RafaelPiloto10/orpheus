Your love got me trippin'  
But now that you're flippin'  
With my heart,  
We were flying high but we're dipping  
In my heart,  
Ohh I am a fool for you,  
I go running home  
Everytime, you walk out on me  
I thought we were going strong but now it's easy to see my mama was right
you're my  
Mama's worst nightmare no doubt about that  
You are my mama's worst nightmare  
No doubt that you are  
Your love got me running  
But now that you're cunning  
Little plans  
Ohh have got me flipping  
And dipping  
You're cunning whilst  
I'm running  
You're my, you're my, you're myyy  
My mama's worst nightmare no  
Mama's worst nightmare no doubt about that  
You are my mama's worst nightmare  
No doubt that you are
