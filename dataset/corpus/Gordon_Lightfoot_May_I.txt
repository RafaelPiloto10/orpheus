Finders, keepers, losers, weepers  
Ring around the rosy  
And I'll catch you if I can  
And if you don't say may I,  
Then you'll have to start again  
But first you must indulge me  
And count from one to ten  
Let the game begin  
  
I adore you when you touch me  
Pin the tail upon the donkey,  
You will surely win  
And if you don't say may I,  
Then I'll pass the cake around  
And I won't give you any,  
But you won't make a sound  
You don't eat soap, anyhow  
  
Red light, green light,  
Blue light, yellow light  
You can take three giant steps  
Or a baby step will do  
But if you don't say may I,  
Then I'll march you out the door  
Where you'll be contemplating  
The numbers one to four  
I hope you're keeping score  
  
'Cause if you don't say may I,  
Then I'll get you with the hose  
And spoil your Sunday clothes  
Will it please you if I tease you  
While you're at the spindry,  
I'll pass the pie around  
But you won't make a sound  
You don't eat blackbird anyhow  
  
There's four and twenty reasons  
Why it can't be wrong  
How long have you been gone  
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers  
Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater  
Wear your sneakers around sound sleepers
