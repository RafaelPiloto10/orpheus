The minute you walked in the joint  
I could see you were a man of distinction.  
A real big spender,  
Good lookin', so refined.  
Say, wouldn't you like to know  
What's goin on in my mind?  
So let me get to the point.  
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see.  
Hey big spender,  
Spend a little time with me.  
Wouldn't you like to have fun, fun, fun?  
How's about a few laughs, laughs, laughs?  
I can show you a good time.  
Let me show you a good time.  
The minute you walked in the joint  
I could see you were a man of distinction.

Hey big spender,  
Hey big spender,  
Spend a little time with me.
