On my way to Italy from the Gulf of Mexico  
Riding on a tanker, feeling mighty low  
My good gal's behind me, no loving for so long  
I'm going back to Texas, for that's where I belong  
  
Nights are so lonely on the ocean  
To much time to dream of yesterday  
If only I could carry out my notion  
And hit the trail for Texas right away  
  
On my way to Italy from the Gulf of Mexico  
Riding on a tanker, feeling mighty low  
My good gal's behind me, no loving for so long  
I'm going back to Texas, for that's where I belong  
  
I never thought I was leaving  
I could get so blue out on the sea  
But I'll bet you after all this grieving  
Its that good old Texas soil for me  
  
On my way to Italy from the Gulf of Mexico  
Riding on a tanker, feeling mighty low  
My good gal's behind me, no loving for so long  
I'm going back to Texas, for that's where I belong
