On my roof (roof, roof, roof)  
Dark and I'm burning a rose  
I don't need proof (proof, proof, proof)  
I'm torn apart and you know  
What you did to me was a crime  
Cold case love (love, love)  
And I let you reach me one more time  
But that's enough  
  
Your love was breaking the law  
But I needed a witness  
So wake me up when it's over  
It don't make any difference  
Will it ever be solved  
Or am I taking the fall  
Truth was there all along  
Tell me how did we miss it  
  
We opened up a cold case love  
And it got the best of us  
And now prints, pictures and white outlines  
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime  
Of a cold case love  
  
Should've investigated  
But love blinded eyes  
Couldn't see, no  
And then I tried to cage it  
But your love ain't the kind you can keep  
Release me now cause I did my time  
Of this cold case love  
My heart's no longer cold and confined  
I've had enough  
  
Your love was breaking the law  
But I needed a witness  
So wake me up when it's over  
It don't make any difference  
Will it ever be solved  
Or am I taking the fall  
Truth was there all along  
Tell me how did we miss it  
  
We opened up a cold case love  
And it got the best of us  
And now prints, pictures and white outlines  
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime  
Of a cold case love  
  
We lost our way  
Took this too far  
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart  
We've lost enough  
Looking for a truth  
That was here all along  
  
Cold case love  
And it got the best of us  
And now prints, pictures and white outlines  
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime  
Of a cold case love  
  
We opened up a cold case love  
It got the best of us  
Now prints, pictures and white outlines  
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime  
Of a cold case love, love
