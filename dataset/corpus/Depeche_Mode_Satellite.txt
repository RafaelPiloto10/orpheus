Now hear this my friends  
I'll never be the same again  
Going to lock myself in a cold black room  
Going to shadow myself in a veil of gloom  
I will function, operate  
I will be a satellite of hate  
  
Driven to this point by a chain of events  
Each one pushed me nearer the edge  
Going to send my message through to you  
You'll receive the signal too  
I will function, operate  
I will be a satellite of hate  
  
Higher, Higher  
  
Disillusioned, I was disenchanted  
Forgot the love that had been implanted  
Heard the lies and I felt the cold  
It broke my heart and I lost control  
Now I'm a satellite of a free state  
I'm a satellite of hate
