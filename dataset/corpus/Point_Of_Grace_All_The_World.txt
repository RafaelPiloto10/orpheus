All the world is a story  
All the world is a stage  
All the world is a canvas  
All the world is a page  
  
All the world is a horizon  
All the world is a field of dreams  
All the world is an open doorway  
All the world is a place for me  
  
To be your voice  
To be your touch  
To give an answer  
To show your love  
  
To hold out hope  
To offer peace  
To shine your light  
For everyone to see in all the world  
  
All the world is a someone  
All the world is a dance  
And all the world is a moment  
All the world is a chance  
  
To be your voice  
To be your touch  
To give an answer  
To show your love  
  
To hold out hope  
To offer peace  
To shine your light  
For everyone to see in all the world  
  
You are amazing mercy  
You are undying grace  
I want the world to see  
How wonderful you are upon my face  
  
To be your voice  
To be your touch  
To give an answer  
To show your love  
  
To hold out hope  
To offer peace  
To shine your light  
For everyone to see in all the world  
  
Be your voice  
Be your touch  
Give an answer  
Show your love  
  
Hold out hope  
Offer peace  
Shine your light  
For all the world
