God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day  
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray  
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day  
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray  
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day  
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray  
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
