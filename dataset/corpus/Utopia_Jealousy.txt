It wasn't really nothin'  
I was just trying to have some fun  
I let my guard down, I just turned 'round  
Someone slashed me with a razor tongue  
It's a strange situation  
I'm not quite sure what it means  
The one I admire, my simple desire  
Smothered by a love gone green  
  
Must be jealousy, must be cause it sounds like  
Jealousy, must be 'cause it looks like  
Jealousy, must be 'cause it smells like  
Jealousy, must be 'cause it feels like  
Eyes are drilling holes in the back of your head  
Someone's got the number of your death bed, stepping into  
  
Jealousy  
You're ready for a comeback  
You're back on your feet again  
You think you're out from under  
You hear a crack of thunder  
Someone stabs you with a poison pen  
  
If you try fightin' dirty  
Just try to keep it clean  
Cause no amount of trying and no amount of crying  
Can save you from a love gone green  
Must be jealousy  
End of the dance and the loss of innocence  
Jealousy drags me to my knees  
Battered by a love gone green
