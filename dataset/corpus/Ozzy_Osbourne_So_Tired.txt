Time has come to say goodbye  
I know it's gonna make you cry  
But you belong to another my love  
And half a love that just isn't enough  
  
I am so tired  
And I just can't wait around for you  
I am so tried  
And I always thought we would see it through  
  
I've waited all this time for you  
Believed your promises were true  
I keep believing that you mean what you say  
You'll leave tomorrow - now tomorrow's today  
  
And I often sit and wonder why  
You're not with me tonight  
I stayed at home remaining true  
While you were out with you know who  
  
I am so tired  
And I just can't wait around for you  
I am so tried  
And I always thought we would see it through
