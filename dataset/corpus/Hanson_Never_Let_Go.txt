Just lay down  
And let your worries sleep  
Don't think now  
The water is dark and deep  
  
'Cause you know that I'll love you  
And never let go  
And you know  
That I'll love you forever  
I'll love you and never let go  
Yes I'll love you and never let go  
  
Just cry out  
Yeah I've cried those tears before  
I can feel it now  
As your teardrops hit the floor  
  
'Cause you know  
That I'll love you and never let go  
And you know  
That I'll love you forever  
I'll love you and never let go  
Yes I love you and never let go  
  
You don't have to ask me do I love you  
As I hold you it says how much I do  
I'm yours until forever is through  
Anytime I stand for you  
I know I'd lay my life down for you  
  
I'll never let  
Not ever let go  
  
Just lay down  
Put your worried thoughts to bed  
As slumber pulls you down  
On my shoulder rest your head  
  
'Cause you know  
That I love you and never let go  
And you know  
That I'll love you forever  
I'll love you and never let go  
Yes I love you and never let go  
  
Never let go never let go  
Never let never let go never let go
