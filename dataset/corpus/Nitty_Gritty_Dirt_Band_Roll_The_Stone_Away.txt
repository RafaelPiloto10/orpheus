You can swim in this old river  
It's been delivered  
Since the factory shut down  
And like the river I'm waiting  
  
For resurrection  
Since I lost your affection  
And love left town  
  
There'll be no more crying  
There's no one left to blame  
Love will come out standing  
So roll that stone away  
We were good  
  
But we could have been better  
And the best is what we're after  
When it comes right down to love  
You were always the strong one  
  
Bright as the setting sun  
Go shine somewhere else my love  
Some brand new world (some brand new world)  
There'll be no more crying  
  
There's no one left to blame  
Love will come out standing  
So roll that stone away  
And like that river I'm waiting  
  
For resurrection  
Since I lost your affection  
And love left town (and love left town)  
There'll be no more crying  
  
There's no one left to blame  
Love will come out standing  
So roll that stone roll that stone  
Roll that stone away
