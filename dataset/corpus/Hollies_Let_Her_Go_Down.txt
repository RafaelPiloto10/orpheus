Sometime in October  
We sailed from England's shore  
When we sailed into a raging storm  
Like I never ever seen before  
And all of the crew they were brave men  
But the captain he was braver  
And he said  
"Never mind the ship me boys  
There's none of us here can save her"  
  
Let her go down Swim for your lives  
Swim for your children swim for your wives  
Let her go down Let her go down  
  
Lost in the open ocean  
There was some of the crew and me  
While the captain steered our wounded ship  
To the bottom of an angry sea  
And with his dying breath  
We all heard him say  
"It's just the fortune of sailor"  
And he said  
"Never mind the ship me boys  
There's none of us here can save her"  
  
Chorus  
  
He wondered if his shipmates  
Were ready to just pray and give in  
So he called their names out one by one  
But there was no one else around but him  
He saw the ship go down the fading light  
And he knew that they could have saved her  
He said  
"The captain lied when the captain cried  
'There's none of us here can save her' "  
  
Chorus  
  
Swim for your lives  
Swim for your children swim for your wives  
Let her go down Let her go down  
Swim for your lives
