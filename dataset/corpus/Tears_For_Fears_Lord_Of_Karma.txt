There's been some knocking  
There's been some heavy knocking  
It sounds like someone wants to break down the door  
My super ego where I go, he go,  
You come a reaping, come a keeping the score and I say  
Lord of karma, your mystic-pain-o-rama  
One good reason, keep my feet on the ground and I say:  
Lord of karma, your mystic-pain-o-rama  
Karma Come on down, oh no, no.  
  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
  
Take fear and loathing and put new clothing on it  
Infatuation with a snow mountain climb.  
In limitation and Devil's advocation,  
Come and make it quick, then hit it the ground and I say:  
Lord of karma, your mystic-pain-o-rama  
Karma, Come on down, oh no, no.  
  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
  
These are the reasons and these are the laws  
In one life you're rich, in the next you are poor  
Save your excuses, your tensions and fears  
Be sure as you go and you go with the flow  
And you reap what you sow as above, so below  
  
Mind your lip and swing your hips  
And be selective, be objective  
No pain, no gain, no pain, no gain, no pain, no gain  
No pain, no gain, no pain, no gain, no pain, no gain  
No pain  
  
Lord of Karma [Repeat: x7]
