[Verse 1]  
What can you buy with the ultimate sacrifice  
If you don't believe in the afterlife?  
Oh I still grieve rememberin' what you were like  
Now what good is a dream when the dreamer dies?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Some are better than good  
Greater than great  
Some are misunderstood  
And they get told to wait by  
  
[Chorus]  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Who'll be the latest  
The latest to fall?  
We're marching into the dark  
  
[Verse 2]  
What if your like was just in the day to day  
And after you're gone the world stays the same?  
Why should you love what you're gonna lose anyway?  
Oh I've imagined one hundred ways  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Some are just no good  
Some will let it just fade  
Some are misunderstood  
We'll just have to wait, 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Who'll be the latest  
The latest to fall?  
We're marching into the dark  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh Heaven knows where we are  
Chasing the fading stars  
Heaven knows where we are  
Motioning to the dark  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Some are better than good  
And greater than great  
Some are misunderstood  
They get told to wait  
Some are just no good  
Some will let it just fade  
Some are misunderstood  
We'll just have to wait, 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Wanna know who  
Who'll be the latest  
The latest to fall?  
We're marching into the dark  
I wanna go marching into the dark  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Were chasing their fading star  
Who'll be the latest  
Latest to fall?  
Marching into the dark
