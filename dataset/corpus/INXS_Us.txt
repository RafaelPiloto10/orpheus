The world is always changing  
You can see it everyday  
But in a tragic situation  
You just can't hide yourself away  
So try a little kindness  
Cause it shouldn't be that hard  
You're shining in the darkness  
When you open up your heart  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
Don't leave it to me, nothing's for free  
It comes down to us  
  
Hungry babies on television  
Can you feel the shame  
You've gotta keep on giving to one another  
Cos it's all gonna happen again  
Why don't you try a little kindness  
Cause it shouldn't be that hard  
Just think about what binds us  
And find a new place to start  
  
Your love is all, we need  
To bring us together  
Don't you leave it to me  
Nothing's for free  
It comes down to us  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
We're not indestructible  
Some kind of miracle  
Happens every day  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
Don't leave it to me  
Nothings for free  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
We're not indestructible  
Some kind of miracle  
Happens every day  
Oh it comes down to us  
It comes down to us  
We all have to stop, stop,  
Stop pretending now  
It comes down to us
