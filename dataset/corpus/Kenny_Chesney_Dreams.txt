She says most men her age want younger women.  
She thinks her self esteem's  
Not quite itself any more.  
But she sees herself as more than  
What the mirror shows,  
Why that's so important,  
Heaven only knows.  
When the important part for her is,  
Souls and heart's and...  
  
Dreams of sharin' a life and a home.  
Dreams...of never ever bein' alone again.  
Dreams...not even diamonds, just a little gold.  
Someone there to hold her hand when she gets old.  
Dreams...the kind you know will never end.  
Forever lovers and forever friends.  
Someone really there, to love and care,  
And share...dreams.  
  
She swears she won't divorce a 3rd time.  
She swears the more she knows about love,  
The harder it is to find.  
Her perfect picture of her white horse prince,  
Is now dependability and common sense,  
Someone kind and brave.  
Someone not afraid of...  
  
Dreams...of never ever bein' alone again.  
Dreams...mot even diamonds, just a little gold.  
Someone there to hold her hand when she gets old.  
Dreams...the kind you know will never end.  
Forever lovers, forever friends.  
Someone really there, to love and care,  
And share...dreams.  
  
Ohhh...dreams,  
The kind you know will never end.  
Forever lovers, and forever friends.  
Someone really there, to love and care,  
And share...dreams.  
  
She says most men her age want younger women.
