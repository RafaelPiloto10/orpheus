Have you ever been  
Have you ever been  
To Electric Ladyland?  
The magic carpet waits  
For you  
So don't be late  
I wanna show you  
The different emotions  
I wanna run to  
The sounds and motions, heeey  
Electric woman waits for you and me  
So it's time we take a ride  
We can cast all of your hang-ups over the seaside  
While we fly right over the love filled sea  
Look up ahead  
I see the loveland  
Soon you'll understand.  
Make love, make love, make love, make love.  
I wanna show you  
The angels will spread their wings, yeah  
I wanna run to  
Good and evil lay side by side  
While electric love penetrates the sky  
I wanna show you  
Lord, Lord, Lord I wanna show you  
I wanna show you  
Haaa, haaa , haaa  
I wanna show you  
I wanna show you  
Show you  
Oh ! I wanna show you  
You gotta believe i wanna show  
I wanna show you  
I wanna show you  
Ah yeah, I wanna show you  
I wanna show you...show you!
