It's the start of the season  
The dawning is near  
The age of fish ends announcing the news of the year  
The tiger returns to the jungle  
  
The wolf comes home to his yard  
When you say it feels good to be back  
Then it's just one step further on to the heart  
Getting over, getting over  
  
It's the start of the season  
Creep out of the arc  
Leave your sticky asylum behind and step out of the dark  
There's an open horizon before us  
  
There is a rainbow under my eyes  
The detector reads low radiation  
And you are fearless to rise til you're high  
Getting over, getting over  
  
It's the start of the season  
Over the land  
A mockingbird is singing a song near the tide's restaurant  
As you undress your movie-blue diving suit  
  
Your innocent skin shines so white  
We shall be one  
Under the sun  
Right here in the power of the light  
  
Come to the summer  
Welcome to the sun  
Come to the summer  
Welcome  
  
To the  
Sun  
Welcome
