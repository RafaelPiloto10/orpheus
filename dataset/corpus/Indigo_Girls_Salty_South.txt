Mister pull up a chair  
I got time for tears  
Tell me all the stories that you never did  
Of the salty south  
The Seminoles held out  
While Geronimo died in a lonely jail  
  
A thousand tides, and  
A thousand waves  
Takin' it all away  
  
It'll come back in  
We'll be gone by then  
And it's a miracle we ever learned to live  
  
Drain that land  
For a better plan  
Sugarcane and the civil man  
But now the ringin' dead them pines  
Planted in that time  
We gonna keep on killin' till they get it right  
  
A thousand tides, and  
A thousand waves  
Takin' it all away  
  
It'll come back in  
We'll be gone by then, oh  
And it's a miracle we ever learned to live  
  
I remember the wind  
As it was settlin'  
And every sun goin' down was a picture then  
But we look back at 'em framed  
They all look the same  
There's no sense of time, no sense of pain  
  
A thousand tides, and  
A thousand waves  
Takin' it all away  
  
And it'll come back in  
We'll be gone by then, oh  
And it's a miracle we ever learned to give
