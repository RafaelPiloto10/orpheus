One day I'll stop breathing  
My heart will stop beating  
I won't see your face again  
This flesh and blood is weak  
Life isn't ours to keep  
Sometime it has to end nd nd "echo"  
In time even memories fade away  
With time you will learn to forgive and forget  
The mistakes that I've made  
I broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
One thing will always be true  
I'll never stop loving you  
  
Fallin from your grace  
You'll never be replaced  
Lord knows how hard I've tried  
But it just aint no use  
I thought I could shake you loose  
I'm still torn up inside  
In time even memories fade away  
With time you will learn to forgive and forget  
The mistakes that I've made  
I've broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
But one thing will always be true  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
I broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
But one thing will always be true  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
No I will never stop lovin you
