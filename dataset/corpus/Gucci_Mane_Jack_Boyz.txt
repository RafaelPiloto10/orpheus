[Chorus:]  
I'm fucked up!  
You fucked up!  
Selling Niggers where's your stash  
You just blew your luck!  
Jack boys on your ass put your chain on top,  
I ain't talking about a name but my  
I'm fucked up!  
You fucked up!  
Telling Niggers where's your stash  
You just blew your luck!  
Jack boys on your ass put your chain on top,  
I ain't talking about a name but my  
  
For big Gucci OJ  
I put the cross on  
For now it comes the thunderstorm  
Couple Niggers down to murder for a couple strikes  
Brick squad, brick squad, everything is brick squad  
Seein a bitch nigga dead make my dick hard.  
Is only one word I can't take is the fear.  
I'm dying for my Niggers!  
My Niggers die for me!  
Like a midget to a train. ain't no stopping me  
No!  
I'm writing for my Niggers!  
My Niggers write for me!  
I'm my brother's that we got is real.  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I'm not the bad Niggers or the biggest one  
But if you beat us, son,  
I get a bigger gun!  
I walk a lot of jewels  
And plus a lot of tools  
I make a lot of shops  
I make some mortal soup.  
It's such a beautiful day,  
To put my diamonds on display  
Black and yellow diamonds catchin sun rays on a sunday.  
You're a man or a mouse?  
He's a fucking mouse!
