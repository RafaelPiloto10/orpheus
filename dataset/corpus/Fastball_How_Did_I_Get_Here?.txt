How did I get here  
Lyin' in the sunshine  
All I have is tears  
Watch them as they fall  
I'm wishing you were here  
This was supposed to be a good time  
This was supposed to be our year  
Now there's nothing after all.  
  
How did I get here  
I guess it doesn't really matter  
I try and pass the days  
Without you on my mind  
Without you next to me  
This is feeling like a bad dream  
I'm doin' it again  
I thought about you one more time  
  
I'm sending out a message via satellite  
Where are you tonight my dear  
We're all missing you right here  
We're lighting you a candle in the dead of night  
Where are you tonight my dear  
We're all missing you
