By Michael Franks  
Love, when we touch I shiver  
Just body language can you blame it  
My love's like a raging river  
And I think you're the one to tame it  
You, you're the quiet, shy type  
You always whisper never shout it  
Ooh, Baby, you are my type  
Why don't you tell me all about it  
I got ways to make you  
Make you tell me all about it  
That's what I'm gonna do  
Till you tell me all about it  
Making love till you do  
Till you tell me all about it  
(Musical Interlude)  
Me, I'm a lousy loner  
Just call my number come be near me  
Me, I'm a soulful moaner  
Stay chez moi so you can hear me  
You, you're the quiet shy type  
You always whisper never shout it  
Ooh, Baby, you are my type  
Why don't you tell me all about it  
(Background singers repeat:  
I got ways to make you, make you tell me all about it  
That's what I'm gonna do, till you tell me all about it  
Making love till you do, till you tell me all about it)  
I got ways  
I got some special ways  
I got some very special ways to make you tell me  
Baby, baby  
(Scat)  
Tell me, tell me  
I got ways to make you  
Make you love me  
(Background singers change to:  
That's exactly what I'm,  
That's what I'm gonna do, till you tell me all about it  
We won't stop making love,  
Making love till you do, till you tell me all about it  
I got some ways,  
I got ways to make you, make you tell me all about it)  
Ooh, tell me that you love me  
Tell me all about it, Baby  
(Scat)  
Tell me, Baby, that you love me...
