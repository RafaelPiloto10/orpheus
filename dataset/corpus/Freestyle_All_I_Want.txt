I  
In the middle of the night  
When I feel A little colder  
I just want to hold you tight  
I just need you to be closer  
Refrain I  
And as I feel the love  
Inside me grow  
Let me whisper to you softly  
'Coz there'S something that I want you to know...  
Chorus I  
All that I want is you  
I need you by my side  
To love me everyday...  
And night  
And all that I want to say  
Is that I really love you  
Hope you feel the same way  
You'Ve become the biggest part of me  
Now I know that you will always be...  
... All I want  
Ii  
Everytime I close my eyes  
I can'T help but dream about you  
Since you came into my life  
All I feel is the warmth in your heart  
Refrain ii  
I'Ve never felt the way you make me feel  
Like A dream that'S never-Ending  
Only this time my heart says that it'S real...  
Chorus ii  
All that I want is you  
I need for you to see  
That you will always be  
In my heart  
And all that I want to say  
Is that I'Ll always love you

And you will always be the one for me  
And the love we have will always be...  
...All I want  
Bridge  
We were meant to be together  
Like we'Ve told each other  
Right from the start  
And you should know that I'Ll  
Always stay right here right  
By your side, we'Ll never be apart...  
Never apart,... And I...  
Coda I  
All that I want is you

To love me every day...
