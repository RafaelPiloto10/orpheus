Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost  
For making me do this shit motherfucker  
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room  
Cause they don't fucking  
  
(I'd like to propose a toast)  
(I said toast motherfucker)  
  
And I am  
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them  
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky  
This is the last call for alcohol, for the  
So get your ass up off the wall  
  
The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac  
The Rudolph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc  
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame  
And come back next year with the whole fucking game  
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top  
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop  
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself  
Rocafella's only niggas that help  
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair  
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here  
They say he bourgie, he big-headed  
Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is  
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds  
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas  
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested  
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus  
  
And I am  
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them  
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky  
This is the last call for alcohol, for the  
So get your ass up off the wall  
  
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir  
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir  
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest  
But all they got left is this guy called West  
Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def  
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z  
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh  
It come out sweeter than old Sadie  
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards  
Girl he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards  
And I was almost famous, now everybody loves Kanye  
I'm almost Raymond'  
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?  
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him  
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine  
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme  
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem  
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams  
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed  
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh  
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more  
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more  
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more  
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga  
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don  
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom  
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards  
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars  
I went to the malls and I balled too hard  
'Oh my god, is that a black card?'  
I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term  
African American Express  
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell  
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to  
Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit  
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips  
  
And I am  
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them  
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky  
This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas  
So get your ass up off the wall
