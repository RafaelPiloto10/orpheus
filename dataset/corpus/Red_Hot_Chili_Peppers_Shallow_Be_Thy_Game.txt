I was not created  
In the likeness of a fraud  
Your hell is something scary  
I prefer a loving god  
We are not the center  
Of this funny universe  
And what is something worse  
I do not serve  
In fear of such a curse  
  
Shallow be thy game  
Two thousand years look in the mirror  
You play the game of shame  
And tell your people live in fear  
  
A rival to the way you see  
The bible let him be  
I'm a threat to your survival  
And your control company  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll never burn me  
You'll never burn me  
I'll be your heretic  
You can't contain me  
I am the power free  
Truth belongs to everybody  
  
To anyone who's listenin'  
You're not born into sin  
The guilt they try and give you  
Puke it in the nearest bin  
  
Missionary madness  
Sweep up culture with a broom  
Trashing ancient ways  
Is par for the course  
It's fucking rude  
  
To think that you're above  
The laws of nature is a joke  
Purple sashes feeding masses  
Smoke on which to choke  
  
I might be a monkey  
When it comes to being holy  
Fundamental hatred  
Get down on your knees and  
  
[Chorus]
