Was it something I said?  
Was is something I did? Ohh,  
Looking for an answer cause I don't even know,  
Why are you so upset with me?  
Girl what is this about?  
Them other shawty's I don't care about,  
  
(Chorus)  
Baby sit down,  
Only when we sex is when I wanna hear you yelling out loud,  
Count down,  
Backwards from ten, now ain't that much better?  
Lay down every little word,  
She said this he said that,  
Don't believe none of them lies,  
Ohhhh,  
  
This damn time,  
Fightin' over shit that don't really matter,  
This chapter, started on a brand new chapter,  
I've never seen this type of thing before,  
I already know why the story unfolds,  
All I wanna do is love you right, take my time,  
Read between the lines girl,  
Read between the lines girl,  
  
Here we go again,  
Heard it all before,  
It's getting us know where fast,  
So let's retrace our steps,  
Figure out where we were,  
Ohh girl,  
Lets talk this through,  
  
(Chorus)  
Baby sit down,  
Only when we sex is when I wanna hear you yelling out loud,  
Count down,  
Backwards from ten, now ain't that much better,  
Lay down every little word,  
She said this he said that,  
Don't believe none of them lies,  
Ohhhh,  
  
This damn time,  
Fightin' over shit that don't really matter,  
This chapter, started on a brand new chapter,  
I've never seen this type of thing before,  
I already know why the story unfolds,  
All I wanna do is love you right, get my time,  
Read between the lines girl,  
Read between the lines girl.
