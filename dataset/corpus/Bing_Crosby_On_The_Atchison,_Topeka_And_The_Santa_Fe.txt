Do you hear that whistle down the line  
I figure that it's engine number forty-nine  
She's the only one that'll sound that way  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
See the old smoke risin' 'round the bend  
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts get the time of day  
From the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
Here she comes, woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-woo  
Hey Jim, you better get out the rig, woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-woo  
She's got a list of passengers that's pretty big  
And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel  
'Cause lots of them been travellin' for quite a spell  
All the way from Philadelphia  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe
