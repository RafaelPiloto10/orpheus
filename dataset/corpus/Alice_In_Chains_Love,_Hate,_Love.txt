I tried to love you I thought I could  
I tried to own you I thought I would  
I want to peel the skin from your face  
Before the real you lays to waste  
You told me I'm the only one  
  
Sweet little angel you should have run  
Lying, crying, dying to leave  
Innocence creates my hell  
  
Cheating myself still you know more  
It would be so easy with a whore  
Try to understand me little girl  
My twisted passion to be your world  
  
Lost inside my sick head  
I live for you but I'm not alive  
Take my hand before I kill  
I still love you, but, I still burn  
  
Yeah, love, hate, love  
Yeah, love, hate, love  
Yeah, love, hate, love  
Oh, Love, hate, love  
Yeah, Love, hate, love
