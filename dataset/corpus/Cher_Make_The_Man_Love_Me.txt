Lord I haven't ask for anything  
In such a long, long time  
Not since that brand new party dress  
When I was eight or nine  
And I know the world's in such a stench  
You got a lot to do  
But if you ever find yourself  
With a minute or two  
Won'tcha please  
  
[Chorus]  
Make the man love me  
Ah make the man see  
I'd be so good for him  
If he'd start letting me  
Come on now  
Make the man love me  
Ah make the man care  
Just open up his heart, Lord  
And I'll take it from there  
  
Lord I know that he needs me  
It's just he don't know  
And my heart so full of him  
It's gonna overflow  
And so if you should have a miracle  
You want to do up right  
Ah won'tcha take him by the hand  
And show him the light  
Won'tcha you please  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I want him  
Lord how I want him  
To make some love to me  
Won'tcha make him see  
How sweet it could be  
So come on come on now  
  
[Chorus]
