the brightest red sweatshirt I ever seen.  
She got an extra large so I wouldn't grow out,  
"That's too big for you!" the other kids would shout.  
But we stuck together, we didn't quit,  
and now the children say, "What a perfect fit."  
  
I love you sweeeeatshirt

I like to rest my hands in your kangaroo pouch,  
it makes them feel comfy like a big soft couch.  
And I don't care if the weather's no good,  
I say "See you later rain" as I pull up my hood.  
Remember that long bus trip when I needed a nap?,  
I used you as a pillow on that Spanish lady's lap.  
I love you sweeeeatshirt red hooded

Oh what is it about you that makes me so jolly?,  
Is it your fifty cotton or your fifty poly?

ohh ohh hoo hoo hoo.  
  
Oh red hooded sweatshirt we been through a lot together like that time I
played in that shirts and skins basketball game and I  
had to take you off and throw you in the corner of the gym. I was midway
through the game and then I saw you looking at me.  
You were staring as if to say "Adam, you suck at basketball, you dribble like
a damn woman." I was so mad I challenged you  
to a game of one on one and you know sweatshirt, even though I beat you 11 to
9, deep in my soul I know you missed those  
lay-ups on purpose. You let me win and that why I'll forever feel this way.
