I'm so young and you're so old  
This, my darling I've been told  
I don't care just what they say  
'Cause forever I will pray  
You and I will be as free  
As the birds up in the trees  
Oh, please, stay by me, Diana.  
  
Thrills I get when you hold me close  
Oh, my darling, you're the most  
I love you but do you love me?  
Oh Diana, can't you see  
I love you with all my heart  
And I hope we will never part  
Oh, please, stay with me, Diana.  
  
Oh my darlin', oh my lover  
Tell me that there is no other  
I love you with my heart.  
  
Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh oh  
  
Only you can take my heart  
Only you can tear it apart  
When you hold me in your loving arms  
I can feel you giving all your charms  
Hold me darling, ho ho hold me tight  
Squeeze me baby with a-all your might  
Oh, please, stay by me Diana.  
  
Oh, please, Diana...
