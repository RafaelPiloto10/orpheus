I feel like a stranger in this home I built for you.  
And I can't understand this awful change you're goin' through.  
And lately I've been watchin' you grow colder everyday.  
And I'd rather be gone than in your way.  
  
I'd rather be gone than in your way.  
I'd rather see someone else here in my place.  
And if I decide on leavin' my world will end today.  
But I'd rather be gone than in your way.  
  
I'd rather be gone than in your way.  
I'd rather see someone else here in my place.  
And if I decide on leavin' my world will end today.  
But I'd rather be gone than in your way.  
I'd rather be gone than in your way.
