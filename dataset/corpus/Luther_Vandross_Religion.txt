It was early Sunday morning  
Everyone in the house was still asleep  
She made some toast and coffee  
Took a shower and made herself smell sweet  
She said, "I don't want a bus ride,  
I believe that the walk might help me think  
Got a heart kind of heavy  
I need some big hat and gloves, shoes and bag religion!"  
  
Religion  
That's my decision  
Some of that "make me feel better when I shout!!!" religion  
That's my decision  
  
Papa Henry was full of spice  
He was a man usually nice  
But something got into him last night  
Made him want to fuss and holler  
The entire house was in a sweat  
His bottle got broken and the floor got wet  
"Clean it up!" you could hear him scream  
Then he said, "I'm going out"  
I need religion  
  
Religion  
That's my decision  
Some of that "raise up the roof, 90 proof" religion  
That's my decision  
Religion  
It's my decision, oh yes it is  
That's my decision  
  
It's the story about a good family  
Who doesn't live anymore in good harmony  
They are people who love their daughter and son  
They try to give them religion  
  
Little Billy likes his best friend Jack  
How in the world could he be like that  
Mama and Henry wanna have that chat  
Boy, you need religion  
  
Little Betty, what'cha gonna do?  
There's a child growing inside of you  
You should've stopped and thought things through  
Little girl you need a vision of religion  
  
Religion  
And that's my decision  
Some of that "how'd I get on Ricky Lake" religion  
That's my decision  
Religion  
Get a little,  
Religion  
Get a little  
Religion
