I like the way you sound in the morning,  
We're on the phone and without a warning  
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard  
  
I like the way I can't keep my focus,  
I watch you talk you didn't notice  
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together  
  
Every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you  
  
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby  
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me  
  
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
Cuz I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall  
  
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face  
You got the keys to me I love each freckle on your face, oh,  
I've never been so wrapped up,  
Honey, I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted  
  
I had time to think it all over and all I can say is come closer,  
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me  
  
Every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you  
  
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby  
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me  
  
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall  
  
The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet  
I'll catch you, I'll catch you  
When people say things that bring you to your knees,  
I'll catch you  
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry  
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile  
  
Whoa oh I need you baby  
Don't be afraid please  
Jump then fall, jump then fall into me  
  
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall  
  
Jump then fall baby  
Jump then fall into me, into me  
  
Every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine  
And every time you're here baby, I'll show you, I'll show you  
You can jump then fall, jump then fall, jump then fall into me, into me  
  
Yeah
