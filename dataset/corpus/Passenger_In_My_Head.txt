I'm so brilliant  
I'm a joke  
My tongue is golden  
I'm about to choke  
And I'm holy  
I'm a wreck  
My voice is velvet  
I have a rope around my neck  
  
I'm so tired of this world in my head  
I am the man that lost  
So tired, so tired of myself  
Am I the man that lost?  
  
I'm a king  
I'm a kick to the curb  
I see things clear  
My world is disturbed  
And I'm a mountain  
Yeah I'm a pile  
I long for tomorrow  
Haven't seen it in a while
