I don't see you through the windshield  
I don't see you in faces looking back at mealcohol doesn't have much that
matters to saycan't imagine where you and time to kill will stay  
  
When the bible is a bottle  
And the hardwood floor is home  
When morning comes twice a day or not at allif I break in two will you put me
back together  
When this puzzle's figured out will you still be around  
To say you've just been there  
Walking the line upside down  
  
Walked and breathed many a cancerous mile  
Where the bat of an eye is too slow to beat the coffin  
They won't tell it on the TV  
They can't say it on the radio  
They pay to move it off the shelf and into our mindsuntil you can't tell the
truth  
When it's right in front of your eyes  
  
When the bible is a bottle  
And the hardwood floor is home  
When morning comes twice a day or not at all  
If I break in two will you put me back together  
When this puzzle's figured out will you still be around  
To say you've just been there  
Walking the line upside down
