Yes I drink away the hurt, and wishing that the ghost would fade away  
There was something more I had to do before you turned and walked away  
Promises broken easily  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Pins and needles climbing up  
The spite of bold cathedrals ever high  
I'm not sure that I could cross this river, I'm not sure I want to try  
Shadows is that's left of you  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Like moths in the night  
Promises broken easily  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Like moths in the night
