See her candle  
Waver in the window of her summer night  
Lying on the breeze  
She tries to fall asleep  
  
Flights of fancy  
Dancing through her memories like Arabian Nights  
He is riding on his wings of fire  
And flies away  
  
She can still hear him say  
If you'll be wise  
If you'll be smart  
Don't let a traveling man take your heart  
  
Take my advice  
Don't let it start  
You'll think you're different from the rest  
You'll try to do your part  
Until he breaks your heart  
  
Lunch for the lonely  
Looking at picture postcards of someone else's scene  
Somehow they don't seem real  
The sea's too green  
  
Somebody calls her  
Giving out information  
About the boy on the moon  
Suddenly it's all too much  
To be told  
What she already knows  
  
If you'll be wise  
If you'll be smart  
Don't let a traveling man take your heart  
Take my advice  
Don't let it start  
Because you've been told too many times  
  
If you'll be wise  
If you'll be smart  
Don't let a traveling man take your heart  
Take my advice  
Don't let it start  
Because you've been told too many times  
  
If you'll be wise  
If you'll be smart  
Don't let a traveling man take your heart  
Take my advice  
Don't let it start  
Because when he comes and needs a friend  
He'll do it all again  
  
Better be smart  
He's breaking your heart  
Find you another lover  
Better be wise  
And open your eyes  
This time
