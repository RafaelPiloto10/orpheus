Baby, there's something I like about you  
You make me feel so wild and free  
I don't know what you've been through  
You're just crazy enough for me  
And when you touch me I come undone  
Do you do that to everyone?  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby me, I'll baby you  
I know that you're a big baby too  
This world is crazy, you need someone to coo  
Baby me and I'll baby you  
Ooh, I'll baby you  
  
It's past my bedtime, I can't sleep alone  
Lay down beside me, I'll pull out the phone  
Take me in your arms and rock me tonight  
I'll tell you a story if you hold me tight  
Cause when you touch me I come undone  
You better not do that to everyone!
