Close your tired eyes, relaxing them  
Count from one to ten and open them  
All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down, but not this time  
  
Way up in the air, you're finally free, and you can stay up there, right next
to me  
All this gravity will try to pull you down, but not this time  
  
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out,  
Then it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than the shooting star, so shine no matter where you are  
Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,  
'Cause it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Brighter than a shooting star,  
Shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
Gazing into my eyes, when the fire starts,  
And fan the flame so hot, it melts our hearts  
All the pouring rain, will try to put it out, but not this time  
  
Let your colors burn, and brightly burst,  
Into a million sparks, but all dispersed and illuminate a world,  
That'll try to bring you down, but not this time  
  
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out,  
Then it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than the shooting star, so shine no matter where you are  
Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,  
'Cause it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Brighter than a shooting star,  
Shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
A thousand heartbeats beating time, and makes this dark planet come alive  
So when the lights flicker out tonight, you gotta shine  
  
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out,  
Then it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than the shooting star, so shine no matter where you are  
Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,  
'Cause it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Brighter than a shooting star,  
Shine no matter where you are, tonight
