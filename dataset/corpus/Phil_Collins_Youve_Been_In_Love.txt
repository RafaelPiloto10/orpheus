You've been in love that little bit too long  
You've been in love and I think that you know  
You've been in love it's time to move on  
You've been in love and it's starting to show  
  
She's getting to used to your face, getting too used to your smile  
She's saying the same things every morning before you leave her  
  
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind  
You'd better look out, cos he's not far behind  
You've been in love that little bit too long  
You've been in love and I think that you know  
You've been in love it's time to move on  
You've been in love and it's starting to show  
  
Suddenly she's trying to please you, you start to think she's acting strange  
And after all these years she wears make-up in the morning  
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind  
You'd better look out, cos he's not far behind  
  
Did you really believe she's doing it all for you?  
Oh, can't you see, there's somebody else  
You never showed it, you should have known it  
  
You've been in love, yeah you've been in love  
You've been in love, yeah you've been in love  
  
Going round singing all those love songs, songs you haven't heard for years  
You're gonna have to ask her why she's so happy  
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind.  
But it may be too late, and I know why  
  
You've been in love that little bit too long  
You've been in love and I think that you know  
You've been in love it's time to move on  
You've been in love and it's starting to show  
You've been in love that little bit too long  
You've been in love, I think that you know  
You've been in love it's time to move on  
You've been in love and it's starting to show  
To show, show, you've been in love, oh oh  
  
(I've got blisters on my fingers!)
