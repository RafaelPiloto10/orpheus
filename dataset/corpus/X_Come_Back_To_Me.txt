He was born with a six - string  
Not a shotgun in his hand  
And he walked across the water  
To reach the promised land  
  
And he searched for the future  
For the meaning of our lives  
Hearing echoes in the distance  
Telling love's so hard to find  
  
Catch the storm  
Don't wait until the dawn  
Catch the storm  
Without you I feel so sad,  
Feel so sad  
  
There were endless days and nights  
Where our love turned into ice  
But the flame's inside still burnin'  
Broken dreams in paradise  
  
We called the eyes of the rainbow  
To free us from our sins  
We searched the night for all lost promises  
A fight we couldn't win
