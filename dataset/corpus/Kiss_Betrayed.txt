You pay your taxes, you pay the rent, till you haven't got a cent  
It's the law of the jungle, if you got the hunger  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Just hold on to what you got (hold on, hold on), just live it to the last drop  
You can't help it, you just can't stop  
  
Betrayed, yeah, life's a bitch, so just don't feel  
Betrayed, no, you ain't the only one who's been betrayed, betrayed  
  
Stone cold and all alone, and you're wearin' everything you own  
They bare your flesh and strip your soul, but underneath you got a heart of
gold  
Just hold on to what you got (hold on, hold on)  
  
Betrayed, you ain't satisfied, I know you feel betrayed  
You ain't crucified, so get real, betrayed, betrayed  
  
All alone, far from home, and you're feelin' cold as stone  
Don't give up, don't give in, life's a bitch if you lose or win  
  
Betrayed - yeah, you ain't the only one who's been  
Betrayed - life's a bitch, if you lose or win - betrayed, betrayed , betrayed,
betrayed
