It took a while for me to know  
What I was looking for  
And every heart I've ever known  
Has left me wanting more  
  
One good love  
Can turn it all around  
Take hold of a restless heart  
Lead it back to solid ground  
  
You can search the world for happiness  
And never get enough  
When all you really need to find  
Is one good love  
  
I followed all of life's pleasures  
Wherever they will be  
But someone I can treasure  
Is all I really need  
  
One good love  
Can turn it all around  
Take hold of a restless heart  
And lead it back to solid ground  
  
One good love  
Can take you to the light  
With just one touch you can forget  
A thousand empty nights  
  
You can search the world for happiness  
And never get enough  
And all you really need to find  
Is one good love  
  
You can search the world for happiness  
And never get enough  
And all you really need to find  
Is one good love  
  
One good Love
