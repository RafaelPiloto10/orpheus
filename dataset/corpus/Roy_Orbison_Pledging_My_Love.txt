Forever my darling our love will be true  
Always and forever I'll love only you  
Just promise me darling your love in return  
May this fire in my soul dear, forever burn  
  
[Chorus:]  
My heart's at your command dear  
To keep love, and to hold  
Making you happy is my desire dear  
Keeping you is my goal  
  
I'll forever love you  
For the rest of my days  
I'll never part from you  
Or your loving ways  
Just promise me darling your love in return  
May this fire in my soul dear forever burn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll forever love you  
For the rest of my days  
I'll never part from you  
Or your loving ways  
Just promise me darling your love in return  
May this fire in my soul dear forever burn
