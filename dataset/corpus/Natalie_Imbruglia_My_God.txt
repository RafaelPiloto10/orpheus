I'm Feelin' kind of strange  
I'm feelin' kind of jammed up and out of the way  
I know it's all deranged  
And now that's gonna give 'til I'm out of this place  
Look at the horizon  
Want it to the one where is flawless  
I'm gonna take your time  
I wanna wonder if you float while the sea is rising  
  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know the way you make me feel  
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go  
Here we go again  
  
My god  
Your face is so beautiful  
My god  
I see you so clear  
If I could stay with you  
Oh my god  
I'll give my soul  
There's nothing else my god  
Don't you leave me here  
  
You're looking for a flower  
You're looking for a flower but you find a tree  
I'm looking for a river  
And suddenly an ocean's washing over me  
  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know the way you make me feel  
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go  
Here we go again  
  
My god  
Your face is so beautiful  
My god  
I see you so clear  
If I could stay with you  
Oh my god  
I'll give my soul  
There's nothing else my god  
  
I wanted to know you  
Wanted to see you  
Wanted to feel you  
Should've believed you  
Wanted to hold you  
Wanted to show you  
Wanted to be you, be you  
  
My god  
Face is so beautiful  
My god  
I see you so clear  
If I could stay with you  
Oh my god  
I'll give my soul  
There's nothing else my god  
Don't you leave me here
