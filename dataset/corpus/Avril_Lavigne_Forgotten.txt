Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
I'm giving up on everything  
Because you messed me up  
  
Don't know how much you  
You screwed it up  
You never listened  
That's just too bad  
  
Because I'm moving on  
I won't forget  
You were the one that was wrong  
I know I need to step up and be strong  
  
Don't patronize me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you forgotten  
Everything that I wanted  
Do you forget it now  
You never got It  
Do you get it now  
Yea yea yea yea yea  
  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
  
Gotta get away  
There's no point in thinking about yesterday  
  
It's too late now  
It won't ever be the same  
We're so different now  
Yea yea yea yea yea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know I want to run away  
I know I want to run away  
Run away  
  
If only I could run away  
If only I could run away  
Run away  
  
I told you what i wanted I  
I told you what i wanted  
What I wanted  
  
But I was forgotten  
I won't be forgotten  
Never Again  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah
