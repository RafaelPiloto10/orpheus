You want the truth  
Here it is  
  
Manufactured  
Is this hop pop industry  
I know  
Cause they tried to do it to me  
Don't you let them  
Take away your eyes  
Be who you are and stop the sweet talk of lies  
  
Bridge:  
And you never gonna see me lipsynch  
And you never gonna see me try to cheat  
Cause I'm not the one who wont break it down  
Follow me, people see that I'm gonna below the roof of of this town  
  
Chorus:  
Tired of the clothes that look like me  
Tired of you people sayin "Britney"  
Tired of the pop that's a flop  
That should never be  
On tv and in your teen magazines  
Tired of the crap I take each day  
Tryin to do my song, tryin to do it my way  
Tired of the pop that's a flop  
That should never be  
On tv and in your teen magazines  
  
Shame  
It's the game you play for fame  
But give it some time  
You won't remember their names  
Some you will, some you won't  
Their the one hit wonder remedies  
Who cannot sing a note  
Bridge  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Yeah yeah 4x  
  
It's the same old game  
Over and over  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus 2x
