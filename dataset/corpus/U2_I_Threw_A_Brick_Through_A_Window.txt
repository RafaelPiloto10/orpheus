I was talking  
I was talking to myself  
Somebody else  
Talk talk talking  
I couldn't hear a word  
A word you said  
  
He was my brother  
I said there was no other  
Way out of here  
Be my brother  
Gotta get out  
Gotta get out  
  
I was walking  
I was walking into walls  
I'm back again  
I just keep walking  
I walk into a window  
To see myself  
And my reflection  
When I thought about it  
My direction  
Going nowhere  
Going nowhere  
  
No one...no one is blinder  
Than he who will not see  
No one...no one is blinder  
Than me  
  
I was talking  
I was talking in my sleep  
I can't stop talking  
I'm talking to you  
It's up to you  
  
Be my brother  
There is another way out of here  
In my brother  
Gotta get out  
Gotta get out  
Gotta get out of here
