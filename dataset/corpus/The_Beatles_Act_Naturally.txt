They're gonna put me in the movies  
They're gonna make a big star out of me  
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely  
And all I gotta do is act naturally  
  
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star  
Might win an Oscar you can never tell  
The movies gonna make me a big star  
'Cause I can play the part so well  
  
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies  
Then I know that you will plainly see  
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time  
And all I gotta do is act naturally  
  
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely  
And beggin' down upon his bended knee  
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal  
All I gotta do is act naturally  
  
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star  
Might win an Oscar you can never tell  
The movies gonna make me a big star  
'Cause I can play the part so well  
  
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies  
Then I know that you will plainly see  
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time  
And all I gotta do is act naturally
