Feel it in your kiss  
And I can see it in the stars  
I don't believe in magic  
But I know just who you are  
I'm not gonna leave you  
Cause you've giving me a reason to stay, to stay, to stay...  
  
Feel it in your kiss  
And I can see it in the stars  
I don't believe in magic  
But I know just who you are  
I'm not gonna leave you  
Cause you've giving me a reason to stay, to stay, to stay...  
  
Feel it in your kiss  
And I can see it in the stars  
I don't believe in magic  
But I know just who you are  
I'm not gonna leave you  
Cause you've giving me a reason to stay, to stay, to stay...  
  
In my mind  
We belong together  
In your eyes  
I believe in,  
I can see forever  
  
Feel it in your kiss  
And I can see it in the stars  
I don't believe in magic  
But I know just who you are  
I'm not gonna leave you  
Cause you've giving me a reason to stay, to stay, to stay...  
  
Feel it in your kiss  
And I can see it in the stars  
I don't believe in magic  
But I know just who you are  
I'm not gonna leave you  
Cause you've giving me a reason to stay, to stay, to stay...  
  
I can feel it  
I can feel it  
I can feel it  
I can feel it... (Stay)  
  
I want you to stay  
  
Feel it in your kiss  
And I can see it in the stars  
I don't believe in magic  
But I know just who you are (I can feel it)  
I'm not gonna leave you  
Cause you're giving me a reason (I can feel it ) to stay,  
To stay... (I can feel it)
