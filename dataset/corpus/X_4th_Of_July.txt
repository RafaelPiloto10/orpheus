She's waitin' for me  
When I get home from work  
Oh, but things ain't just the same  
She turns out the light  
And cries in the dark  
Won't answer when I call her name  
  
On the stairs I smoke a  
Cigarette alone  
Mexican kids are shootin'  
Fireworks below  
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July  
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July  
  
She gives me her cheek  
When I want her lips  
But I don't have the strength to go  
On the lost side of town  
In a dark apartment  
We gave up trying so long ago  
  
On the stairs I smoke a  
Cigarette alone  
Mexican kids are shootin'  
Fireworks below  
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July  
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July  
  
What ever happened I  
Apologize  
So dry your tears and baby  
Walk outside, it's the Fourth of July  
  
On the stairs I smoke a  
Cigarette alone  
Mexican kids are shootin'  
Fireworks below  
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July  
Hey baby, Baby take a walk outside
