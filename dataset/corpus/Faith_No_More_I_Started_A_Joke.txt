I started a joke, which started the whole world crying,  
Oh but I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no.  
  
And I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing,  
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.  
  
And I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes,  
And I fell out of bed, cursing my head from things that I'd said.  
  
Til I finally died, which started the whole world living,  
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.  
  
And I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes,  
And I fell out of bed, cursing my head from things that I'd said.  
  
'Til I finally died, which started the whole world living,  
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was one me.
