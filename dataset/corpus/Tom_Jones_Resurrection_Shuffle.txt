Who who  
Twist yourself further from the middle of the floor  
Throw a little kiss to the woman next door  
Step on the gas put your hand in the air  
Make a V-sign and you throw back your hair  
Think about nothin' now you're nice and high  
You're advocating love but you don't know why  
Now you're getting vibrations all down to your feet  
That's the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection beat  
  
Put your hand on your hips  
Now you let your backbone slip  
Put out your tongue, put your hand in the air  
Make a V sign you just don't care  
Now you feel free you gotta lose control  
All Gods children got a little bit of soul  
You don't have to think you don't have to move a muscle  
To do the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection shuffle  
  
Alright  
Oh here we go again  
Oh that's it you're doin' it  
Alright  
  
You Think about nothin' now you're nice and high  
You're advocating love but you dont know why  
You're getting vibrations all down to your feet  
That's the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection beat  
  
Here we go  
Put your hand on your hip  
You gotta let your backbone slip  
Put out your tongue, put your hand in the air  
Make a V sign like you just don't care  
Now you feel free you gotta lose control  
  
All Gods children got some soul  
You don't have to think you don't have to move a muscle  
To do the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection shuffle  
  
You doin' alright  
This is gonna last you for years and years and it alright  
You doin' alright, don't get uptight  
Uh-huh yea, that sounds alright, um-hum  
Do do n do do do
