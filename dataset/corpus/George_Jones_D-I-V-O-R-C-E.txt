Our little boy is four years old  
And quite a little man  
So we spell out the words  
We don't want him to understand  
Like T-O-Y or maybe S-you-are P-are-I-S-E  
But the words we're hiding from him now  
Tear the heart right out of me.  
  
Our D-I-V-O-are-C-E, becomes final today  
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away  
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me  
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-C-E.  
  
Watch him smile, he thinks it Christmas  
Or his 5th Birthday  
And he thinks C-you-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play  
I spell out all the hurtin' words  
And turn my head when I speak  
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt  
That's drippin' down my cheek.  
  
Our D-I-V-O-are-C-E, becomes final today  
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away  
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me  
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-C-E...
