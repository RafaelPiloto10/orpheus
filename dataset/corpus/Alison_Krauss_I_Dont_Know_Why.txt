I don't know why the sky is so blue  
I don't know why I'm so in love with you  
If there were no music, I would not get through  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do  
  
I don't know why somewhere dreams come true  
I don't know where we'll find a place for you  
Every time you look that way I lay down my life for you  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do  
  
I don't know why sun can make you cry  
I don't know how I'm bound to get you back, but I'll try  
They don't mean to cause you pain, they're just afraid of loving you  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do  
  
I don't know why the trees grow so tall  
I don't know why I don't know anything at all  
If there were no music, I would not get through  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do, I do  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do
