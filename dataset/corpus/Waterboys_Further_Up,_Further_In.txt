I dreamed the wind came to my house  
These are the words fell from his mouth  
"The King you seek you'll find him true  
But only if he rides the road with you"  
I stepped aboard a ship that flew  
It took me to wherever it wanted to  
Far above the land, far above the sea  
The dreamer and the doer agreed to agree  
I was sent to the war, stripped of my power  
Gagged and imprisoned in a tall dark tower  
I must have cried for an age or more  
'till I saw through tears and I found the door  
High on a cliff, in gorgeous clothes  
A madman danced on the balls of his toes  
Forgetting myself I fell at the feet  
Of the greatest Fool I ever did meet  
The stars were bright and magic afoot  
On the Summer wind rose the sound of a flute  
I saw the musician - my heart knew him well  
What happens next, no rhyme can tell  
We came to the end of the world one day  
A dolphin swan in a sheltered bay  
I paid to the King what it was I owed,  
Put my face to the wind and my foot on the road  
I find I've wandered far from home  
But home is in me wherever I roam  
I thought I was an hour or a year behind  
But the hours and the years are only time
