When I look into the mirror  
Just can't believe, what do I see  
There's no wakin' from this nightmare  
And you're lost in your reality  
  
So you tell me all your secrets  
And you tell me that you're innocent  
There's something in your eyes I can see  
And my face keeps looking back at me  
  
You Confess  
You can't help yourself  
This living lie that you can't go on  
You're possessed  
You can't fool yourself  
You're the crime and you can't go on  
  
Another day, another sorrow  
No today and no tomorrow  
Try and wash away the shame  
And you smile in your picture frame  
  
You had a charmed life, but you think from grace  
And you're long gone without a trace  
You're all alone and wonder why  
And you laugh when you want to cry  
  
You Confess  
You can't help yourself  
This living lie that you can't go on  
You're possessed  
You can't fool yourself  
You're the crime and you can't go on  
  
You Confess  
You can't help yourself  
This living lie that you can't go on  
You're possessed  
You can't fool yourself  
You're the crime and it can't go on  
It can't go on  
  
God never spoke to me about your sin  
So livin' in our lies will test the faith  
So cut your straight lines on the mirror  
And dip your hands in holy water  
Try and wash away the shame  
'cause all you've got is your father's name  
(repeat choruses)
