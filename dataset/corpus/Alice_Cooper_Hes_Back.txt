You're with your baby  
And you're parked alone  
On a summer night  
You're deep in love  
But you're deeper in the woods  
You think you're doin' alright  
  
You heard a voice  
Did you see that face  
Or was it just a dream  
It can't be real  
That only happens, babe  
On the movie screen  
  
If you see him comin'  
Get away if you can  
He's a dangerous man  
Throws a dangerous party man  
  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
He's going out tonight  
Going to make his rounds to get his fill  
Standing staight and tall  
He's a ton of fun  
And he's dressed to kill  
  
You know you read he was gone  
It surely is him  
But he's back on the prowl  
Again and again and again  
  
Don't you know  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
You know you read he was gone  
It surely is him  
But he's back on the prowl  
Again and again and again  
  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
He's back
