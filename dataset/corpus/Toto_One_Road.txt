Time, is the enemy of a young man's dreams  
I'm stranded, in the heartland, or so it seems  
  
I'm hitching a ride for a chance at the good life  
I'll have my own place, out on fifth avenue  
I'm leavin' this time gonna walk on that fine line  
I'll be the first one who finally breaks through  
  
One road to the promised land  
I have to get there any way I can  
One road to the promised land  
Gonna find out just who I am  
  
Freedom, do you know what I mean  
Flatlands, are all I've ever seen  
  
Stuck in a small town where you live, then you die  
Ain't nothin' but fool's workin' nine until five  
I'll sleep in the subways till I get what I need  
I'm not gonna stay here, just lie here and bleed  
  
One road to the promised land  
I'm gonna get there any way I can  
One road to the promised land  
Show the world just who I am  
  
One road to the promised land  
I thought by now I'd be a different man  
One road to the promised land  
Guess I found out, just who I am
