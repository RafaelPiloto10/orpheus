Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart  
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart  
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips  
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong  
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong  
Losing you It's a nightmare, babe, and to me it's new  
Never before did you see me begging for more  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
(I'm at the point of no returning)  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
(Caught in a land-slide of emotions)  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions
