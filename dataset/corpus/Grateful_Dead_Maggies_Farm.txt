Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Wake up in the morning, fold my hands, pray for rain  
Got a head full of ideas, that are drivin' me insane  
It's a shame the way they makes me scrub the floor  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
Hands you a nickel, hands you a dime  
Asks you with a grin if you're havin' a good time  
Then he fines you every time you slam the door  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
Well, she talks to the servants about man and God and law  
Everybody knows she's the brains behind pa  
She's sixty eight, says she's twenty four  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's father no more  
He puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks  
Bedroom window is made out of bricks  
The national guard hangs 'round his door  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's father no more  
  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Try my level best to be just like I am  
Everybody wants me to be just like them  
They sing while you slave and I just get bored  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
