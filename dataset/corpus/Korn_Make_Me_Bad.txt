I am watching the rise  
And fall of my salvation  
There's so much shit around me  
Such a lack of compassion  
  
I thought it would be fun and games  
(it would be fun and games)  
Instead it's all the same  
(it's all the same)  
I want something to do  
Need to feel the sickness in you  
  
I feel the reason, as it's leaving me  
No, not again  
It's quite deceiving, as I'm feeling  
The flesh make me bad  
  
All I do is look for you  
And when I fix you needed to  
  
Just to get some sort of attention, attention  
  
What does it mean to you  
For me, it's something I just do  
I want something  
I need to feel the sickness in you  
  
I feel the reason, as it's leaving me  
No, not again  
It's quite deceiving, as I'm feeling  
The flesh make me bad
