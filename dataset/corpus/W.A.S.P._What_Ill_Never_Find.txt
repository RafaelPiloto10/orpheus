[BIlly to Jesse]  
  
Time to go away  
Down a road I cannot hide  
Will I have no name  
For destiny's I cannot find  
Will I wander alone  
Forever's lonely road of time  
Am I looking for what  
I'll never find  
  
Did you call my name  
I will be leaving from this dream  
Can you feel the pain  
Slowly leaving me  
Will you hold my hand  
And ease me to the other side  
Am I looking for what  
I'll never find  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me in the night  
Will you feel me  
If you leave me will I cry?  
Can you hear me  
Can you feel me say goodbye
