It was the summer of 793  
When we sailed across the Great North Sea  
Comets crossed the skies that night  
Must have known something wasn't right  
  
We arrived upon your English shore  
And you offered friendship  
But we wanted more  
Yeah, so much more!  
  
We're tearing up this place tonight  
Literally!  
We're gonna set this sleepy town alight  
Literally!  
We'll kill and steal and burn and drink  
'Cause us vikings don't care what you think  
Woah oh oh!  
  
Let me in, won't you please  
We're here to raid your monasteries  
We're primed and ready to attack  
And we love how monks just don't fight back  
  
You'll die or become a slave to me  
Though our slaves often get chucked up in the sea  
If the boat's heavy! Yeah, yeah!  
  
You're gonna lose your head, my friend  
Literally!  
We're gonna getcha in the end  
Literally!  
And I'll drink a toast from your skull  
'Cause we're vikings and that's how we roll!  
  
(Play that axe, Ragnor!)  
  
We're gonna paint the whole town red  
Literally!  
With the blood of the dead  
Literally!  
We'll take everything that you own  
And get back on our ship, and go back home  
Woah, oh oh!  
  
We're going home  
Woah, oh oh!  
We're going home  
Woah, oh oh!  
We are going home  
Woah, oh oh!  
We are going home  
Woah, oh oh!
