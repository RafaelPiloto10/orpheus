From this moment on you and me dear  
Only two for tea dear from this moment on  
From this happy day no more blue songs  
Only hoopty-do songs from this moment on  
For you got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
You got the sweet lips to kiss me good night  
From this moment on, you and I babe  
We'll be riding high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment on
