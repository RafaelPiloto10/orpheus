Why should it be,  
Someone like me could make the same mistakes again.  
Haven't I learned,  
People get hurt,  
When they go diving in the deep end  
In the deep end,  
In the deep end,  
In the deep end.  
Thought I was smart,  
Controlling the art, of turning off my intuition  
Haven't I seen, since I was fourteen.  
That life is all just repitition  
You lose or you win,  
You sink or you swim,  
When you go diving in the deep end,  
In the deep end,  
In the deep end,  
In the deep end.  
Now it's time to realise,  
You don't have to agonise  
You don't have to compromise  
But the one thing you must do  
Is open your eyes  
Your eyes,  
Your eyes.  
Why should it be,  
Someone like me could make the same mistakes again.  
Haven't I learned,  
People get hurt,  
When they go diving,  
Diving, diving (fade).
