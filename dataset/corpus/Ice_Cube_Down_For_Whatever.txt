Damn.  
I'm broke.  
My feet hurt.  
(Inside the mind of a car jacker)  
And that bitch is slippin'.  
It makes me wanna, creep.  
It makes me wanna, creep.  
  
Damn I'm such a G it's pathetic  
Here comes the big headed  
Nigga that's dippin'  
Sippin' on Courvoisier  
Goddamn I must havta floss today  
Now pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary  
So I'm chasin' bitches like Tom chased Jerry  
I'll put the pedal to the flo-uh  
In my two-tone Ford Explo-uh  
You know how it's done  
Sounds bumpin  
Ain't that somethin'?  
Jumped on the 110  
She's flyin' in the Blazer  
Like "Go Speed Racer"  
But I ain't gonna chase her  
Like Racer X  
But I won't flex  
Til it's time to have sex  
So when you want to get together?  
Cause you know a nigga like me  
Is down for whatever  
  
And I'm down for whatever  
  
When I was little I didn't want to be like Mike  
I wanted to be like Ike  
Cause  
Papa Was A Rolling Stone in the sixties  
And he liked green like Bill Bixby  
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty  
Pokets never skinny  
Played let's get it on in the living room  
And hwne he gets drunk you better give him room  
Cause he'll turn the party out sayin', "This is my motherfuckin' house"  
And y'all gots to go  
Through the door  
And if you can't find the door  
He'll help you with the four-four  
Talkin' much shit on the grass  
And straight down to blast  
I'm still in my p.j.'s  
He's in a turtleneck sweater  
And we down for whatever  
  
And I'm down  
Solid Pro is down for whatever  
The Don Jaguar is down for whatever  
And it don't seem to stop  
  
Now  
I don't talk a lot of shit  
But when it's time to get busy with these hos, let's go  
Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead  
Then my niggas wearin' blue or red  
Cause I got the gift  
To hit these hos swift  
And I'm smellin' like a fifth  
Of somethin'  
Yeah, that's right  
I'm standin' in the store  
Koreans  
Act so nice  
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells  
Doughnut  
And you know what?  
I'm Cool Like That like Digable Planets  
But don't take a nigga for granted  
Cause whether it's a verdict of the L.A. four  
You just don't know  
That this rappin'-ass nigga will change with the weather  
And be down for whatever  
  
And I'm down  
Creep.  
And I'm down for whatever  
  
Ice Cube, devoid of pop  
And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas  
  
It makes me wanna, creep.  
It makes me wanna, creep.
