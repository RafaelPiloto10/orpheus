Alright,  
Now dig this, baby  
  
You don't care for me  
I don'-a care about that  
Gotta new fool, ha!  
I like it like that  
  
I have only one burning desire  
Let me stand next to your fire  
Let me stand next to your fire (Repeat 4 times)  
  
Listen here, baby  
And stop acting so crazy  
You say your mum ain't home,  
It ain't my concern,  
Just play with me and you won't get burned  
  
I have only one itching desire  
Let me stand next to your fire  
Let me stand next to your fire (Repeat 4 times)  
  
Oh! Move over, Rover  
And let Jimi take over  
Yeah, you know what I'm talking 'bout  
Yeah, get on with it, baby  
That's what I'm talking 'bout  
Now dig this!  
Ha!  
Now listen, baby  
  
You try to gimme your money  
You better save it, babe  
Save it for your rainy day  
I have only one burning desire  
Let me stand next to your fire  
Let me stand next to your fire
