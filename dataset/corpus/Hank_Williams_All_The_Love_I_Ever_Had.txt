One time you know, I loved you true  
There was nothing I wouldn't do  
But you have treated me so bad  
You killed all the love I ever had  
You leave me alone and run around  
You were the talk of the town  
It made you glad to see me sad  
You killed all the love I ever had  
No one knows the torture I went through  
Loving you and knowing you were untrue  
It's over now and I'm so glad  
You killed all the love I ever had  
All these years I've sat and cried  
A thousand times my poor soul died  
You have treated me so bad  
You killed all the love I ever had
