My life is in a serious mess,  
My baby is gone, there's heavy mental stress  
I never knew love but I know it now,  
I want to give her my heart, but how how  
  
I never knew love but I know it now,  
I want to give her my heart, but how how  
How How  
  
Maybe I should buy her a beautiful dress,  
Maybe gold and diamonds, and no more stress  
I decide to call her, it drives me insane,  
Then she's on the line and tells me "Don't be vain"  
  
I decide to call her, it drives me insane,  
But then she's on the line and tells me I take the blame  
You ? little fool and you know what I miss,  
No diamonds, no gold, just a kiss  
Just a kiss  
  
I got nothing to lose so I know it doesn't matter,  
I do it the old way and write her a letter  
I know how much I love you and I need you now,  
You're the one and only and you tell me how  
  
Now I'm out of trouble and a serious mess,  
My baby is back, no more stress  
You know how much I love you and I need you now,  
I'll give you my heart, just tell me how how  
How how
