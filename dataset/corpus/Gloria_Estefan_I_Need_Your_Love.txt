Something deep inside of me  
Keeps holding on to your memory  
How I've tried to find someone new  
But everywhere I look it's you that I see  
Don't you know that my whole life has changed  
I can't look at the past without feeling the pain  
And at night all alone I just cry  
And I hope, and I pray you'll be  
Back by my side  
  
I need your love  
Every day seems forever without you  
I need your love  
Tell me that you'll come back to me  
All my friends tell me  
I'll be ok  
That someday i'll forget you  
And i'll love once again  
  
But someday seems so far away  
And I know I won't make it without you in the end  
Tell me how can I go on this way  
Knowing that someone else could be  
Taking my place  
Tell me where in the world would I be  
If I wake up each morning and you're not here with me  
  
I need your love  
Everyday seems forever without you  
I need your love  
Tell me that you'll come back to me  
I need your love  
Every day seems forever without you  
I need your love  
Tell me that you'll come back to me  
I need your love  
Every day seems forever without you  
I need your love  
Tell me that you'll come back to love me
