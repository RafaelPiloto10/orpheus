Time goes between us, and there's no release  
Silent ref'rence to defenses raised higher  
Than we'll ever need  
The more we try, flame inside gets colder to the touch  
Taking for granted, gets taken for granted too much  
  
So come on and move me  
Let me feel you move me  
Prove me wrong, show me I still belong  
Come on and move me  
Let me feel you move me like you used to  
  
She never asked anything of me  
That I could ever be  
Now we're lyin' in the shade  
Sharpenin' the blades of our rivalry  
Untidy lies, they could never disguise  
The truth behind the door  
Feelin's grow nearer, then disappear again some more  
  
So come on and move me  
Let me feel you move me  
Prove me wrong,s how me I still belong  
Come on and move me  
Let me feel you move me like you used to  
  
There can be no contention, come on and move me  
Let me feel you move me  
Prove me wrong, show me I still belong  
Come on and move me  
Let me feel you move me like you used to  
Move me, come on.
