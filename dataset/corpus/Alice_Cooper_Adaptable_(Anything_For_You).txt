If you were Lucy  
I'd be your Ricky  
When you were juicy  
I'd get real sticky  
And when you're magic  
It makes me tricky, too  
  
Yeah, I'm a Sony  
You're Panasonic  
I'm heavy metal  
You're philharmonic  
If you get earaches  
I'd turn my volume down  
A notch or two for you  
  
'Cause I will do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
I'm so adaptable to you  
Was untrappable 'til you  
  
I will do for you  
Anything for you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you  
  
If you do that fold out  
I'll scream and holler  
But when you hold out  
I'll spend three dollars  
One way or other, babe  
I'll spend the night with you  
That's true  
  
Now, you ain't no Hepburn  
And I ain't no Fonda  
But if you were drownin'  
In Golden Ponda  
Mouth to mouth  
I'd resuscitate with you  
  
Because I'm so adaptable to you  
Anything you want me to  
I'm so adaptable to you  
Was untrappable 'til you  
  
I will do for you  
Anything for you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you  
So plug me into you  
  
Say you're Vampira  
And needed plasma  
And I was dying  
From chronic asthma  
I'd leave my death bed  
To draw some blood for you  
Just for you  
  
Because I will do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
And I will do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
Yes, I'm so adaptable to you  
Leave a craps table for you  
On a winning streak  
  
I will do for you  
Anything for you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you
