Mustang Sally, think you better slow your mustang down  
Mustang Sally, think you better slow your mustang down  
You been running all over the town now  
Oh! I guess I'll have to put your flat feet on the ground  
  
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride  
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride  
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride  
  
One of these early mornings, oh, you gonna be wiping your weeping eyes  
I bought you a brand new mustang 'bout nineteen sixty five  
Now you come around signifying a woman, you don't want to let me ride  
Mustang Sally, think you better slow your mustang down  
You been running all over the town now  
Oh! I guess I'll have to put your flat feet on the ground  
  
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride  
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride  
All you want to do is ride around Sally, ride, Sally, ride
