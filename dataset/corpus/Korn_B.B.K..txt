So you've seen I've gotten this far.  
Please give me some place to worry.  
I'm not trying to go there, so take me away.  
Life sometimes pisses me off.  
It's never a good trip for me  
Every time I reach for love, it's taken away.  
Night! So I play.  
  
Give me a sign this is day.  
Give me some patience, so I pray.  
It's time to die. Is that what I want?  
There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved.  
Is there something wrong with me?  
Once in my life I'd like to be really set free.  
  
Let me be me.  
Night! So I play.  
Give me a sign this is day.  
Give me some guidance, so I pray.  
It's time to die. Is that what I want?  
  
Take me away.  
Taken away.  
Take me away.  
Taken away.  
  
Something I get, I got to get home  
Run, run, run, run, run, run running home  
Where is my home  
Night! So I play.  
Give me a sign this is day.  
Give me some patience, so I pray.  
It's time to die. Is that what I want?  
  
Night! So I play.  
Give me a sign this is day.  
Give me some guidance, so I pray.  
It's time to die. Is that what I want?
