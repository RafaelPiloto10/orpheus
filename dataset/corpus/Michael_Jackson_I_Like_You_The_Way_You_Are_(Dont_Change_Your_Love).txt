  
Oh, stop don't change that smile honey  
That you wear up on your face  
Take it up with makeup girl  
I just know you're in the place  
When I look at you  
All my dreams come true  
My future, girl, in you I see  
You've always been for real  
And that's good enough for me.  
  
I like you the way you are, girl  
Baby don't change your love on me  
I like you the way you are, girl  
Baby don't change your love on me  
Don't change  
Don't change  
Don't change, ooh baby  
Just be yourself  
  
Oh, stop don't change the recipe honey  
What a sweet, sweet love you make  
Believe me girl that losing you  
Would be much than I could take  
Your loving I got used to I need it bad  
Don't give me girl no substitute  
I'm begging you please don't change your love on me  
  
Oh, I like you the way you are, girl  
Baby don't change your love on me  
I like you the way you are, girl  
Baby don't change your love on me  
Don't change  
Baby don't change it  
Baby don't change it  
Baby don't change it  
Baby don't change it  
Baby don't change it...  
Just be yourself  
  
Oh, I like you the way you are, girl  
Baby don't change your love on me  
I like you the way you are, girl  
Baby don't change your love on me  
Baby don't change it  
Baby don't change it...
