Six cheap people in an empty hotel  
Every last one with a story to tell  
Give them all pills, so their heads won't swell  
We were borne to a woman whose husband did quite well  
  
Oh sunshine, shone brightly  
Through my window today  
Could have tripped out quite easy but i decided to stay  
Hold out your hand said whitey with the blame  
Gonna bring you up so you really dig the pain  
Take you under my wings so you'll never be the same  
'cause your wife is so much older and both her legs are lame  
A sunbeam shone brightly through my window today  
Could have gone 20 miles but i decided to stay  
  
All my flock has packed up and flocked back to hell  
Open up the windows so the place don't start to smell  
Carry on with what your doing 'cause you don't to it that well  
I've been umpteen different people and no one else can tell  
  
Sunshine shone brightly through my asshole today  
Could have tripped out quite easy but i decided to stay  
To stay a while  
Come up and see me make me smile  
Come up and see me make me smile
