As I wake up in the morning on life's big roller coaster  
Looking for the devil in disguise  
As I look into the haze and maze and the lightning and the thunder  
I hope an angel's on my side,  
On my side  
  
Cause time, time, time don't give a damn about tomorrow,  
Time (background singers)  
Time don't really care about no yesterdays,  
Time (background singers)  
Time is only watching all the pain we bear  
All of the joy we share  
Do we care  
Time to wonder  
  
As I look at all the faces, I've just got to stop and wonder  
What are we searching for  
Everybody spys and lies and tries to talk about the future  
As we're marching off to war  
Anybody keeping score  
Oh yeah  
  
Cause time, time, time don't give a damn about tomorrow  
Time, (background singers)  
Time don't really care about no yesterdays,  
Time (background singers),  
Time is only watching all the pain we bear  
All of the joy we share  
Do we care  
Time to wonder  
  
Take a look around at all the time we wasted  
Take a look around and know that you're just passing through  
When you find the truth that lies inside the darkness  
Will it ever come to be that you'll find the key  
That will set you free, that will set you free, that will set you free  
It's only time  
Time to wonder  
It's time to wonder  
Oh yeah, it's time to wonder  
  
What are you going to do with your life?  
Time (background singers)  
What are you going to do with the time that you're living in?  
Time (background singers)  
It's time to wonder, it's time to wonder, it's time to wonder, it's time to
wonder
