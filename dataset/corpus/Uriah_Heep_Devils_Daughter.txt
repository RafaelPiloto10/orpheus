I don't believe in  
Your kind of affection  
Your taking me  
In the wrong direction  
Don't give me none of  
That holy water  
Comin' on like you're  
The Devil's daughter  
  
Just take me to your chapel  
Show me to your leader  
Take me to your chapel  
I want to meet your leader  
Come on  
  
How do you find the time to exist  
I've got to keep my  
Strength of mind to resist  
Don't give me none of  
That holy water  
Comin' on like you're  
The Devil's daughter  
  
Where do you come from  
And where do you go  
Can I touch without havin' to know  
Don't give me none of  
That holy water  
Comin' on like you're  
The Devil's daughter  
  
Come on now  
Come on now take me there
