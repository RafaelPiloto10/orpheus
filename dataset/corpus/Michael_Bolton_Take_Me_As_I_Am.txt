Woman, you don't understand  
Oh, I'm just a man  
Baby, that's all I am  
That's all I have ever been  
And you, you don't understand  
Oh, I've gotta live  
  
You make it so hard to do  
You know you hurt me, baby  
Take me, take me as I am  
Take me as I am, baby  
Oh, oh, take me as I am  
  
All I believe is that you've taken me  
For some kind of dream  
I don't want to wait too long  
For my love is in the way to see it  
I don't want to lose you, baby  
But your love is in the way  
  
You gotta listen  
It's time to listen to me  
You, you don't realize  
Oh, I've gotta live  
You make it so hard to bear  
It may be hard for me to go on  
  
And I know, I know, I know  
You'll understand  
I'm just a man, baby  
That's all I am  
Don't make it hard on me  
  
Just take me, take me as I am, baby  
Take me as I am, baby  
Take me as I am, oh  
Take me as I am, baby  
Oh, take me as I am now
