Look at the way the flowers bloom for you,  
They want to show you their beauty, Lord  
Running waters dance,  
You and I romance  
  
Chorus  
  
Unto You, be all the glory (x2)  
  
Bridge  
  
Angels dance around You  
The earth it sings about You  
Open up the heavens, Lord,  
Let your kingdom come to earth  
  
My praises all surround You  
My soul can't dance without You  
Open up the heavens Lord  
Let your kingdom come to earth
