Oh, my honey, take my money  
I do what I wanna do  
Don't you know the sun is shining  
I'm sure trying, I ain't crying  
My feet won't touch the ground  
I ain't got no more misery  
  
Spread the word I'm living again  
Tell the world I'm loving again  
Don't you know I feel like giving again  
Freedom, oh  
  
No more walking or fast talking  
No things are gonna wear me out  
I'm sure glad I wasn't born a fool, yeah  
Some day, baby, you'll be my lady  
I know that it won't be long  
We ain't got no more misery  
  
Spread the word I'm living again  
Tell the world I'm loving again  
Don't you know I feel like giving again  
Freedom  
  
Oh, honey honey honey, taking all my money  
I do what I really wanna do  
Oh, the sun is shining  
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I never never cried  
Oh, my feet won't touch the ground  
I ain't got no more misery  
  
Spread the word I'm living again  
Tell the world I'm loving again  
Don't you know I feel like giving again  
Freedom
