Woah, Check it out

Some stupid things  
Mean a lot in my life  
Like the feeling like that I want to now ya.  
Like the feeling like that I want to now ya.  
  
If you're in my heart  
Say I could and I would be strong, man  
Say I could and I would be strong, man  
  
World in another  
I was trapped within  
A world within another  
World in another  
  
Say I was trapped within  
A world within another  
  
And is it true?  
You better believe it honey  
Better believe it honey  
  
But you may wear your heart  
Upon your sleeve  
But vicious lies only tease, tease  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
  
Every eye open was not see  
Every eye closed is not sleeping  
This is true  
Every eye open was not seeing  
  
World in another  
I was trapped within  
A world within another  
  
Oh and is it very true  
That we can have a fine romance  
Is it very true  
That we can have a fine romance  
  
Is it very true  
That we can have a fine romance  
  
A fine romance, let me hear it, let me hear it.  
  
Ooh, check it out  
  
World, world, world, world. world in another  
World, world, world, there's a world within another  
  
World in another  
I was trapped within  
A world within another  
It's a world  
  
Made for one another  
You better believe it honey
