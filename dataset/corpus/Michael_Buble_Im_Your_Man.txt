If you want a lover  
I'll do anything you ask me too  
And if you want another kind of love  
I'll wear a mask for you  
And If you want a partner take my hand  
And If you want to strike me down in anger  
Here I stand  
I'm your man  
  
And if you want boxer  
I will step into the ring for you  
And if you want a Doctor  
I'll examine every inch of you  
And if you want a driver climb inside  
And if you want to take me for a ride  
You know you can  
Cause I'm your man  
  
Ah the moons too bright  
The chains too tight  
The beast won't go to sleep  
I've been running thru these promises to you  
That I made and could not keep  
But a man has never got a woman back  
Not by begging on his Knees  
  
I've crawled to you baby  
And I've followed your feet  
I've howled at your beauty like a dog in heat  
  
I've called at your heart  
And I tear at your sheet  
Cause I'm your man  
  
And if you got to sleep a moment on the road  
I will steer for you  
And if you want to work this week alone  
I'll disappear for you  
  
And if you want a father for your child  
Or only want to walk with me a while  
Cross the sands  
Well I'm your man  
  
Ah the moons too bright  
The chains too tight  
The beast wont go to sleep  
I've been running thru these promises to you  
That I made and could not keep  
But a man has never got a woman back not by begging on his Knees  
  
I've crawled to you baby  
And I've followed your feet  
I've howled at your beauty like a dog in heat  
I've called at your heart  
And I tear at your sheets  
  
Cause I'm your man  
I'm your man
