Under the intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes  
I have felt the full knowledge  
And force of their expression  
And yet been unable to possess it  
And have felt it leave me  
As so many other things have left  
The letter half read  
The bottle half drunk  
Finding  
Finding in the commonest objects of the universe  
A circle of analogies  
Of metaphors  
Ooohhh  
For that expression  
Which has been willfully  
Withheld from me  
The access to the inner soul denied  
  
I want to know, ooohhh  
I want to know  
I want to know, oh  
I want to know  
  
In consideration  
In consideration of the faculties and impulses  
Of the human soul  
Of the human soul  
In consideration  
Of our arrogance  
Of our arrogance  
Our radical, primitive irreducible arrogance of reason  
We have all overlooked the propensity  
We saw no need for it  
The paradoxical something which we may call perverseness  
Perverseness  
Through its promptings we act without  
Comprehensible object  
We act for the reason we should not  
We act for the reason we should not  
For certain minds this is absolutely irre-, irre-  
Irresistible  
Irresistible  
The conviction of the wrong  
Or impolicy of an action  
Is often the unconquerable force  
The unconquerable force  
It is a primitive impulse  
It is a primitive impulse  
Primitive impulse  
The overwhelming tendency  
The overwhelming tendency to do  
Wrong for the wrong's sake  
To do wrong for the wrong's sake  
We persist in acts  
Because we feel that we  
Should not persist in them  
Because we feel we, feel we  
Should not persist, per-, persist in them, ah  
Ooohhh  
  
So I want to know  
I want to know  
I want to know  
I want to know  
  
I want to, I want to know  
I want to, I  
Ooohhh, we persist in action  
We persist in action  
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong  
Ooohhh  
Wrong, wrong  
Oh we persist in action  
Ah yeah yeah  
When you know that it's wrong
