Fly away  
From a broken heart  
You have your love I've got to know  
  
What you say to me?  
Why'd you throw it all away?  
Where you go to I don't know  
  
As tears of angels  
Whisper softly through the trees  
Calling to me  
Hear there gently sighing pleas  
  
I'm a fool if I think my babe'll come back  
I'll be waiting still I'm starting to crack  
And I care if you forget about me  
And I cry  
And I cry  
'Til you take it all from my heart  
  
Fly away  
Upon the wings of love  
Though I'll be here again tomorrow  
  
Like an angel  
Falling softly upon her knees  
Calling to me  
Hear her gently sighing pleas  
  
I'm a fool if I think my babe'll come back  
I'll be waiting still I'm starting to crack  
And I care if you forget about me  
But I cry  
And I cry  
'Til you take it all from my heart  
  
I'm a fool if I think my babe'll come back  
I'll be waiting still I'm starting to crack  
And I care if you forget about me  
And I cry  
And I cry  
'Til you take it all from my heart
