Someone asked me, about you  
Asked me if this was love, are we serious  
I kindly replied that I loved you  
Don't know if I should be falling again  
  
There's a part of me, still in misery  
Thought I know I got to move on  
I'm scarred of commitment  
I'm scarred of what could go wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause if I love again, I could lose again,  
There's a chance that my heart could break  
Hate to be wrong again  
Baby, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you  
If I hurt again and I cried again  
That's the chance that I'm gonna take  
I can't be wrong again  
Baby, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
It's gonna take me just a moment  
To take this all the way it feels kind of strange  
So what could you do to assure me  
That you won't go astray baby and hurt me some day  
  
So no promises, don't want roses  
I've already heard every lie  
And I ain't in no hurry  
And I hope you're not wasting my time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Starting over  
Takes me under  
I need your shoulder  
When I can't bear this pain  
I need your love now  
To help me make it alright  
I don't need no one babe  
Runnin' in and out of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I love again and I can lose again  
That's a chance that I'm gonna take  
I can't be wrong again  
Baby, 'cause I'm crazy 'bout you
