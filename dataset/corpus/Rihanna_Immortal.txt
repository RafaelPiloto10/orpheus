To be an immortal, one must not devour  
To be an immortal, we gotta know what's right  
To be an immortal, we must hide our power  
To be an immortal, we gotta use our might  
  
It's the time to flutter and go fly  
We can do whatever,  
We will not lie  
Our faces never break a tear  
Cause our smiles are coming from ear to ear  
So... We're watching you,  
Yes... We're protecting you,  
Emergency emergency,  
  
To be an immortal, one must not devour  
To be an immortal, we gotta know what's right  
To be an immortal, we must hide our power  
To be an immortal, we gotta use our might  
  
It's time to start flying.  
.. Above the ground, through the stars in the twilight sky,  
Flying... Above the moon go round and round till the sun comes out  
Flying... Above the ground, through the darkness we will never die  
Flying... Above the sun go round and round till the moon comes out  
You are my Immortal, you will live forever  
  
Just come and join my side, I'm letting you in.  
  
To be an immortal, one must not devour  
To be an immortal, we gotta know what's right  
To be an immortal, we must hide our power  
To be an immortal, we gotta use our might  
  
To be an immortal, one must not devour  
To be an immortal, we gotta know what's right  
To be an immortal, we must hide our power  
To be an immortal, we gotta use our might  
  
Immortal, immortal, immortal oh...  
Whoa... Oh... Whoa...  
  
To be an immortal, one must not devour  
To be an immortal, we gotta know what's right  
To be an immortal, we must hide our power  
To be an immortal, we gotta use our might  
  
To be an immortal, one must not devour  
To be an immortal, we gotta know what's right  
To be an immortal, we must hide our power  
To be an immortal, we gotta use our might
