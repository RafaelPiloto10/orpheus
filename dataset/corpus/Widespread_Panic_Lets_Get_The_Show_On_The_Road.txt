Let's get the show on the road  
At the curtain take a bow  
New Haven just a rendezvous to take you to  
A lover who was then but never now  
  
And Susan paid the lady  
Who called the players' song  
Just a figurine of stagehand reveries  
I guess up-and-coming can't be that wrong  
  
Let's get the show on the road, babe  
The spotlight's on the stage  
Somehow it seems that I heard these words before  
Did you forget to turn the page?  
  
Just remember what they told you  
About how the show goes on  
How can you come back if you've never been away?  
How can you sing without a song?  
  
And today is for sale and it's all you can afford  
Buy your own admission  
The whole things got you bored  
Well the Lord chooses the good ones  
And the bad ones use the Lord  
  
Let's get the show on the road, babe  
Won't you take a look a round?  
It seems so easy climbing to the top  
You better know the way back down  
  
I can't believe you really stumbled  
But I always knew you'd fall  
It seems so easy to say I knew you when  
I'd rather it was not at all  
  
And today is for sale and it's all you can afford  
Buy your own admission  
The whole things got you bored  
Well the Lord chooses the good ones  
And the bad ones use the Lord
