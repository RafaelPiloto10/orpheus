Pack up, I've had enough, that's it, I quit  
Give up, you win, I lose, you win  
You choose, you stay  
I'll go, you stay, I lose  
  
I used to be a dreamer  
But I realize that it's not my style at all  
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer  
Doesn't stand a chance at all  
  
Get out of here  
Get out of here  
Get out  
Do I make myself clear  
  
No way, I must go, can't stay, must run  
No chance, I can't give a second chance  
No hope, there's no hope for you now  
No romance, no more romance  
  
No how, no how could we stay together  
No need, I have no need for you now  
No fear, no fear of you no more  
  
Get out of here  
Get out of here  
Do I make myself clear  
  
Pack up, give in, go home, get out  
  
I used to be a dreamer  
But I realized that it's not my style at all  
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer  
Doesn't stand a chance at all  
  
And I've become bitter  
For I believe that this is better  
No matter, whatever, whenever  
We can never ever stay together  
  
Get out of here  
Go  
  
Do I make myself plain  
I don't want to ever see you again  
Get out of here  
  
Pack up, give in, get out of here  
Rev up, go away, get out of here  
Give in, go home, right away, get to  
Pack up, give in, give up, rev up  
Go away, out
