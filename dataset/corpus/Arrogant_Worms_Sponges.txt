Can't think of anything to sing about  
Not much out there to sing about  
The world's okay, the weather's fine  
No need to sing about that  
  
I'll sing about  
  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah!  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah yeah  
Sponges suck, sponges suck  
Sponges absorb liquid then you squeeze them out yeah!  
  
There's lots of songs of peace  
Lots of songs of love  
Even songs about peaches and Valkyries  
No songs about  
  
Tuna fish, tuna fish, tuna fish, tuna fish  
They're real big and swim in oceans  
Come in cans like hockey pucks  
Tuna got their names 'cause they don't swim in pairs!  
  
Get it? Tuna. Are there two of those fish? Nah! Two-nah! Two-nah! It's funny!
Hee hee! No? I like tuna.  
  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah!  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah yeah  
Sponges suck, sponges suck  
Sponges suck, sponges suck  
Sponges clean up dishes and sinks  
And countertops and baby's noses  
They suck up soap and when you squeeze them out they make  
Bubbles!  
Bubbles!  
Bubbles!  
  
Sponges
