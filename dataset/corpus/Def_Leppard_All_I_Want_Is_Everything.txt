I don't know how to leave you  
And I don't know how to stay  
I've got things that I must tell you  
That I don't know how to say  
The man behind these empty words  
Is crying out in shame  
Holding on to this sinking ship  
When nothing else remains  
  
[Chorus]  
All I want is everything  
Am I asking too much?  
All I want is everything  
Like the feel of your touch  
But all I have are yesterdays  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
It's hard to hold your head up  
When you're kneeling down to pray  
And talking don't come easy now  
When the words get in the way  
If you could see what's going on  
Behind these private eyes  
The truth would look so easy now  
But I'm running out of lies  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You think the shadow of doubt  
Is hanging over my head  
It's just an angel  
Whose wings hide the sun  
And it's myself I betray  
I cannot wish this away  
Took my chance  
Now the damage is done  
  
[Chorus]
