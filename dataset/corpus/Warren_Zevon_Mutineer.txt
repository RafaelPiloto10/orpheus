Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum  
Hoist the mainsail, here I come  
Ain't no room on board for the insincere  
You're my witness  
I'm your mutineer  
  
I was born to rock the boat  
Some may sink but we will float  
Grab your coat, let's get out of here  
You're my witness  
I'm your mutineer  
  
Long ago we laughed at shadows  
Lightning flashed and thunder followed us  
It could never find us here  
You're my witness  
I'm your mutineer
