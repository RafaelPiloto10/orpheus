I really tried my hardest just to make you understand  
It feels like to a boy, when he don't feel like a man  
But you gave me so much money  
And you would not understand  
I realize I hurt you, so I stay just as I am  
  
[Chorus]  
But the whole world keeps on turnin'  
Yes, the whole world keeps on turnin'  
But the whole world keeps on turnin'  
I just roll along  
  
There's been too many mornings  
And one too many years  
Once went by the big ones who just can't take the pace  
We found out the hard way  
I hope you understand  
That my life is just my head  
And I had an overdose  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to try, I used to try  
Used to cry, oh I used to cry  
  
[Chorus]
