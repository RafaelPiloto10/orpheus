At a truck stop in St Angelo  
Saw a bill board about this rodeo  
This weekend out in El Paso  
So I signed up to ride  
  
I drew a bull called "original sin"  
Heard he'd killed a couple of men  
Figured this was something I could win  
'Cause the devil was on my side  
I was havin' myself one hell of a ride  
But I ended up disqualified  
That bull just up and died  
Before they blew the whistle  
  
[Chorus]  
With those north Texas blues,  
Thought I'd paid all my dues  
Then those south Texas blues,  
Told me "son, you ain't through"  
Had the east Texas blues and the west Texas too  
I've done all I know to do,  
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose,  
These ol' Lone Star Blues.  
  
Well I got laid off at Brown and Rue  
Then on my way back to cuttin' chute  
I lost my wrist watch and my boots  
Shootin' dice with a dude from Houston  
Well there ain't no jobs here workin' cattle  
So I got on the part time haulin' gravel  
With some outfit from Seattle out here building custom homes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I gassed my truck and I packed my clothes  
Turned in my key and I hit the road  
I said "cow town's where I'll go,  
You never know, I might get lucky!"  
  
Well I got a friend there turning knobs  
At a place called Billy Bobs  
Said thought he could get me a job there  
Workin' as a bouncer  
First night on the job was just insane  
Some ol' boy got all deranged  
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain  
To this day, my ears still ring!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've done all I know to do,  
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose  
These ol' Lone Star blues
