Just as we hit the green,  
I've never been so happy to be alive.  
Only seven miles behind  
You could smell the child,  
The smell of the front line's survival.  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet,  
(I pull the pin.)  
  
You learn to ride the Earth,  
When you're living on your belly and the enemy are city-births.  
Who need radar? We use scent.  
They stink of the west, stink of sweat.  
Stink of cologne and baccy, and all their Yankee hash.  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet,  
(I'm pulling on the pin,)  
Ooh, I pull out, pull out the pin.  
(pulling on the pin, oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
Just one thing in it  
Me or him.  
Just one thing in it  
Me or him.  
And I love life!  
Just one thing in it  
Me or him.  
And I love life!  
I love life!  
I love life!  
  
I've seen the coat for me.  
I'll track him 'til he drops,  
Then I'll pop him one he won't see.  
He's big and pink, and not like me.  
He sees no light.  
He sees no reason for the fighting  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet.  
(I'm pulling on the pin,)  
Ooh, I pull out, pull out the pin.  
(pulling on the pin, oh)  
  
I had not seen his face,  
'til I'm only feet away  
Unbeknown to my prey.  
I look in American eyes.  
I see little life,  
See little wife.  
He's striking violence up in me.  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
