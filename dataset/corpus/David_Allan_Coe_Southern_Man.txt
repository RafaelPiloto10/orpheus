Southern man better cool your head  
Don't forget what your good book says  
Southern change gonna come at last  
Now your crosses are burning fast  
Southern man  
I saw cotton and I saw black  
Tall white mansions and little shacks  
Southern man when will you pay them back  
I heard screaming and ooh whips cracking and  
How long how long, how long  
Southern man  
Southern man better cool your head  
Don't forget what your good book says  
Southern change gonna come at last  
Now your crosses are burning fast  
Lilly pelle your hair is golden brown  
I've seen your black man comin round  
Swear to God, I'm gonna cut him down  
I heard screaming and ooh whips cracking and  
How long how long, how long  
Southern man  
Southern man better cool your head  
Don't forget what your good book says  
Southern change gonna come at last  
Now your crosses are burning fast
