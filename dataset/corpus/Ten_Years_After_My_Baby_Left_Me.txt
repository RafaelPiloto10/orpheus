My baby left me  
She wouldn't tell a lie  
Cause she said she would, she did  
And she left me high and dry  
My baby left me  
Last night I heard her cry  
She wouldn't tell me why  
She just said bye-bye  
  
I used to sing the blues  
I thought I sang for real  
Now I know the feel  
And it hurts too much  
My baby left me  
She left me all alone  
She's never coming home  
And I want to die  
  
My baby left me, my baby left me
