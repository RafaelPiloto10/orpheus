If I came back just a cripple from the war  
Would you hold me close just like you did before?  
And what in the world would you do  
If I could not make love to you?  
  
The question is not whether the freedom we've got  
Is worth the consequence of war  
The question is just, can I hold you at dusk  
Without you asking me for more?  
  
A post-war eunuch  
A lover that is lame  
Some famous hero, and one shares his name  
But where in the world would I go?  
You're all that I love and all I know  
  
The question is plain  
Could our love still remain  
Without its carnal ecstasy?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
And who in the world would I be  
If I lose all of you and half of me?  
  
Oh
