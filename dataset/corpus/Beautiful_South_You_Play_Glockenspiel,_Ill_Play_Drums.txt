There's a boy with a brace across his teeth  
White socks, tattooed underneath  
Bus tickets chitched up in his palm  
Stood there he's spinning a yarn  
There's a girl with a plastic pair of shoes  
Two eyes permanently bruised  
Can't find the time to be alarmed  
Just stood spinning a yarn  
Just take your time  
It'll work out fine  
It'll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums  
My name is Derek from the den  
I deal in shillings and in pence  
I'll get you any deal you like  
Ten sweets for a mountain bike you like  
My name is Mandy from the yard  
I deal in crazy tarot cards  
I'll tell you what the future brings  
One cat and a dog that sings  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums  
Just take your time  
It'll work out fine  
It'll do no harm  
To spin your yarn  
You do English  
I'll do sums  
You break fingers  
I'll break thumbs  
You play Dads  
And I'll play Mums  
You play Glockenspiel  
And I'll play drums
