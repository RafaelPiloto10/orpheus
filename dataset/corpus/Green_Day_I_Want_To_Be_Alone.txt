[Chorus]  
I lock myself inside my room  
I want to be alone  
With you around, you'll only add on  
I want to be alone  
It's been disturbed by my thoughts  
I want to be alone  
With you around, you'll only add on  
I want to be alone  
  
Please don't think I'm crazy  
I don't want you to understand  
My mind is growing hazy  
To heck with your helping hand  
Why don't you just leave me alone?  
This conflict is my own  
Keep your sources away from me  
That's all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Please don't think I'm crazy  
I don't want you to understand  
My mind is growing hazy  
To heck with your helping hand  
Why don't you just leave me alone?  
This conflict is my own  
Keep your sources away from me  
That's all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Please don't think I'm crazy  
I don't want you to understand  
My mind is growing hazy  
To heck with your helping hand  
Why don't you just leave me alone?  
This conflict is my own  
Keep your sources away from me  
That's all
