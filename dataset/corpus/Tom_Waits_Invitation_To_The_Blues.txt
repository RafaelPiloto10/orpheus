Well she's up against the register with an apron and a spatula,  
Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors  
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes,  
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues  
  
And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth  
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore  
You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle  
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue  
  
She said How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?,  
You say 'anyway's the only way', be careful not to gamble  
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here  
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes  
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues  
  
But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java,  
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers  
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey  
But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind  
And the dream that I was chasing, and a battle with booze  
And an open invitation to the blues  
  
But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy,  
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things  
He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't 'cept at night,  
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared  
So they took the registration, and the car-keys and her shoes  
And left her with an invitation to the blues  
  
Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening  
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while  
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring,  
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose?  
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay? now I gotta choose,  
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues
