So you're a self proclaimed messiah  
Or maybe a blasphemes liar  
A clever hypnotic hoax  
A hallowed heretic coax  
Who tells these stories so old  
No, never the same twice told  
Speaking in distorted truths  
I see that Thomas wants some proof  
Did you come to heal the sick  
With one more magician's trick  
Ye generation seeks a sign  
While blind keeps leading the blind  
  
So you say there is no god  
Just a clever man's charade  
A once upon a fairy tales fraud  
Has god made man or man made god  
  
There is no god  
Confused thy talk in parables  
Accused thou walk in parallels  
A simple game of Simon says  
This month's flavor sciences  
Today's fact, tomorrow's fiction  
Leave the rest to superstition  
If knowledge comes from learning books  
Wisdom comes from discerning looks  
A fool that says there is no god  
Don't feel for that sorry sod  
Who needs proof then he'll believe  
I wonder if he's been deceived  
  
There is no god
