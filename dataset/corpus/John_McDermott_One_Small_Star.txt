When I need to feel you near me  
I stand in this quiet place  
Where the silver light of countless stars  
Falling on my face  
Though they all shine so brightly  
Somehow it comforts me to know  
That some that burn the brightest  
Died an eternity ago  
Chorus  
But your light still shines  
It's one small star to guide me  
And it helps me to hold back the dark  
Your light's still shining in my heart  
I'm learning how to live without you  
And I never thought I could  
And even how to smile again  
I never thought I would  
And I cherish your heart's memories  
Cause they bring you back to life  
Some caress me gently  
And some cut me like a knife  
Chorus  
Can your soul be out there some where  
Beyond the infinity of time  
I guess you've found some answers now  
I'll have to wait for mine  
When my light joins with yours one day  
We'll shine through time and space  
And one day fall on a distant age  
Upon some stranger's face  
But your light still shines  
It's one small star to guide me  
And it helps me to hold back the dark  
Your light's still shining in my heart  
Your light's still shining in my heart
