Look at me now, a shadow of the man I used to be...  
Look through my eyes and through the years of loneliness you'll see...  
To the times in my life when I could not bear to lose  
A simple game.  
And the least of it all was the fortune and the fame...  
But the dream seemed to end just as soon as it had begun...  
Was I to know?  
For the last thing of all that was on my mind  
Was the close at the end of the show.  
The shadow of a lonely man feels nobody else...  
  
In the shadow of a lonely, lonely man  
I can see myself...  
  
(Looking out of nowhere...Looking out of nowhere...)  
  
But the sound of the crowds when they come to see me now,  
Is not the same.  
And the jest of it all is I can't recall my name.  
But I cling to a hope till I can't hold on anymore...anymore...  
And for all the acclaim, I am all alone!  
And I see as I look through the door,  
  
The shadow of a lonely man...There's nobody else...  
In the shadow of a lonely, lonely man  
I can see myself!  
  
...Look at me now, a shadow of the man I used to be....
