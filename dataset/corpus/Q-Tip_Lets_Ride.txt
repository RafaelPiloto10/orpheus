Brand new truck, butter soft seat  
Four point something with a low ride something  
Ain't nothing better than to ride out the hood with it  
Who looking better and damn you looking good in it  
Take a chance with a nigga in a choice ride  
Listen to the CD's I play inside  
Mos Def, Jay, Prince, and Stevie  
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, and Biggie  
And when the evening is over love  
Gonna find a nice spot for the rover love  
Do things to make the man in the moon blush  
My mind race but I tell my waist don't rush  
You's a upper echelon piece  
So when you find its stashed then you don't freak  
You want to nibble on a nigga ear  
And do all the things that make a nigga want to get near  
Oh I'm a Queens representative  
Get wild by any means my incentive is  
When we done, I start it up again  
And ride round with you 'cause you my special friend, uh  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, me and you I think we should ride  
Come on come on come on come on  
Don't worry just done get inside  
Come on come on come on come on  
  
The second cut, her ride is like art  
We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it  
The backseat is the canvas we painting on  
Abstract the word we creating on  
The TV's in the back and the dash too  
Got miss napkins and bamboo  
Don't worry, the tip's past the legal one  
Outkast's banging loud in my eardrum  
The way the wheels spin cutting through the still wind  
Outsiders looking in with the ill grin  
Fuel injected brand new inspected  
Emissions got tested details perfected  
Got the armor all touch empty out the dutch  
No tobacco spilling on my rug clutch  
Kick off your shoes show off your pedicure  
Shake off the blues we all forgetting more  
Boy that thing  
Stuff that brings ecstasy maybe you blink  
A little harder than your average hugagraph  
Lady tell me this is better than taking a cab  
And when you back tell all your girls  
You rode around hot-wheeling drinking no Earl  
Vacationing, V up my V8  
Just one night we drive and we escape  
  
[Chorus: x2]
