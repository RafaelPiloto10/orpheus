I knew exactly  
What you were going through  
It's just that I didn't have the right  
To discuss your problems I saw you struggling  
For our education I saw you struggling to get us clothes to wear mama  
This man you got married to is dead alive  
Over the years I asked myself  
Many questions Is he my real dad or  
Was I adopted mama I know it's difficult for you mama  
But hold on I am a little grown up now  
Oh Ho  
Chorus:  
Hold on just a little bit longer now (x4)  
You were a laughing stock in the community  
The press didn't rest  
Makin' news out of you mama  
Now is the time to show them that he who laughs last laughs the best, that's
the way it is (x2)  
Chorus:  
Hold on just a little bit longer now  
I know it's not easy for you mama but your tears will turn to laughter now
that I"m a grown up mama  
Chorus till fade
