Waterboy, where are you hiding  
If you don't come right here  
Gonna tell you pa on you  
There ain't no hammer  
That's on a this mountain  
That ring like mine boy  
That ring like mine  
I'm gonna bust this rock boy  
From here to the Macon  
All the way to the jail boy  
All the way to the jail  
You Jack o diamond  
Jack o diamond  
Know you of old boy  
I know you're of old  
You rob-a my pocket  
Rob my pocket  
Silver and gold boy  
Of silver and gold  
There ain't no sweat boy  
That's on a this mountain  
That run like mine boy  
That run like mine
