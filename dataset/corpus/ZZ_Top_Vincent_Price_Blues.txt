There's a rockin' time on the borderline  
Between sundown and up  
There's an off-the-wall cantina, man  
Just waitin' to tear you up  
The locals know that in you go  
And out con nalgas fried  
Night descends, and the fun begins  
Way out the other side  
  
But, I didn't say it  
Oh, no  
Vincent Price said it's alright  
Vincent Price said it's OK  
  
There's a very cherry charmer  
Oozin' groovin' grease  
She come in with the graveyard shift  
A pleasin' teasin' squeeze  
El jeffe [sic] holler mucho mas  
Get some sucker's ass inside  
I think you'll know you gotta go  
To get some satisfy  
  
But, I didn't say it  
Oh, no  
Vincent Price said it's alright  
Vincent Price said it's OK  
  
I've dined at Spago and Eclipse  
And Whataburger too  
I've had Mescal with lotsa gals  
Along 5th Avenue  
I always shot the best they got  
Dinero no problema  
Ain't no quarter south-the-border  
In this off the wall cantina  
  
But, I didn't say it  
Oh, no  
Vincent Price said it's alright  
VIncent Price said it's ok  
Vincent, Vincent Price said it's alright  
Vincent Price said it's OK
