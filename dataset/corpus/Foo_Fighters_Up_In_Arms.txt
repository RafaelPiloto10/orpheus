The rain is here, and you, my dear, are still my friend  
It's true two of us are back as one again  
I was the one who left you  
Always coming back  
I cannot forget you, girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
  
The rain is here, and you, my dear, are still my friend  
It's true, the two of us are back as one again  
I was the one who left you  
Always coming back  
I cannot forget you, girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
  
Together now, I don't know how this love could end  
My lonely heart, it falls apart for you to mend  
I was the one who left you  
  
Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
I was the one who left you  
  
Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
I was the one who left you  
  
Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl  
Now I am up in arms again
