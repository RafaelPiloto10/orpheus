Oiou  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Chorus:  
Oiou  
You're the one I want to serve forever  
Oiou, oiou  
Oiou  
You're the one I want to serve forever  
Oiou, oiou  
Once I was sinking down  
I called out your name  
You caught my falling soul  
And now I'm not the same  
Chorus  
You are a mighty God  
Holy and true  
You've given me everything  
I owe my life to you  
Chorus  
I called out to you, O Lord  
And you heard my cry  
You lifted me out of the mire  
And set my feet on high  
Chorus
