[Hmm-hm-hm-hm-hmm-m  
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm]  
  
I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way  
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away  
Gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight  
Gotta set it all afire, set it all alight  
  
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar  
I am gonna set you all alight  
Gotta make it man  
I ain't got a choice  
Gotta fill this hall tonight  
  
Helpless (helpless)  
Helpless (helpless)  
Helpless (helpless)  
Helpless (helpless)  
  
I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe not tonight  
Gotta set you all afire, gotta treat you right  
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love  
Gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above  
  
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar  
I am gonna set you all alight  
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice  
Gotta fill this hall tonight  
  
Helpless (helpless)  
Helpless (helpless)  
Helpless (helpless)  
Helpless (helpless)  
Huh!  
  
I can see the stars, but I can't see what's going on  
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun  
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday  
This stage is mine, music is my destiny  
  
Cannot squeeze the life from me, yeah  
  
I can see the stars, but I can't see what's going on

Cannot squeeze the life from me  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  
  
Hoh!  
  
[See ya  
Keep it going and keep it ringing out, let it ring out  
Hey, doc  
Okay, turn it off now]
