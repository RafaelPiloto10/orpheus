If you respect me  
Don't protect me  
You can tell me, I can handle it  
Stop pretending, cause we're going down  
If you let go, then just let go  
It's disrespectful how you've handled this  
Never ending, kinda round around  
  
I lie to my heart cause I thought you felt it  
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted  
No you don't have to love me  
If you don't wanna  
Don't act like I mean nothing  
But if you're gonna  
Well, when you're better off  
  
Unkiss me, untouch me  
Untake this heart  
And I missing  
Just one thing  
A brand new star  
  
Can't erase this, can't delete this  
I don't need this, I can't handle it  
I just feel it, that you're over us  
If I wait here, if I see you  
It won't matter, what's the point of this?  
We're in pieces, because you're over us  
  
I lie to my heart cause I thought you felt it  
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted  
No you don't have to love me  
If you don't wanna  
Don't act like I mean nothing  
But if you're gonna  
Well, when you're better off  
  
Unkiss me, untouch me  
Untake this heart  
And I missing  
Just one thing  
A brand new star  
Unkiss me  
Unkiss me  
  
So baby let go  
Gotta let go  
It's disrespectful how you've handled this  
Never ending, kinda round around  
  
Unkiss me, untouch me  
Untake this heart  
And I missing  
Just one thing  
A brand new star  
So unkiss me  
So unkiss me  
Unkiss me
