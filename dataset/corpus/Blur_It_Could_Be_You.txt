Churchill got his lucky number  
But tomorrow there's another  
Could be me could be you  
No silver spoon  
Sticky teeth they rot too soon  
You've got to have the best tunes  
Or that's it you've blown it  
  
All we want is to be happy  
In our homes like happy families  
Be the man on the beach with  
The world at his feet  
Yes, it could be you  
  
The likely lads  
Are picking up the uglies  
Yesterday they were just puppies  
Beery slurs now life's a blur  
Telly addicts  
You should see them at it  
Getting in a panic  
Will we be there  
Trafalgar Square?  
  
So don't worry  
If it's not your lucky number  
Because tomorrow there is another  
Could be you, could be me
