Past the cafe shutters down,  
No one stirs in the town.  
  
The morning after the rain  
The barges move on the Seine.  
  
Down the avenue lined with trees  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
Paris bells ring on the breeze.  
  
Dawn is breaking, birds start to sing,  
Sun is rising, warms everything.  
  
The echo of footsteps on a cobbled street,  
Dim alleyways where the shadows meet.  
  
Down the avenue lined with trees  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
Paris bells ring on the breeze.  
  
The places where we used to visit,  
The chapel where we went to wed.  
  
Paris bells on the breeze  
Often stir memories.  
  
We both knew the morning rain  
We both wandered down the Seine.  
  
Now you're gone away from me  
You're just a memory  
Like the bells ring on the breeze,  
Paris bells ring on the breeze.
