"Oh, hi! Is Miss Otis in?"  
"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today,"  
  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, mmm  
And she's sorry to be delayed  
But last evening down at lover's lane  
She strayed, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When she woke up and found  
That her dream of love was gone, madam  
She ran to the man who had lead her so far astray  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail, madam  
They strung her up on the willow across the way  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam  
  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
