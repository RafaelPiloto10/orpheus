Take me anyway you want me  
Cause I need your love to see me through  
You can make me anyway you want me  
That's all that I can offer you  
I have tried so hard to please you  
But I just can't seem to reach you  
  
Tried, tried a little kindness  
Every night and day like I knew I should  
But you can take me, yes and you can leave me  
But I always stayed, and you knew I would  
Come on, come on closer now  
I will get to you somehow  
  
Come on, come on closer now  
I will get to you somehow  
But you got to show me how  
Please, please baby, please  
Please, baby show me the way to your heart  
  
You got to take me anyway you want me  
Or take me just, just the way I am  
Take me, or you can make me
