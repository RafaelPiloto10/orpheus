How can I be sure?  
When your intrusion is my illusion  
How can I be sure  
When all the time you changed my mind  
I asked for more and more  
How can I be sure  
  
When you don't give me love  
You gave me pale shelter  
You don't give me love  
You give me cold hands  
And I can't operate on this failure  
When all I want to be is  
Completely in command  
  
How can I be sure  
For all you say you keep me waiting  
How can I be sure  
When all you do is see me through  
I asked for more and more  
How can I be sure  
  
I've been here before  
There is no why, no need to try  
I thought you had it all  
I'm calling you, I'm calling you  
I ask for more and more  
How can I be sure
