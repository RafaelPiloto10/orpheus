Would it stain  
If the lights fell down on your name  
And each face began to look all the same?  
How much is enough?  
Did you ever want to just lose touch with everybody you know?  
In the morning  
When you've wiped his taste away  
The last of the red and all the records you played  
How much is enough?  
Did you ever want to just lose touch with everybody who heard?  
Did you ever want to join a collective  
Or throw a party just to make sure you missed it?  
Did you ever want to be a collective?  
Would you sell out  
To the dealer with the lowest cost  
And you burn every proscenium floor?  
How much is enough?  
Did you ever want to get in touch with somebody you've hurt?  
Offered up some kind of collective  
Where you can never ever be left selected  
Did you ever want to be a collective?  
If the lights then fell  
Do you think you could tell  
How much?  
If the lights then fell  
Do you think you could tell  
Just how much?
