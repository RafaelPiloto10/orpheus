We march like fools in the parade of chaos.  
We march like fools in the parade of chaos.  
Led by our enemies.  
While we sing there praises.  
Led by our enemies.  
While we kiss their hands.  
The morning rained fire.  
Let heavens retire.  
Over the eyes of the blind.  
And the voices of spoiled children.  
True leaders are gone.  
We turned our backs to many times.  
And bit the hand of the provider.  
Chaos kills us.  
Chaos
