My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola  
My eyes are wide like cherry pies  
I got sweet taste for men who're older  
It's always been so it's no surprise  
  
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds  
And it's making me crazy  
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby  
  
Come on baby, let's ride  
We can escape to the great sunshine  
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind  
We made it out to the other side  
We made it out to the other side  
We made it out to the other side  
Come on come on come on come on come on baby  
Whoa ah yeah  
  
I fall asleep with an American flag  
I wear my diamonds on skid row  
I pledge allegiance to my dad  
For teaching me everything he knows  
  
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds  
And it's making me crazy  
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby, yeah  
  
Come on baby, let's ride  
We can escape to the great sunshine  
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind  
We made it out to the other side  
We made it out to the other side  
We made it out to the other side  
  
Drug, suck it up, like Vanilla Ice is  
Don't treat me rough, treat me really nice-is  
Decorate my neck, me, I'm on decisis  
Why, come on come on come on  
Ooo ooo ooo ooh  
Ooo ooo ooo ooh  
Ooo ooo ooo ooh  
Yeow!  
  
Come on baby, let's ride  
We can escape to the great sunshine  
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind  
We made it out to the other side  
  
Come on baby, let's ride  
We can escape to the great sunshine  
We made it out to the other side  
We made it out to the other side  
  
Come on come on come on baby  
Come on come on come on baby  
Whoa ah  
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola  
Ooh ah  
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola  
Ooo ooo ooo ooh  
Ooo ooo ooo ooh  
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola  
Ooh whoa yeah
