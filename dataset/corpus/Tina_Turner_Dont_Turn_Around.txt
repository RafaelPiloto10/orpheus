If you want to leave I won't beg you to stay  
And if you gotta go darling maybe it's better that way  
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
Just walk out that door, see if I care  
Go on and go now but  
Don't turn around  
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
I won't miss your arms around me holding me tight  
If you ever think about me just know that I'll be alright  
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
I know I'll survive, sure I'll make it through  
And I'll even learn to live without you  
Don't turn around  
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
I wish I could scream out loud that I love you  
I wish I could say to you don't go, don't go, don't go  
Don't turn around  
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know
