Baby brought me in out off the highway  
Poured my right good liquor down the sink  
Straightened out my crooked ways of thinking  
And made it purely pleasure when I drank  
  
And it's all right now  
I've just hit my stride  
Right off the bat  
I'm drunk on Bluebird wine  
  
Baby's up and running in the mornin'  
Says she's got a million things to do yeah  
While I'm gone just you go get your guitar  
Write some pretty song about me and you  
  
And it's all right now  
I've just hit my stride  
Right off the bat  
I'm drunk on Bluebird wine  
  
Baby says she'd really love a party  
Get some friends together feelin' fine yeah  
Any friend of mine is worth his habit  
A belly full of baby's Bluebird wine  
  
And it's all right now  
I've just hit my stride  
Right off the bat  
I'm drunk on Bluebird wine  
  
Yes it's all right now  
I've just hit my stride  
Right off the bat  
I'm drunk on Bluebird, wine
