Tough boys  
Running the streets  
Come a little closer  
Rough toys  
Under the sheets  
Nobody knows here  
Rough boys  
Come over here  
I want to bite and kiss you  
I want to see what I can find  
Tough kids  
Take a bottle of wine  
When your deal is broken  
Ten quid  
She's so easy to blind  
Not a word is spoken  
Rough boys  
Don't walk away  
I'm still pretty blissed here  
Tough boys  
I'm gonna carry you home  
You got pretty pissed dear  
Gonna get inside you  
Gonna get inside your bitter mind  
Rough boys  
Don't walk away  
I want to buy your leather  
Make noise  
Try and talk me away  
We can't be seen together  
Tough kids  
What can I do?  
I'm so pale and weedy  
Rough fits  
In my Hush Puppy shoes  
But I'm still pleadin  
Tough boys  
Running the streets  
Come a little closer  
Rough toys  
Under the sheets  
Nobody knows her  
Rough boys  
Come over here  
I want to bite and kiss you  
I want to see what I can find
