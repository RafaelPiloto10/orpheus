By Steve and Carol Ide  
Let's not sit here, talk about it baby  
It's got to start in your heart or else it'll pass on by  
It's what pleases you when your love seems new  
That puts the light back in your eyes  
You got what it takes, and I know it make it through  
CHORUS:  
You've got to give it all that you got  
Honey that's the thing to do  
You've got to give it your best shot  
Even when the world's closing' in on you  
It's not an easy life we're livin'  
But in the end if it's love you're givin'  
Don't be afraid, don't give it up  
Give it all you got  
There's people around who are standin' right by your side  
Walkin' hand in hand, they could follow you up to the sky  
But if you leave 'em alone, they'll be on their own  
And then there'll be reason to try,  
What's the use payin' dues when you got no reason why  
CHORUS  
What do you do when there's so much in you  
You can't feel the road that you're on  
Say what needs to be said, get it all out your head  
And you're back on the road before long  
CHORUS
