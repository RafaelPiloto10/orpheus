She lit a candle in the dowtown cathedreal  
Quietly confessing counting on a blessing  
She looked as if she had no where to go  
I could see her weeping hands together  
Hoping you would hear.  
This is the time of year we hold our familes  
Near but God let us be a friend to the hurting.  
  
Oh Emanuel God with us spirit revealed  
In us that we may be a hope to the world  
Oh Emanuel God with us with a light to break  
The drakness that we may show your hope  
To the world Emanuel be God in us.  
  
I moved in closer just so I oculd se her face,  
Maybe she was a mother someones only  
Duaghter her silver hair shimmered like  
The snow, Christmas bells were ringing  
Now beside her kneeling I asked her name  
She said this was the time of year I had my family  
Near but they've all gone and I have been so lonely  
  
Oh Emanuell God with us, spirit revealed  
In us that we may be a hope to the world  
Oh Emanuel God with us with a light to break the darkness  
That we may show your hope to the world Emanuel be God in us  
  
So with my family that Christmas day a girl  
Of sixty years could laugh and play as we watched  
Her dance our eyes were full of tears  
  
Oh Emanuel God with us spirit revealed in us that we  
May be a hope to the world  
Oh Emanuel God with us with a light to break the darkness  
That we may show your hope to the world Emanuel be God in us  
  
Be God in us
