Do I have to come right out  
And say it,  
Tell you that you look so fine?  
Do I have to come right out  
And ask you to be mine?  
If it was a game I could play it,  
Trying to make it  
But I'm losing time  
I got to bring you in,  
You're overworking my mind.  
  
Indecision is crowding me,  
I have no room to spare  
And I can't believe she cared  
Like a dream she has taken me  
And now I don't know where  
And a part of me is scared  
The part of me I shared  
Once before.  
  
Do I have to come right out  
And say it,  
Tell you that you look so fine?  
Do I have to come right out  
And ask you to be mine?

Do I have to come right out  
And say it, girl  
Tell you that you look so fine?  
Do I have to come right out  
And ask you to be mine?
