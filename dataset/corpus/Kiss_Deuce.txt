Get up  
And get your grandma outta here  
Pick up  
Old Jim is workin' hard this year  
And baby  
Do the things he says to do  
  
Baby, if you're feeling good  
And baby if you're feeling nice  
You know your man is workin' hard  
He's worth a deuce  
  
Honey  
Don't put your man behind his years  
And baby  
Stop cryin' all your tears  
Baby  
Do the things he says to do  
Do it  
  
Baby, if you're feeling good  
And baby if you're feeling nice  
You know your man is workin' hard  
He's worth a deuce  
  
And baby, if you're feeling good  
Yes baby if you're feeling nice  
You know your man is workin' hard  
Yeah
