And the tears fall like rain  
Down on my face again  
Oh the words you wouldn't say  
And the games you played  
With my unfoolish heart  
Oh I should have known this from the start  
  
Oh the winter and spring  
Going hand in hand  
Just like my love and pain  
How the thought of you cuts deep within the vain  
Oh this brand new skin stretched across scared terrain  
  
I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my life again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
So I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my lies again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
  
Oh...  
  
All those years down the drain  
Love was not enough when you want everything  
What I gave to you and now the end must start  
Oh I should have listened to my heart  
  
'Cause I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my life again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
So I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my lies again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
  
Oh...  
  
I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my life again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
So I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my lies again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road
