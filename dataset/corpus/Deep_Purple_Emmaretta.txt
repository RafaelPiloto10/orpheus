Emmaretta, did you get my letter?  
I sent it to you, oh Emmaretta  
Do you still feel when night is falling  
Something calling, oh Emmaretta  
Behind my thoughts, oh Emmaretta  
I can get to you to feel better  
I must go now, oh Emmaretta  
Full moon's rising, oh Emmaretta  
Oh, it's a thousand miles  
Oh, and I need you child  
Oh, they can drive me wild  
What I feel can make it real  
Help  
Oh, it's a thousand miles  
Oh, and I need you child  
Oh, they can drive me wild  
If what I feel can make it real  
Emmaretta, did you get my letter  
I sent it to you, oh Emmaretta  
Do you still feel when night is falling  
Something calling, oh Emmaretta
