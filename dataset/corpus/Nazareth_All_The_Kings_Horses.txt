I know you  
You always rode so tall in the saddle  
You are the answer  
But I know that you are only causin' trouble  
Take all you want, leave me the rest behind  
You're a user  
A winnin' no new friends, just make one small step  
You're a user  
You never came to anyone's call  
Spent all your life head on the wall  
While you're up there, there's only one way to fall  
  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Will never put you together again  
  
You still got your chances  
The one thing the whole world loves is a winner  
You can't walk on water  
With your heat the ice you're on is gettin' thinner  
You used to be so wise  
But you are fooled by your own lies  
And I see right through your disguise  
  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Will never put you together again  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Will never put you together again
