She drove a blue car around Bloomington  
She was a thin girl but she had substance  
She said that most girls who come to Bloomington  
Only come here to find husbands  
The existence of God was confirmed  
By the way she unfolded herself alongside  
And I tried to harden my heart  
But she wouldn't let me, she wouldn't let me  
Oh oh Bloomington, Bloomington  
When the rest of the world is over and done  
Oh oh you'll still be the only one  
I'll ever love Bloomington  
In a park that doubled as a parking lot  
There was music it was free  
Oh the girl in pink took a sip of my drink  
And laid down next to me  
Yeah the way she unfolded herself  
Was an earthquake a hurricane tidal wave flood  
This is love baby this is love  
The moment she let me, the moment she let me  
Oh Bloomington, Bloomington  
When the rest of the world is over and done  
Oh oh you'll still be the only one  
I'll ever love Bloomington
