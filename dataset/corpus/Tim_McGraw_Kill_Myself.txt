I'm gonna clean the house  
I'm gonna fix the fence  
With my final hours  
I'm gonna tie up these loose ends  
I won't leave a note for anyone to find  
Tomorrow they'll know what I've done here tonight  
  
The drastic steps I've taken  
Are just an act of desperation  
I knew no one would miss me, so what the hell?  
I fought, and lied, I drank too much  
Hurt everyone I've ever touched  
And just how much I've hurt you, it's hard to tell  
This is not some cry for help  
It's goodbye, I wish you well  
Because I love you I'm gonna kill myself  
  
Now who is that in my easy chair?  
Now wait a minute, that's the old me sitting there  
And I thank God, the devil in me died  
'Cause I stand before you now a man changed and alive  
  
The drastic steps I've taken  
Are just an act of desperation  
I knew no one would miss me, so what the hell?  
I fought, and lied, I drank too much  
Hurt everyone I've ever touched  
And just how much I've hurt you, it's hard to tell  
This is not some cry for help  
It's goodbye, I wish you well  
Because I love you I had to kill myself.  
  
I'm gonna clean the house  
I'm gonna fix that fence  
In my final hours, I'm gonna tie up these loose ends
