When I think about you  
I think about how much I miss you  
When you're not around  
  
When I think about you  
I think about how much I can't wait  
To hear the sound of your laughter  
Time and distance never matter  
  
Well I miss you now  
I have so many questions  
About love and about pain  
About strained relationships  
About fame  
As only he could explain it to me  
  
Seems like yesterday  
I think about how much I  
Wish that you were here with me now  
The invisible girl  
That was my name  
She walks in and walks out  
And I'm sorry now  
I'm sorry now  
  
Well I miss you now  
I have so many questions  
About love and about pain  
About strained relationships  
About fame  
As only he could explain it to me  
  
Tell me again  
  
Paris to Rome  
London to Paris  
Always goodbye  
I nearly couldn't bear it  
Her heart settles down  
She's back on that staircase  
On the way up to her place  
  
I miss you now  
I have so many questions  
About love and about pain  
About strained relationships  
About fame  
Only he could explain it to me  
  
Tell me again  
  
Paris to Rome  
London to Paris  
Always goodbye  
I nearly couldn't bear it  
Her heart settles down  
She's back on that staircase  
On the way up to her place  
  
I miss you now  
I have so many questions  
About love and about pain  
About strained relationships  
About fame  
As only he could explain it to me  
  
I miss you now  
I miss you now  
Miss you now
