Manic depression is searching my soul  
I know what I want  
But I just don't know, honey  
How to go about getting it  
  
Feeling sweet feeling  
Drops from my fingers fingers  
Manic depression is captured my soul  
  
Woman so willing the sweet cause in vain  
You make love  
You break love  
It's a all the same, when it's  
When it's over  
  
Music sweet music  
I wish I could caress caress caress  
Manic depression is a frustrating mess  
Oh!  
  
Well I think I'll go turn myself off and a go on down  
All the way down  
Really ain't no use in me hanging around  
Oh, I gotta see you,  
  
Music sweet music  
I wish I could caress and a kiss kiss  
Manic depression is a frustrating mess  
  
Owh!  
Owh!  
  
Music sweet music sweet music  
Sweet music  
Sweet music  
Hooo....depress
