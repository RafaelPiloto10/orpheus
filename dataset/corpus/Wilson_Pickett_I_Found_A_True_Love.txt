I found a true love, I swear by the stars above  
I know she's mine, mine, all mine  
I found a true love, I call her Magnolia  
I know she's mine, mine, all mine  
One more, one more thing  
She don't try to play the field, she got a love that's real  
And that makes her mine, mine, all mine  
She's got the kind of thing about her  
That makes me can't do without her  
And ah, she's mine, mine, all mine  
When I get up in the mornin'  
(Do, do, do)  
With all my might, lord have mercy  
And I give her good lovin', do, yes I do, child  
Soothe her all the time, oh yeah  
She picked me up, oh yes she did  
I'm a-fallin' on down, oh yeah  
Ah she placed my feet, y'all, oh yeah  
Placed 'em on solid ground  
And I can shout about her, yeah  
And she's mine, mine, mine  
Ah, lord have mercy
