Love Has Come of Age  
Kenny Loggins  
(This Is It)  
The many times you've learned the lines  
That love has spoken  
So easily you love to leave  
Your heart's unbroken  
You've opened up a hundred eyes  
And given them a point of view  
Now think about the times you knew  
And hold them up to me and you  
Love has come of age  
You close your eyes and  
Fantasize a lost horizon  
A memory, a gentle breeze for love  
To ride in,  
But in your dreams you turned arouind  
And stumbled on a Shangri-la,  
You'll never be along anymore,  
'Cause brother now you've gone too far  
Love has come of age  
I'll stop by by tomorrow  
I'll stop by by tonight  
I'll stop by by morning. Momma  
It's alright.  
If a gigolo's what you're after  
You'll have to hold on tight  
Bye bye bye, later, baby  
Make it, make it right
