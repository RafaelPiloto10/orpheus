  
  
I'm waiting for my visit  
They'll fill this room with flowers an' all  
They'll put on their biggest smile  
But only for a while  
  
If only I could help it  
If only mercy'd be on my side  
I wouldn't have to die  
And my family wouldn't cry  
  
But the pain is getting far to strong  
And the medicine won't hold for long  
It's getting closer  
So I'm waiting for someone to come  
To come and take my soul where it belongs  
But no one's coming no one  
  
So I'm calling heaven now  
I'm calling heaven now  
Calling heaven's hand  
So heaven help  
  
I try to find the aswer  
I try to find a reason why I  
I'm leaving them all behind  
But there's something I will find  
  
The blood's still running through my heart  
But my hairs are slowly falling apart  
And I just can't take it  
So I'm waiting for someone to come  
To come and take my soul where it belongs  
But no one's coming, no one  
  
So I'm calling heaven now  
I'm calling heaven now  
Calling heaven's hand  
So heaven help  
Yes I'm calling heaven...  
  
I see it in their faces  
They know I'll be leaving tonight  
But somewhere down the line  
I'm sure we'll meet again  
Somewhere down the line  
I'm sure we'll meet again
