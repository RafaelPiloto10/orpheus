Now an' then, there's a fool such as I  
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, when we say goodbye  
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry  
When you're gone I will dream a little dream as years go by  
Now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I  
Now an' then there's a fool such as I am over you  
You taught me how to love an' now you say that we are through  
I am a fool, but I love you dear, yes I will, until the day I die  
Now an' then there's a fool such as I  
  
Pardon me, pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye  
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry  
When you're gone, when you're gone  
I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by  
Now an' then, now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I  
Now an' then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you  
You taught me how to love an' now you say that we are through  
I am a fool, yes but I love you dear  
I will love you dear, until the day, until the day I die  
Now an' then, now an' then there's a fool, a fool such as I  
Now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I  
Now an' then, there's a fool such as I
