Strong on the outside,  
But coming apart at the seams, that's me  
Tragically always together,  
But bruised underneath, that's me  
  
I stand just to stumble,  
Tripping on my pride,  
Why do I always try to hide  
  
Meanwhile, back at my heart,  
I'm desperate for all that you are,  
Undo me, take me apart  
  
Meanwhile, back at my soul,  
Mend me Lord, please make me whole,  
You know just where to start,  
Back at my heart, back at my heart  
  
Patiently waiting to pick up the pieces of me, that's you,  
Healer of hearts, when the world leaves it broken in two, that's you,  
  
Maker of Heaven, sky and the sea,  
You stretched you reached for me, you reached for me  
  
Meanwhile, back at my heart,  
I'm desperate for all that you are,  
Undo me, take me apart  
  
Meanwhile, back at my soul,  
Mend me Lord, please make me whole,  
You know just where to start,  
  
Back at my heart, back at my fear,  
Back at my brokenness, Lord meet me here,  
No one's opposed, I'm not afraid anymore.  
  
I'm desperate for all that you are,  
Undo me, take me apart  
  
Meanwhile back at my soul,  
Mend me Lord, please make me whole,  
You know just where to start,  
Back at my heart  
  
Back at my heart, back at my heart, back at my heart,  
  
Healer of hearts when the world leaves it broken in two, that's you
