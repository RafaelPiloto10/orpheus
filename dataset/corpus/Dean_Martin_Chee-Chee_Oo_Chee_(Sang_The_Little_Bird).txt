(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
Once on a tree top tall a little bird  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
Sang out the sweetest song I ever heard  
  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(He sang to me so merrily)  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(The little birdie on the tree)  
  
Life's such a lovely thing it seemed to say  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
If you'd only sing your cares away  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
Chee chee-oo chee so merrily it went along  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
Chee chee-oo chee so happily his little song  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
And so (and so) I sing (I sing)  
Chee chee-oo chee the happy happy little thing  
  
If you (if you) feel blue (feel blue)  
Sing chee chee-oo chee and you can be as happy too  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
Sing this happy little song  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
Chee chee-oo chee  
Chee chee-oo chee it sang to me so merrily  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
Chee chee-oo chee the little birdie on the tree  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(If you feel blue)  
Sing chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee and you can be as happy too  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
(Chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee)  
Sing this happy little song  
(Sing chee chee-oo chee, chee chee-oo chee and you can be as happy as can be)
