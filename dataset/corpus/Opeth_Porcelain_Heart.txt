I, lost all I had (one April day)  
I, turned to my friends (nothing to see)  
I, wrote down a name (and read it twice)  
I, wallow in shame  
  
I, said that I love (eternal skis)  
I, cling to my past (like childish dreams)  
I, promised to stay (and dwell my grief)  
I, went far away  
  
I see red spilled 'neath my feet  
Lead me through wastelands of deceit  
Rest your head now, don't you cry  
Don't ever ask the reason why  
  
Kept inside our idle race  
Grow seven idols, false embrace  
Rest your head now don't you cry  
Don't ever ask the reason why
