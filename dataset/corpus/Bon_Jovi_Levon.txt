Levon wears his war wound like a crown  
He calls his child Jesus'cause he likes the name  
And he sends him in the finest school in town.  
  
Levon, Levon likes his money  
He makes a lot they say  
Spends his days counting  
In a garage by the motorway.  
  
He was born a pauper  
To a pawn on a Christmas Day  
When the New York Times  
Say God is dead and war's begun.  
Alvin Tostig Has a son today.  
  
And he shall be Levon  
And he shall be a good man.  
And he shall be Levon.  
In tradition with the family plan  
And he shall be Levon.  
And he shall be a good man.  
He shall be Levon.  
  
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town.  
His family business thrives.  
Jesus blows up balloons all day,  
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly.  
And, Jesus he wants to go to Venus.  
Leave Levon far behind.  
Take a balloon and go sailing,  
While Levon, Levon slowly dies.  
  
And he shall be Levon  
And he shall be a good man.  
He shall be Levon....
