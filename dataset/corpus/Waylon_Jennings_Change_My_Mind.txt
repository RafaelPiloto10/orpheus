If I should get a look of leavin' in my eyes  
Put your arms 'round me, woman, and change my mind  
If I ever seem too restless or dissatisfied  
Put your arms 'round me, woman, and change my mind  
Don't let me separate your love from mine  
Don't let me leave you, I might get the urge some time  
If I do, you'll know what to do to keep me by your side  
Put your arms 'round me, baby, and change my mind  
If the gay life of the barrooms beckons me at night  
Put your arms 'round me, baby, and change my mind  
And if a new love ever tempts me that I should search to find  
Put your arms 'round me, woman, and change my mind  
Put your arms 'round me, woman, and change my mind
