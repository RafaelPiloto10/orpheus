Frank butler:  
I've had my way with so many girls  
An' was lots of fun.  
My system was to know many girls  
To keep me safe from one  
I find it can't be done.  
My defenses are down  
She's broken my resistance  
And I don't know where I am  
I went into the fight like a lion  
But I came out like a lamb.  
My defenses are down  
She's got me where she wants me  
And I can't escape no how  
I could speak to my heart when it weakened  
But my heart won't listen now.  
Like a toothless, clawless tiger,  
Like an organ-grinder's bear,  
Like a knight without his armor,  
Like Samson without his hair.  
My defenses are down  
I might as well surrender  
For the battle can't be won.  
But I must confess that I like it,  
So there's nothing to be done.  
Yes, I must confess that I like it  
Being miserable's gonna be fun  
  
Male chorus:  
His defenses are down  
She's broken my resistance  
And he's in an awful jam.  
  
Frank butler:  
I went into the fight like a lion  
  
Male chorus:  
But you came out like a lamb.  
  
Frank butler:  
My defenses are down  
  
Male chorus:  
She's got you where she wants you  
And you can't escape no how

My defenses are down

So there's nothing to be done.
