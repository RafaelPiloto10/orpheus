Reality is something that you rise above  
We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are  
Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run  
The fearful fall foul of fate as often as the reckless  
  
You don't need money to be rich anyhow  
Spending yourself is what it's all about  
  
No tears  
No lies  
No pain  
No doubt  
No darkness  
No confusion  
No loneliness, despair  
No more, no more  
It's all illusion  
  
If you have made mistakes  
There's always another chance for you  
You can start over again at any moment  
Any little time you choose  
  
Talk about failure  
To fall is not to fail  
Failure isn't about falling down  
Failure is staying down  
  
Energy makes energy anyhow  
Spend yourself and get rich right now  
  
No tears  
No lies  
No pain  
No doubt  
No darkness  
No confusion  
No loneliness, despair  
No way, no how  
It's all illusion  
  
Reality is something that you rise above  
We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are  
There's always another chance for you  
You can start over again  
Start over again  
Over again  
Any little time you choose  
Get rich right now
