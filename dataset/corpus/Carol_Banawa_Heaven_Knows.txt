He's always on my mind  
From the time I wake up  
Till I close my eyes  
He's everywhere I go  
He's all I know  
Though he's so far away  
It just keeps getting stronger everyday  
And even now he's gone  
I'm still holding on  
So tell me, where do I start  
Coz it's breaking' my heart  
Don't want to let her go  
[CHORUS:]  
Maybe my love will come back someday  
Only heaven knows  
And maybe our hearts will find a way  
But only heaven knows  
And all I can do is hope and pray  
Coz heaven knows  
My friends keep telling me  
That if you really love him  
You've got to set him free  
And if he returns in time  
I'll know he's mine  
But tell me where do I start  
Coz it's breaking my heart  
Don't want to let her go  
Repeat chorus except last line  
[BRIDGE:]  
Coz heaven knows  
Why I live in despair  
Coz wide awake or dreaming  
I know he's never there  
And all the time I act so brave  
I'm shaking inside  
Why does it hurt me so?  
[REPEAT CHORUS]  
Heaven knows? Heaven knows.
