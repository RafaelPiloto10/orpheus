All this energy callin' me  
Back where it comes from  
It's such a crude attitude  
It's back where it belongs  
  
All the little kids goin' up on the skits go  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Jumpin' Jane Jean, and moonin' James Dean go  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
  
Momma knows, but she don't care,she's got her worries too  
Seven kids, and a phony affair, and the rent is due  
  
All the little chicks with the crimson lips go  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Livin' in sin with a safety pin goin'  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
  
I got some records from World War II  
I play 'em just like me grand dad do  
  
He was a rocker, and I am too  
Now Cleveland rocks, Now Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks!  
OHIO
