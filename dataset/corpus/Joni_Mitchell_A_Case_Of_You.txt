Just before our love got lost you said  
"I am as constant as a northern star" and I said,  
"Constantly in the darkness  
Where's that at?  
If you want me I'll be in the bar"  
  
On the back of a cartoon coaster  
In the blue TV screen light  
I drew a map of Canada  
Oh Canada  
With your face sketched on it twice  
  
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine  
You taste so bitter  
And so sweet oh  
I could drink a case of you darling and I would  
Still be on my feet  
Oh I would still be on my feet  
  
Oh I am a lonely painter  
I live in a box of paints  
I'm frightened by the devil  
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid  
I remember that time that you told me, you said  
"Love is touching souls"  
Surely you touched mine 'cause  
Part of you pours out of me  
In these lines from time to time  
  
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine  
You taste so bitter  
And so sweet oh  
I could drink a case of you darling  
Still I'd be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet  
  
I met a woman  
She had a mouth like yours, she knew your life  
She knew your devils and your deeds and she said  
"Go to him  
stay with him if you can  
But be prepared to bleed"  
  
Oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine  
You're so bitter  
bitter and so sweet oh  
I could drink a case of you darling  
Still I'd be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet  
hmm
