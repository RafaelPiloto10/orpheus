Thinking of the faces I've seen  
Back when I was young and green  
I was falling back then  
Now I'm workin' on building a fire  
And flirtin' with that ol' desire  
And fallin' again into the wind  
I fall in love again, I'm fallin' again  
Well you'd think that I would learn by now  
To keep from falling somehow  
But I'm fallin' again  
'Cause when I caught that look in your eyes  
That's when I realized  
I was fallin' again into the wind  
I fall in love again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
I fall in love again  
Fallin' again into the wind  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
I fall in love again  
Fallin' again into the wind
