I got more than I asked for,  
There ain't nothin' I need.  
I took all 'til I had more,  
I'm always takin' the lead  
  
Old man shakin' dice down on the street,  
Try'n to make a livin' somehow  
But I'm really sure about gettin' things sorted out  
And I'm gettin' ready right now  
  
You can't hold me,  
I have told you  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life  
  
I've been called by many names  
And all of them are bad  
I can take it all the same,  
It's all I've ever had  
  
I've got somethin' that you can't get  
But one thing you can see  
Gettin' there ain't easy  
But it sure was hard for me  
  
You can't hold me,  
I have told you  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life  
  
Every time I take a look  
There's someone close behind  
They never used to make a pass,  
The things that crossed their minds  
  
Now they tell me that it's all right  
And they want to be my friend  
They're ridin' on my back  
When is it goin' to end?  
  
You can't hold me,  
I have told you  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life  
  
Got more than I asked for,  
Got more than I need  
Got more than I asked for,  
Got more than I need  
Got more than I asked for,  
Got more than I need
