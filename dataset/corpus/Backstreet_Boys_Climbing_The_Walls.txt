Close your eyes, make a wish  
This could last forever  
If only you could stay with me now  
So tell me what it is, that keeps us from each other now  
Yeah, it's coming to get me  
You're under my skin  
  
[Chorus]  
No I can't let you go  
You're a part of me now  
Caught by the taste of your kiss  
And I don't want to know the reason why I can't stay forever like this  
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you  
  
Take my hand, take my life  
Just don't take forever  
And let me feel your pain kept inside (ohh yeah)  
There's gotta be a way, you and I together now  
Yeah it's comin' to get me  
You're under my skin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's an illusion, how can I feel this way?  
(if I can't have you)  
It's an illusion, nothing is real this way  
(if I can't have you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't let you go, no  
And I don't want to know the reason why  
I can't stay forever like this (no no)  
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss (I miss you) you
