(Creedence Clearwater Revival)  
  
737 coming out of the sky  
Oh won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride  
I want to move  
  
Playing in a travelling band, ee-ya!  
Well I'm flying across land  
Trying to get a hand  
Playing in a travelling band  
  
Take me to the hotel baggage car no where  
Come on come on won't you get me to my room  
I want to move  
  
Playing in a travelling band, ee-ya!  
Well I'm flying across the land  
Trying to get a hand  
Playing in a travelling band  
  
Listen to the radio talking about the last show  
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia  
I want to move  
  
Playing in a travelling band, ee-ya!  
Well I'm flying across the land  
Trying to get a hand  
Playing in a travelling band, Oh-wow!  
  
(solo)  
  
(use walking bass)  
  
Hell will come again on a Saturday night  
Oh with your fussing and your fighting  
Won't you get me to the right  
I want to move  
  
Playing in a travelling band, ee-ya!  
Well I'm flying across the land  
Trying to get a hand  
Playing in a travelling band, oh-wow!  
  
(guitar solo)  
  
Oh I'm playing in a travelling band  
Playing in a travelling band  
Won't you get me, take me hand  
Well I'm playing in a travelling band  
Well I'm flying across the land  
Trying to get a hand  
Playing in a travelling band, oh-wow!  
  
Hey!
