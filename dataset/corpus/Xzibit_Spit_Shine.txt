I ma' clean this whole shit out like colonics  
With words put together better than Sony electronics  
King of the jungle, humbly stay honest  
Eat with the lions, swim with pyranhas  
Gasoline the seem, strike the match  
Inferno, I'm too thorough nigga' so stand back  
(Oof!)  
I spit shine, get mine and rip rhymes  
And make my career take an incline  
I'm strict with knives, straight with razors  
Good with grenades and great with gauges  
Been around the world in a million stages  
Watch niggas bitch up and go through changes  
I had guns before thugs was in fashion  
I mashed out before niggas knew mashin'  
I knew terror before the plane started crashin'  
I got punch lines and niggas ain't laughin'  
I'm gon' be here after the smoke die down  
Insomnia style, I won't lie down  
Fight the good fight, don't need no help  
Keep your hands up, defend yo' self  
Move like I move and live life long  
Can't move up if ya' heart not strong  
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shits mine  
(Yeah)  
Every time I spit I shine  
Cocksucka' I preach what I practise, back shit up  
Wrap this rap shit up, still actin' up  
Get found in a trunk of an Acura  
Y'all suck like jail and Dracula  
X turn up the heat, increase the hatred  
Straight stone faced don't fuck wit gay shit  
So I guess that means I can't fuck wit you now  
Two down, let off, vacate to new town  
It feel like Bishop and juice now  
Got a flame thrower that'll burn big holes through your goose down  
(Yeah!)  
Rough sound, same strong background  
Been on black, the big boys layin' chips down  
My whole train of thought is  
To bully any mothafucker wit problems and not get caught  
I was blessed with life but I curse to death  
I'm a spit to my very last breath, fuck y'all  
I'm gon' be here after the smoke die down  
Insomnia style, I won't lie down  
Fight the good fight, don't need no help  
Keep your hands up, defend yo' self  
Move like I move and live life long  
Can't move up if ya' heart not strong  
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shits mine  
Every time I spit I shine  
Let me give this a three second look, I hit a million dollar target  
You ain't came up yet, well nigga' let me show ya'  
Come across dope like planes and boats  
Like balloons filled with Coke down a mexican's throat  
You ever seen a man get smoked, they shit on they self  
Their body shake for a second then it gets dissected  
For evidence of the weapon and the people involved  
Let one nigga' talk, everybody gettin' caught fa sho'  
I say that to say this  
(What?)  
If you can't handle the time then ride the bitch  
Might as well touch ya' tail and jump the fence  
Castrate ya' self, expose the bitch  
X go head up, but fuck, never ran from it  
I got a gauge with buck shot that you can't stomach  
You ain't a killa, you a album filla  
You ain't a soldier, you a rap promoter, game over  
I'm gon' be here after the smoke die down  
Insomnia your style, I won't lie down  
Fight the good fight, don't need no help  
Keep your hands up, defend yo' self  
Move like I move and live life long  
Can't move up if ya' heart not strong  
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shits mine  
Every time I spit I shine
