We've got our little fingers workin' hard  
On the trains and dolls and cars  
Hurryin' 'cause Santa's a-waitin'  
Soldiers marchin' out the door  
Carryin' the toys galore  
For Santa's reindeer ride  
This is more than just another reindeer ride  
Not a practice run in July  
We've got to load up all the festive gear  
Peace, and hope, and yuletide cheer  
For Santa's reindeer ride  
Polish the runners, shine Rudolph's nose  
Tighten the harness, brush off the snow  
We'd love to sing our little working songs,  
Wish that we could tag along  
Just to see the children's faces  
Tonight the world is filled with joy,  
Deeper than the games and toys  
It's time to load up the sleigh.  
Tonight the world is filled with joy,  
Deeper than the games and toys  
It's time to load up the sleigh. (It's time to load up the sleigh).  
For Santa's reindeer ride.
