We're all gonna die  
When I was a very young boy, mamma told me we all gonna die  
Mamma said son love can't be trusted, it's just another weakness  
We all gonna die  
  
[Chorus :]  
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie,  
We're all gonna die  
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie  
We all gonna die  
  
Now I'm grown, seen a lot livin', made a few friends  
Gonna get high, hoping I don't take more than I'm given  
Judgement day comin', we all gonna die  
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Baby getting born, old man die'n  
Young lady laughin', old woman cryin'  
Leaving like a lamb, comin' back like a lion  
Babylon to Zion, we're all gonna die  
  
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die  
When I was a very young boy mamma told me, we're all gonna die  
Mama said, son, love can't be trusted  
Its just another weakness, we're all gonna die  
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die  
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
