He was black and handsome  
And mighty mighty brave  
Comin' from the backwoods  
The grandson of a slave  
He was caught for something  
They knew he'd never done  
And he was diggin' ditches  
Out in the burnin' sun  
  
[Chorus]  
Working on the chain gang-No More  
Working on the chain gang-No More  
Working on the chain gang-No More  
Working on the chain gang-No More  
No more, no more, no more  
  
Man he was a giant  
And iron he could bend  
And he swore he'd fight them  
Down to the bitter end  
Though he was no talker  
His burnin' eyes would say  
You may keep on tryin'  
Can't hold me no way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And one night he lay in waiting  
Hit the guard and took the key  
And before the others caught him  
He jumped out and he was free  
He jumped out and he was free  
  
He made for the swamp lands  
It seemed a hopeless duel  
They had dogs and shotguns  
And they were mighty cruel  
But they couldn't find him  
He was too smart and strong  
Hiding' in the daytime  
Wandering all night long  
  
Working on the chain gang-No More [Repeat: x6]
