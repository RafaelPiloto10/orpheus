I will light the match this mornin' so I won't be alone  
Watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone  
Oh I will stand arms outstretched pretend I'm free to roam  
Oh I will make my way through one more day in, hell  
How much difference does it make  
How much difference does it make yeah  
  
I will hold the candle till it burns up my arm  
Oh I'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired  
Oh I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind  
Hey, I won't change direction, and I won't change my mind  
How much difference does it make  
How much difference does it make, how much difference  
  
I'll swallow poison, until I grow immune  
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room  
How much difference  
How much difference does it make
