Addicted To Butts  
(Addicted To Love - Robert Palmer)  
  
You hack and gag  
You cough and wheeze  
You climb the stairs  
On hands and knees  
Your heart pounds  
Your teeth grind  
Another smoke  
And you'll be fine  
  
You'd you like to think that you could quit when you want  
Oh, yeah  
It's closer to the truth 3 packs a day ain't enough  
You know your gonna have to face it  
You're addicted to butts  
  
Might as well face it you're addicted to butts  
Might as well face it you're addicted to butts  
Might as well face it you're addicted to butts  
Might as well face it you're addicted to butts  
  
You're really hooked  
You're such a fiend  
Your lungs are tar  
And nicotine  
Your will is broke  
Your face is lined  
You're blowing smoke  
Out your behind  
  
You think that Dr. Koop is just an overpaid quack  
Oh, yeah  
But you hate to read his message on the side of the pack  
You know you're gonna' have to face it  
You're addicted to butts  
  
Might as well face it you're addicted to butts  
Might as well face it you're addicted to butts  
Might as well face it you're addicted to butts  
Might as well face it you're addicted to butts  
Might as well face it you're addicted to butts
