Each time I hold somebody new  
My arms go cold thinking of you  
No one can take your place, darling, in my embrace  
I'll never be free  
  
And when my lips burn with desire  
No other kiss can put out the fire  
Though I may try and try, no one can satisfy  
This longing in me  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never be free from your smile so tender  
The sweet surrender in your eyes  
How can I be free when I still remember?  
How you could thrill me with a sigh  
Just like a chain bound to my heart  
Your love remains while we're apart  
  
Each kiss I gave to you  
Made me a slave to you  
I'll never be free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That kiss I gave to you  
Made me a slave to you  
I'll never be free
