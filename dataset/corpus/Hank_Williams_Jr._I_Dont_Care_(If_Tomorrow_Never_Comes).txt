I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
This world holds nothing for me  
I've been lonely night and day ever since you went away  
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
  
If tomorrow never comes and the sun don't ever shine  
It won't matter with me  
For when she left away my world ended that day  
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
  
My lonely mind goes back to days that used to be  
My broken heart cries out for you  
Oh if I can't have you here I can't go on my dear  
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
  
If tomorrow never comes...  
George when she left away poor Hank my world ended that day  
I don't care if tomorrow never comes
