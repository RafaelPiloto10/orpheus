In a little town down south  
There's little plow board house  
With a wolf outside the door  
And in the bedroom there's a light  
Its been staying on all night  
For at least a month or more  
The heartaches and the bills keep coming due  
And with all they're going through  
  
[Chorus]  
Its no small miracle that love hangs on  
Hearts get weary when hope is gone  
In a world where roses wither and die  
Its no small miracle when love survives  
  
It's been uphill for a while  
But he still makes her smile  
Every now and then  
Lately they been finding out  
It's the little things that count  
And they do what they can  
He tells her he loves her everyday  
She says things will be ok  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a world where roses wither and die  
It's no small miracle when love survives
