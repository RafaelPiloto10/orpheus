Listen everybody, especially you girls  
You liked to be left alone  
By the one you love, never phone  
  
I love to holler  
My friends sometimes say  
That I believe, I believe  
That a woman should love that way  
  
Well it hurts me so inside  
I see I treat you so unkind  
Somebody somewhere  
I tell ya it ain't fair  
  
Can I get a witness?  
(Can I get a witness?)

(Can I get a witness?)  
Somewhere

A little bit louder, baby

Well it hurts me so inside  
To see love to be so unkind  
Somebody somewhere  
Tell ya, it ain't fair  
  
Up early in the morning  
(Can I get a witness?)  
With it on my mind  
(Can I get a witness?)

(Can I get a witness?)  
If the love is [Incomprehensible]

Somebody somewhere
