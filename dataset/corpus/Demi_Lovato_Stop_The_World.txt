I don't know why, I don't know why  
I'm so afraid (so afraid)  
I don't know how, I don't know how  
To fix the pain (fix the pain)  
  
We're livin' a lie, livin' a lie  
This need to change (need to change)  
Were out of time, were out of time,  
And its still the same  
  
[Chorus]  
We can't stop the world,  
But there's so much more that we can do.  
You can't stop this girl from falling more in love with you.  
You said nobody has to know give us time to grow and take it slow.  
But I'd stop the world  
If they finally let us be alone.  
Let us be alone.  
I'd stop the world  
  
I'm  
Hearin' the noise, hearin' the noise  
From all around (from all around)  
I'm on edge, I'm on edge  
  
Of breakin' down (breakin' down)  
Like Bonnie and Clyde,  
Let's find a ride  
And ditch this town.  
  
To keep it alive, keep it alive  
Don't make a sound.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never wanna take that final look,  
I'll turn another page  
Won't close the book.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let us be alone  
Alone, ooh, ooh, weee-ah. Alone.
