In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're close to me  
I could see  
That moment of truth when you spoke to me  
In my world  
It's never too late we can both be free  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're near  
If you knew  
The changes I feel that you put me through  
And you do  
I see in your eyes that you really do  
And it's true  
It happened so fast that it must be true  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're near  
And I'm only just beginning  
To believe what you have done  
How you turned it upside down  
This world of mine  
And it seems while I was looking  
It was right in front of me  
All the time  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're close to me  
I could see  
That moment of truth when you spoke to me  
In my world  
It's never too late we can both be free  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're near  
Cause I'm only just beginning  
To believe what you have done  
How you turned it upside down  
This world of mine  
And it seems while I was looking  
It was right in front of me  
All the time  
If you knew  
The changes I feel that you put me through  
And you do  
I see in your eyes that you really do  
And it's true  
It happened so fast that it must be true  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're near
