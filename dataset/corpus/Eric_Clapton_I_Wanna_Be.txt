I wander helplessly day by day  
It's so much easier to run away  
My mind is spent, my body sold  
Never knowing which way to go  
  
I'm always there for you, baby  
Won't you let me see  
If we can get closer every day  
  
I wanna be felt by you  
I wanna be touched by you  
I wanna be loved by you  
I wanna be anything you want me to  
  
Don't mean nothing when you're growing old  
Nobody knows what the future holds  
I am left with a bitter taste  
Torn away from that beautiful chase  
  
But I'm always there for you baby  
Won't you let me see  
If we can get closer every day  
  
I wanna be felt by you  
I wanna be touched by you  
I wanna be loved by you  
I wanna be anything you want me to  
  
I wanna be felt by you  
I wanna be touched by you  
I wanna be loved by you  
I wanna be anything you want me to  
  
I wanna be felt by you  
I wanna be touched by you  
I wanna be loved by you  
I wanna be anything you want me to  
  
I wanna be
