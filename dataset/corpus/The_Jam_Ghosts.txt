Why are you frightened can't you see that it's you  
That ain't no ghost it's a reflection of you  
Why do you turn away an' keep it out of sight  
Oh don't live up to your given roles  
There's more inside you that you won't show  
  
But you keep it hidden just like everyone  
You're scared to show you care it'll make you vulnerable  
So you wear that ghost around you for disguise  
  
But there's no need just 'cause it's all we've known  
There's more inside you that you haven't shown  
  
So keep on moving, moving, moving your feet  
Keep on shuf-shuf-shuffling to this ghost dance beat  
Just keep on walking down never ending streets  
  
One day you'll walk right out of this life  
And then you'll wonder why you didn't try  
  
To spread some loving all around  
Old fashioned causes like that still stand  
Gotta rid this prejudice that ties you down  
  
How do you feel at the end of the day  
Just like you've waked over your own grave  
  
So why are you frightened can't you see that it's you  
At the moment there's nothing so there's nothing to lose  
Lift up your lonely heart and walk right on through
