I don't know if words can say  
But darlin' I'll find a way  
To let you know what you mean to me  
I guess it was meant to be  
  
Now I hold you in my heart  
As my life's most precious part  
Oh darlin'  
I dream about you often my pretty darlin'  
  
I love the way you soften my life with your love  
Your precious love, oh  
Now I was living like half a man  
And then I couldn't love but now I can  
  
You pick me up when I'm feeling sad  
You give me soul I never had  
I'm gonna love you every single night  
'Cause I think you're outta sight  
  
Oh darlin'  
I dream you often my pretty darlin'  
I love the way you soften my life with your love  
Your precious love, oh, oh  
  
I'm crazy but I wake up in the dead of night  
I think some other fella's gonna hold you tight  
What would life be like without you by my side  
I'm crazy but I worry 'bout you day and night  
  
Oh  
Ooh darlin'  
Ooh  
Oh darlin'  
  
I dream about you often my pretty darlin'  
Love the way you soften my life with your love  
Your precious love oh, oh  
You soften my life with your precious love, oh  
  
I love the way you soften my life with your love  
I love the way you soften my life with your love  
Oh darlin'  
I love the way you soften my life  
  
With your love  
Oh darlin'  
I worry all about you darlin'  
Couldn't live without you darlin'  
  
I worry all about you darlin', yeah  
Crazy all about you darlin'  
Oh darlin'
