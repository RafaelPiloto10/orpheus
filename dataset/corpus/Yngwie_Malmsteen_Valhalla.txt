Valhalla,  
Valhalla  
Pick up your sword  
Pick up your sword  
And get your ass on to the battle field  
This hell on earth  
That you call your life  
We'll snuff it out  
And you're gonna die  
We come from the north  
We come from the ice  
We live dangerously  
And very short lives  
We fight day by day  
Sailing the seas  
We're natural born slayers  
We live by the sword  
And die by the sword  
We're never afraid  
And to drink with the gods  
To be singing their songs  
I raise my cup in valhalla  
To feast in their halls  
And laugh with them all  
I raise my cup in valhalla  
Valhalla  
You live by the sword  
You die by the sword  
The hammer of Thor  
Beating you down  
The thunder crashing  
Through your door  
With the gods by our side  
We follow the stars  
As we're sailing into  
This holy war  
We come from the north  
We come from the ice  
We live dangerously  
And very short lives  
We fight day by day  
Sailing the seas  
We're natural born slayers  
We live by the sword  
And die by the sword  
We're never afraid  
And to drink with the gods  
To be singing their songs  
I raise my cup in valhalla  
To feast in their halls  
And laugh with them all  
I raise my cup in valhalla  
Valhalla  
We live by the sword  
And die by the sword  
Valhalla  
Valhalla  
Valhalla  
We come from the north  
We come from the ice  
We live dangerously  
And very short lives  
We fight day by day  
Sailing the seas  
We're natural born slayers  
We live by the sword  
And die by the sword  
We're never afraid  
And to drink with the gods  
To be singing
