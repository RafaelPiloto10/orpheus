Your love is like a tidal wave, spinning over my head  
Drownin' me in your promises, better left unsaid  
You're the right kind of dreamer, to release my inner fantasy  
The invincible winner, and you know that you were born to be  
  
[Chorus]  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, a love taker  
Don't you mess around with me  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, a love taker  
Don't you mess around, no no no  
  
Your love has set my soul on fire, burnin' out of control  
You taught me the ways of desire, now it's takin' its toll  
You're the right kind of sinner, to release my inner fantasy  
The invincible winner, and you know that you were born to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, no  
  
You're the right kind of sinner, to release my inner fantasy  
The invincible winner, you know that you were born to be  
  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, love taker  
Don't you mess around with me  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, love taker  
Don't you mess around with me  
  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, love taker  
Don't you mess around with me  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, love taker
