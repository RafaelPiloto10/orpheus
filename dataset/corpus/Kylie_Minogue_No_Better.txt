Ah ah Ah ah Ah ah  
Wonder in you're wilderness  
Close enough take a breath  
Closer still touch you're skin  
Open up (open up)  
Let me in  
Don't you know you're taking me down  
You're making me high  
My life's turned around  
Now safe me tonight  
No better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uh uh there's no better love  
Follow up my fantasies  
So nice ment to be  
Nicer still what's to come  
Take a ride (take a ride)  
Come undone  
Don't you know you're taking me down  
You're making me high  
My life's turned around  
Now safe me tonight  
No better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uhh there's no better love  
No better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uh uh there's no better love  
(don't you know you're taking me down  
Youre making me high  
My life's turned around  
Now safe me tonight)  
Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm Ah ah mm  
Don't you know you're no better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uhh there's no better love  
No better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uh uh there's no better love  
No better love, no better love
