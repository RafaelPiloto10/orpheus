I need no redefine  
All the things I hate today  
Politics that fail  
From a president derailed  
I hate the shit economy  
I might as well be sodomy  
I know that in the end  
I'm expected to pretend  
  
But I can't relate  
To your verbal idiocy  
No one's in control  
When the government's the enemy  
  
So light the fuse  
Impose your views  
Consfearacy  
Is anarchy  
  
Actions of hostility  
Breeds conformity  
Annihilation will begin  
Extermination from within  
  
So light the fuse  
Impose your views  
Consfearacy  
Insanity  
  
I need no redefine  
How I see the world today  
Seems that all the war  
Didn't even up the score  
It's only mind pollution  
There is no resolution  
Still I know that in the end  
I'm expected to pretend  
That I can't think for myself  
Blame it all on someone else  
Half-hearted smile  
While you look the other way  
I can't relate  
To your verbal idiocy  
No one's in control  
When the government's the enemy  
  
So light the fuse  
Impose your views  
Consfearacy  
Complacency  
Is your demise
