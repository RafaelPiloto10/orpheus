Yeah!  
Slow French kissing with the Dauphin's daughter  
If I fall in love now I'll be floating in Seine  
Plastered in Paris I've had an Eiffel  
Gonna make my escape on the midnight train  
Choo, choo to you - Choo, choo to you - Charting the single  
Schnapping my fingers on an alcoholiday  
Sniff round a Fraulein when I'm scent to Cologne  
All night hotel Liebling make your mark  
Let sugar daddy melt in his home sweet home  
Home is where the heart lies, but if the heart lies  
Where is home, is where the heart lies, but where is home?  
  
Get a pizza the action when I Romeo again  
Chianti see you with me, so just let him wine  
Juliet on the balcony, it's pasta serenade  
Wedding rings, I know when Venice time, Venice time  
To chart the single, to chart the single  
  
Charting the single, charting the single  
The chicks are getting cheaper on the not so common market  
Stockpile experience before the blond hairs turn to grey  
Before the blond hairs turn to grey  
I like to train, express myself in the universal language  
Ego on my face in the nicest possible way  
It's absolutely the nicest possible way  
  
Charting the single  
I got no clause in my contract, got no shares in my name  
I'm just charting the single in a bachelor's game  
Charting the single  
It's a solo performance on a one way street  
You'll never have the chance again and never again we'll meet  
Charting, charting, charting, charting the single
