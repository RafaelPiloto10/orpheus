Every day's a new day  
That's what I've been told  
Try to hold your head high  
The world runs hot and cold  
  
It's hard to follow footprints  
in the shifting sand  
Another thirsty rider  
Behind the caravan  
  
You had no idea  
just what was waiting out there  
You never thought you'd carry the weight  
of the world  
On your pretty blond hair  
  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
To you, no Shangri-La  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
Nobody knows no Shangri-La  
  
Hey! There's a whole lotta people  
wonderin' who you are  
They think you walk without a care in the world  
But they've been wrong so far  
  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
To you, no Shangri-La  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
Nobody knows no Shangri-La  
  
No one can decide  
What we all must outrun  
Who's gonna carry the weight of the world  
Until we learn to stop  
and do what must be done?  
  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
To you, no Shangri-La  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
Nobody Knows no Shangri-La
