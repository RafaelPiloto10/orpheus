Well, you covered your tracks  
And now I can't see you  
You had your ashes scattered at sea  
There's no grave to visit, no tombstone to look at  
You were in the New York Times obituary  
There's no record, no tape, no book, no movie  
Some photographs and some memories  
Sometimes I dial your phone number by mistake  
And this is what I hear:  
This is no longer a working number, baby  
Please redial your call  
This is no longer a working number  
Your party doesn't live here anymore  
This is no longer a working number  
If you still require help  
Stay on the line, and an operator  
Will try to bail you out  
I knew I should have seen you that Thursday  
I knew I shouldn't have left  
But you sounded so good, your spirits so up  
I thought I'd see you next week  
I say over and over if I had half a brain  
If I had half a brain in my head  
I wouldn't sit here, dialing a wrong number  
And listening to what some recording said  
I knew I should have written, written things down  
I always say I'll never forget  
Who can forget a one-eyed pilot?  
Who's a concert pianist?  
A painter, a poet, songwriter supreme  
My friends are blending in my head  
They're melting into one great spirit  
And that spirit isn't dead  
Now, I may not remember everything that you said  
But I remember all the sings you've done  
And not a day goes by, not an hour  
When I don't try to be like you  
You were gassed, stoked, and rarin' to go  
And you were that way all the time  
So I guess you know why I'm laughing at myselves  
Every time I dial the wrong line  
This is no longer a working number, baby
