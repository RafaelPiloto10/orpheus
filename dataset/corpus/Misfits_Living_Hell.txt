Imprisoned in this world of darkness few have known  
A monster lusting blood and the hunger grows  
Out on the street, danger's real, the killer's still at large  
A trail of death through sewers to the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell  
  
This town has worn thin everybody knows  
Panic in the news and the terror grows  
A tunnel full of filth escape into the night  
Another hole to dwell in the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell  
  
In this living hell  
In this living hell  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell
