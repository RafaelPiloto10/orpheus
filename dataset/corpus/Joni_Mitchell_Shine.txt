Oh let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on Wall Street and Vegas  
Place your bets  
Shine on the fishermen  
With nothing in their nets  
Shine on rising oceans and evaporating seas  
Shine on our Frankenstein technologies  
Shine on science  
With its tunnel vision  
Shine on fertile farmland  
Buried under subdivisions  
  
Let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on the dazzling darkness  
That restores us in deep sleep  
Shine on what we throw away  
And what we keep  
  
Shine on Reverend Pearson  
Who threw away  
The vain old God  
kept Dickens and Rembrandt and Beethoven  
And fresh plowed sod  
Shine on good earth, good air, good water  
And a safe place  
For kids to play  
Shine on bombs exploding  
Half a mile away  
  
Let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on world-wide traffic jams  
Honking day and night  
Shine on another asshole  
Passing on the right!  
Shine on the red light runners  
Busy talking on their cell phones  
Shine on the Catholic Church  
And the prisons that it owns  
Shine on all the Churches  
They all love less and less  
Shine on a hopeful girl  
In a dreamy dress  
  
Let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on good humor  
Shine on good will  
Shine on lousy leadership  
Licensed to kill  
Shine on dying soldiers  
In patriotic pain  
Shine on mass destruction  
In some God's name!  
Shine on the pioneers  
Those seekers of mental health  
Craving simplicity  
They traveled inward  
Past themselves...  
May all their little lights shine
