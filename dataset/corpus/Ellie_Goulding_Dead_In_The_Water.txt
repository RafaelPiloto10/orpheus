If I was not myself  
And you were someone else  
I'd say so much to you  
And I would tell the truth  
It's high, can't hardly breathe  
  
When your hands let go of me  
The eyes say standing out  
And I feel things from selves  
  
I'm dead in the water  
Still looking for ya  
I'm dead in the water  
Can't you see, can't you see  
  
You've seen this all before  
Life left on the shore  
We're smiling all the same  
You sail away again  
  
I'm dead in the water  
Still looking for ya  
I'm dead in the water  
Can't you see, can't you see  
  
Oh yeah  
I'm dead in the water  
Still looking for ya  
I'm dead in the water  
Can't you see, can't you see  
  
I'm dead in the water  
Still looking for ya  
I'm dead in the water  
Can't you see, can't you see
