I was watching a movie, the other night on TV  
The actress reminded me of you  
Her attitude, the way that she smiled  
She was doin' a part girl, like you used to do  
  
I do believe you played it better  
If it wasn't better, it was just as strong  
I would've called you up on the telephone that night  
But somehow girl, it'd been all wrong  
  
I heard you married a stranger  
In a horse and carriage that was covered with gold  
Well, you wanted to be different and still fit in  
I wonder if you feel different at all now that you're older  
  
Hope you didn't lose that innocent laughter  
Oh, God I hope time didn't take that away  
All those junior high nights underneath the front porch light  
A good Catholic girl during the day  
  
Oh oh oh, just watching the time grow  
Old enough to know that these memories can't hurt a thing  
Oh oh oh, just watching the time grow  
If I saw you today, girl, I wouldn't even know ya  
  
Well, I know it wasn't that big of a love affair  
But boy, it sure seemed like one back then  
When I parlay the memories into their proper places  
I can see now, we were no more than friends  
  
Ooh, your kisses sure tasted sweet  
But I guess any kiss tastes sweet at fifteen  
I just hope your touch is as warm to your ol' man  
As it seemed like it was to me  
  
Oh oh oh, just watching the time grow  
Old enough to know that these memories can't hurt a thing  
Oh oh oh, just watching the time grow  
If I saw you today, girl, if I could be with you today  
I wouldn't even know ya
