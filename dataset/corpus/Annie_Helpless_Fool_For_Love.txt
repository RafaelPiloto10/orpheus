(verse)  
I saw you  
It was a rainy day in May or June  
I couldn't help it  
God, you looked so fine  
I just had to make you mine, all mine  
Well I'm a helpless fool for love  
Instantly  
I cannot eat nor sleep, no  
Hard to breathe  
You read my love so easy  
A, be, see  
Twist my mind around and 1, 2, 3  
Then I'm a helpless fool for...  
(chorus 1)  
Ah...  
When he walks (?)  
When he talks  
When he moves  
Makes my day  
I'm the helpless one  
Ah...  
Not unkind  
I don't mind  
When he talks  
Just a rush  
I'm a fool for love  
(verse)  
All shook up  
I know it's stupid to precipitate  
Without getting all humiliate  
Didn't know what I should say or do  
Everything I'll give to you and me (when I'm here without you)  
We're gonna have a riot  
Trust in me (I can't live without you)  
I'm gonna make you happy  
What you need (helpless fool without you)  
I'll give you everything  
I'll try to be (you know, you know, you know, you know, you know)  
Still your helpless fool for...  
(chorus 2)  
Ah...  
When he walks  
When he talks  
When he moves  
Makes me feel  
I'm a fool for love  
Ah...  
What a joy, you're my boy  
And it seems like a dream  
Now I'm all shook up  
Ah...  
Need you, Doctor Love  
Are you there?  
Every day I'm the helpless one  
Ah...  
Not unkind  
I don't mind  
When he talks  
Just a rush  
I'm a fool for love  
I am a helpless fool for love  
I am a helpless fool for love  
I am a helpless fool for love  
(chorus 2)  
I am a helpless fool for love
