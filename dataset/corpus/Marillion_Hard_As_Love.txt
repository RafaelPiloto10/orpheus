Well I hear that you were looking out to hunt me down  
And I guess you're used to having everything you want  
But you know that love can be as hard as sticks and stones  
I tell you nothing else can be as hard as love can  
  
Well I hear you got my number and you want my name  
I'm a stream of noughts and crosses in your are-A-M  
But you know that love can be as hard as algebra  
Baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love  
  
Hard as love  
  
Well I hear that you were lookin' out to take me home  
And I hear that you can handle it and you're not scared  
Have you heard about the pictures on my bedroom wall?  
Baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love  
  
Hard as love  
  
Well it makes you hungry and it makes you high  
It makes you suffer and it makes you cry  
But it's all worthwhile  
  
It makes you humble and it makes you crawl  
It makes you tremble and it makes you fall  
But it's all worthwhile  
  
It makes you desperate and it makes you dream  
It makes you dangerous and it makes you scream  
But it's all worthwhile  
Just lie back and smile  
  
"We will continue to love you even though the rest of the world hates you."  
  
It makes you hungry and it makes you high  
It makes you suffer and it makes you cry  
It makes you panic and it makes you vain  
It makes you primitive and sick inside  
It makes you angry and it makes you blind  
It makes you guilty and it makes you lie  
Tied up and beaten  
Spat out and eaten  
Suicidal  
Nothing's ever been as hard  
  
Well I hear that were lookin' out to change my faith  
You can bash me with your book of words, hammer me down  
But you know that love can be as hard as six inch nails  
Baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love  
  
Hard as love
