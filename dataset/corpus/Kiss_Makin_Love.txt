I just hate when the girl says wait  
I really want her by my side  
Don't hesitate  
I really want her by my side  
The whole night through  
We do all the things that we wanna do  
Well, come on baby, don't leave me sad  
Cause you're good lookin', the best I've had  
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)  
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long  
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)  
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long  
Ow, all night long  
  
Red light, green light, don't say "No"  
I really want her, she says  
"Stop, baby" go, go, go  
I really want her by my side  
The whole night through  
We do all the things that we wanna do  
Well, come on baby, don't leave me sad  
Cause you're good lookin', the best I've had  
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)  
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long  
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)  
Makin' love (makin' love) all night  
  
Whoo, makin' love (makin' love)  
All night long, makin' love (makin' love)  
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long  
  
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)  
Makin' love (makin' love) all night long  
Makin' love (makin' love), makin' love (makin' love)  
Makin' love (makin' love) all night, oh
