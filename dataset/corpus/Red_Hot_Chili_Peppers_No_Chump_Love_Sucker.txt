She's a witch  
A bonafide bore  
What's more - she snores  
And that is a fact  
Cow eyes lie  
Yes it's time to resist  
How did I ever  
Get into this  
How could I ever  
Have kissed that bitch  
So what if she's  
Got big tits  
  
She's the kinda girl  
Who changes her mind really quick  
She's the kinda girl who  
Won't just let things sit  
  
She came like a cat  
Like a cat to cat nap  
She came in my lap  
With her womanly hips  
When I first met her  
I came unglued  
I played the part of  
A blue blooded fool  
I'm through with your sewage  
I'm through with your trash  
I always knew that I'd  
Get the last laugh  
  
She's the kinda girl  
Who changes her mind really quick  
She's the kinda girl who  
Won't just let things sit  
  
Like two trains on one track  
Bound for a crash  
Two red white and blues we were  
Destined to clash  
I can't fix the future  
I can't change the past  
Like fly by night news  
We were not meant to last  
I'm through with your bluefish  
I'm through with your gash  
I'm through being screwed with by  
You and your wack attack  
  
Jump back for chump love  
You won't be back for cover  
But no no no no  
I'm no chump love sucker  
No chump love sucker  
  
No chump love sucker  
  
I thought that your love  
Was a matter of fact  
But I lost my pride  
When I realized that  
The smack in my bag  
And my baseball bat  
Was all you were after  
Boys "you dirty rat"  
She's a bitch and a brat  
And a living disaster  
She thought she was fast  
But I was faster
