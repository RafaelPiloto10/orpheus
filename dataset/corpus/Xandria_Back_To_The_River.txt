I can recall my name - but it was not the same  
I fear I'd gone astray - I've almost gone insane  
Sometimes I still can hear - echoes of silent fears  
But on that winter's day - you swept them all away  
These were the times when I longed for the river  
And I closed my eyes and yo laid your handy down on me  
Mot just a burning sin - a candle in the wind  
It was so much more - I want to thank you for  
I can see you, still my friend  
Still so deep inside of me  
You filled my void, you let me fly  
You broke my chains, you showed me life  
You set me up, you made me true  
I was back at the river with you
