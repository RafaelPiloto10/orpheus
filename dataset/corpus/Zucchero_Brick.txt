Girl, I surrender, that's no lie  
You don't remember, how I tried  
All I can dream, all I say  
  
Don't make it better  
Walking around with a brick in my head  
Hanging around, still trying to make it better  
Thinking by now, that I'm sick in the head  
'Cause it's everything that you don't want  
Give you everything, but you don't care  
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't  
Hell it's everything that you don't want  
  
Girl, it's a wonder, I survived  
You are the hunger, burning my insides  
Living your dream, call my name  
  
I'll make it better  
Walking around with a brick in my head  
Hanging around, still trying to make it better  
Thinking by now, that I'm sick in my head  
'Cause it's everything that you don't want  
Give you everything, but you don't care  
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't  
Hell it's everything that you don't want  
  
Wait a minute, you got a noose around my heart  
Come on, come on, come on, squeeze  
All that your breaking is my heart  
Your gonna freeze it, baby you've gone so cold!  
  
(Girl, I surrender)  
Walking around with a brick in my head  
Hanging around, still trying to make it better  
(Girl, I surrender)  
Thinking by now, that I'm sick my head  
'Cause it's everything that you don't want  
(Girl, I surrender)  
I give you everything, but you don't care  
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't  
(Girl, I surrender)  
And it's everything that you don't want  
Oh yeah, it's everything that you don't want  
(Girl, I surrender)  
  
I'll be brave this time  
Cause it's everything that you don't want  
(Girl, I surrender)  
Giving you everything but you don't care  
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't  
(Girl, I surrender)  
It's everything that you don't want  
It's all everything that you don't want  
(Girl, I surrender)  
  
That's a lie girl  
That's no lie girl  
(Girl, I surrender)  
That's all I'll say  
'Cause it's everything that you don't want  
(Girl, I surrender)  
It's everything that you don't want  
I give you everything but you don't care  
Walking around with a brick in my head
