Yes, it's true  
  
I want that apple, just like William Tell  
No more floor gazing, no more head down the well  
I'm feeling extrovert  
I should be shaking the stars instead of hugging the dirt  
  
I swear!  
  
I'm really burning, fit to boil up the sea  
Human volcano at a zillion degrees  
I'm feeling extrovert  
Instead of quiet and shy I'm really dying to flirt  
  
I feel like someone else  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
I feel like someone else  
I feel new, not so blue  
I feel  
Extrovert  
  
No hidden message, nothing political  
You needn't listen, I just wanted to show  
I'm feeling extrovert  
I am the lion who's roaring not the mouse that gets hurt  
  
I feel like someone else  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
I feel like someone else  
I feel new, not so blue  
I feel  
My trumpet plays for you  
I'm gonna blow it now
