The night we met  
The night that I won't forget  
You seemed what I'd been waiting for  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
You held me tight  
And everything seemed just right  
I couldn't ask for me  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
He used to smile at me  
And a-hold my hand like you do  
Then he left me  
And a-broke my heart in two  
  
I see your face  
And feel your warm embrace  
You're all that I adore  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
Oh baby, I've been wrong before
