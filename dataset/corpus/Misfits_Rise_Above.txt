Jealous cowards try to control  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
They distort what we say  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
Try and stop what we do  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
When they can't do it themselves  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
  
We are tired of your abuse  
Try to stop us, it's no use  
  
Societies arms of control  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
Think they're smart, can't think for themselves  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
Laugh at us behind our backs  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
I find satisfaction in what they lack  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
  
We are tired of your abuse  
Try to stop us, but it's no use  
  
We are tired of your abuse  
Try to stop us, it's no use  
  
We are born with a chance  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
I am gonna have my chance  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
We are born with a chance  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
And I am gonna have my chance  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
  
We are tired of your abuse  
Try to stop us, it's no use  
  
Rise above, rise above, rise above  
We're gonna rise above  
We're gonna rise above  
We're gonna rise above
