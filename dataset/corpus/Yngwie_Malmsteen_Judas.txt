I cast my pearls before the swine  
Sealed and delivered  
Then I drink your toast of wine  
Though it's bitter sweet  
I'm eating from you hand so neat  
Pennies from heaven  
You say you give  
You say you love  
But yet you live  
Judas...Judas  
Sightseeing through the lights  
and shades of you mighty colonnades  
No I got the picture  
of the beauty and the beast  
I am the lamb...you are the priest  
To crucify me  
You say you give  
You say you love  
But yet you live  
Judas...Judas  
To make a living...Makes no difference  
You are what you do  
Some are false and some are true  
You haven't got a clue  
I'd rather reign in hell some said  
Than serve in heaven  
You say you give  
You say you love  
But yet you live  
Judas...Judas
