I saw a bright light, shinning there before  
Walk to it, I waited've for the end  
A final vision promising salvation  
Of resurrection for a fallen man  
  
Do you still wait for your god  
And a symbol of your fate  
  
I can free you from this hell and mysery  
You should never be ashamed my son  
I can give you power beyond anything  
Trust me, you will be the chosen one  
  
I was forgotten, my body scorned and broken  
My soul rejected, taketh by his blood  
Your redemption, a sinner not worth saving  
Forever taken from the one I loved  
  
Do I still wait for my god  
And a symbol of my fate  
  
I can lead you down the path and back to life  
All I ask is that you worship me  
I can help you seek revenge and save yourself  
Give you life for all eternity  
  
Servants of the fallen, fight to pawe the way  
For the saviour's calling, on this wicked day  
To unveil the madness with a vicious pain  
One man rises up, standing in their way  
  
Redemption, redemption for humanity
