Usually in the morning I'm filled with sweet belonging  
And ev'rything is beautiful to see  
Even when it's raining, the sound of heaven singing  
Is simply joyful music to me.  
  
Sometimes I feel like a sad song  
Like I'm all alone without you.  
  
So many diff'rent places, a million smiling faces  
Life is so incredible to me  
Especially to be near you and how it is to touch you  
Oh paradise was made for you and me.  
  
I know that life goes on just perfectly  
And ev'rything is just the way that it should be  
Still there are times when my heart feels like breaking  
And anywhere is where I'd rather be.  
  
Oh and in the night time I know that it's the right time  
To hold you close and say I love you so  
To have someone to share with  
And someone I can care with  
And that is why I wanted you to know  
  
Sometimes I feel like a sad song  
Like I'm all alone without you, without you.
