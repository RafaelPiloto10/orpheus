Looking good through the window  
Shinin' red and blue light  
A little thick in the bottom  
But still lookin' alright, yeah  
Got a pocket fulla money  
Got me a long night ahead  
A quick stop by the bulldog  
Score me some panama red, yeah  
Wham, bam, oh Amsterdam  
Yea, yea, yea  
Stone you like nothin' else can  
Yea, yea, yea  
Hot damn, roll an Amsterdam  
Yea, yea, yea  
If she can't, then nothin' else can  
Caught a plane outta Moscow  
Spent one cold night in Berlin  
It's a long hard way  
But I'm a comin' back again, yea  
Wham, bam, oh Amsterdam  
Yea, yea, yea  
Stone you like nothin' else can  
Yea, yea, yea  
Yea, come on now, roll an  
Amsterdam  
Yea, yea, yea  
If she can't, then no one else can  
Yea, yea, yea...  
Wham, bam, oh Amsterdam  
Yea, yea, yea  
Stone you like nothin' else can  
Yea, yea, yea  
Hot damn, roll an Amsterdam  
Yea, yea, yea  
If she can't, then no one else can  
Yea, yea, yea  
Wham, bam, oh Amsterdam  
Yea, yea, yea  
You don't have to worry about the  
Man  
Yea, yea, yea  
Hot damn, burn an Amsterdam yea  
Yea, yea, yea  
Stone me like nothin' else can  
Yea, yea, yea
