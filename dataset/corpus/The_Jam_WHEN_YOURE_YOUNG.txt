Life is timeless, days are long when you're young  
You used to fall in love with everyone  
Any guitar and any bass drum  
Life is a drink and you get drunk when you're young  
Life is new and there's things to be done  
You can't wait to be grown up  
Acceptance into the capital world  
You pull on some weed, then you pull on someone when you're young  
  
But you find out life isn't like that  
It's so hard to comprehend  
Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end  
  
But you don't mind you've got time on your side  
And they're never gonna make you stand in line  
You're just waiting for the right time  
  
You're fearless and brave, you can't be stopped when you're young  
  
You swear you're never ever gonna work for someone  
No corporations for the new age sons  
Tears of rage roll down your face  
But still you say "it's fun"  
  
And you find out life isn't like that  
It's so hard to understand  
Why the world is your oyster but your future's a clam  
  
It's got you in its grip before your born  
It's done with the use of a dice and a board  
They let you think you're king but you're really a pawn  
  
You're fearless and brave, you can't be stopped when you're young  
You used to fall in love with everyone  
Any guitar and any bass drum
