She was the sweetest ever  
Whatever happened to forever  
She never say never, she rather say whatever  
I'd rather stay together and she'd rather chase the devil  
Now I'm left to race the rebel  
Bartender make it several  
Turn up the bass and treble  
How bout I make it metal  
I'm such a fatal fellow  
And she's the reason why  
Because without the muthafucker I'd die  
I'd die, I'd die  
So bury me today or tomorrow  
'Cause I've buried myself away  
In the sorrow in may  
I die before I wake  
I pray I'm resurrected for her nightmares sake  
  
But you love me  
At least that's what she said  
That whole weekend in my bed  
But there was a speaker in my head  
Saying "seek and you'll be led"  
But instead, instead I loved you  
I was weak and mislead  
I was deeper than dead  
I was sinking in dread now I'm thinking in shreds  
So I inked this in red  
  
But she loves me  
She loves me not  
  
I hate love  
Yeah I hate love  
Oh my God  
I hate love  
  
I used to tell myself I wouldn't do this to myself  
Until I proved it to myself  
And now I'm losing myself  
I hides to have my shit together but now  
You see now, I'm with whatever  
And now. you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever  
And everybody know I ain't actin' like in supposed  
I'm attacking my own soul  
I'm back in a lone mode  
I'm back on that long road  
And that road goes forever and ever  
  
I don't wanna love no more, spare me  
You can have my heart it's only dead beat  
I'm sick of the loves songs and the bullshit  
When reality bites like a wolf bitch  
She's on top, she wanna kiss  
She won't stop, she don't wanna quite  
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever  
  
She loves me  
She loves me not  
I hate love  
Yeah I hate love  
Oh my God  
I hate love  
  
And I don't want love, I don't want love  
I don't wanna love no more  
So if you see her you can have her  
She'll be outside my door  
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor  
I curse the very day you were born  
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that in guilty
