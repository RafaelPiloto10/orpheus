Keep your chin up when you're feelin' lonely  
Don't let them get you down  
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone  
Hangin' around for someone to call  
Ooh they won't come knocking at all  
Don't run and hide  
Even if it hurts you inside  
So I said  
Give as good as you get  
  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You'd better do it  
'Cause it makes you feel good  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You're never gonna help yourself  
  
Come on  
Get up  
You're feelin' good  
  
Keep your fingers off my money  
Don't try and pull me down  
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me  
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around  
Invite me to your little contract Ha! Ha!  
Rumor has it that you could play dirty  
I'll tell you what I'll do about that  
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah!  
  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You'd better do it  
'Cause it makes you feel good  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You're never gonna help yourself  
  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
You'd better do it  
'Cause it makes you feel good  
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
It's everyone for themselves  
Move on out
