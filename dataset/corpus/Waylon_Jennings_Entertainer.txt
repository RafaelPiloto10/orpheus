I am the entertainer I know just where I stand  
Another serenader another long haired man  
Today I am your champion I may have won your heart  
But I know the game you'll forget my name I won't be here in another year  
If I don't stay on the charts  
  
I am the entertainer had to pay my price  
Things I didn't know at first I learned by doing twice  
But still they come to haunt me still they want their say  
So I learn to dance with my hands in my pants  
Rub my neck and just write 'em a check and they'll be on their way  
I am the entertainer I've been all around the world  
I played all kinds of places played all kinds of girls  
I don't remember faces I don't remember names  
What the hell it's just as well cause after a while and a thousand miles  
It all becomes the same  
I am the entertainer I come to do my show  
You heard my latest record spin on the radio  
Well it took me years to write it the best years of my life  
It's a beautiful song but it ran too long wanna have a hit you gotta make it
fit  
So they cut it down to 3:05  
I am the entertainer Idol of my age  
Make all kinds of money boy when I go on the stage  
They see me in the paper and in the magazines  
If I go cold my feet get sore put me in the back of the discount rack  
like another can of beans  
I am the entertainer know just where I stand  
I am the entertainer
