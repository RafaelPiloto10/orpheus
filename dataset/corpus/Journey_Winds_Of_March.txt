I covered you with roses  
Like the stars at night  
I covered you with love  
Like a blanket on a cold winter's night  
I covered you with joy  
To make your lifetime bog and bright  
  
You touched me with your eyes  
Soft as an evening breeze  
You held me in your arms  
As the winds rushed through the trees  
You are my child  
You make my lifetime big and bright  
  
You are my child  
You came like the winds of March  
With all the love in your eyes  
You are my child  
You came like the morning lights  
With all your love, in your eyes  
  
You are my child  
You came like the morning light  
With all your love, in your eyes
