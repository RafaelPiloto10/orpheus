Country music singers  
Have always been a real close family  
But lately some of my kinfolk  
Have disowned a few others and me  
  
I guess it's because  
I kinda changed my direction  
And Lord, I guess I went  
And broke their family tradition  
They get on me want to know  
  
Hank, why do you drink?  
Hank, why do you roll smoke?  
Why must you live out  
The songs that you wrote?  
  
Over and over  
Everybody met my prediction  
So if I get stoned I'm just carryin'  
On an old family tradition  
  
I am very proud  
Of my daddy's name  
Although his kind of music  
And mine ain't exactly the same  
  
Stop and think it over  
Put yourself in my position  
If I get stoned and sing all night long  
It's a family tradition  
  
So don't ask me  
Hank, why do you drink?  
Hank, why do you roll smoke?  
Why must you live out  
The songs that you wrote?  
  
If I'm down in a honky tonk  
Some old slicks trying to give my friction  
I say leave me alone I'm singin' all night long  
It's a family tradition  
  
Lordy, I have loved some ladies  
And I have loved Jim Beam  
And they both tried to kill me in 1973  
  
When my doctor asked me  
"Son, how'd you get in this condition?"  
I said "Hey sawbones, I'm just carryin' on  
An old family tradition"  
  
So don't ask me  
Hank, why do you drink?  
Hank why do you roll smoke?  
Why must you live out  
The songs that you wrote?  
  
Stop and think it over  
Try to put yourself in my unique position  
If I get stoned and sing all night long  
It's a family tradition
