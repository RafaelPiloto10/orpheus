I turn sideways to the sun  
Keep my thoughts from everyone  
It's a jungle, I'm a freak  
Hear me talk, but never speak  
  
So I'm stepping out of time  
Because breaking is a crime  
And it may all be too late  
But I've no passion for this hate  
  
That's the price of love (that's the price of love)  
Can you feel it (can you feel it)  
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)  
How long would it last (that's the price of love)  
  
And when this building is on fire  
These flames can't burn any higher  
I turn sideways to the sun  
And in a moment I am gone  
  
That's the price of love (that's the price of love)  
Can you feel it (can you feel it)  
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)  
How long would it last (that's the price of love)  
  
That's the price of love (that's the price of love)  
Can you feel it (can you feel it)  
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)  
How long would it last (that's the price of love)
