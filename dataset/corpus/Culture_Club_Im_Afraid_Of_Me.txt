Some days in more ways  
I need the distractions  
Fire, desire, love and reaction  
He must be someone  
Yes even me  
Something for nothing  
Some wish to see  
Life beyond reason  
  
Who will I be (who will I be)  
I'm afraid of me  
I'm afraid of me  
  
Always survive days  
Cut and discretion  
Touched in a sane way  
Leave no impression  
  
He must be someone  
Yes even you  
Fool my direction  
Some wish to see  
Love without treason  
Who will love me (who will love me)  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm afraid of me  
I'm afraid of me  
(Afraid to love you)  
I'm afraid of me  
I'm afraid of me
