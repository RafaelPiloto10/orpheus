Do you want to hear something sad?  
We are but victims of desire  
I'm gonna shake this day  
I wanna shake this day before I retire  
  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm sick of everything  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
  
Bueno sera, I won't be long before we all walk off the wire  
Well I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend for what I require  
Bueno sera I will come in quick  
Don't want my flame to get no higher  
  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm sick of everything  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm gonna see my friend  
Gonna see my friend, make it go away  
  
Want to leave it all.  
Want to give it up.  
Want to see it go once and for all  
Want to view it cho'  
Want a little bit home  
Want to be there  
  
Hard as a statue, black as a tattoo, ?  
Gonna take me an astral plane  
I'm gonna tunnel through denial  
But I'm gonna shake this day  
I wanna shake this day before I retire  
  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm sick of everything  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away
