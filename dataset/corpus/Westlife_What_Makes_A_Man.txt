This isn't goodbye  
Even as I watch you leave  
This isn't goodbye  
I swear I won't cry  
Even as tears fill my eyes  
I swear I won't cry  
  
Any other girl I let you walk away  
Any other girl I'm sure I'll be okay  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me what makes a man want to give you all his heart  
Smile when you're around and cry when you're apart  
If you know what makes a man want to love you the way I do  
Girl you gotta let me know so I can get over you  
  
What makes us so right  
Is it the sound of the laugh  
That look in her eyes  
When do you decide  
She is the dream that you see  
That falls in your life  
  
And you'll apologize no matter who was wrong  
You'll get on your knees if that would bring her home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Other girls that come along they always knew  
What's the point when all I ever want is you  
Tell me  
  
[Chorus]
