Please don't go,  
Please don't go away from me  
Please don't go,  
Please don't go away from me  
  
I got my breakfast in bed  
You're big stuff in Chicago, so get in bed  
This bedroom's only 12 by 10  
  
You're all talk,  
You're all talk  
  
I got your number for a real good time  
Take the phone off the hook and watch you go wild  
They say you go nuts and that's what I like  
  
You're all talk,  
You're all talk  
  
Please don't go,  
Please don't go away from me  
Please don't go,  
Please don't go away from me  
  
I got your number for a real good time  
Take the phone off the hook and watch you go wild  
They say you go nuts and that's what I like  
  
You're all talk,  
You're all talk  
You're all talk,  
You're all talk  
You're all talk,  
You're all talk  
You're all talk,  
You're all talk
