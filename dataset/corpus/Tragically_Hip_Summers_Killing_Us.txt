Does summer exist in its praises?  
Does summer exist in its praises?  
The summer lives here where this place is  
Come on up here, we've got something to show you  
Wanna show you everything we know  
Wanna show you we've been banished before you  
Wanna show you we've got our own roads  
And does your family know your wishes  
'Cause this chorus will do you like the dishes  
Summer's killin' us  
It's just sing, sing, sing all day  
It's as if summer existed in it's praises  
Come on over, I've got somethin' to play you  
'Back At Sunshine', it's the Shadow Band  
We can have strictly cactus relations  
Telling the waves to stop crashing  
And does anybody know your wishes  
'Cause this tune'll do you like the dishes  
This summer's killin' us  
It's just sing, sing, sing all day  
It's as if summer just exists in her praises  
A time for more to happen sooner  
A time to be a person you still know  
To float a while on your sure power  
Till you say, "Canada lost, go home"  
The summer's killin' us  
We sing, sing, sing all day  
And it's as if summer exists here in it's praises, ooh  
Summer exists in a doorway  
Summer exists at the fair  
Summer is forever changes  
Summer's taking me all the way
