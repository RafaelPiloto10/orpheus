I Want You Back  
When I had you to myself  
I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces always made you  
Stand out in a crowd  
  
Then someone picked you from the bunch  
One glance was all it took  
Now it's much too late for me  
To take a second look  
  
Oh, baby, give me one more chance  
(To show you that I love you)  
Won't you please let me  
(Back in your heart)  
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go  
(Let you go, baby)  
But now since I see you in his arms  
  
I want you back  
Yes, I do now (I want you back)  
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)  
Now, now, now  
  
The Love You Save  
When we played tag in grade school  
You wanted to be it  
But chasin' boys was just a fad  
You crossed your heart, you'd quit  
When we grew up you traded  
Your promise for my ring  
Now just like back in grade school  
You're doing the same old thing  
  
Stop, the love you save maybe your own  
Darlin' take it slow  
Or some day you'll be all alone  
(You better stop)  
(The love you save maybe your own)  
Darlin' look both ways before you cross me  
You're heading for a danger zone  
  
I'll Be There  
You and I must make a pact  
We must bring salvation back  
Where there is love  
I'll be there  
(I'll be there)  
  
I'll reach out my hand to you  
I'll have faith in all you do  
Just call my name and I'll be there  
(I'll be there)  
  
I'll be there to comfort you  
Build my world of dreams around you  
I'm so glad that I found you  
I'll be there  
With a love that's strong  
I'll be your strength  
I'll keep holdin' on, ooh  
(Holding on)  
  
If you should ever find someone new  
I know he'd better being good to you  
'Cause if he doesn't  
I'll be there (I'll be there)  
  
Don't you know, baby, yeah, yeah  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
Just call my name and I'll be there  
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
  
Just call my name, and I'll be there
