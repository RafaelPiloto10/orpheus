Good girl on a bad day  
She needs love in a bad way  
Victim in a red dress  
She won't give no more  
And won't take no less  
Walking up the west side  
She bought a ticket for the long ride  
Well she's ripe for the take  
  
But it's no show, late night  
Talkin' 'bout no go, red light  
When she put on a show  
How far will she go  
She says yes when she means no  
  
Under the gun  
She can't walk away  
She can't run, mmm  
Under the gun, yeah, under the gun  
  
She's got wicked intentions  
She'll use less than conventional ways  
She'll do things I can't mention  
But there are some games  
That she just won't play  
Walking on the wild side, wild side  
She bought a ticket for the long ride, long ride  
Yeah she's mine for the take  
  
But it's no show, late night  
Talkin' 'bout no go, red light  
When she put on a show  
How far will she go  
She says yes when she means no  
  
Under the gun  
She can't walk away  
She can't run  
Under the gun, yeah, under the gun  
  
Under the gun  
Now, she can't walk away  
You can't run  
Under the gun, under the gun  
  
When she put on a show  
How far will she go  
She says yes when she means no  
  
Under the gun  
She can't walk away  
She can't run  
Under the gun, yeah, under the gun  
  
Under the gun  
She can't walk away  
You can't run  
Under the gun, under the gun  
  
Under the gun  
Now, you can't walk away  
You can't run  
Under the gun, under the gun  
  
Under the gun  
You can't walk away  
Under the gun
