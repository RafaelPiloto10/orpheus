Freddy my love, I miss you more than words can say  
Freddy my love, please keep in touch while you're away  
Hearing from you can make the day so much better  
Getting a souvenier, or maybe a letter  
I really flipped over the great cashmere sweater  
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love  
  
Freddy you know, your absense makes me feel so blue sooo blue  
That's okay though, your presents make me think of you sure they do  
Mama will have a heart-attack when she catches  
Those peddle pushers with the black leather patches  
Oh how I wish I had a jacket that matches, Freddy my love  
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love  
  
Don't keep your letters from me, I thrill to every line  
Your spelling's kinda crummy, but honey so is mine  
I treasure every gifty, the ring is really nifty  
You say it cost you fifty, so you're thrifty, I don't mind  
  
Whoa - Freddy you see, you'll hold me in your arms someday (Freddy my love)  
And I will be wearing your lacy lingerie (Freddy I'm yours)  
Thinking about it, my heart's pounding already  
Knowing when you come home, we're bound to go steady  
And throw your service pay around like confetti, Freddy my love  
  
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love  
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love  
Freddy, my love  
(to fade)
