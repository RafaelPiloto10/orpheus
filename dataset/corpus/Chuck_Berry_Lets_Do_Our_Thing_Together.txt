I don't need no fields of whiskey  
Don't indulge in beer or wine  
But baby, you turn me on  
And blow my ever-lovin' mind  
Now, let's do our thing together  
Go out and have a balling time  
You know I dig you doing your thing  
And I'll turn you on when I do mine  
I'm not a blue-blood or a scholar  
Just a hard-workin' boy  
And after five long days  
My body needs a little joy  
Now, let's do our thing together  
Go out and have a balling time  
You know I dig you doing your thing  
And I'll turn you on when I do mine  
I am solid, sane and sober  
And I'm over twenty-one  
What I see is what I want  
And what I want is you right on  
Now, let's do our thing together  
Go out and have a balling time  
You know I dig you doing your thing  
And I'll turn you on when I do mine  
I'm in the mood for a little rockin'  
You got to shake it up and shout  
You been a little uptight lately  
I'm goin' let it all hang out  
Let's do our thing together  
Go out and have a balling time  
You know I dig you doing your thing
