There's no gravity up here  
It's kind of hard to explain  
Every time I'm holding you  
It's like backwards rain, yeah  
  
You lift me up like a kite on a string  
Like a bird on newfound wings  
So high on you, I'm floating and  
Flying around  
Your love's like fallin' upside down  
  
You've got me so lightheaded  
It's a dizzy mood  
Spinning uncontrollably  
And gaining altitude  
  
You lift me up like a kite on a string  
Like a bird on newfound wings  
So high on you, I'm floating and  
Flying around  
Your love's like fallin' upside down  
  
Look at me  
Used to be, I could keep my feet  
On the ground  
When you said you could take  
Me higher  
You weren't playing around  
(You weren't playing around)  
  
You lift me up like a kite on a string  
Like a bird on newfound wings  
So high on you, I'm floating and  
Flying around  
Your love's like fallin' upside down
