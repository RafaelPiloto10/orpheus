I remember the taste of the vintage wine  
From '63 through to '69  
And I'm proud of the things we believed in then.  
If I had the chance I'd go around again  
Oh I tell you,  
We were young and free.  
Oh I'll tell you  
'Cause I was there, you see.  
  
And I look to the future with open arms  
And the songs that flow from my old guitar  
And I want to be there when the music plays  
And the lights go up on the empty stage.  
  
Oh I tell you  
Music set me free.  
Oh I tell you,  
It sounds so good to me.  
  
And if you're into wandering  
Underneath the stars,  
We'll take the trip together  
Through this magic world of ours.  
  
And if you're still uncertain  
Just what we can be  
Well, baby, make your mind up,  
Get your things and follow me.  
  
'Cause if you're into romance baby  
Love will find a way  
And if you're into dreaming  
Dream with me.  
  
I remember the sounds of the children's' prayer  
The laughing eyes and the golden hair  
And, as hard as I try,  
Not a day goes by  
That I don't think of them.  
  
I tell you  
We can be so free.  
Oh I tell you,  
If you'll be there with me
