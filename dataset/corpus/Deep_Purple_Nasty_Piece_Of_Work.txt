I got my feelers out  
Pleasure I can give you pain  
I'm the demon of misfortune  
Let me tell you that bad luck is my game  
Fires burning make you cold  
You can touch but you can't hold  
It's an even split  
Between zip and the number on your ticket  
Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt  
I'm a nasty piece of work  
  
Down get down on your knees  
Running gonna bring you down  
I'm the demon of disorder  
You know I'm gonna drive you into the ground  
As you're stepping through the door  
My shadow crawls across your floor  
Your dream of love  
It's not enough it's gonna come to nothing  
You ain't seen nothing it's gonna get worse  
I'm nasty nasty  
  
It's an even split  
Between zip and the number on your ticket  
Your dream of love  
It's not enough it's gonna come to nothing  
Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt  
You ain't seen nothing it's gonna get worse  
I'm a nasty piece of work
