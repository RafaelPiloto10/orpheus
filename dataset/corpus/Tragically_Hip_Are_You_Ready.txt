Hear the ol' whistle blowin'  
They're pulling the plug  
We got to get goin'  
They got our hole dug  
Are you ready? Are you ready?  
Are you ready to love?  
And are you ready? Ready?  
Are you ready to love?  
The devils in the blues  
Smoke it to the stub  
Never accept  
Then accept with a shrug  
Are you ready? Are you ready?  
Are you ready to love?  
And are you ready? Ready?  
Are you ready to love?  
To love, to love  
To love, to love  
They got safety fifth  
And they take the world straight  
Whatever it is  
They'll just have to wait  
To get pretend back  
Who wants to be tough  
To be permanent  
Permanent enough  
Are you ready? Are you ready?  
Are you ready to love?  
And are you ready? Ready?  
Are you ready to love?  
Are you ready? Are you ready?  
Are you ready to love?  
And are you ready? Ready?  
Are you ready to love?  
To love, to love  
To love, to love  
To love
