I looked in my rear view mirror and  
It seemed to make a lot more sense  
Than what I see ahead of us,  
Ahead of us, yeah.  
Uh I'm ready to make that turn  
Before we both crash and burn  
'Cause that could be the death of us,  
The death of us,  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And You decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
Hey, What happened to the butterflies  
Guess they didn't count at that stop sign  
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light  
Hey, right when I think that we found it  
Well that's when we start turnin' around  
You're saying baby don't worry  
But we're still going the wrong way baby  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And you decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
They say only fools fall in love  
Well they must've been talking about us  
And sometimes I feel like, I've been here before  
Ah  
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right  
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight  
Honey I know  
Yeah, we can find our way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
My baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was

Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in

Pressure

Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on  
Honeymoon Avenue
