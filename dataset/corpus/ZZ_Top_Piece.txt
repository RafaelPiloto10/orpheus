Piece  
I want a little piece  
I want a little piece of your love  
I' ve been here, I' ve been there  
Seems like I' ve been everywhere  
Lookin' around lookin' for a release  
I'm just lookin' around  
Piece  
I want a little piece  
I want a little piece of your love  
So tell me, tell me  
What 'cha gonna do  
I just wanna make love to you  
Piece  
I want a little piece  
I want a little piece of your love  
Piece  
I want a little piece  
I want a little piece of your love
