Born in a stable He came here for me  
Born of a virgin He came here for me  
God's only son come to set the world free,  
Born of God's love and He came here for me.  
Savior, of the world I praise thee  
Jesus, Lamb of God, I pray to thee hear me  
As I praise thy birth bend down thy ear and hear my prayer  
Over a stable a star shone so bright,  
Guiding 3 wise men who rode through the night  
He was called baby Jesus, He came here for me,  
Born to this world, then He died here for me.
