Darling what are we goin' through  
It's no secret what I do  
Always through revolving doors  
Each time's harder than before  
What goes around comes around  
I'll be with you when I can  
I know it's hard to understand  
But I am a circular  
I am a circular man  
Seems I'm gone before I left  
Always just one step ahead  
For you it's longer, marking time  
Lovin' me as I pass by  
Chorus  
When daddy's on the doorstep  
He won't take you for granted  
It's better than the very first time  
You can count on me, eventually  
Can't make up for the time we've lost  
Stolen from myself the most  
I keep your picture close to me  
Take it out for the boys to see  
What goes around comes around  
I'll be home when I can  
Sometimes it's hard to understand  
But I am a circular  
I am a circular  
I am a circular man  
Woohoo mmmhmmm  
What goes around, comes around  
What goes around, comes around  
What goes around, comes around  
What goes around, comes around  
Around and round and round
