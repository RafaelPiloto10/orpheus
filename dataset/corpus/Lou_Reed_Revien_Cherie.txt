Lovely day, the sunshine  
A light of love, love divine  
As time strode away  
  
A test of love, I bring to you my love  
Like a bird who builds your unborn a home  
Full of warmth, I give to you the same test of love  
Revien cherie, revien cherie  
  
Sitting all alone in a daze  
I sing a song to you my love  
I wish I were dead  
My love was far away  
  
A test of love, I bring to you my love  
Like a bird who builds your unborn a home  
Full of warmth, I give to you the same test of love  
Revien cherie, revien cherie  
  
Life to me is a share  
To be, to see, to understand each other  
To love one another  
I give to you the same test of love  
Revien cherie, revien cherie, revien cherie
