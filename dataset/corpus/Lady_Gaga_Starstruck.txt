Like adjust the dotted line and I suppose to sign  
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down  
She so star struck, the gal all stuck  
I should have had an overdose too many starbucks  
  
Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller  
Notice who let the top back on the chevy impala  
Hummers and all that fully loaded with two spoilers  
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars  
  
But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor  
All on me, just spotted a baby actor  
Complete swagga, they go the dagga  
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after
