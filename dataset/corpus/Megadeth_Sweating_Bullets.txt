Hello me, meet the real me  
And my misfit's way of life  
A dark black past is my  
Most valued possession  
Hindsight is always 20-20  
But looking back it's still a bit fuzzy  
Speak of mutually assured destruction?  
Nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest!  
  
Feeling paranoid  
True enemy or false friend?  
Anxiety's attacking me and  
My air is getting thin  
I'm in trouble for the things  
I haven't got to yet  
I'm chomping at the bit and my  
Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets  
  
Hello me, it's me again  
You can subdue but never tame me  
It gives me a migraine headache  
Sinking down to your level  
Yea, just keep on thinking it's my fault  
And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance  
Mankind has got to know  
His limitations  
  
Feeling claustrophobic  
Like the walls are closing in  
Blood stains on my hands and  
I don't know where I've been  
I'm in trouble for the things  
I haven't got to yet  
I'm sharpening the axe and my  
Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets  
  
Well, me, it's nice talking to myself  
A credit to dementia  
Some day you too will know my pain  
And smile it's blacktooth grin  
If the war inside my head  
Won't take a day off I'll be dead  
My icy fingers claw your back  
Here I come again  
  
Feeling paranoid  
True enemy or false friend?  
Anxiety's attacking me  
And my air is getting thin  
Feeling claustrophobic  
Like the walls are closing in  
Blood stains on my hands  
And I don't know where I've been  
  
Once you committed me  
Now you've acquitted me  
Claiming validity  
For your stupidity  
I'm chomping at the bit  
I'm sharpening the axe  
Here I come again, whoa!  
Sweating bullets
