Come to decide that the things that I tried  
Were in my life just to get high on  
  
When I sit alone  
Come get a little known  
But I need more than myself this time  
  
Step from the road to the sea to the sky  
And I do believe that we rely on  
  
When I lay it on  
Come get to play it on  
All my life to sacrifice  
  
Hey oh listen what I say oh  
I got your  
Hey oh now listen what I say oh  
  
When will I know that I really can't go  
To the well once more time to decide on  
  
When it's killing me  
When will I really see  
All that I need to look inside  
  
Come to believe that I better not leave  
Before I get my chance to ride  
  
When it's killing me  
What do I really need  
All that I need to look inside  
  
Hey oh listen what I say oh  
Come back and hey oh  
Hey oh look at what I say oh  
  
The more I see the less I know  
The more I like to let it go... hey oh  
  
Woah oh  
  
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
  
Privately divided by a world so undecided  
And there's no where to go  
  
In between the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
  
Running through a field where all my tracks will  
Be concealed and there's no where to go  
  
When to descend to amend for a friend  
All the channels that have broken down  
  
Now you bring it up  
I'm gonna ring it up  
Just to hear you sing it out  
  
Step from the road to the sea to the sky  
And I do believe what we rely on  
  
When I lay it on  
Come get to play it on  
All my life to sacrifice  
  
Hey oh listen what I say oh  
I got your  
Hey oh listen what I say oh  
  
The more I see the less I know  
The more I like to let it go... hey oh  
  
Woah oh  
  
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
  
Privately divided by a world so undecided  
And there's no where to go  
  
In between the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
  
Running through a field where all my tracks will  
Be concealed and there's no where to go  
  
I said hey  
Hey yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Tell my love now  
  
Hey  
Hey yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Tell my love now  
  
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
  
Privately divided by a world so undecided  
And there's no where to go  
  
In between the cover of another perfect wonder  
Where it's so white as snow  
  
Running through a field where all my tracks will  
Be concealed and there's no where to go  
  
I said hey  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Tell my love now  
  
Hey  
Yeah yeah  
Oh yeah
