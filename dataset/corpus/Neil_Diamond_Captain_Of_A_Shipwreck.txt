I was lost until you found me  
You're the reason for my today  
Was tempest tossed, now I sleep soundly  
Thanks to you I gladly say  
  
That if your goldmine comes up empty  
I'll be there to work the claim  
If you're a captain of a shipwreck  
I'll be first mate to your shame  
  
Trust in me to share your burden  
Stand by you where I belong  
When life brings the day uncertain  
I will soothe you with my song  
  
And if your goldmine comes up empty  
I'll be there to work the claim  
If you're a captain of a shipwreck  
I'll be first mate to your shame  
  
Fear no flood in stormy weather  
Fear no fire if winds arise  
Flesh and blood, I'm yours forever  
And forever, it never dies  
  
And if your goldmine comes up empty  
I'll be there to work the claim  
If you're a captain of a shipwreck  
I'll be first mate to your shame  
  
If you're a captain of a shipwreck  
You can find me up on the top deck  
You'll be captain of a shipwreck  
I'll be first mate to your shame.
