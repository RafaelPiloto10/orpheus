If I could have my wasted days back  
Would I use them to get back on track?  
Stop to warm at karmas burning  
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?  
  
Do I have the strength  
To know how I'll go?  
Can I find it inside  
To deal with what I shouldn't know?  
  
Could I have my wasted days back  
Would I use them to get back on track?  
  
You live it or lie it!  
  
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle  
  
Keep searching, keep on searching  
This search goes on, this search goes on  
  
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock  
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock  
  
I've worn out always being afraid  
An endless stream of fear that I've made  
Treading water full of worry  
This frantic tick tick talk of hurry  
  
Do I have the strength  
To know how I'll go?  
Can I find it inside  
To deal with what I shouldn't know  
  
Worn out always being afraid  
An endless stream of fear that I've made  
  
You live it or lie it!  
  
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle  
  
Keep searching, keep on searching  
This search goes on, this search goes on  
  
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock  
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock  
  
My lifestyle (Birth is pain)  
Determines by deathstyle (Life is pain)  
A rising tide (Death is pain)  
That pushes to the other side (It's all the same)
