For once in my life  
I've got someone who needs me  
Someone I've needed so long  
For once unafraid  
I can go where life leads me  
And somehow I know I'll be strong  
  
For once I can touch  
What my heart used to dream of  
Long before I knew  
Someone warm like you  
Could make my dreams come true  
  
For once in my life  
I won't let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it's hurt me before  
For once I've got someone  
I know won't desert me  
'Cause I'm not alone anymore  
  
For once I can say  
This is mine, you can't take it  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it  
For once in my life  
I've got someone who needs me  
  
At least I can say  
This is mine, you can't take it  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it  
For once in my life  
I've got someone who needs me  
For once in my life  
I find someone  
I've got someone who needs me
