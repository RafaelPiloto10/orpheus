Back and forth, I sway with the wind  
Resolution slips away again  
right through my fingers, back into my heart  
Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark  
Sometimes I think I'm blind  
Or I may just be paralyzed  
Because the plot thickens every day  
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away  
But I know, there's a picture beneath  
Indecision clouds my vision  
No one listens  
Because I'm somewhere in between  
My love and my agony  
You see, I'm somewhere in between  
My life is falling to pieces  
Somebody put me together  
Layin' face down on the ground  
My fingers in my ears to block the sounds  
My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight  
Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight  
Droplets of "yes' and "no"  
In an ocean of "maybe"  
From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline  
From the top, another downhill slope of mine  
But I know, the equilibrium's there  
Indicision clouds my vision  
No one listens  
Because I'm somewhere in between  
My love and my agony  
You see, I'm somewhere in between  
My life is falling to pieces  
Somebody put me together
