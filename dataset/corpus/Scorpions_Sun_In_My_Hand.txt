Yeah, well I'd like to tell you something now  
For men who shows you who's the furthest in the sky  
  
How can you lose your mind  
How can you waste your time  
Hoping like that  
Look at the sun inside  
  
Of my hand so bright  
I call it music  
  
Now if you touch you'll see  
The stars from infinity  
Judge me forever  
You and the touch of rain  
  
Music will make you sane  
Burn like you say 'em  
  
How can you lose your mind  
How can you waste your time  
Hoping like that  
Look at the sun inside  
  
Of my hand so bright  
I call it music
