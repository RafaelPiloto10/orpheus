People moving about the town upside down, you know why  
Little bits of coloured glass in the sky  
Children pushing mummy down to the park, in a pram  
Look out the pavement's changing to jam  
See them running  
Now where are they going to  
To follow them, leads you nowhere  
Shout to them quickly but no one can hear you  
All they can do is to stare  
Your bowler hats are turning green  
Your city suits are coloured cream  
You, you who changed my life  
You made it misery, sadness reins alone  
Wonder why you do this, to me  
When I've tried so hard for you  
People talking to the man who's digging a hole, in his mind  
He's no need to worry, he's deaf and blind  
See the dustman doing his round in a rolls made of glass  
He's gained everything because he's got class  
Friends are leaving me when I did everything  
Just as they used to behave  
Trying to copy them, losing my real self  
Floating away in a cloud  
Your minds have blown you out of step  
The rules you taught you never kept  
You, you who changed my life  
You made it misery, sadness reins alone  
Wonder why you do this, to me  
When I've tried so hard for you
