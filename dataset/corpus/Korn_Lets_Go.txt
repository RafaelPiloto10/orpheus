Let's go!  
  
What's the problem  
Why can't you relax?  
Inside hating on everything, that makes me mad  
Love is scary and love is to blame  
Guess I'll lose you and that is a shame  
Because I'm ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
  
Let's go!  
  
I'm taking over  
I won't be lead astray  
Life's doesn't last long  
I gotta get away  
  
The solution I try to reveal  
But the question is how can you really be healed?  
Hate is scary and hate is to blame  
God, I need you and that is a shame  
Because I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
  
Let's go!  
  
I'm taking over  
I won't be lead astray  
Life's doesn't last long  
I gotta get away  
  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
  
Lets go!  
  
I'm taking over  
I won't be lead astray  
Life's doesn't last long  
I gotta get away
