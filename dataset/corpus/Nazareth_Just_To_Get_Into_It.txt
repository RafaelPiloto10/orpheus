I know that she don't like me  
She knows that I don't care  
I could mistreat and bad mouth that woman  
Turn around and she'd be there  
She ain't got no pride she don't even try to hide  
What she does  
It's a buzz  
  
To be seen in your limousine  
She'll do strange bedroom scenes  
She likes rock'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
Her head's full of rock 'n' roll dreams  
She's exactly what she seems  
She likes rock 'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
  
Hangin' around hotel bars  
Droppin' someone's name  
Usin' those lines that you heard before  
Playin' the same old games  
She ain't got no style  
Eyes that never smile  
Feel like you're on trial  
She ain't worth while  
  
To be seen in your limousine  
She'll do strange bedroom scenes  
She likes rock 'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
Her head's full of rock 'n' roll dreams  
She's exactly what she seems  
She likes rock 'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
  
She wants to interview  
Says the world should know your views  
With someone you can see right through  
She's just comin' on  
Tryin' to pretend that it's  
Just a yawn  
Ah, come on  
  
To be seen in your limousine  
She'll do strange bedroom scenes  
She likes rock'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
Her head's full of rock 'n' roll dreams  
She's exactly what she seems  
She likes rock 'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it
