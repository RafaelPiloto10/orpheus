I know she says she wants me  
I hear it every day  
And I know she know it keeps me  
Well there ain't no other way  
But she's got a heart must be made of stone  
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone  
  
She says  
Who said I would  
She knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me  
She fills me full of loving  
Oh then she sets me free  
But she's got a heart must be made of stone  
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone  
  
She says  
Who said I would, tell me, who said I would  
Who said I would, who said I would  
  
I'm not the only one but I do fine  
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind  
I don't own her and I never could  
Don't think I do, don't think I should  
  
Tell me  
Who said I would, who said I would  
  
But she's got a heart must be made of stone  
And when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone  
  
You're not the only one but you do fine  
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind  
I don't own me and you never could  
Don't think you do, don't think you should  
  
Who said I would (who said I would)  
Now she knows when she calls me  
I'll come running every time  
And she knows she gets me hot  
But she don't know it's her body never mine  
  
And she's got a heart must be made of stone  
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone  
She says  
Who said I would, tell me, who said I would  
Who said I would, who said I would
