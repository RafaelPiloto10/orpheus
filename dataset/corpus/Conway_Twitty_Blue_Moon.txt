Once upon a time, before I took up smiling  
I hated the moonlight  
Shadows of the night like the poorest find beguiling  
Seems flat as the moonlight  
  
With no one to stay up for  
I went to sleep at ten  
And life was a bitter cup  
For the saddest of all men  
  
Blue moon  
You saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
Blue moon  
You knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for  
Someone I really could care for  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Blue moon
