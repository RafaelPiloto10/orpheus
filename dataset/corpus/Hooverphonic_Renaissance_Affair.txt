Sweet relief calms me down  
Makes me drown lost and found  
Neighbours complain sheets are stained  
Hotel shower the best around  
Spacing from Paris to new york  
Silver sunglasses silver phone  
Connect us to someone who doesn't know  
About these feelings we can't control  
People they want us to fall down  
But we won't ever touch the ground  
We're perfectly balanced we'll float around  
'Til no one is near do you hear this sound  
Spacing from Paris to new york  
Silver sunglasses silver phone  
Connect us to someone who doesn't know  
About these feelings we can't control  
This strange feeling captures us it generates this huge fuzz  
I miss you all the time I must face I miss your touch and your embrace
