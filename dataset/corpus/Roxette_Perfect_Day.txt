Breathe some faith into my chest.  
Lay me down, I need the rest.  
Ever since the sky turned grey  
I've waited for the perfect day  
Hey now, it seems you've always touched me like the sun.  
There's no escape for the broken-hearted, there's no return once you've lost  
your way.  
I say a prayer now our love's departed that you'll come back to stay and bring  
the perfect day  
Blinded by a crazy light I fell into the darkest night.  
Those magic ties, the two of us, I couldn't see it turn to dust  
Hey now, it seems you've always reached me like the sun.  
There's no escape for the broken-hearted, there's no escape once you've lost  
your way.  
I say a prayer now your love's departed that you'll come back to stay.  
Bring back the perfect day.
