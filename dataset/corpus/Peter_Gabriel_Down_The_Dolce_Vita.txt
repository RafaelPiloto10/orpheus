'Hey Mac, see you down the Dolce Vita!  
'Get back, we don't have time  
'cause I hear we're sending off the heroes  
When the year goes, they're out of the bay,  
Trying to find a way  
To make it alive'  
  
'So long' said poor men to their families,  
Be strong 'til we get back home.  
And if not, take care of all the children  
Until then just hope and pray  
To make it alive'  
  
'You guys are crazy'  
  
They shout and then we leave the harbor.  
In doubt, they're acting weird  
And the sea is whipping up a welcome  
If hell come we're all easy prey,  
Trying to find a way  
To make it alive'  
  
'You guys are crazy'  
  
The captain's hand shook for the guys to get in place  
He said, 'Let's look behind your face.'  
With each corner covered, they were all around  
Waiting for the midnight bell to sound  
'Out of sight," cried Aeron through his glasses  
'Don't fight' said Gorham's smioulder  
I was scared of being easy prey,  
Trying to find a way  
To make it alive'
