Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?  
Do the flame colored skies light your fire?  
We are heavy metal lions, they will never understand  
The kind of people you or I am, bow your heads and take your hands  
  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
Does the ocean inspire, easy rider?  
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?  
You are California proud, you are angels of the night  
Rock 'n' roll guardians now, the last keepers of the light  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
Paradise is a hell colored flame sky  
Is it nice to feel free and wild?  
Paradise is the game of do or die  
I just ride, ride, ride  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels
