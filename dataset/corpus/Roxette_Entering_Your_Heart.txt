I came in crawling  
With an absent-minded smile  
I had so many things un-tied that summer night  
When I decided it was worth another try  
Entering your heart.. ohh yeah  
Close your eyes  
Don't say a word  
All your thoughts must go un-heard  
And i......  
Have failed so many times....  
Entering your mind....  
Entering your mind....  
I'm not the most important one under the sun  
I don't have any power connections to the pentagon  
But I've got something of my own, that must get done  
Entering you heart  
Ohhh... entering your heart  
Close your eyes  
Don't tell a soul....  
All you dreams must be told....  
And i.....  
Have failed so many times....  
Entering you mind....  
Entering you mind  
Ohhh...  
Ohhh...  
I......  
Have failed so many times....  
Entering your mind....  
Entering your mind....  
Ohhh..... entering you heart  
Woah.. entering you heart
