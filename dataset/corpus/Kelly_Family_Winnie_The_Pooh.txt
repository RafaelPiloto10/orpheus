I must a walked a mile  
Until I got to the rabbit's house  
Mama rabbit cooked a soup for me  
And papa rabbit read a story out loud  
  
And then I went out to play yeah  
With my big big friend  
His name is big big Ben  
  
Winnie the pooh  
Winnie too too  
Is Winnie  
Winnie the pooh  
  
He's my best best best best absolutely  
Best best friend  
His name is Winnie  
Winnie the pooh  
  
There's a tree  
Not too far from here  
With the biggest honey hive(wow)  
That you've ever seen  
  
Papa rabbit said  
I shouldn't leave  
But I can't stop my feet now  
They just walk and walk  
  
But there's just a little problem  
There's a million bee's  
But they won't get to me  
  
Winnie the pooh...
