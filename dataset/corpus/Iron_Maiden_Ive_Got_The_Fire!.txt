If you're looking for someone that you can keep  
then, baby, pass me by  
And if you wanted something that's twenty years deep  
Baby, don't even try  
And if you wanted someone to take your soul  
I'll lift you up little bit higher  
  
I've got the fire  
I've got the fire  
  
So you think I'm skinny, don't you sell me cheap  
I'm as wide as a country-mile  
Some like it wide, I like it deep  
Guess which one is my style  
So you think you can beat me by my own game  
Maybe I call you a liar  
  
I've got the fire  
I've got the fire
