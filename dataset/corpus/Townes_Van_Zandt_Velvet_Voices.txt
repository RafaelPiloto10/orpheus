By Townes Van Zandt  
I'll play upon my violin  
Until the mountains ring  
Of lonely laughter blindly thrown  
And cause an endless sark of strings  
The skies are sad  
They're dancin' to a silent symphony  
And the velvet voices all shall join  
The singing  
  
The hall is filled to every corner  
By a tinkling hint of chimes  
A melody careens and crumbles  
Leaving just a trace behind  
A rhythm [palter and] faintly fails  
The silver on its wings  
And the velvet voices all shall join  
The singing  
  
The cymbals flash, the drums they crash  
The trumpets rise the song  
The brass beton plucks its diamonds  
From a glittering wall of almost dawn  
The crystal chords they slash the wind  
In humble majesty  
And the velvet voices all shall join  
The singing
