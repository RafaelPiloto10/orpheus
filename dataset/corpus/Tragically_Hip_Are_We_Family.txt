It's only human to want  
To inhabit every feeling you've got  
And more often than not  
Let's take it to the nth degree  
  
Here he goes  
Gimmie ten bucks and a head start  
Here's where he goes  
The puzzle's pullin' apart  
  
And here's the scene  
You're yellin' calmly out the street  
Are we family or what?  
  
From happy-go-lucky  
To surly-go-crazy the lot  
And more often than not  
Admission to the battles is free  
  
Here he goes  
Gimmie ten bucks and a head start  
Here's where he goes  
Pullin' the puzzle apart  
  
And here's the scene  
Where you whisper down the crookedest street  
Are we family or what?  
  
Are we family when it's only if not when  
Sisters and brothers, wolf, wolf lover  
And the boy who stamped too many ants?  
Are we family?  
  
It's only human to want  
To inherit every feeling you've got  
And like it or not  
Let's take it to the nth degree  
  
Here we go  
Give us ten bucks and a head start  
Here's where we go  
The puzzle's pullin' apart  
  
And here's the scene  
Your horse is going the wrong way up the street  
Are we family or what?  
  
Are we family, when its not if but when  
Taking care of each other, one bullet to another  
When it's all if a song can't save us then nothing can?  
Are we family or what?  
(Are we family ?)  
  
Are we family or what?  
(To one another, the lost to the recovered?  
[Incomprehensible])  
Are we family or what?  
(The tribal jury to the Pakistani teen?)  
  
Are we family or what?  
(Ill-starred evenings to champion mystique)  
Are we family or what?  
(Sick as a writer writing to be lighter than the uncanny, are we family?)  
When the invasion of Antarctica's complete are we family?
