I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
  
My soul the sky, my heart a sun  
my mind a world - my only one  
My thoughts the people, the world around  
My dreams the kings - or the clowns  
  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
  
The continents and the seven oceans  
bound the range of my emotions  
My time is long but not forever  
My moods are the changing wind and weather  
  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
  
Color it in !  
Color it in !
