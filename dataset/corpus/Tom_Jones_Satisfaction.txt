I can't get no satisfaction  
I can't get no satisfaction  
'Cause I try and I try  
Yes, I try, I try  
I can't get no satisfaction  
I can't get no satisfaction  
When I'm cruisin' in my car  
And the man comes on the radio  
He's tellin' me more and more  
About some useless information  
Supposed to fire my imagination  
And I can 't get no satisfaction  
Oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey  
Ooh, baby, tell me what I say  
Oh, well, when I'm watching my TV  
And this man comes on and tells me  
What drink would be good for me  
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke  
The same cigars as me  
And I can't get no satisfaction  
No, no, no, hey, hey, hey, hey  
Tell me what I say  
When I'm ridin' 'round the world  
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that  
And I'm tryin' to meet some girl  
Who tells me, baby, baby, come back, maybe next week  
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak  
I can't get no satisfaction  
Oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey  
Baby, tell me what I say  
Come here, baby  
What do ya mean  
You don't know what will satisfy me  
Yes, you do  
I've been all around the world  
Looking for some girl  
And I can't get no satisfaction  
And I've got to have some satisfaction
