Words and Music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe  
  
All I want is a room somewhere  
Far away from the cold night air  
With one enormous chair  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?  
  
Lots of chocolate for me to eat  
Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat  
Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?  
  
Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still  
I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  
  
Someone's 'ead restin' on my knee  
Warm and tender as 'e can be  
Who takes good care of me  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?  
  
Who takes good care of me  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly? (loverly)  
Loverly (lovely)  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?
