Got to be a winner, trophy winner  
Get to hold your head up high up!  
Number one!  
  
Got to be a winner, trophy winner  
Get to hold your head up high up!  
Number one!  
  
Number one  
Number one  
Honey tell me,  
When your working day is done,  
Were you reaching for the high rung,  
Reaching to be number one?  
  
You get a car  
You want a boat  
You want an eenie-meenie-miney miney-moe  
Oh there must be more to living  
Than a mortgage and a lawn to mow  
  
Sweaty work  
And lucky breaks  
And blood and tears is all it takes  
To be a winner!  
People cheer  
And people gasp  
People want your autograph  
When you're a winner!  
  
Run, run, run, run  
Let's see you run  
We'll be betting by the starting gun!  
Shall we shower you with flowers  
Or shall we shun ya  
When your race is run?  
Will we shower you with flowers  
Or will we shun ya  
When your race is run?  
Will they shower you with flowers  
Or will they shun ya  
When your race is run?  
  
Got to be a winner, trophy winner  
Get to hold your head up high up!  
Number one!
