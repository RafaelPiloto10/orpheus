[Verse 1]  
Yeah, here's a story bout my homeboy randy  
He was hooked on a girl named candy  
Started off as sex for fun  
Now the girl's got him on the run  
Made love to her just one time  
Now she runs his body and mind  
He calls everyday on the phone  
But baby's playin' games  
Leave a message at the tone  
Soft and gentle is not her style  
This girl is so damn wild  
All my partners want to get next to her  
But she ain't down with that, She moves right through 'em  
Yeah, like paper plates, Tears 'em up and she throws 'em away  
If you had any guts today, You'd get your butt up and you'd walk away  
But you're hooked  
Hooked

Use you one time and then she wipes you out

Try to act like you were mack  
You can't go an hour without that sex attack  
What's wrong, boy, is it that good?  
There's a lot of girls that would and could  
Take you, But you're so damn weak  
I think you need to seek  
Professional help, For your problems  
Lay on the couch and let the doctor solve 'em  
Talkin' to you and now he took your money

Now, I must admit she's fly  
But i'll be damned if oh me oh my  
If I ever let a girl run my thing  
I'm poppin' it the most, you know what I'm sayin'?  
So understand, you gotta be real hard  
Don't treat her like a dog, but let her know  
You'll pull her card if she ever gets outta hand
