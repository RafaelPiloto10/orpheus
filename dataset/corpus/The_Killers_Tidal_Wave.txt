He's always trouble with his noncomplacent  
Shotgun eyes, shotgun eyes  
His subtlety, his mystery  
Not like the other guys  
  
She's always taken by his reputation  
He's so bad, he's so bad  
On Saturday night, they're running for the shadow  
  
You say your heart ain't ever been broken  
You think you know where you're going  
Tidal wave  
Tidal wave come rushing over me  
You say this life has given you nothing  
You got another thing coming  
Tidal wave  
Tidal wave come rushing over me  
  
He'll get a warning sign to keep his distance  
From her old man, from her old man  
Now the story of forbidden love  
Has gotta make a stand  
  
So in the middle of the early morning  
They'll slip away, slip away  
And we know they'll do their best  
Somewhere in the golden west  
  
Oh yeah, and we'll watch them drive  
They're so alive  
  
You say your heart ain't ever been broken  
You think you know where you're going  
Tidal wave  
Tidal wave come rushing over me  
You say this life has given you nothing  
You got another thing coming  
Tidal wave  
Tidal wave come rushing over me  
Tidal wave  
  
These tidal waves are caught off track  
Come tomorrow, cause I can't go back  
Come together, can't you see  
Tidal wave gonna cover me.  
These tidal waves are caught off track  
Come tomorrow, cause I can't go back  
Come together, can't you see  
Tidal wave gonna cover me.  
  
Cover me  
I can't go back  
Can't you see
