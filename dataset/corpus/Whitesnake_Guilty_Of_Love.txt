I believe my love for you  
Is a love that will last forever,  
An' I'm here to testify  
I'm a prisoner of your heart  
Baby don't you believe  
When I tell you I love you  
That I really mean it,  
Don't you walk away,  
Don't you turn your back on me  
  
I'm guilty of love,  
It's a crime of passion  
Guilty of love,  
An' there's no doubt about it,  
No doubt about it  
  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty,  
In the first degree  
Guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty,  
In the first degree  
  
I can never forget the times  
When I took what you gave me for granted  
So I stand accused  
An' I plead guilty to the crime  
You can lock me away if you want  
Just as long as your arms are around me,  
An' I won't mind  
If you just throw away the key  
  
I'm guilty of love,  
It's a crime of passion  
Guilty of love,  
An' there's no doubt about it,  
No doubt about it  
  
Guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty,  
In the first degree  
Guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty,  
In the first degree  
  
Guilty of love  
  
I'm guilty of love,  
It's a crime of passion  
Guilty of love,  
An' there's no doubt about it,  
No doubt about it  
  
Guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty,  
In the first degree  
Guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty  
  
Guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty,  
In the first degree
