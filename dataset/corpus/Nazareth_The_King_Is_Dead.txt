I have not come to worship you  
Only flowers at your throne  
  
I have not come to plead or beg  
Or to claim what is my own  
  
Oh I know you are the king  
And you'll say what is wrong  
  
I have come to cut you down  
And to leave your body dead  
  
You do not mean so much to me  
Nor that crown upon your head  
  
You are just as sad as me  
You are lonely flesh and blood  
  
And the time has come for you to die  
  
And now you bleed, please spare my life  
You know I'm the chosen one  
  
I don't believe what you bequeth  
And I must do what must be done  
  
You say you're the only king  
Your words just fall like rain
