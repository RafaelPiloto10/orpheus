Taxi  
I'm goin' home  
Six blocks down make a left at  
The lights  
Haa...  
I think I had too much to drink  
I'm in the restroom at the sink  
The water runnin' and I'm tryna'  
Think  
The cranberry made my white  
Dress pink  
I got the bass kickin' in my head  
A little more than just wasted  
But I remember what happened  
After he said  
What he said  
What he said  
He said  
I don't know why she tell you so  
But I'm drunk so here you go  
See I'm fallin, fallin in love with you  
And your best friend too  
And I just can't help myself  
Just can't help myself  
That was it  
My best friend's boyfriend admits  
It blew my mind when you told  
Me this  
But then he turned and try to  
Give me a kiss  
My best friend saw it and she got  
Upset  
And threw a drink, at my head  
So I'm sittin' in the restroom  
Steamin'  
Cos he said  
Cos he said  
He said  
I don't know why she tell you so  
But I'm drunk so here you go  
See I'm fallin, fallin in love with you  
And your best friend too  
And I just can't help myself  
Just can't help myself  
A Friday night should never go so  
Bad  
I tried to talk to her but she's just  
Drunk and mad  
We won't remember this  
Tomorrow and that's what's really  
Sad  
My shoes broke  
My dress is ruined  
I'm goin home in a cab  
Well...  
Somebody call me a cab  
Uhhhooo...  
Somebody call me a cab  
Call me a cab  
Eeooo...  
He said  
I don't know why she tell you so  
But I'm drunk so here you go  
See I'm fallin, fallin in love with you  
And your best friend too  
And I just can't help myself  
Just can't help myself  
Down and out on a Friday night  
Down and out on a Friday night  
Down and out on a Friday night
