[Chorus:]  
Babe break me off a piece of your love  
Once it's on I can't seem to get enough  
So keep it up, keep it comin', uh what  
Break me off some baby  
  
You're wicked, baby so do what's right  
Break me off a piece of that love tonight  
Like a steel guitar that I love to play  
Everyone loves Jesus on judgment day  
You get hot just like gasoline  
In your cashmere shirt and your cut-off jeans  
I've been workin' all day, here's what I made  
Baby what you say break me off some  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
Down in Mexico there's a man I know  
Who gave away his future for a piece of gold  
He washed his hands in Noah's flood  
Now those mountains they're just red as blood  
I left this place just to come with you  
Walkin' off the mesa in some dead man's shoes  
I've been workin' all day, here's what I made  
Baby what you say break me off some  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
Eie yie yie yie yie yie yie  
Eie yie yie yie yie yie yie  
  
I like the way you're movin' on the dance floor baby  
I like the way you're moving' on the dance floor baby  
  
Shake shake shake 'til my eyes are sore baby  
Shake shake shake 'til my eyes are sore baby  
  
Bounce bounce bounce 'til your body is sore baby  
Bounce bounce bounce 'til your body is sore baby  
Feel the heat Moe Z Put his hands on  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
