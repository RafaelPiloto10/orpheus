If I was a road dog, baby  
All of my songs were true  
Reckon' I'd like my whiskey drinkin'  
a whole lot more than I do  
But I don't know about the good life, baby  
Not so sure it's for me  
I'd much rather be home rollin' with you  
Than watching Tom Snyder on TV  
  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
Big rig baby, rollin' on home to you  
  
Now I been to lots of parties  
Spent my whole life in a bar  
There's a whole lot of good lookin' women out there  
Who think I am a star  
Drinkin' and a smokin' ain't really where I am  
If I had my own two ways I'd be rollin' home to Alabam  
  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin' on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
A big rig baby, rollin' on home to you  
  
Now some day I'll be better  
My ramblin' days will be through  
I won't have anymore gigs to play  
I'll be back home there with you  
But meanwhile wait a minute  
What's that thing I see  
It's a good lookin' woman with a bottle of Scotch  
And she wants to go home with me  
  
She's lookin' like a big rig  
Rollin' on home to you  
I wish I was big rig, a big rig baby  
Rollin' on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin' on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin' on home to you
