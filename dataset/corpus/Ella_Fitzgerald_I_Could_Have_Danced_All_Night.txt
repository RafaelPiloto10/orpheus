I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night  
And still have begged for more  
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things  
I've never done before  
  
I'll never know what made it so exciting  
Why all at once my heart took flight  
I only know when he began to dance with me  
I could have danced, danced, danced all night  
  
I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night  
And still have begged for more, more, more  
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things  
I've never done before  
  
I'll never know what made it so, so exciting  
Why all at once my heart took flight  
I only know when he began to dance with me  
I could have danced, danced, danced all night
