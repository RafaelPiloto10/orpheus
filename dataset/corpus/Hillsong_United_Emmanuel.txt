Together in this place of worship  
Your greatness we proclaim  
We stand as one in giving You  
All glory and acclaim  
To You our hearts are open  
To You our hands we raise  
Come take the place of honour in our lives  
  
Emmanuel  
Our God is with us  
Prince of Peace Mighty One  
The Ever-living God  
  
See the praises of our Saviour  
Rise to open skies  
With the dawning of redemption  
Your glory will arise  
For You alone are worthy  
Here in Zion you are praised  
Our Lord and King forever  
You will reign
