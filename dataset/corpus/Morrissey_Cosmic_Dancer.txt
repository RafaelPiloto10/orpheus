I was dancing when I was twelve  
I was dancing when I was twelve  
I was dancing when I was...oh  
I was dancing when I was...oh  
I danced myself out of the womb  
I danced myself out of the womb  
Is it strange to dance so soon?  
Is it strange to dance so soon?  
Is it wrong to understand  
The fear that dwells inside a man?  
What's it like to be a loon?  
I liken it to a balloon  
Oh...  
I danced myself into the tomb  
I danced myself into the tomb  
Is it strange to dance so soon?  
Is it strange to dance so soon?  
Is it wrong to understand  
The fear that dwells inside a man?  
What's it like to be a loon?  
I liken it to a balloon  
Oh...
