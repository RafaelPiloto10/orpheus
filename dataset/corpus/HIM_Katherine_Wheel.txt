Come on and break me a limb at a time  
Wrap me around your spokes so tight  
There is no letting go  
Spin me around to blur the line between you and I  
What are you waiting for?  
  
Lo and behold baby  
These are the things you make me do  
Katherine wheel I'm burning for you  
Please don't stop until my heart no longer screams  
Katherine wheel  
Katherine wheel  
  
Holding hands won't be enough  
In a world giving head to a god  
Love in theory and practice chapter one  
  
Lo and behold baby  
These are the things you make me do  
Katherine wheel I'm burning for you  
Please don't stop until my heart no longer screams  
Katherine wheel  
Katherine wheel  
  
I twist and turn in your arms swirl  
The dizzier I get the clearer I see with you  
I'm at peace with the world within  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Lo and behold baby  
These are the things you make me do  
Katherine wheel I'm burning for you  
Please don't stop until my heart no longer screams  
Katherine wheel  
Katherine wheel
