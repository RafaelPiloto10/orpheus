Tears on your pillow, that's evidence  
Crying all night, it don't make no sense  
Never know what to do, so the tears come out  
I used to wonder what this thing was about  
  
You're so sensitive  
So willing to give  
Girl, you're just a cutie, yeah, yeah  
But, everything hits your tender spot  
I think I see just what you've got  
  
Emotion eyes see what they wanna see  
They just won't let it be  
There's always something goin' on  
Emotion eyes, can't seem to be without  
Something to cry about  
They just get so emotional  
  
My, oh, mercy me, just what do you see?  
Nothing stops those tears from coming  
What's the matter chile, don't you ever smile?  
Watching you is really something  
  
You don't need to struggle with your badness  
'Cause you're the baddest girl there'll ever be  
You've got to learn to compromise  
You've got to dry your weeping eyes  
Watch what you see with those  
  
You don't need to struggle with your badness  
You're just the baddest girl there'll ever be  
You've got to learn to compromise  
You've got to dry your weeping eyes  
Watch what you do with those
