Maybe, is a word that hangs between us  
It's the thing to say when all else has failed  
Maybe we failed, maybe  
Maybe, but I can't bare say it's over  
Til the love we found is hopelessly lost  
Maybe I could, maybe not.  
  
Our lives might have come unwound  
But have we've come so far  
That we can't turn the hurt around  
Our hearts still remain the same  
Oh, first to wonder why  
Oh, ask to make a change.  
  
But maybe  
Maybe, if we hold on to tomorrow  
Just hold on, just hold on  
Then we just might find a feeling again  
Not let it end.  
  
Maybe, it's a word that hangs between us  
Maybe, time would help the wondering to stop  
Maybe we will know, maybe not  
Maybe, maybe.
