Time kills  
Go ask Jesus  
I'm done  
Makes no difference  
Stare straight  
Stare at the sun  
I'm done  
Makes no difference  
  
Time takes us all  
So, why am I not just living for today?  
Time takes us  
Time takes us all  
Will I die right now?  
I'm only seconds away  
Time takes us  
  
Move on  
Gone forever  
I'm done  
Makes no difference  
Poison  
Time kills slowly  
You're done  
Makes no difference  
  
Time takes us all  
So, why am I not just living for today?  
Time takes us  
Time takes us all  
Will I die right now?  
It could be seconds away  
Time takes us  
  
Time will now be  
Time will now be  
Time will now be (time will now be) the chopping block  
Leave my head  
Time will now be the chopping block  
So leave my head!  
Leave my head!  
Leave my head!  
  
Time kills  
Makes no difference  
I'm done  
(Makes no difference, makes no difference)  
  
(Time takes us all)  
So, why am I not just living for today?  
Time takes us  
Time takes us all  
Will I die right now?  
It could be seconds away  
Time takes us  
  
Time takes us all
