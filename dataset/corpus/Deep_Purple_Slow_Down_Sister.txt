Go to the woman like a switchblade knife  
Baby says we're gonna break the law tonight  
Ooh...if your daddy could see you now  
Rock'n'Roll rebel on a jailbreak run  
This operator but a little high strung  
There's one in every crowd  
You got coming to you, it happens every time  
That's what you get for a life of crime  
You got it coming to you, if you cross the line  
And you can't back up, when the going gets tough  
And if you fly that high you'd better get some...  
Slow down sister, you're burn, burn, burnin', at the speed of light  
Better slow down sister  
Put on tile brakes or you won't get through the night  
She don't love you, gonna shoot to thrill  
I tell you that little girl's kiss could kill  
She got me standing on a one way street  
Can't break the chains, the ties that bind  
Slave to the rhythm and my heart's in time  
Beware the taste is bittersweet  
When the lights go down, and you hit the ground  
It'll happen so fast,....  
Slow down sister  
I said look out now, danger in a little girl's eyes  
Slow down sister  
Well you're gonna find out there's trouble in paradise  
..that ain't nice...  
You'll never stop... your butterfly ball  
....in the black, you think you've done it all  
Come on now baby, you know it's true  
You want all the money and the price of fame  
Ride to glory on another man's name  
Now there's a lesson here for you  
You'd better slow down sister  
I said look out now, there's danger in a little girl's eyes  
Slow down sister, slow down ,slow down  
Well you're gonna find out there's trouble..trouble in paradise  
I said slow!
