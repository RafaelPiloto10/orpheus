Girl, you're such a bad thing  
Standing there all alone  
Looking so good to me baby  
Can't do no wrong (hey, baby)  
  
Put your arms around me  
Set my world on fire  
There ain't never gonna be nobody like you baby  
Honey, that's no lie (hey, honey)  
  
You put that spell on me  
I'll tell you, honey  
You know you set me free  
Hey, little girl you know my hearts desire  
Come on and give it to me, baby  
I can't deny ya!  
  
Hey, hey, what I'm sayin' is  
Do it to me one more time  
Oh, give you one more chance  
This heart of mine  
Do it to me one more time, baby  
Can't get enough of your love!  
  
Oh, you're my Motown lover  
Girl of my dreams  
When you laugh, when you cry  
Girl, that look in your eyes  
You're my everything, oh baby,  
Oh baby, oh baby  
  
You're puttin' that spell on me  
I'll tell you baby  
You know you set me free

Oh, give you one more chance  
This heart of mine  
Do it to me one more time  
Can't get enough of your love!  
Can't get enough of your love!  
  
Whoa, oh, my friends say I'm a dreamer  
It takes a fool in love  
To know what I'm feeling  
Each time you say goodbye  
I find a reason why to give us one more try  
Knowing, knowing, baby  
You're gonna hurt me! Ooh, ooh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, do it to me one more time  
Give you one more chance this heart of mine  
Do it to me one more time  
Can't get enough of your love!  
  
Got this feeling deep inside me  
There ain't nothing I can hide, baby  
I just love the way you love me  
Do it to me one more time, oh baby  
Can't you see girl, that I need you  
All I wanna do is please you  
Even though it's hard to love you  
Do it to me one more time, oh yeah  
When you move girl, you tease me  
We make love slow and easy  
I just want you here beside me  
Do it to me one more time!  
Do it, do it baby
