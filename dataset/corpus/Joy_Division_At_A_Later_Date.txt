Why must we be put down when we try to get away?  
Why must we all grow up when we could just play and play?  
Good things in life are free - can't buy everything, that's true  
Only one thing wrong with that - what it don't buy I don't use  
  
Only thing I'm thinking of is "Why are we all here?"  
There must be more to do at nights than drinking rotten beer  
The world's a very shady place, and you can't trust a soul  
"Grin and bear it" seemed the thing, when it just gets a hold  
At a later date, it might come out a fright  
At a later date, I hope that you're alright  
  
Human beings are dangerous and they call me in the dark  
But everything gets twice as cold in marching for a lark  
There's loads of things I'd like to do if I could find the time  
Working really tires me and I think I'll turn to crime  
At a later date, I hope they start it soon  
At a later date, before we hit the moon  
  
I just can't be bothered to make an effort here at all  
People make you feel your contributions are too small  
I just can't be bothered to make an effort here at all  
People make you feel your contributions are too small  
At a later date, I'll be awful great  
At a later date, someone somewhere blew it  
At a later date, at a later date
