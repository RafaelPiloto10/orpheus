It won't be long now  
The music's on loud  
We'll sing this song out  
And then we'll lie down  
I'll hold you close then  
And let you know when  
The space and time bend  
And then we'll fall in  
  
Go put on your best tonight  
It's you and me and one spotlight  
One more show, one last time  
We are ready  
  
Say you will be all around me  
When your body sets your heart free  
Say you will be all around me  
  
I'll look for your eyes  
To keep me inside  
When everything dies  
But one last sunrise  
And when we stand there  
Together not scared  
I'll dry your last tear  
And then we'll just err  
  
Go put on your best tonight  
It's you and me and not much time  
To watch the world burning bright  
We are ready  
  
Say you will be all around me  
When your body sets your heart free  
Say you will be all around me  
Say you'll get me before the ending  
Take my body, set my heart free  
Say you'll get me before the ending  
  
Go put on your best tonight  
It's you and me and one spotlight  
One more show, one last time  
It won't be long now  
  
Say you will be all around me  
When your body sets your heart free  
Say you will be all around me  
Say you'll get me before the ending  
Take my body, set my heart free  
Say you'll get me before the ending  
Say you will be (you won't be long)  
All around me (you won't be long now)
