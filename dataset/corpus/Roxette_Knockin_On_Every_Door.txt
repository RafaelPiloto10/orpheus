Hey now honey  
You got to face the floor  
You headed for the heart  
But you couldn't find the door, could you?  
Could you?  
  
Well, I'm standing in the sun  
But I'm living in the rain  
I got to get a-whirlin' like a human hurricane over you  
Over you  
  
Now you're looking like a fox on the run  
And you're faster than a shot from a gun  
I'm pointing at you, oh you  
Talking 'bout you, hey you  
  
I thought we had love in store  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Babe, I've seen it all before  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Ain't no lovin' you ignore  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Keep keep knock knockin' on every door  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
  
Hey now honey  
Time is all you've spent  
You moved into the bed  
But you couldn't pay the rent, could you?  
Could you?  
  
In the twinkle of an eye  
You electrify  
I got to get a-shootin' like a rocket in the sky, bye bye  
Goodbye  
  
Now you're burning like you're hot on the scene  
Don't you love to steal a part of my dream?  
I'm looking at you, oh you  
Talking 'bout you, yea you  
  
I thought we had love in store  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Babe, I've seen it all before  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Ain't no lovin' you ignore  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Keep keep knock knockin' on every door  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
  
I thought we used to have love in store  
You keep knock knockin' on every door  
Hey babe, don't run around here no more  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Ain't no sugar you ignore  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Keep keep knock knockin' on every door  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
  
You'd better learn your lesson now...
