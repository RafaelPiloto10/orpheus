Throughout my lifetimes I'd hesitate  
I'd feel some joy  
But before I'd show my thanks it became too late  
But now all the way I want to find the time  
Stop and say  
I thank you Lord for giving us each new day  
  
And as I think back over so many years  
Love that's filled my ears  
I got to thank you Lord for giving us Pure Smokey  
And anyone who hears - hears that voice so free  
He really got a hold on me  
And I thank you all for giving to us Smokey - Smokey  
  
Singing it so sweetly  
Like no one else could do  
Always trying something new  
I thank you all for giving us Pure Smokey
