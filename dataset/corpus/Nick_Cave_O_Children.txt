Pass me that lovely little gun  
My dear, my darling one  
The cleaners are coming, one by one  
You don't even want to let them start  
  
They are knocking now upon your door  
They measure the room, they know the score  
They're mopping up the butcher's floor  
Of your broken little hearts  
  
O children  
  
Forgive us now for what we've done  
It started out as a bit of fun  
Here, take these before we run away  
The keys to the gulag  
  
O children  
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice  
Children  
Rejoice, rejoice  
  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on  
  
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim  
They're gathering round with all my friends  
We're older now, the light is dim  
And you are only just beginning  
  
O children  
  
We have the answer to all your fears  
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal clear  
It's round about, it's somewhere here  
Lost amongst our winnings  
  
O children  
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice  
Children  
Rejoice, rejoice  
  
The cleaners have done their job on you  
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove  
They've hosed you down, you're good as new  
And they're lining up to inspect you  
  
O children  
  
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost  
He's found the answer that we lost  
We're all weeping now, weeping because  
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you  
  
O children  
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice  
Children  
Rejoice, rejoice  
  
Hey little train! We're jumping on  
The train that goes to the Kingdom  
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun  
And the train ain't even left the station  
  
Hey, little train! Wait for me!  
I once was blind but now I see  
Have you left a seat for me?  
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?  
  
Hey little train! Wait for me!  
I was held in chains but now I'm free  
I'm hanging in there, don't you see  
In this process of elimination  
  
Hey little train! We're jumping on  
The train that goes to the Kingdom  
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun  
It's beyond my wildest expectation  
  
Hey little train! We're jumping on  
The train that goes to the Kingdom  
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun  
And the train ain't even left the station
