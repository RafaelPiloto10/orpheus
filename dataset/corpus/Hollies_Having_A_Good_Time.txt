You read the stars  
Everyday in the paper  
And believe every word they say  
You want to know  
If I'll always love you  
But I can't see tomorrow today  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
The story is always unwinding  
But right here and now  
It doesn't matter  
Are you having a good time  
  
You know that I'm no fortune teller  
I can't predict  
How it will be  
You need a love that lasts forever  
That far ahead  
I just can't see  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
I don't know what might've happen  
But this me and you in this situation  
Are you having a good time  
  
If everything's perfect  
What more could we ask for  
We're here and now  
  
Are you having a good time  
You're somewhere off  
Into the future  
Imagining how it will look  
Will we last another chapter  
Can we make it last 'til the end of the book  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
The story is always unwinding  
But right here and now  
It doesn't matter  
Having a good time  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
I don't know what might've happen  
But this me and you in this situation  
Are you having a good time  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
The story is always unwinding  
But right here and now  
It doesn't matter  
Are you having a good time
