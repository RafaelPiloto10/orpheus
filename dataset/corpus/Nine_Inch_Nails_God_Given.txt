Hey, man, please don't make a sound  
Take a look around  
Can't you see what's right in front of you?  
Have a little taste  
No more time to waste  
You don't wanna get left behind 'cause it's all coming down right now  
  
How hard is it to see?  
Put your faith in me  
'Cause you wouldn't want to be  
Praying to the wrong piece of wood  
You should get where you belong  
Everything you know is wrong  
Come on, sing along, everybody now  
  
(God given)  
  
[Chorus:]  
And He gives us sight  
And we see the light  
And it burns so bright  
Now we know we're right  
It is kingdom come  
And Thy will be done  
We have just begun  
We're the chosen ones  
  
(I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come
right from  
His mouth that He wants me to tell you)  
  
Wait  
Step into the light  
How can this be right?  
I'm afraid we're going to ask you to leave  
Guess you cannot win  
With the color of your skin  
You won't be getting in to the Promised Land  
This is just another case  
You people still don't know your place  
Step aside, out the way, wipe that look off your face  
'Cause we are the divine  
Separated from the swine  
Come on, sing along, everybody now  
  
(God given)  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
(I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come
right from  
His mouth that He wants me to tell you)  
  
(God given)
