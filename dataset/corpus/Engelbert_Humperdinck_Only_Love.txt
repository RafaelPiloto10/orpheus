ONLY LOVE  
WRITERS MARK SPIRO, ROBBIE BUCHANAN  
I see the distant lights ahead  
Another hour or so, and I'll be back in bed  
I guess I really thought  
That I was gone for good  
But you know I never could  
I count the headlights passing by  
With every one I find  
Another reason why  
You'll be sound asleep  
And I'll look a fool  
How could I be so cruel?  
Only love could make me turn around  
And make these tears come tumbling down  
Only love  
Only love could make you stay with me  
I doubt myself but you believe  
Only love  
I wish that I could be that strong  
To see me as I am,  
And love me right or wrong  
I guess I'm still afraid  
To only say goodbye  
So I keep it all inside  
Only love...  
[Chorus]  
So I try to run, but no matter what I do  
I know it's true: I can't go on without you  
Only love...
