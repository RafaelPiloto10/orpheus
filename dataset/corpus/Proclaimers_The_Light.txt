You make it sound easy  
You say just hold your hand out don't you  
You just hold your hand out don't you  
That hope never leaves you  
  
'Cause a light shines on that helps you to steer  
Makes everything clear  
(Well it might)  
Well it might in your world  
  
(But it doesn't)  
But it doesn't in mine  
(I've been stumbling)  
I've been stumbling in the dark for years  
And the light just made me blind  
  
You say it lights every pathway  
Shows me how to live life  
For the rest of my days  
For the rest of my days  
  
(But I can't)  
But I can't put my faith in  
(Your words)  
Your words and demands  
  
(I believe)  
I believe in God alright  
It's folk like you I just can't stand  
  
You don't have to try and scare me  
To reinforce my faith sir  
'cause I know that one day  
I'll stand before my maker  
  
(And it I'm found)  
And if I'm found wanting  
(When my case)  
When my case is heard  
  
(It'll be)  
It'll be by the author  
Not some interpreter of his words  
  
You make it sound easy  
You say just hold your hand out don't you  
You just hold your hand out don't you  
That hope never leaves you  
  
'Cause a light shines on that helps you to steer  
Makes everything clear  
(Well it might)  
Well it might in your world  
  
(But it doesn't)  
But it doesn't in mine  
(I've been stumbling)  
I've been stumbling in the dark for years  
  
And the light just made me blind  
Yeah the light just made me blind
