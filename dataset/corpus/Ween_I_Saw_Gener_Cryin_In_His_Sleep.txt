I heard my brother weepin' in the dead of the night  
I said, "Dude, man, you feelin' alright"  
Gener said nothin' and continued to weep  
I caught Papa Gene Ween cryin' in his sleep  
  
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep  
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep  
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep  
  
(You fucked it up again!)  
  
Life at the top can be tough  
Sometimes you think you've seen enough  
But you can find a diamond in the rough  
But when it's time for bed, you shouldn't think about that stuff  
  
Yeah, I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep  
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep  
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep  
  
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep  
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep  
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep
