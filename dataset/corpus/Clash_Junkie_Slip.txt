I wasn't going that far  
The junkie slip!  
I said I wasn't doin' it  
The junkie slip!  
Yea thought I'd find a rhythm in the junkie town  
Thought I'd find a rhythm when the junkies hang around  
  
Thought I'd go out walking to the junkie kind of beat  
Setting on those bars that the junkies meet  
The junkie slip!  
Nail it down  
The junkie slip!  
This side of town  
The junkie slip!  
And whatcha knowing before you's a doin'  
The things they's a-knowing  
You pawn your coat and your car  
Pawned your cigar and your old guitar  
You pawned your guitar and your saxophone  
You're pawning everything in your mother's home  
  
'cause it's a junkie slip!  
Just like rock n' roll  
A junkie slip!  
Like Johnny did the stroll  
And you know it feels alright  
But what's that feeling on a Saturday night?  
  
You're itching itching itching in your pillow in the day  
You're itching itching itching and you gave your coat away  
Itching itching itching and then in your sleeping bag  
There's a little packet that you thought you never had  
  
It's a junkie slip!  
Every night  
Junkie slip!  
Cold water fright  
It's a junkie slip  
And an old spoon cooky cooky cooky kooky afternoon  
All afternoon and in the middle of the night  
  
You're worse for the difference and it don't sleep tight  
Don't pull the curtains fon't put on the light  
See-see-see-'cause it's a junkie slip!  
What's goin' on?  
Was early night  
I lit the fire  
Finish alright  
Yeh Edi-Edi-Edi-Yeh Edi-Juan  
Him going to live with Indian  
Come in the car, it's an old machine  
Riding from Brookway on a magazine  
Be on that corner with a magazine  
  
Do ya do ya do ya follow your friends?  
Do I hear you saying that you're going back again?  
It's a junkie slip!  
Where? Did it end?  
But did it ah did it did it ever end?  
When did it ever end?  
Don't ask me when on a Wednesday night  
Don't ask me when on a Thursday night  
I said oh? Who the hell are you?  
You said oh! Well you met me  
I said I can guess why
