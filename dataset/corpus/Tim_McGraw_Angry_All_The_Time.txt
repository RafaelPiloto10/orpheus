Here we are  
What is left of a husband and a wife with four good kids  
Who have a way of gettin on with their lives  
And I'm not old but I'm getting a whole lot older every day  
It's too late to keep from goin' crazy  
I've got to get away  
  
The reasons that I can't stay, don't have a thing to do with being in love  
And I understand that lovin' a man shouldn't have to be this rough  
And you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left you far behind  
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time  
  
Our boys are strong now, the spittin' image of you when you were young  
I hope someday they can see past what you have become  
I remember every time I said I'd never leave  
But what I can't live with is memories of the way you used to be  
  
The reasons that I can't stay, don't have a thing to do with being in love  
I understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough  
You ain't the only one who feels like this world's left you far behind  
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time  
  
Twenty years, have came and went, since I walked out of your door  
I never quite made it back, to the one I was before  
And God it hurts me to think of you  
For the light in your eyes was gone  
And sometimes I don't know why this old world can't leave well enough alone  
  
The reasons that I can't stay, don't have a thing to do with being in love  
And I understand that lovin, a man shouldn't have to be this rough  
You ain't the only one who feels like this world's left you far behind  
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time [Repeat x3]
