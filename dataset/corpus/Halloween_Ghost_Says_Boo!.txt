I'm a ghost, my name is Bill,  
I live in a haunted house up on the hill.  
All day long, all by myself,  
I don't have to share with anyone else.  
  
Halloween night, kids come around,  
They knock on my door, from all over town.  
They open the door 'cause they think it's ok.  
I'll show you what I do to scare'em away.  
  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house,  
Get out of my house right now.  
  
They look through the windows, look through the doors,...  
  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house,  
Get out of my house right now.  
  
They get really scared when they hear me say boo!...  
  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house.  
The ghost says boo! Get out of my house,  
Get out of my house right now.
