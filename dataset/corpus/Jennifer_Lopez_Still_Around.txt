Do you remember what you said to me the day I met you  
Like yesterday I still can hear your voice, you promised to be  
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there  
Well, it's been a while and here we are lookin' back on times that we shared  
  
I still imagine us being young and so in love  
Never apart, you were my heart  
Seems like it's always just been us  
  
I remember we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me  
I'm the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete  
If I said I'd be your girl  
You would stay with me forever  
Boy, you never let me down  
Through it all you're still around  
Still around (yeah)  
  
I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days  
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made  
I sing your favorite song inside my head when you're not with me  
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me  
  
I can imagine us being old and still in love  
Never apart, you are my heart  
Makes me smile, we're still in love  
  
I remember we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me  
I'm the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete  
If I said I'd be your girl  
You would stay with me forever  
Boy, you never let me down  
Through it all you're still around  
  
Looking back through all the years  
  
Heh  
You remember the first time I went to your house  
And your father looked at me like I had three heads  
(And I will never forget the day)  
Heh  
We were so in love  
(Looking back through all the years)  
You were so beautiful and so young  
(And I will never forget the day you came into my life and what you said to
me)  
I can't believe you're still mine  
That's crazy  
I love you  
  
I remember we were in the park (we were in the park)  
Holding hands and you said to me (holding hands)  
I'm the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete (and I would your life complete)  
If I said I'd be your girl  
You would stay with me forever (I'm still your girl)  
Boy, you never let me down  
Through it all you're still around (I'll never let you down, my baby)  
  
I remember we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me  
I'm the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete  
If I said I'd be your girl (said I'd be your girl and)  
You would stay with me forever  
Boy, you never let me down  
Through it all you're still around  
Still around (yeah)
