They got the luxury money can buy  
They're living like kings and queens  
The whole world's crying whenever they cry  
They smile when they smile at scenes  
What's left of all that glamour and glory  
You find behind the doors in hollywood  
Living like a moviestar  
Tell me how they really are  
Prisoners of roles  
Until their final curtains fall  
Living like a moviestar  
I don't think i go too far  
If i say they're lonely after all  
Too much of everything  
Too much to choose  
They finally lose control  
Crime and insanity, scandals and booze  
They're dying 'fore getting old  
What's left of all that glamour and glory  
You find behind the doors in hollywood  
Living like a moviestar  
Tell me how they really are  
Prisoners of roles  
Until their final curtains fall  
Living like a moviestar  
I don't think i go too far  
If i say they're lonely after all  
Living like a moviestar  
Tell me how they really are  
Prisoners of roles  
Until their final curtains fall...
