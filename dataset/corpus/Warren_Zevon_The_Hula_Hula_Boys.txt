I saw her leave the luau  
With the one who parked the cars  
And the fat one from the swimming pool  
They were swaying arm in arm  
I could hear the ukuleles playing  
Down by the sea  
She's gone with the hula hula boys  
She don't care about me  
She's gone with the hula hula boys  
She don't care about me  
They're singing,  
  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana  
  
Yesterday she went to see  
The Polynesian band  
But she came home with her hair all wet  
And her clothes all filled with sand  
I didn't have to come to Maui  
To be treated like a jerk  
How do you think I feel  
When I see the bellboys smirk?  
And I can hear the ukuleles playing  
Down by the sea  
She's gone with the hula hula boys  
She don't care about me  
They're signing,  
  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana  
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
