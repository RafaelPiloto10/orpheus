You fell away,  
What more can I say?  
The feelings evolved,  
I wont let it out,  
I can't replace  
Your screaming face  
Feeling the sickness inside  
  
Why won't you die?  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
So many words,  
Can't discribe my face  
This feelings evolved  
So soon to break out  
I can't relate  
To a happy state  
Feeling the blood run inside  
  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine,  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me?  
Keep me down to what you think I should be  
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry  
Keep on trying I'm not dying so easily  
(I will not die)  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me? (I will not die)  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me? (I will not die)  
  
Why wont you die?  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Why would you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine
