(words sung by the character in the movie given in brackets)  
Now I have nothing, so God give me strength  
Cause Im weak in her [his] wake  
And if Im strong I might still break  
And I don't have anything to share  
That I wont throw away into the air  
  
That song is sung out  
This bell is rung out [this belle is wrung out]  
[he] she was the light that I'd bless  
[he] she took my last chance at happiness  
So God give me strength, God give me strength  
  
I can't hold onto [him] her, God give me strength  
When the phone doesnt't't ring  
And Im lost in imagining  
Everything that kind of love is worth  
As I tumble back down to the earth  
  
That song is sung out  
This bell is rung out  
[he] she was the light that I'd bless  
[he] she took my last chance at happiness  
So God give me strength,  
  
God if [hed] she'd grant me [his] her indulgence and decline  
I might as well wipe [him] her from my memory  
Fracture the spell as [he] she becomes my enemy  
Maybe I was washed out like a lip-print on his shirt  
See, Im only human, I want him to hurt  
I want him  
I want him to hurt  
  
[instrumental]  
Since I lost the power to pretend  
That there could ever be a happy ending  
  
That song is sung out  
This bell is rung out  
[he] she was the light that I'd bless  
[he] she took my last chance at happiness  
So God give me strength, God give me strength
