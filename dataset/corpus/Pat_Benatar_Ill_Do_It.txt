Well the unseen sights look good to you  
I notice how you survey the room  
Awkward conversation and you're too polite  
You know that's always a clue  
I'm wasting my time tryin' to tell ya'  
That you're making the mistake of your life  
Cause you're so sure that you need to go  
At any cost, at any price  
  
But, I'll Do It  
I'll send you out on your own, with no guarantee  
I'll Do It  
But when you want to come home and you look for love  
Don't look for me!  
  
Tell me, when did everything start to go wrong?  
And why was I the last one to know?  
You're so good at hidin' your feelings  
I'm so good at lettin' mine show  
  
Well I know how great it feels together  
But that just isn't enough  
Cause I need more than your bedside manner  
I need someone to love  
  
So, I'll Do It  
I guess there's nothin' to say, its all been said  
I'll Do It  
Make sure you want it this way, 'cause when it's done this time  
I'll be gone  
  
I'll Do It  
I'll send you out on your own, with no guarantee  
I'll Do It  
But when you want to come home and you look for love  
Don't look for me!  
  
I'll Do It  
I'll Do It  
I'll Do It  
I'll Do It  
I'll Do It
