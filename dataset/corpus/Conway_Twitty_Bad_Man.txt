I have the reputation that's known throughout the land  
They say I'm master on the draw of any livin' man  
They call me a bad man, they say I kill for fun  
They say the only thing I know is how to use a gun  
But they don't know the reason they branded me as bad  
It started many years ago when I was just a lad  
  
I rode into a cattle town, a boy of twenty-three  
So young and yet that very day I carved my destiny  
I walked into the town saloon that sad and faithful day  
Then I began to gamble to pass the time away  
I thought I played a hand or two then hit the thrill again  
But Lady Luck was with me and I began to win  
  
The dealer kept on dealin', the stakes were gettin' high  
And pretty soon there was no one left but an old cowboy and I  
The minutes seemed like hours, you couldn't hear a sound  
We've been in race until we'd lay all our money down  
The cowboy smiled and showed his hands, three aces he did hold  
But I laid down the royal flush and reached to claim my gold  
  
The cowboy stood and faced me, his hands hung on his hips  
A look of hate was in his eyes and the smile had left his lips  
He said, "Young man, slap leather, I'm known for miles around  
To keep my reputation about I got to gun you down"  
White lightnin' speeded through that fire, one life will be the cost  
The cowboy crumbled to the floor, his reputation lost  
  
Now years have come and years have gone and many men have died  
He's tried his luck and hoped he'd be the fastest gun alive  
And in my many fights to live, I wondered if I'd won  
I'm known by all the bad men, they think I kill for fun  
Someday I'll meet the cowboy who's speed will meet the test  
And that will in the saga of the bad man of the west
