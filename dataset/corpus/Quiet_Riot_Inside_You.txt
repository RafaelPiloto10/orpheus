All I ever get from you  
Are attitudes and broken rules but...  
I just wanna feel your love beside me  
A new day is gonna come  
Together to sing my song  
Got to feel the melody inside you  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
I wanna feel, I wanna feel inside you  
Love's fire burnin' in my brain  
Love's fire gonna drive me insane  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
Since your flowing through my veins  
I ain't never felt the same  
Feels like a whole new world inside me  
I'm never gonna let you go  
Gotta let your feelings show  
Never, never leave the love inside you  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
I wanna feel, I wanna feel inside you  
Love's fire burnin' in my brain  
Love's fire gonna drive me insane  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
Nothing could ever take you away from me  
No one would ever take me (yeah yeah) inside of you  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
I wanna feel, I wanna feel inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you
