No life till leather  
We are gonna kick some ass tonight  
We got the metal madness  
When our fans start screaming  
It's right well alright  
When we start to rock  
We never want to stop again  
  
Hit the lights  
Hit the lights  
Hit the lights  
  
You know our fans are insane  
We are gonna blow this place away  
With volume higher  
Than anything today the only way  
When we start to rock  
We never want to stop again  
  
Hit the lights  
Hit the lights  
Hit the lights  
  
With all our screaming  
We are gonna rip right through your brain  
We got the lethal power  
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain  
When we start to rock  
We never want to stop again  
  
Hit the lights  
Hit the lights  
Hit the lights
