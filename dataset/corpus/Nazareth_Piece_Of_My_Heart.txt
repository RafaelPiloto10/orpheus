Didn't I make you feel  
Like you were the only one  
Didn't I give you everything  
That a man possibly can  
But all the love I give you  
It's never enough  
But I'm going to show you baby  
That a man can be tough  
Come on come on come on come on  
And take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart  
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good  
You're out on the street looking good  
And you know deep down in your heart it ain't right  
And you never never hear me  
When I cry for you each night  
Sometimes I tell myself I can't stand the pain  
But when I hold you in my arms  
I say it again  
Come on come on come on come on  
And take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart  
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good  
Sometimes I tell myself I can't stand the pain  
But when I hold you in my arms I say it again  
Come on come on come on come on  
And take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart  
You know you've got it  
So take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart  
Take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart
