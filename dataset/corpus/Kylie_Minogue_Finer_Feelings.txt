The finer feelings, the finer feelings  
  
You can't give to me  
Anything  
I couldn't get for myself  
I have needs as much as any man  
And I understand the feelings well  
  
I can still have a true heart  
With a free mind  
A good life  
With a good time  
  
[Chorus]  
But what is love  
Without the finer feelings  
It's just sex  
Without the sexual healing  
Passion dies  
Without some tender meanings  
It ain't love  
Without the finer feelings  
  
I get passionate  
Just like you  
But I have a little self-control  
You just show your selfish attitude  
Your emotion leaves me cold  
  
I can still have a true heart  
With a free mind  
A good life  
With a good time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The finer, the finer  
The finer feelings  
  
(I can still have a true heart) it ain't love  
(With a free mind) it ain't love  
(A good life)  
(With a good time) feelings  
  
[Chorus]
