Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!  
Turn on the dynamo, into the wild I go,  
No other place I know, I know.  
Turn on I see red,  
Warhorse, Warhead,  
Throttle up for speed ahead, yeah ahead.  
CHORUS:  
Ooooh, on I burn,  
Fuel these pumping engines,  
Burning hard, loose and clean,  
And on I burn, turning my direction,  
Quench my thirst with gasoline.  
Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire,  
Can't fight the need for speed,  
I'm loose, I'm clean, I'm burning lean and mean, and mean.  
Ignite the open trail,  
Excite, exhale, comin' on, hot from hell, yeah hot from hell.  
CHORUS  
Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire,  
Oooh, yeah-heh.  
SOLO1  
On I burn!  
SOLO2  
On, and on, and on...  
Give me fuel,  
On, and on, and on...  
Give me fire,  
On, and on, and on...  
My desire,  
On, and on, and on...  
CHORUS  
Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!  
FUEL!
