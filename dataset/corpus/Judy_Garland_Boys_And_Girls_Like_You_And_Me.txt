We walk on every city street  
We walk in lanes where branches meet  
And stars send down their blessings from the blue.  
We go through storms of doubt and fear  
And so we walk from year to year  
Believing in each other as we do.  
Bravely marching forward two by two...  
  
Boys and girls like you and me  
Walk beneath the skies  
They love just as we love  
With the same dream in their eyes.  
Songs and kings and many things  
Have their day and are gone  
But boys and girls like you and me  
We go on and on.  
  
Songs and kings and many things  
Have their day and are gone  
But boys and girls like you and me  
We go on and on.
