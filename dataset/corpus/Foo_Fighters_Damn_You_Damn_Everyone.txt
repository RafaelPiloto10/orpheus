Try Runnin around the candle  
I was only running into you  
Try Runnin around the candle  
I don't try to run it into you  
  
I get tired of runnin into you  
  
Damn you damn everyone  
I'll be fine without you  
Damn you damn everyone  
I'll be fine without you  
  
I'm still tired of runnin into you  
  
Try one that's with you  
Tear my damn heart in two  
I won't battle? At you  
Running into it! Running into it!
