I am ready more than ever  
For YOU to love  
Heart is open  
I surrender every part of me  
  
Boom  
Is an explosion  
GOD is here to move  
Come on take over  
I am here for YOU  
  
My hope is in YOU  
Every day I'm living for YOU  
Give me YOUR power  
So I can change this world for YOU  
  
Show me YOUR ways LORD  
Gonna hold this place for YOU  
Give me YOUR spirit  
Come on set my heart on fire  
  
YOUR power  
YOUR glory  
Come and fill this place  
  
Gonna lift my voice to YOU  
Gonna give YOU all I am  
Gonna lift for YOU alone  
Cause YOU have set me free
