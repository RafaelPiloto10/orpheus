I'm the kind of brotha'  
Who been doin' it my way  
Gettin' my bread for years  
In my career  
And every lover  
In and out my life  
I hear love and left the tears  
Without a care  
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around  
She caught me by surprise  
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down  
I can't figure it out why  
  
I'm so, caught up  
Got me feelin' it, caught up  
I don't know what it is  
But it seems she's got me twisted  
I'm so, caught up  
Got me feelin' it, caught up  
I'm losin' control, this girls got a hold on me  
  
Let me go baby  
Now listen  
My momma told me  
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around  
Same ol' song  
But I was so sure  
That it wouldn't happen to me  
'cause I know how to put it down  
But I was so wrong  
This girl was mean  
She really turned me out  
Her body was so tight  
I'm lookin' for her in the daytime with a flashlight  
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style  
And I can't figure it out  
  
But I'm so, caught up  
Got me feelin' it, caught up  
I don't know what it is  
But it seems she's got me twisted  
  
I'm so, caught up  
Got me feelin' it, caught up  
I'm losin' control  
This girls got a hold  
I'm so, caught up  
Really feelin' it, caught up  
I don't know what it is  
But it seems she's got me twisted  
  
I'm so, caught up  
Really feelin' it, caught up  
I'm losin' control  
This girls got a hold on me  
  
And I think I like it baby  
Oh no, oh no, ooh, yeah, oh my  
  
This girl was mean  
She really turned me out  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, suga  
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style  
I'm so, caught up, caught up  
Don't know what it is  
But it seems she's got me twisted  
I'm so, caught up  
Really feelin' it, caught up  
I'm losin' control  
This girls got a hold  
I'm so, caught up  
I'm so, caught up  
I don't know what it is  
But it seems she's got me twisted  
I'm, caught up  
Really feelin' it  
Caught up, I'm losin' control  
This girls got a hold on me
