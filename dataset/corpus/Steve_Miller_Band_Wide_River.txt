Wide river she opens her mouth to the sea  
Singin' dear dear ocean now, here is a kiss from me  
And she runs like a river to the setting sun  
She runs like a river that has never been won  
She runs like a river that will always be free  
  
Wide river, carry me back home  
To the place I love, that I call my own  
And we can run like a river to the setting sun  
Run like a river that has never been won  
Run like a river that will always be free  
  
Wide river, do you remember me?  
It was not so long ago that you set me free  
And now I run like a river to the setting sun  
I run like a river that has never been won  
I run like a river that will always be free  
  
Come on baby, let's run in circles  
Come on darlin', let's circle each other  
And find our love, all the love that we need  
  
Come on baby, let's circle each other  
What we can do, do for each other  
I'll do for you, and you'll do for me  
  
And we can run like a river to the setting sun  
Run like a river that has never been won  
Run like a river that will always be free
