You're a rock-n-roll star  
You are out of the charts  
Your blood is cold you're getting old  
But your life is rock-n-roll  
  
That crazy rock-n-roll band  
Is spinning in your head (in your head)  
Each and every way ya make the thoughts  
Is about stars on the chart  
  
Ohhh... and they are top of the bill  
  
You're a rock-n-roll star  
You've been the first one on the chart  
You've had glory and fame  
Rock-n-roll was your game  
  
Ohhh... and you were top of the bill
