This song is for lovers out there  
And the little light in the trees  
And all the flowers have gingivitis  
And the birds fly happily  
We're together once again my love  
I need you back oh baby baby  
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start  
Living without you girl you'll only break my heart...  
I can feel it I can hold it I can rub it I can shape it  
I can mold it I can cut it I can taste it I can spank it  
Beat it  
Masturbate it  
I been looking for days now  
Always hearing the same ol' city boy  
Won't you spank through?  
I can make you do things you won't think you ever could
