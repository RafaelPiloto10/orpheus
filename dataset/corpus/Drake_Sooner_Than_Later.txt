Verse 1:(Drake)  
  
I Forgot To Call You On Your Birthday,  
You Swear You're The Last Thing On My Mind,  
There Is Nothin' I Can Do To Fix It,  
(All You Ever Asked Me For Was Time)  
When The Lights Don't Glow The Same Way That They Used To,  
And I Finally Get A Moment To Myself,  
I Will Realize You Were Everything I'm Missing,  
And You'll Tell Me You're In Love With Someone Else  
  
Chorus:(Drake)  
  
So Can You Do Me A Favor, If I Pull It Together,  
Make It Sooner Than Later,  
We Won't Be Here Forever, And I Realized I Waited Too Long,  
But Please Don't Move On,  
You Don't Need No One Else  
You Don't Need No One El-El-El-El-Else  
You Don't Need No One Else  
You Don't Need No One El-El-El-El Oh Ho Ho  
You Don't Need No One Else  
  
Verse 2:(Drake)  
  
You Just Changed Your Hair And It Looks Perfect,  
Wish I Was The First To Let You Know,  
Every Chance I Get To Make It Better,  
I Just Find A Way To Let It Go,  
When The Lights Don't Glow The Same Way That They Used To,  
And I Finally Get A Moment To Myself,  
I Will Realize You Were Everything I'm Missing,  
And You'll Tell Me You're In Love With Someone Else  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Verse 3:(Drake)  
  
The Girl Of The World, You See Someone Gotta Lose  
I Thought I Can Have It All, Do I Really Gotta Choose  
What Good Is All The Cash, If It Doesn't Buy Time,  
And What Good Is Bein' Famous, If I'm Never On Your Mind,  
Nights Fallen, Lights Glowin' And I'm Just Tryna Pay The Price Owin',  
And I Don't Wanna Feel The Comfort From My Ice Showin',  
And I Ain't Tryna Be Without You At The Right Moments,  
Nigga Nice Goin',  
Is It Worth It, That Decision,  
Cause Hearts Breakin', I Ain't Tryna Be In That Collision,  
So Imma Dust My Shirt, And Fix My Pants,  
Cause I Better Look Good Girl If This My Chance, I Swear  
  
[Chorus:]
