Baby, who you been lovin' since your man's gone  
Baby, who you been seein' since your man's gone  
Tellin' all those cheap, cheap lies, you  
Hopin' that his eyes won't see through you, yeah  
Well baby, I can play it, there's something I just got to do  
I got to slumpin' and you know that it's true  
You got the sure shockin', hit rockin' movements  
You're gonna blow my blues away  
  
Come on and rock me till I'm ready to rock (rock me, baby)  
Rock me till I'm ready to drop  
  
Baby, who you been lovin' since your man's gone (man's gone)  
Baby, who you been seein' since your man's gone (man's gone)  
Tellin' everybody that you just don't  
Really need love from anyone  
  
Baby, who you been lovin' since your man's gone (man's gone)  
Baby, who you been seein' since your man gone (man's gone)  
  
Rock me till I'm ready to rock (rock me, baby)  
Rock me till I'm ready to drop  
  
Baby, who you been lovin' since your man's gone (man's gone)  
Hey baby, who you been seein' since your man gone (man's gone)  
I'm sayin' baby, who you been lovin' since your man's gone  
(Baby, who you been lovin')  
Ooh honey, who you been seein' since your man gone  
(Baby, who you been lovin')  
I'm sayin' baby, who you been lovin' since your man's gone  
(Baby, who you been lovin')  
Honey who you been sleepin' with, your man's gone  
(Baby, who you been lovin')  
Baby, who you been walkin' with, your man's gone  
(Baby, who you been lovin')  
Honey, who you been lovin'
