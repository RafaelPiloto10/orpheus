Night falls, with gravity.  
The earth turns, from sanity  
Taking my only friend I know,  
He lives a lie, his name is Hope.  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.  
  
The horrors of the night melt away  
Under the warm glow of survival of the day  
Then we move on,  
My shadow grows taller along with my fears  
And my friends shrink smaller as night grows near  
  
When the sun is coming, window soothes  
And the silver lining rides the hills  
I will be saved for one whole day  
Until the sun make the hills its grave  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind.  
  
[Repeat x4]  
I'm semi-automatic,  
My prayers schizophrenic  
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on  
  
By the time the night wears off, the dust is down  
And shadows burn  
I will rise and stand my ground,  
Waiting for the night's return.  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind.
