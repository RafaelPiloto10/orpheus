Reasons why you ran  
Don't make you a good man  
Yes, I understand  
You were on time at the wrong time  
I was there (?) tried  
And I don't know why you can act cold on a diamond so out of line  
For you (for you)  
I'd do anything for you (for you, for you)  
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)  
I'd put my fist through a wall  
How come (How come)  
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)  
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)  
But I get nothing at all  
  
Reasons for my hope  
All make me a big joke  
I already know  
You were just fine  
I was just fine  
Why did we turn a good time to a dark one?  
I gave you a chance  
But the better man never called  
Oh, oh  
  
For you (For you)  
I'd do anything for you (for you, for you)  
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)  
I'd put my fist through a wall  
How come (how come)  
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)  
I take the blows like a champion (champion champion)  
But I get nothing at all  
But I get nothing at all  
But I get nothing at all  
For you (for you)  
I'd do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I'd do anything for you (for you, for you)  
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)  
I'd put my fist through a wall  
How come (How come)  
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)  
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)  
But I get nothing at all (but I get nothing, but I get nothing at all)  
I get nothing at all  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything
