(talk) This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki who is looking down on me
from  
Heaven Watching my every move as usual....  
  
(chorus)  
There but for the grace of god do I go do I go  
There but for the grace of God do I go do I go-go  
I'm trying to take my time on this rhyme  
  
But it's bustin from the seems  
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams  
I'm moving all around  
Oh yes,I'm making leaps an bounds  
There's so much shit to say, no time to write it down  
I'm skippin' to this and skippin' to that  
I've overflowed my cup.  
I'm flowin' kind of quick I hope you can keep up  
Every ain't cool just cause you slap me on my hand  
There're things about all of ya'll have got to understand  
Latifah- never was a teacher  
Never was a preacher  
Never was a saint  
Never was conceited  
Never was defeated  
Sometimes I get tired sometimes I want to faint.  
But I never shut up when things piss me off  
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across  
That's what I got to do that's how it's got to be  
I've got an angel watching over me  
  
(chorus) 2 times  
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world  
Yes he did, yes he did  
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world  
You don't hear me  
Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world, world,world,world  
The light of my world, my world- AHHHHH yes he did...............
