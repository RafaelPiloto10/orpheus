Comb your hair and paint and powder, you act proud and I'll act prouder  
You sing loud and I'll sing louder, tonight we're settin' the woods on fire  
You're my gal and I'm your feller, dress up in your frock of yeller  
I'll look swell but you'll look sweller settin', the woods on fire  
We'll take in all the honky tonks, tonight we're having fun  
We'll show the folks a brand new dance that never has been done  
I don't care who thinks we're silly, you be daffy and I'll be dilly  
We'll order up two bowls of chili, settin' the woods on fire  
  
I'll gas up my hot rod stoker, we'll get hotter than a poker  
You'll be broke but I'll be broker, tonight we're settin' the woods on fire  
We'll sit close to one another, up one street and down the other  
We'll have a time oh brother, settin' the woods on fire  
We'll put aside a little time to fix a flat or two  
My tires and tubes are doin' fine but the air is showin' through  
You clap hands and I'll start bowin', we'll do all the law's allowin'  
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowin', settin' the woods on fire
