Come on now  
Come on now  
We got no wheels to race  
  
Come on now  
Come on now  
Police are every place  
  
Come on now  
Come on now  
We got no skirts to chase  
  
I'm just a junk food guy  
Now I am telling you why  
I am living at the matinee, yeah  
  
I just want to sleep and play  
Come on now  
Come on now  
When the folks are not around  
  
Come on now  
Come on now  
Nagging 'about the sound  
Come on now  
Come on now  
To turn that racket down  
I'm just a comic book boy  
There's nothing scary to enjoy  
Freak admission stroll inside  
I was born on a roller coaster ride  
  
Come on now  
Come on now  
Police are every place  
  
Come on now  
Come on now  
We got no skirts to chase  
  
I'm just a comic book boy  
There's nothing scary to enjoy  
Freak admission stroll inside  
I was born on a roller coaster ride  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah come on now
