I know you don't know me  
Only our eyes have met  
But what yours are saying  
Is making me sweat  
The dance floor is empty  
Why don't you meet me in love  
  
Your breath on my body  
The touch of your skin  
Your touch is ungodly  
And way beyond sin  
I've fallen so deeply  
Beggin you meet me in love  
  
Darling please meet me  
And I'll whisper sweetly  
You're the one  
All my life  
That I've dreamed of  
I've fallen so deeply  
I'm yours completely  
So darling please meet me forever in love  
  
Lips warm and tender  
Ask if I'll always care  
Simply surrender  
And follow me there  
Trust me completely  
Darling please meet me in love  
  
Darling please meet me  
Ever so sweetly in love
