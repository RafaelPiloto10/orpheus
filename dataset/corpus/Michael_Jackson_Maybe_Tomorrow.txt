I don't know how many stars there are  
Up in the heavenly sky  
I only know my heaven is here on earth  
Each time you look into my eyes  
The way.. You do baby  
  
Thank you, thank you baby  
  
My beautiful bird you have flown away  
I held you to tight, I can see  
  
You're all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby  
  
Chorus:  
You are the book that I read each day  
You are the song That I sing  
Gonna sing it to you  
You are the four seasons of my life  
But maybe tomorrow, you'll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow, you'll come back to my arms girl  
  
(Maybe she won't)  
  
Maybe  
You're all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby  
  
Chorus)
