I'm incredible, I mix up shit like cake mix  
Keep it blazin hot, rhymes burn to keep you frost bit  
Mc's is assed-out cause they lost it  
Peep my foundation, the way I reinforce it  
I monitor movements, precisely  
Makin niggas hit high notes, like the Eisley's  
Finally, some bitches I can touch up  
Tie em to the grill of my Six, pop the clutch up  
Hush up, I rush up, inside your cut  
Make you puss up, then bust up, cause my shit bumps  
This Don's Trumps, kill straight cats and all chumps  
Cause "Life is like a box of chocolate," Mr. Gump  
Uh, the ultimatum, lets abbreviate em  
Ll platinum again, don't you hate 'I'm?  
A thin line between darkness and sunshine  
Five Percenters that was raised on swine  
Known to be wise, and you wise to understand  
Bringin me drama is a handstand in quicksand  
I've been hot so long, I'm immune  
Your rap career get cut short like Poom-Pooms  
  
Chorus: Keith Murray (Ll Cool J)  
  
Now, from the streets to the suites and all around the world,  
They all recognize we (Incredible)  
We can stand in the water and can't get wet,  
You can bet your last dollar we (Incredible)  
We gets it on in the worst way  
All the homeboys and the girls say we (Incredible)  
From one brother to another  
They agree with each other, lyrically we both (Incredible)  
  
[Keith Murray]  
  
Adios, mios, Montageune  
We're too hot to hold and too bold to be controlled  
Your only skin-deep, my ugly comes from the soul  
I find the leaks, and E plug the holes  
I have more beef than filet mignon  
But got smart, and flushed the bullshit down the? Como?  
Rappers just started rappin last week, get a deal next week  
And go platinum next month  
But pass the blunt, so I can stay hy- like -dro  
Don't act like you don't know, I'm about to fly a flow  
I'm three from three from a three-point land  
With more devastation than a nigga can withstand  
Remember me? Untouched by any emcee  
I add verbal assault to your mental injury  
Cause I'm the vogit, toat it, quote it  
Five-0 said freeze, man I blowed it  
Ryhme strategies, no one's bad as this  
I sew up the populace like a seamstress  
A prisoner, doing time and the bit  
A grown man, and don't play with no kids
