Don't make me blue, don't make me blue  
I can't forget moments of love  
I'm not too old to dream, you're in my heart  
I can't forget, these love and tears  
Your make up was wet, turn back the years  
Oh I can't forget you babe, you know it's true  
Oh I can't forget you girl, we are more than two  
  
Don't make me blue  
When the sky is grey  
And I want to fly  
With you night and day  
Don't leave me here  
Seas in my eyes  
Don't let it end  
My paradise  
  
Oh I don't care, what people say  
I'm walking through these walls, if that's my way  
Like snow in June, love is hard to find  
And I know for sure, this girl is mine  
Oh I can't forget you babe, you know it's true  
Oh I can't forget you girl, we are more than two  
  
Don't make me blue (don't make me blue)  
When the sky is grey (when the sky is grey)  
And I want to fly  
With you night and day  
Don't leave me here (don't leave me here)  
Seas in my eyes (seas in my eyes)  
Don't let it end  
My paradise  
  
Don't make me blue
