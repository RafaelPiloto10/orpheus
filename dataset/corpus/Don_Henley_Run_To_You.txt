She says her love for me can never die  
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I  
Oh, but her love is cold  
It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know  
Cause when it gets too much  
I need to feel your touch  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna run to you  
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night  
I'm gonna run to you  
  
She's got a heart of gold, she'd never let me down  
But your the woman always turns me on, you keep me commin' round  
I know her love is true, but it's so damn easy makin' love to you  
I've got my mind made up  
I need to feel your touch  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night  
I'm gonna run to you  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
Oh, when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night  
I'm gonna run to you  
  
Oh, I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night  
I'm gonna run to you  
  
Oh, I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night  
  
Oh, when the feelin's right, now  
Oh yeah, when the feelin's right, now  
I'm gonna run to you (Oh oh)  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, now....
