Where'd you go, huh?  
They all think I know you,  
Yeah, it's so hard to motivate me to devote  
A single inch of me to something I can't see,  
I don't mean to pry but why  
Would you even make the eyes?  
I don't believe my ears,  
And I'm scared of my own head,  
I will deny you for years and  
I'll make you raise me from the dead,  
And if I said that I would live for you for nothing in return,  
Well, I'm sorry Mr. Gullible,  
But lying's all I've learned,  
So be concerned (x2)  
  
No music,  
And I can talk about anything  
Whether or not it's worthwhile  
Is based on who's listening,  
Most of us listening for something we can relate to,  
All of us related for something we just been through,  
Taken for granted trust is damaged and now we panic,  
Livin empty-handed living lives like we can manage,  
I can feel you but still know where home is feeling like Jonah did,  
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded,  
So be concerned (x2)  
  
I am disappearing  
Inside my birds-eye theories,  
I try to say goodbye, defy and deny,  
What it is I'm fearing  
Clearly I am dying,  
Dearly I am writing,  
Merely testifying that a test to fly requires  
I pass the test with colors flying,  
I don't believe you most the time,  
I'm lying 'cause I say I am fine,  
You are the pearl, I am the swine,  
So break my life and take this rhyme,  
I'm so sorry but I do believe  
That all my bridges I have burned,  
And I've earned a policy of no return,  
So be concerned (x4)
