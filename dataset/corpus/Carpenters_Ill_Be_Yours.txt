When I first saw you my heart said, "yes"  
You'd be the one to cure my loneliness  
And so every night I pray,  
Pray that some day you will say  
Pray that you'll say you love me and then I'll be yours  
  
I see you everyday you say "hello"  
But I can't say a word  
I love you so  
And so every night I pray,  
Pray that some day you will say  
Pray that you'll say you love me and then I'll be yours  
  
I love you so, but you will never know  
You think I'm just a friend, that all I'll ever be, I know  
  
I just a dreamer, it's nothing new  
But still I hope someday they'll all come true  
And so every night I pray,  
Pray that some day you will say  
Pray that you'll say you love me and then I'll be yours  
Say you'll love me and then I'll be yours
