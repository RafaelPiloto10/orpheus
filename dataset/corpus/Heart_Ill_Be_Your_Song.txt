These have been quiet days  
When was the last time I wanted to sing  
Last few dying days hanging on - what will they bring?  
Even you and me  
We keep coming apart  
And it's a wrong thing  
We goota look right at each other and say it  
Turn on the radio and play it  
And fall in love again  
Can you feel the light shine  
You now this song's yours and mine  
Ain't it good to know you've got a place to go  
Where the melody's fine  
Sometimes I'm not so strong  
And even now I could be wrong  
But if you love me like music  
I'll be your song  
  
Lately the day's been grey  
And time's been hard  
Man up in town putting everybody down  
Watch him play his card  
When you get free come on home to me  
I'm gonna lay it down  
We got love - we've got to feel it and show it  
Make each other really know it  
And fall in love again  
We've got to be friends
