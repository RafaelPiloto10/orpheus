Although you've spoken many times before  
A sight of birth he leaves you by a door  
And now you know he doesn't understand  
And all you need is the warmth of his hand  
And if he'd smile your loving blood would dance  
One silent kiss leaves you in a trance  
And now you know you cannot live alone  
But you will find your future is unknown  
One day the questions rise, on wings of chance you fly  
And on that day your laughs and tears will die  
And fall as free as seabirds climb the skies  
And you will love when love comes your way  
And when it comes there's nothing more to say  
And now you know he doesn't understand  
And now you know you don't need his hand  
One day the questions die, on wings of chance you fly
