There's been no sunlight  
Since the day you said goodbye  
Since the moment that my life  
Turned into a masquerade  
  
I can't even pretend to  
Paste a smile across my face  
All my dreams have been erased  
There's nothing left to save me  
  
And you  
You're the only one can stop my sky from falling  
You're the only one who's name I keep on calling  
When everything is closing in  
And you  
You're the only one can stop this heart from aching  
You're the only one who can stop me from shaking  
And put me back together  
Again  
  
What I'd give just to wake up  
And wipe your memory from my eyes  
But I can't wish for bluer skies  
I've never been quite so hopeless  
  
And you  
You're the only one can stop my sky from falling  
You're the only one who's name I keep on calling  
When everything is closing in  
And you  
You're the only one can stop this heart from aching  
You're the only one who can stop me from shaking  
And put me back together  
Again  
  
And if you stay away  
I fear it will all be too much  
And if you stay away  
I'll be a man who's lost his touch  
  
And you  
You're the only one can stop my sky from falling  
You're the only one who's name I keep on calling  
When everything is closing in  
And you  
You're the only one can stop this heart from aching  
You're the only one who can stop me from shaking  
And put me back together  
Again  
  
Again
