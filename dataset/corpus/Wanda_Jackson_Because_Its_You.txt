If this is the life you crave honky tonks night and day  
Well I guess I have to learn to like it too  
I'll try hard to be like you I wanna do the same you do  
I'll meet you on your side of town because it's you  
I could never love another if we go down we'll go together  
I wanna ride where the tight care is you  
Where the wine and liquor flow stay there till it's time to close  
Right or wrong I'll tag along because it's you  
[ steel ]  
I could never love another...  
Right or wrong I'll tag along because it's you
