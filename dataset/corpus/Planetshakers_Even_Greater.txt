Now is the time for God's people to arise  
The day is here Lord your kingdom we will build  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
We are called For greater  
We are called for more  
Let your love and power  
Move through us  
  
[Chorus:]  
All we want is you Lord come and fill us  
Hear the cry of our hearts come and pour it out  
Pour it out on us  
You alone are the one we desire  
You alone are the one that we're living for  
So pour it out on us  
  
[Bridge:]  
We believe for even greater  
We believe for more  
Let your power come upon us  
We believe for more
