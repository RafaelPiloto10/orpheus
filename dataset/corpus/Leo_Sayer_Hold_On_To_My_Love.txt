Hallo western union  
Won't you listen to me man?  
Had no time to say "good bye"  
So take th is telegram  
While I'm gone  
She got to hold on to my love  
While I'm gone  
She got to hold on to my love  
  
Breaks my heart to leave her  
But I'm working with this band  
I've got one chance to make it now  
Please make her understand  
That while I'm gone  
She got to hold on to my love  
While I'm gone  
She got to hold on to my love  
Don't give it away  
  
Oh yeah, uh huh  
So come on operator  
And get my message through  
She don't need to write me ev'ry day  
All she's gotta do is hold on  
Hold on to my love  
While I'm gone  
She got to hold on to my love  
Don't let it slip away  
  
Hold on  
Hold on to my love  
Hold on  
Hold on to my love
