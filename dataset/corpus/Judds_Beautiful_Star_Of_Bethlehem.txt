Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem  
Shinning far through shadows dimmed  
Giving the life for those who long have gone on  
Guiding the wise men on their way  
Unto the place where Jesus lay  
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on  
  
Oh beautiful star the hope of light  
Guiding the pilgrims through the night  
Over the mountains 'till the break of dawn  
Into the land of perfect day  
It will give out a lovely ray  
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on  
  
Oh beautiful star (beautiful, beautiful star) of Bethlehem  
Star of Bethlehem  
Shine upon us until the glory dawn  
Give us a lamp to light the way  
Unto the land of perfect day  
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on  
  
Oh beautiful star the hope, the grace  
For the redeem of good and blessed  
Yonder in glory when the crowd is one  
Jesus is now the star divine  
Brighter and brighter he will shine  
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
