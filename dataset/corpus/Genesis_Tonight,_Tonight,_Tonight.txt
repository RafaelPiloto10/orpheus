I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey, but it's alright  
Like a load on your back that you can't see but it's alright  
Try to shake it loose, cut it free, let it go, get it away from me.  
  
Cause tonight, tonight, tonight I'm gonna make it right  
Tonight, tonight, tonight.  
  
I'm going down, going down, like a monkey, but it's alright  
Try to pick yourself up, carry that weight that you can't see, don't you know  
it's alright  
It's like a helter skelter, going down and down, round and round but just get  
it away from me.  
  
Because tonight, tonight, tonight  
We're gonna make it right  
Tonight, tonight, tonight.  
  
I got some money in my pocket, about ready to burn  
I don't remember where I got it, I gotta get it to you  
So please answer the phone, cause I keep calling, but you're never home  
What am I gonna do  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
I'm gonna make it right  
Tonight, tonight, tonight.  
  
You keep telling me I've got everything, you say I've got everything I want  
You keep telling me you're gonna help me, you're gonna help me, but you don't  
But now I'm in too deep  
It's got me so that I just can't sleep  
Get me out of here, please get me out of here  
Just help me I'll do anything, anything if you'll just help me get out of
here.  
  
I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey, but it's alright

Cause tonight, tonight, tonight  
Maybe we'll make it right
