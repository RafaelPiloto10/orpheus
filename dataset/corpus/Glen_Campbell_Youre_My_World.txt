You're my world you're every breath I take you're my world you're every move I
make  
Other eyes see star up in the skies but for me they shine within your eyes  
As the trees reach for the sun above so my arms reach out to you for love  
With your hand resting in mine I feel a power so divine  
  
You're my world you are my night and day  
You're my world you're every breath I breathe  
If our love ceased to be then it's the end of my world for me  
  
With your hand resting in mine...
