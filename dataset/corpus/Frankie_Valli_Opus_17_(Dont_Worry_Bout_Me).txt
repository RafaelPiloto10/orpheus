Oh I can see there ain't no room for me  
You're only holding out your heart in sympathy  
If there's another man, then girl I understand  
Go on and take his hand and don't you worry bout me  
  
I'll be blue and I'll be crying too  
But girl you know I only want what's best for you  
What good is all my pride if our true love has died  
Go on and be his bride and don't you worry bout me  
  
I'll be strong I'll try to carry on  
Although you know it won't be easy when you're gone  
I'll always think of you, the tender love we knew  
But somehow I'll get through so don't you worry bout me  
  
Oooh, baby  
  
Sweetie pie before you say goodbye  
Remember if he ever leaves you high and dry  
Don't cry alone in pain, don't ever feel ashamed  
If you want me again just don't you worry bout me  
  
I love you no matter what you do  
I'll spend my whole life waiting if you want me to  
And if this is good-bye you know I'd rather die  
Than let you see me cry cause then you'd worry bout me  
  
Repeat 2X  
I'll be strong I'll try to carry on  
Although you know it won't be easy when you're gone  
I'll always think of you, the tender love we knew  
But somehow I'll get through so don't you worry bout me
