I can remember when we first met,  
We really had some times.  
When the success started to kick in,  
Life turned into a mess.  
  
Why can't we still be friends?  
Why judge me for what I am?  
Can't we go back again?  
I'm still the same man.  
  
You figured out really who I am,  
Don't bet your life on that.  
Why can't you see me for what I am?  
We're human, don't forget that... that.  
  
Why can't we still be friends?  
Why judge me for what I am?  
Can't we go back again?  
I'm still the same man.  
  
Still around.  
Don't follow me around.  
Playin' me like a clown.  
Facing life not real... not real.  
  
Life's not real. Not real. [Repeat: x 2]  
Why can't we still be friends?  
Why judge me for what I am?  
Can't we go back again?  
I'm still the same man.  
  
Same man! [Repeat: x 4]
