Final bow  
In a disused music hall  
Of laughter and mime  
The airwave police  
Were the only  
Admirers to admire  
  
Sliding sideways in a rusty old Ford  
The drivers broke down and  
A young girl screams  
Walking through rock dreams  
Tall stories  
Mobile T.V. radio  
Nobody came  
  
The station is abandoned  
Deserted for peace day  
Some old man said 'Just do your best'  
And I think passed away  
  
My shadow is never far behind  
And I must find another role to play  
Visit maskmaker  
Please bend my mind  
Someone, no one  
I really don't mind  
Nobody cares
