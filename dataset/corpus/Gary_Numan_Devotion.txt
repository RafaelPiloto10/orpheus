Charm up, strange down  
Old face, new sound.  
Same kick, same pain  
Same reason, same game so.  
Dance, let's move.  
I can't dance, I can't sing  
I'm too old, I'm too thin so?  
Motion, I'm in love  
One night's enough so.  
Dance, let's move.  
You can play  
You can lose  
You can't win  
('I'm still looking for rhythm')  
You can choose  
Move up, I don't like this motion  
Move out, I don't like this feeling  
Move up, I don't need devotion  
Move out, I don't need a reason.  
'And I'm still looking for the rhythm.'
