Too much near the truth they say  
Keep it 'til another day  
Let them have their little game  
Delusion helps to keep them sane  
  
Let them have their little toys  
Matchbox cars and more kids joys  
Exciting in their plastic ways  
Frozen food in a concrete place  
  
Your gonna go insane  
I'm tryin' to save your brain  
  
Alright!  
  
I don't know what's happening  
My head's all torn inside  
People say I'm heavy  
They don't know what I hide  
  
Take a life it's going cheap  
Kill someone no one will weep  
Freedom's yours just pay your dues  
We just want your soul to use  
  
Your gonna go insane  
I'm tryin' to save your brain
