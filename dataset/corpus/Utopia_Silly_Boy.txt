In the days when I was young I never had to cry  
If I wanted a lover I did not have to try  
But I must have set my expectations far too high  
Guess I'm just a silly boy  
  
I guess I'm just a silly boy  
There are some things about love that I don't understand  
When you promise your heart you do the best you can  
But no matter how I try behaving like a man  
  
Seems I'm just a silly boy  
I guess I'm just a silly boy  
This is the last time I'll wait to stand in line  
If you don't come see me I'm dropping the boom on you  
  
'Cause when you lose me  
Then everyone will see what a silly girl can do  
Don't you tell me that it's over  
Don't you make a sound  
  
'Til I get to the river or someplace I can drown  
'Cause I put my faith upon you and you let me down  
Guess I'm just a silly boy  
I guess I'm just a silly boy
