Well It's a quarter a two  
and looking at you  
and going down, going down slow  
Well It's a quarter a two  
and looking at you  
and going down, going down slow  
  
TV went off about one, we have only begun  
I know that the Wednesday may come  
but I have no intention of going home  
  
Well It's a quarter a three  
digging on me  
and going down, going down slow  
  
Could stay here all night,  
they claim your outta sight  
please get up and turn out the light  
There ain't nothing better than the middle of the night  
  
And It's a quarter a four  
begging for more  
and going down, going down slow  
going down, going down slow  
going down, going down slow  
going down, going down slow
