I can tell your heart's been broken in two  
You are looking for a shoulder  
I've found out that other people's tears  
Just seem to make me older  
I'd like to help with your broken heart  
Really I think it's a crime  
But I ain't got the time, ain't got the time  
All that I can give you is a well wish  
I hate to be that way I know that it's selfish  
But baby I've got a destiny to meet  
And I know it's on down the line  
Ain't got the time ain't got the time  
  
I can tell that you've been hurt pretty bad  
You need someone to cry to  
You're like a bird with the broken wing  
And you need some place to fly to  
But I've found out from life  
That I can't live nobody's but mine  
Ain't got the time, ain't got the time  
All that I can give you is a well wish...
