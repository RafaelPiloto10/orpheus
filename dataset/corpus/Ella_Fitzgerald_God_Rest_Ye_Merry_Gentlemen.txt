God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
The blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How bad in Bethlehem was born  
The son of God by name  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Now to the Lord sing praises  
All you with in this place  
And with true love and brotherhood  
Each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas  
All ever that you can face  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
