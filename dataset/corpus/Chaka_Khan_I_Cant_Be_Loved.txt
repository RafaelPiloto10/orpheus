I've been thinking 'bout yu, oh baby  
And I wonder where you are tonight  
Tryin' to live without you, it's crazy'  
Cause no one else can light my fire  
  
More than a few  
Have been willing to do just what I wanted  
But as hard as they try  
It just ain't right, oh baby  
  
I can't be loved  
By anyone but you, oh baby, baby  
It's not enough  
There ain't no substitute for you  
I can't be loved by anyone but you  
I just can't live without your love  
  
My emotions, baby, are showing  
No one seems to understand  
This commotion, darlin', keeps growing  
I'm afraid it's getting out of hand  
  
Putting aside all the pain and the pride  
And I still want you, and I need you tonight  
  
Can't be loved  
There ain't no chance for new romance  
Can't be loved  
It just ain't love with someone else
