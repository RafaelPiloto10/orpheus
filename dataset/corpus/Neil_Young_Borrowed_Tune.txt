I'm climbin' this ladder,  
My head in the clouds  
I hope that it matters,  
I'm havin' my doubts.  
  
I'm watchin' the skaters  
Fly by on the lake.  
Ice frozen six feet deep,  
How long does it take?  
  
I look out on peaceful lands  
With no war nearby,  
An ocean of shakin' hands  
That grab at the sky.  
  
I'm singin' this borrowed tune  
I took from the Rolling Stones,  
Alone in this empty room  
Too wasted to write my own.  
  
I'm climbin' this ladder,  
My heads in the clouds  
I hope that it matters.
