You're the one that makes my day a dream come true  
Yet and still you wander if I think of you  
You ought to see how the other girls behave when you're not round  
And only then you would know that it's on your finger I'm wound  
  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
That I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me no  
'Cause it's by your side girl that I long to be  
Yes there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say  
What you don't know is with you I can never act that way  
  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
That I care  
  
I care for you baby  
I swear that I care  
I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me  
Have faith in me  
I care for you baby
