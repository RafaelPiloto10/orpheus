Try to remember the kind of September  
When life was slow and oh so mellow  
Try to remember the kind of September  
When grass was green and grain so yellow  
Try to remember the kind of September  
When you were a young and a callow fellow  
  
Try to remember and if you remember  
Then follow-follow, oh-oh  
  
Try to remember when life was so tender  
That no one wept except the willow  
Try to remember when life was so tender  
That dreams were kept beside your pillow  
Try to remember when life was so tender  
That love was an ember about to billow  
  
Try to remember and if you remember  
Then follow-follow, oh-oh  
  
Deep in December it's nice to remember  
Although you know the snow will follow  
Deep in December it's nice to remember  
Without a hurt, the heart is hollow  
Deep in December it's nice to remember  
The fire of September that made you mellow  
  
Deep in December our hearts should remember  
Then follow-follow, oh-oh Follow, oh-oh
