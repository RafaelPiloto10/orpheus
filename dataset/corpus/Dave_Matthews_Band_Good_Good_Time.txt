Don't it sometimes feel  
As if the world is turned upside down.  
We're all standing on our heads.  
Tryin' to make the most of this,  
Kinda makes it feel like your heavy.  
  
Don't it sometimes feel like you got too much to bear.  
Well let it at the door my friend,  
Come inside and let's have a good good  
Good good time tonight  
Try forget it all  
'Cause it will still be there tomorrow,  
You can be sure, it will still be there for us all.  
  
Let's have a good good time tonight  
That's what I preach, yeah.  
You can leave the problems out  
We come back to teach about  
The fun I like good good time  
Nobody be there by my side  
Close your eyes, shake it up, shake it up.  
Baby ya look good tonight  
It's a good good time tonight, yeah  
  
Stumble self down, fall down,  
Scrape your knee, rub it good.  
You wake up with your head feels like,  
Someone's beatin' on you.  
End of story  
But overboard, overboard  
Just for this evening  
Leave it behind, leave it behind,  
Let's dance the night away.  
  
Let's have a good good time tonight  
Hope ya can if ya will.  
Try to leave your tears after all  
Bring 'em in to show everyone  
We can get to the bottom of this bottle  
We could end of this burning toll  
Roll up now, roll it up another one,  
And another fall through before.  
Let's have a good good time tonight  
  
It's a good good time tonight  
It's a good good time tonight  
It's a good good time tonight  
It's a good good time tonight
