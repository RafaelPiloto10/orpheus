I see a turning wheel  
On a dusty track  
Caught in the void and empty space  
In between there and back  
And the paradise of going somewhere  
That's still so far away  
Happy, boy you bet I am  
Holding on to this smile for just as long as I can  
  
Heaven  
  
It's all bright in front  
And it's all dark behind  
Livin' for the now that's in between the bridges and the signs  
And getting there is still a long long way to go  
While the others dream and wish  
This is everything I officially need to know  
Happy, boy you bet I am  
Holding on to this smile for just as long as I can  
  
Heaven
