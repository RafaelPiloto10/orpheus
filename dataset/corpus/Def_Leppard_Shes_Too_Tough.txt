Black stockings and a high heeled dress  
Good looking but her face is a mess  
She's no angel, oh no  
Love loaded, she's got plenty to spare  
She'll pull your trigger if only you dare  
She's no angel, oh no  
  
She's too tough  
Can't help it, she just can't help it  
She's too tough  
Can't help it, she just can't help it  
  
Hands off, well it's catch 22  
You can't touch and she can't refuse  
She's no angel, oh no  
Whiplash'll give you six of the best  
Lay back, let her mind do the rest  
She's no angel, oh no  
  
She's too tough  
Can't help it, she just can't help it  
She's too tough  
Can't help it, she just can't help it  
She's too tough  
Can't help it, she just can't help it  
She's too tough  
Can't help it, she just can't help it  
  
She's too tough  
Can't help it, she just can't help it  
She's too tough  
Can't help it, she just can't help it  
She's too tough  
Can't help it, she just can't help it  
She's too tough ...
