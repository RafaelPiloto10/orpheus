One too many days  
I've felt forgotten  
And one too many nights  
I've slept alone.  
  
And every time I watch  
The fruit turn rotten  
I tell myself I'll  
Try a little harder  
Next time.  
  
Sacred are the ties  
That love entrusts us  
Even if they fray  
Before they bind  
And I'm afraid I never  
Did you justice  
So I'm going to feel my  
Love a little stronger  
Make it last a little longer  
Next time.  
  
Next time  
I ain't gonna fall on my knees  
And come out of love empty handed.  
But next time I'll be  
Even harder to please  
When will the next time be?  
  
One too many days  
I've felt forgotten  
And one too many nights  
I've slept alone.  
And every time I watch  
The fruit turn rotten  
I tell myself I'll  
Try a little harder  
Play my cards a little smarter  
Next time.  
Whoa oh  
Next time
