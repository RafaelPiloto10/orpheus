I'm gonna wipe these teardrops from my eyes  
There ain't no use for me to cry  
And there's some things I think I need to say  
I'll think about you every day every day while you're away  
I'll be true to you honey while you're gone if you're not gone too long  
But if you're gone for a year or two it may be too long for me to be true  
I might find somebody else cause I get lonesome by myself  
I'll be the truest love you've known and for a while I'll stay at home  
I'll be true to you honey while you're gone if you're not gone too long  
[ guitar - steel ]  
Tomorrow you'll be gone I know so love me now before you go  
We don't know what's farther down the road  
There may be a detour sign to upset plans of yours and mine  
I'll be true to you honey while you're gone if you're not gone too long  
But if you're gone for a year or two...  
Oh yeah if you're not gone too long
