  
  
'Round and 'round the cobbler's bench  
The monkey chased the weasel,  
The monkey thought 'twas all in fun  
Pop! Goes the weasel.  
  
A penny for a spool of thread  
A penny for a needle,  
That's the way the money goes,  
Pop! Goes the weasel.  
  
A half a pound of tupenny rice,  
A half a pound of treacle.  
Mix it up and make it nice,  
Pop! Goes the weasel.  
  
Hello, it's me  
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet  
To go over everything  
They say that time's supposed to heal ya  
But I ain't done much healing  
  
Hello, can you hear me  
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be  
When we were younger and free  
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  
  
There's such a difference between us  
And a million miles  
  
Hello from the other side  
I must have called a thousand times  
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried  
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry  
I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened  
  
It's no secret that the both of us  
Are running out of time  
  
So hello from the other side  
I must have called a thousand times  
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried  
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Anymore  
  
Hello from the other side  
I must have called a thousand times  
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried  
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
Up and down the London road,  
In and out of the Eagle,  
That's the way the money goes,  
Pop! Goes the weasel.  
  
I've no time to plead and pine,  
I've no time to wheedle,  
Kiss me quick and then I'm gone  
Pop! Goes the weasel.
