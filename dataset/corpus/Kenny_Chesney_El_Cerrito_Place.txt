I been hangin' round this place, I been lookin' through your space  
I been waitin' for you, I've been waitin' for you  
All the places that you go, all the people that you know  
I've been lookin' for you, I've been lookin' for you  
  
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place  
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face  
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard  
Singin' hallelujah while they dance over the stars  
They all say they're goin' far  
  
Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
All night long, all night long, all night long  
  
Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land  
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand  
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along  
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song,  
Were you even here at all?  
  
Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
All night long, all night long, all night long  
  
Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight  
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked  
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say  
And if you ever were here baby they ain't givin' you away  
  
Now it's been two days  
I'm still lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
All night long, all night long, all night long  
  
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place  
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face  
  
Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land  
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand  
  
Think I'll go back to the city, back to El Cerrito Place  
That's the last time I saw that pretty smile upon your face  
I've been lookin' for you baby
