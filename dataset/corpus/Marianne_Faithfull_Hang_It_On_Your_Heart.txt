Am I 12, am I 104,  
I am the hanging man and that's for sure.  
I know for sure  
Follow your heart,  
Don't mess around,  
Follow your heart.  
  
Doesn't matter where you catch a start  
You take the future and you pin it, pin it hang it on your heart  
Wishing on a star  
No use your wishing on a star  
If you wanna know where to start, yeah,  
If you wanna know where to start,  
Hang it on your heart,  
Hang it on your heart.  
  
Double vison is the state of the art,  
Indecision tearing me apart.  
Don't fall apart,  
Follow your heart.  
Don't muck around,  
Follow your heart.  
Wishing on a star,  
Don't do your wishing on a star,  
If you wanna know where to start, yeah,  
If you wanna know where to start,  
Hang it on your heart,  
Hang it on your heart.  
  
Clocks tick around in your town  
Sleep clocks around in a sleepy town.  
Can't keep a good thing down,  
You can't keep a good thing down.  
  
If you wanna know where to start, yeah,  
If you wanna know where to start,  
Hang it on your heart,  
Hang it on your heart.  
  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart  
Hang it on your heart
