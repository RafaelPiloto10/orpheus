Eight miles high  
And when you touch down  
You find you're  
Stranger than known  
Signs in the street  
That say where you're going  
Are somewhere  
  
Just being their own  
Nowhere is there  
Warmth to be found  
Just those afraid  
Of losing their ground  
Rain gray town  
Known for its sound  
In places  
  
Small faces abound  
Round the squares  
Huddled in storms  
Some laughing  
Some just shapeless forms  
Sidewalk scenes  
And black limousines  
Some living  
Some standing  
Alone
