Oh, my baby goes rockin', ooh, rockin' all night  
No shoes no stockin's, but that's all right  
Well she don't need stockin's and shoes to rock all night  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Well you don't need stockin's and shoes to dance the blues  
Well I love a-my baby, indeed I do  
Well I love a-my baby, she loves me too  
You oughta see us rock without stockin's and shoes  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Well you don't need stockin's and shoes to dance the blues  
Well the bare feet slappin' on the hardwood floor  
These crazy things a-happen, along about four  
And the very next night my baby's a-back for more  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Well you don't need stockin's and shoes to dance the blues  
Well I bought my baby some crazy socks  
I love my baby, but she don't wear socks  
Yeah she kicks her shoes right off and man she rocks  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Well you don't need stockin's and shoes to dance the blues  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Stockin's and shoes
