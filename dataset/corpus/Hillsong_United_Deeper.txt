Light to men  
Love of God  
Healing for the wounded heart  
Like a child quiet my soul  
Hear Your voice surround me Lord  
  
Jesus, hold me into Your heart  
Into Your heart  
Lord my soul delights  
And I know You hear my prayer  
Take me deeper Lord  
  
Glorious Son to You I shall bow  
Bow my knee, bow my will  
Cherished by the strong and the weak  
Humble hearts shall hear You speak  
And by Your love Lord You opened my heart  
Now Your light will shine always  
By Your Word Lord Your promise secure  
And my soul will live always  
Take me deeper Lord
