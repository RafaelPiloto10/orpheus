Yo yo, this Wyclef, alongside DJ Skribble (for the ladies)  
Yo Skribble I have one question  
Could you please answer this for me?  
I gotta know this yo  
  
What makes a DJ  
What makes an MC  
What makes the ReFugees  
Why are kids getting jealous?  
  
'Cause we F, are, E, S, H  
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh!  
F, are, E, S, H  
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh!  
  
Hey you, player, with the dibble and the dabble  
You want to battle who? Wyclef or DJ Skribble  
Hold the stickup it's a freestyle session  
Skribble where you from man  
Well I'm from Haiti, then Brooklyn, then Jersey  
With a universal tag, plus I got  
You slept on this musician, plus the hip-hop art  
Bring your best MC's  
'Cause every man got disciples if you ever want a rival  
Show up, with a mic, and a rifle  
Wyclef stuck the bank at mid-day  
And took all of Sony money, in a black van he got away  
I just got a call from Tommy Mottola  
He said forget about it "oh my word"  
So I held John Agrassia, at gunpoint  
He's shook, callin' Donny Aiena, while smokin' a joint  
I said, 'Who's the informer?' They say, 'Michael Malden'  
I had to take him out "Three the hard way!"  
The moral of this story don't blame the record company  
If your record ain't selling you lack creativity  
  
But what you want me to say? What what you want me to say huh?  
Yo I've been trying to get a deal for, years and it ain't  
What you want me to say?  
  
"And I'll kill anyone, who dares to go against me!"
