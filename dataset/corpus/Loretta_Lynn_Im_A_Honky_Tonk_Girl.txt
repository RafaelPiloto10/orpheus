Ever since you left me I've done nothing but wrong.  
Many nights I've laid awake and cried.  
We was so happy.  
My heart was in a whirl,  
But now I'm a honky tonk girl.  
So turn that jukebox way up high,  
And fill my glass up while I cry.  
I've lost everything in this world,  
And now I'm a honky tonk girl.  
(Instrumental)  
I just can't make a right with all of my wrongs,  
Every evening of my life seems so long,  
I'm sorry and ashamed for all these things you see,  
But losing him has made a fool of me.  
So fill my glass up to the rim,  
To lose my memory of him,  
I've lost everything in this world,  
And now I'm a Honky Tonk Girl
