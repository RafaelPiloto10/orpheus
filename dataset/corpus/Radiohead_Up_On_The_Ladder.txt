I'm stuck in the T.A.R.D.I.S.  
Trapped in hyperspace  
One minute snake charming  
The next in a motorcade  
All the right moves in  
In the right places  
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet  
You can almost see the strings  
Give me an answer  
Give me a line  
I've been climbing up this ladder  
I've been wasting my time  
Up on the ladder  
We're all tied to a stake  
Up on the ladder  
We wait for your mistake  
Up on the ladder  
Try to call out your name  
Up on the ladder  
You're all the fucking same
