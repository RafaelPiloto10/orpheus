So I'm back to the Velvet Underground  
Back to the floor that I love  
To a room with some lace and paper flowers  
Back to the gypsy that I was to the gypsy that I was  
  
And it all comes down to you  
Well you know that it does, well  
Lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice  
Oh and it lights up the night  
And you see you're a gypsy  
You see you're a gypsy  
  
To the gypsy  
That remains  
She faces freedom  
With a little fear  
Well I have no fear  
I have only love  
And if I was a child  
And the child was enough  
Enough for me to love  
Enough to love  
  
She is dancing away from you now  
She was just a wish  
She was just a wish  
And her memory is all that is left for you now  
You see you're a gypsy  
You see you're a gypsy  
  
Lightning strikes  
Maybe once maybe twice  
And it all comes down to you  
Oh oh well it all comes down to you  
Lightning strikes  
Maybe once maybe twice  
Oh  
I still see your bright eyes bright eyes  
And I've always loved you  
And it all comes down to you  
It all comes down to you
