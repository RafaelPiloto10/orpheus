(Verse 1)I am the One, One, One oh oh! I can bring the roofs down One by One.
But I can't be won. I can't stop myself from being the first One, first One.
Being the One is fun. But my job here is not done.  
  
[Chorus:] We're in the club being who we are. After that we'll go to the bar.
The One thing I know about you is that you are the One to two.  
  
[Verse 2:] Ooo I'm thinking about the wonderful times we've had but my friends
are bad. I've kept too many secrets from everyone but you and I will always
have fun. I'm just One of a kind. You know the One!  
  
[Chorus:]  
[Bridge:] The thing that everyone says about that shit today I am not the One
who is gay. Judas is our demon that's not a sin, but don't try to make your
heart made out of tin.  
  
[Chorus:] You shit-talk but I'm gonna take a walk you are mean enough to pay
the One, the One  
(One, One, One, One)
