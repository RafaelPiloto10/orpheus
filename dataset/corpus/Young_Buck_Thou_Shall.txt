G-Unit!!!  
Yeah...  
You better kill me  
50, lemme get these niggas  
(get 'em Buck!!!)  
  
I brush my teeth, load my clip, and go bust my heat  
I'm in too deep, I can't say fuck the streets  
I need some sleep, the fiends still comin'  
Bush 'bout to blow this bitch up  
Better get money, dead bodys get picked up  
I'm David in teen's now  
Niggas we're digital, but they work triple beams now  
I'm livin' for me now, 'cause I done went to war with the other side  
Lucky me, 'cause the enemies mother and brother died  
Hot shot gun shell's and teflon chest plate's  
It's tatt'ed on my arm nigga, thugin' till my death day  
Ya'll niggas just wait, right after my court date  
It's gonna get grimey, like new york say  
Bitch niggas horse play, real niggas gon' spray  
Bang the fo', change clothes, and come back the same day  
Better holla mayday, 'cause we comin'  
And we gunnin at any muthafucka want sumthin  
  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will  
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel  
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will  
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel  
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real  
  
I'm already dead, can't kill me nigga  
And even if I do die, I'm still gon' kill ya  
I'm unfamiliar with a lot of these soldiers  
I go out in the road, and niggas think that it's over  
Runnin, the fiends all puttin too much soda on the d'  
You would think niggas know, 'cause they older than me  
Been here longer than me, and still peace'n a ounce out  
How can ya' be a birdman, if you don't know how to count  
It's back to the black gloves, and home invasions  
Puttin holes in a nigga, the size of a gold dayton  
No I'm not waitin on nothin, no more  
Eather you pay me what you owe me, or I'm cuttin ya throat  
Nigga ya baby momma know me, go and ask the hoe  
How I done tied her ass up over a bag of dope  
I'll be glad to go to the pen over revenge  
I'm comin' out the same way, a nigga went in  
  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will  
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel  
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will  
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel  
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real  
  
Boom!, g-unit!!!, we on some military shit nigga  
You better kill us all, 'cause we commin'  
Muthafucka's!
