Come with me, and let's go wander  
Far beyond the wild blue yonder,  
Out where stars roam free.  
Though the journey's far from breezy,  
Stick with me, I'll make it easy-  
You can depend on me.  
  
Yeah, there's a long road before us,  
And it's a hard road, indeed.  
Bur darlin', I swear,  
I'll get us there,  
Wherever the trail may lead.  
  
Once we cross that far horizon,  
Life is bound to be surprisin'  
But we'll take it day by day.  
Never mind the wind and weather,  
If we walk that trail together,  
Somehow we'll find our way.  
  
Yeah, there's a long road before us,  
And it's a hard road, indeed.  
Bur darlin', I vow,  
We'll get through somehow,  
Wherever the trail may lead.  
  
Can't tell you when we'll be there-  
It may take all our lives.  
We're headin' for that great unknown.  
We'll soon be walkin' free there,  
But 'til that day arrives,  
At least we won't be travellin' alone...  
  
And there's a long road before us,  
And it's a hard road, indeed.  
Bur darlin', don't fear,  
'Cause I'll be right here,  
To give you the strength you need...  
And through the whole ride,  
I'll be by your side,  
Wherever the trail may lead.
