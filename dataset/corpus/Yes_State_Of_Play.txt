You can hear the siren screaming  
Take me to the promised land  
See the intervention  
Take you higher and higher  
  
See we are the giving world  
We are responsible  
We're not about to break  
  
[Chorus]  
It's just a state of play  
It's just a state of play  
  
This is the revolution coming  
With the giving world  
No need to wait for your  
Appointment is made  
  
No need to ask for help, it's in  
The love we breathe  
Dancing in the new design  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Secret needing from this love I'm feeding  
High time flying monumental  
Reaching to God love  
Secret needing all i really  
  
Want to know right now  
The state of play  
Are you looking at it  
Is it looking at you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No point in kidding let the  
Children split the atom  
A firm believer this appointment with love  
  
All those who look for glory  
They see the flags are flying  
They hear the siren screaming  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Secret needing from this love I'm feeding  
High time flying  
All I really want to know  
Right now, right now  
  
(I want to be inside your heart)  
I want to know right now is  
This the state of play  
Are you looking at it
