Which will you go for  
Which will you love  
Which will you choose from  
From the stars above  
Which will you answer  
Which will you call  
Which will you take for  
For your one and all  
And tell me now  
Which will you love the best.  
  
Which do you dance for  
Which makes you shine  
Which will you choose now  
If you won't choose mine  
Which will you hope for  
Which can it be  
Which will you take now  
If you won't take me  
And tell now  
Which will you love the best.
