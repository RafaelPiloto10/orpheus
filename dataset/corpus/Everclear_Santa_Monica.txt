I am still living with your ghost  
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast  
I don't want to be your downtime  
I don't want to be your stupid game  
  
With my big black boots and an old suitcase  
I do believe I'll find myself a new place  
I don't want to be the bad guy  
I don't want do your sleepwalk dance anymore  
I just want to see some palm trees  
I will try and shake away this disease  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
We can live beside the ocean  
Leave the fire behind  
Swim out past the breakers  
Watch the world die  
  
I am still dreaming of you face  
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away  
I don't want to be your good time  
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore  
  
I'll walk right out into a brand new day  
Insane and rising in my own weird way  
I don't want to be the bad guy  
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore  
  
I just want to feel some sunshine  
I just want to find some place to be alone  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Yeah watch the world die  
Yeah watch the world die  
Yeah watch the world die  
Yeah watch the world die
