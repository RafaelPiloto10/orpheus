Mama coco hey you're lookin heavy  
Mama coco ho you're lookin' good  
Mama coco yes I've been getting hungry  
  
Mama coco feed me woman food  
I don't have fancy shacks or multi-colored cadillacs  
But I have three months of loneliness  
So mama have a drink relax  
Mama mama so glad to have you here  
  
I love you mama coco  
Mama coco such anticipation  
Mama coco mam you're blowin' my mind  
Mama coco I'm just a male caucasian  
Mama coco I'm virgin to your kind  
  
Now don't get paranoid  
I ain't a horny little mongoloid  
All I wanna have is a little bit of love and joy  
  
Mama mama so glad to have you here  
I love you mama coco  
Mama mama so glad to have you here  
I love you mama coco
