Baby I wanna tell you all my hopes and dreams and fears  
But I'm watching television, could you get me another beer  
There's wrestling and pro football on, I hope you understand  
I must watch it all for I am a man  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he perspires  
'Til the stains show on his shirt  
I missed our anniverary and the birth of our son  
It was beyond my control, my team was on a playoff run  
Oh baby, baby, baby, you mean everything to me  
But could you move your butt, you're blocking the TV?  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he does tire  
Gets sleepy and naps on the couch  
Oh baby, oh honey, oh darling, oh pudding, what are you doing with that
suitcase? Leaving me? What do you mean we don't communicate? We're talking all
the time. We're talk about-- Ooh! Monster trucks! That little Volkswagon ain't
got no chance against The Cowcrusher! c'mon Cowcrusher, crush that little
Volks-- you're gone. I hope she left me one of them pudding pops. They're
tasty.  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And he shops at Canadian Tire  
And he always keeps his coupons  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he expires  
And he cried when Wayne Gretzky retired
