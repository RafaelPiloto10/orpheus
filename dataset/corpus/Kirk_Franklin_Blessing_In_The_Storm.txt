Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah  
oh ah, oh ah, oh ah  
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah  
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah  
  
[Verse 1:]  
When I cannot hear the sparrow sing  
And I cannot feel the melody  
There's a secret place that's full of grace  
There's a blessing in the storm,  
Help me sing it  
There's a blessing in the storm.  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When the sickness won't leave my body  
And the pain just won't leave my soul  
I get on my knees and say "Jesus please"  
There's a blessing in the storm,  
Help me sing it  
There's a blessing in the storm.  
  
[Verse 3:]  
When I cannot seem to love again  
And the raindrops won't ever end  
If you just hold on  
Those clouds will soon be gone  
There's a blessing in the storm  
Help me sing it  
There's a blessing in the storm.  
Sweet sweet, the storm, sweet  
(repeat verse 3)
