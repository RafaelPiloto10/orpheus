This one time I flip, call the radio  
Man play the record that I been loving so

Dance to the flow

At one time there was a rhythm on my stereo  
Pick up the phone line  
Send my jam down the radio

Catch a wave on the air today

A rhythm I could groove to

Crank the volume now the song is all mine  
Come sound system make the rhythm climb
