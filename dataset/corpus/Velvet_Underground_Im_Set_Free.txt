I've been set free and I've been bound  
To the memories of yesterday's clouds  
I've been set free and I've been bound  
  
And now I'm set free  
I'm set free  
I'm set free to find a new illusion  
  
I've been blinded but  
You I can see  
What in the world has happened to me  
The prince of stories who walk right by me  
  
And now I'm set free  
I'm set free  
I'm set free to find a new illusion  
  
I've been set free and I've been bound  
Let me tell you people  
What I found  
I saw my head laughing  
Rolling on the ground  
  
And now I'm set free  
I'm set free  
I'm set free to find a new illusion
