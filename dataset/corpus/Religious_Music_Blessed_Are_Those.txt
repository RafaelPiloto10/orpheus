How blessed are those  
Blessed are those who walk with You  
How blessed are those  
Those whose hearts are always true.  
  
Those who live in Your law  
Whose hearts seek after Thee  
How free their lives of sin  
How blessed their purity!  
  
O, how blessed are those  
Blessed are those who walk with You  
How blessed are those  
Those whose hearts are always true.  
  
Oh, that I had more strength  
In obeying Your decrees  
But I am trying, Lord  
O God, do not forsake me!  
  
But bless me, Lord  
Bless me as my heart seeks You  
And bless me, Lord  
As I turn my life to You.  
  
Turn to You...
