I don't want to be your lover  
  
Last night I heard you creeping  
I was almost sleeping  
When I heard you come home  
You knew I loved you madly  
And I would gladly  
Do anything for you  
  
You climbed the stairs to heaven  
But you may never climb those steps again  
You thought you'd be forgiven  
But I was driven to make you understand  
  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your head  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your bed  
  
Tell me how you could do it  
Why put me through it  
When you said you'd be true  
You said that it was nothing  
But it was something  
And sometimes that's enough  
  
So climb the stairs to heaven  
But you may never climb those steps again  
You thought you'd be forgiven  
But I was driven to make you understand  
  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your head  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your bed  
  
You climbed the stairs to heaven  
But you may never climb those steps again  
You thought you'd be forgiven  
But I was driven to make you understand  
  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your head  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your bed
