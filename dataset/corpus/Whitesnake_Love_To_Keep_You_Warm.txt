If you want love,  
You gotta be cool  
And if you deny it,  
Then baby you're a fool.  
I'm telling you now,  
Don't you hide it away.  
Because you need to keep you warm both night and day.  
  
I could come home  
Late at night  
And after some loving,  
Baby, it would be alright.  
I've given up trying  
Lying my way.  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day,  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day.  
  
I said baby, if you need my love  
You better come home with me.  
Maybe if you want my love,  
You know you got it easily.  
But, when the sun goes down  
And the night is cold,  
You know I won't be far away.  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day,  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day.  
  
You gotta have love  
  
If you want schooling baby  
I'll be around,  
I'm ready for fooling  
But, don't hang around.  
And every morning I know I will say.  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day,  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day.  
  
I said baby, if you need my love  
You better come home with me.  
Maybe if you want my love,  
You know you got it easily.  
But, when the sun goes down  
And the night is cold,  
You know I won't be far away.  
Because you need love to keep you warm both night and day,  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day,  
You gotta have love to keep you warm both night and day,  
I said you need love to keep you warm both night and day.
