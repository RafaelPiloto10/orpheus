You are too beautiful, my dear,  
To be true  
And I am a fool for beauty  
Fooled by the feeling that  
Because I had found you,  
I could have bound you too  
  
You are too beautiful  
For one man alone,  
For one lucky fool to be with,  
When there are other men  
With eyes of their own  
To see with  
  
Love does not stand sharing  
Not if you care.  
Have you been comparing  
My every kiss with theirs?  
  
If on the other hand I'm faithful  
To you  
Its not through a sense of duty  
You are too beautiful,  
And I am a fool for beauty
