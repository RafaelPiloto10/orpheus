I woke up to yet another day  
Grown to expect, expect more of the same  
Except for, for a subtle change  
And that is, I'm slowly fading away  
Harvest moon, soon will pass  
Crop is gone, left only chaff  
A bitter pill, and an overcast  
A flag unfurled, at half mast  
Ahhhhh...  
  
A year to the day  
Since you went away  
A moment in time  
When you were last mine  
I'm here standing still  
Yeah! With more time to kill  
Hey! I barely survived  
Yeah, I barely survived  
  
Like pouring salt on an open wound  
Memory filling, filling this empty room  
I'm as bare, I'm as bare, as a barren womb  
Still like the air, in a whitewash tomb  
Ahhhhh...  
  
A year to the day  
Since you went away  
A moment in time  
When you were last mine  
I'm here standing still  
Hey! With more time to kill  
I barely survived  
Yes, I barely survived  
  
Ahhhhh...  
  
A year to the day  
Since you went away  
A moment in time  
When you were last mine  
I'm here standing still  
Been standin' still. With more time to kill  
Hey! I barely survived  
I barely survived  
  
A year to the day!  
Year to the day!  
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  
A year to the day!  
Three sixty-five!  
Three sixty-five, five, fiiive!  
  
Ahhhhh...
