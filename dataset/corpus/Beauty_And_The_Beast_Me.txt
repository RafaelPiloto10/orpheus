Gaston  
  
You've been dreaming, just one dream  
Nearly all your life  
Hoping, scheming, just one theme:  
Will you be a wife?  
Will you be some he-man's property?  
Good news!  
That he-man's me!  
This equation, girl plus man  
Doesn't help just you  
On occasion, women can  
Have their uses too  
Mainly to extend the fam'ly tree  
Pumpkin, extend with me!  
  
Gaston  
  
We'll be raising sons galore  
  
Belle  
  
Inconceivable!  
  
Gaston  
  
Each built six foot four!  
  
Belle  
  
Unbelievable!  
  
Gaston  
  
Each one stuffed with ev'ry Gaston gene!  
  
Belle  
  
I'm not hearing this!  
  
Gaston  
  
You'll be keeping house with pride!  
  
Belle  
  
Just incredible!  
  
Gaston  
  
Oh so gratified  
  
Belle  
  
So unweddable!  
  
Gaston  
  
That you are a part of this idyllic scene.  
  
(Spoken)  
Picture this: A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting over the fire,
my little wife massaging my feet, while the little  
Ones play on the floor with the dogs. We'll have six or seven!  
  
Belle  
  
Dogs?  
  
Gaston  
  
No, Belle!  
  
Strapping boys... Like me!  
  
Belle  
  
Imagine that!  
  
Gaston  
  
I can see that we will share  
All that love implies  
We shall be a perfect pair  
Rather like my thighs  
You are face to face with destiny!  
All roads lead to...  
The best things in life are...  
All's well that ends with me!  
Escape me?  
There's no way  
Certain as "Do, Re,"  
Belle, when you marry...  
  
(Spoken)  
So Belle, what would it be?  
Is it "yes", or is it "oh, yes"?  
  
Belle  
  
I... I just don't deserve you!  
  
Gaston  
  
Who does? Me!
