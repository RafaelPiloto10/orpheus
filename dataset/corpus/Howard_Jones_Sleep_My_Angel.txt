Sleep my angel  
It is time for bed  
I will be there  
To watch over you  
I'll protect you from the world  
And the voices in your head  
I'll be with you  
With my life I will defend  
I'll be with you  
I will be there in the end  
And I'll cry your tears  
As you feel every pain  
Coax out the sun  
From the endless rain  
Thought I'd never feel  
So much love for another  
I'll be with you  
I will be there in the end  
Love that is there  
Through the false and the real  
Love that desires  
No reward and no gain  
As I hold your tiny hand  
You'll never know how I feel  
There's a promise  
With my life I will defend  
I will be there with you 'til the end  
And I'll cry your tears  
As you feel every pain  
Coax out the sun  
From the endless rain  
Thought I'd never feel  
So much love for another  
I'll be with you  
I will be there 'til the end  
All that potential  
Bursting inside  
Let me help you on your journey  
Let me help you with life  
I will be there with you 'til the end
