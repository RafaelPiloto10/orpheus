I was driving out to meet you that night  
Getting reports on the weather  
You were coming home, had caught the last flight  
But we would soon be together  
You'd been gone such a long time  
When my radio gave the warning  
  
Chaos at the airport tonight, something ain't right  
No-one can land in the weather  
Planes are crashing out of control  
And all in all I think you've lost him forever  
  
Looking up I started searching the skies  
Was he still up there above me  
Was the man who'd waved a million goodbyes  
Now just a stranger who loved me  
But as I drove to the terminal sign  
I heard a great loud explosion  
  
Chaos at the airport tonight, something ain't right  
No-one can land in the weather  
Planes are crashing out of control  
And all in all I think you've lost him forever  
  
I ran so, so fast but if I could only reach you  
But you're so far away, you're oh so far away  
Landing lights approaching  
Out from a sea of darkness  
But you're so far away, you're oh so far away  
  
Like a bird of death it hovered around  
Until the wheels started turning  
Then I saw the jets just touching the ground  
And I could see it recurring  
And as I looked for the last time  
My radio gave the warning
