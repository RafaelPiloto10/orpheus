Nobody told me  
Every moment without you would seem so long  
I get so lonely  
And the nights have been so cold since you've been gone  
Did I go and make believe the way you touched me  
Was it real or just a game my mind was playing, tell me  
  
[Chorus]  
Was it the flame of love  
Or was it just my imagination  
Was it the flame of love  
Or an act of desperation  
  
It's amazing  
How a love could feel so good then fade away  
And replacing you with someone else is a game my heart won't play  
Cause I know I'll never feel the heat that's in your soul  
But I can't remember how I lost complete control  
Tell me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How could I know you'd ever go  
Taking my dreams away with you  
You lead me along  
You did me wrong  
I can't go on now, baby
