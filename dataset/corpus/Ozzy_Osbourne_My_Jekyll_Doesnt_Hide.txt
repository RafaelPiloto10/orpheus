Condemned to violence  
Arrested by pain  
Inside the soul lies a man insane  
Conceived in anger  
Addicted to hate  
The mutant child of a twisted state  
  
Beware the contradiction  
Beneath the crimson void  
'Cause in the world of fiction  
My Jekyll doesn't hide  
  
A killer's smile with  
A psycho star dream  
Behind the mask things aren't what they seem  
Unholy soldier  
Disciple of sin  
What kind of mind are you living in  
  
You're preaching revolution  
Don't you mean genocide?  
Behind this resolution  
My Jekyll doesn't hide  
  
Waiting to die for the every first time  
All right, that's right  
Waiting to die for the every first time  
I don't give a damn, 'cause I think it's my time, my time  
  
The symbiosis  
Of murder and lies  
What do I see looking through your disguise?  
Fourth Reich dementia  
Subversion ideals  
God only knows what your secret conceals  
  
Who'll be the first offender?  
Who will be victimized?  
In your perverse agenda  
My Jekyll doesn't hide
