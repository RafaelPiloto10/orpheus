When I saw you this morning, baby  
Tell me why did you walk away  
When I saw you this morning, baby  
Tell me why did you walk away  
Can't believe that you don't want me  
I thought our love was here to stay  
  
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby  
I'll be waiting for your call  
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby  
I'll be waiting for your call  
If you forgot the number  
Come on over  
You won't have to call at all  
  
I never lied to no one  
I ain't gonna lie to you  
When I say I'm yours forever  
Every word I say is true  
Buzz me, baby  
I'll be waiting for your call  
If you forgot the number  
Come on over  
You won't have to call at all  
  
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby  
You mean so awfully much to me  
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me, baby  
I'm like a ship that's lost at sea  
But when I get my arms around you  
I ain't gonna let go till 1953
