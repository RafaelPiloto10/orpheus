Here is London, giddy of London  
Is it home of the free  
Or what?  
  
Can you squeeze me  
Into an empty page of your diary  
And psychologically save me  
I've got faith in you  
I sense the power  
Within the fingers  
Within an hour the power  
Could totally destroy me  
(Or, it could save my life)  
  
Oh, here is London  
"Home of the brash, outrageous and free"  
You are repressed  
But you're remarkably dressed  
Is it real?  
And you're always busy  
  
Really busy  
Busy, busy  
Oh, hairdresser on fire  
All around Sloane Square  
And you're just so busy  
Busy, busy  
Busy scissors  
Oh, hairdresser on fire  
(Only the other day)  
  
Was a client, over-cautious  
He made you nervous  
And when he said  
"I'm gonna sue you"  
Oh, I really felt for you  
  
So can you squeeze me  
Into an empty page of your diary  
And supernaturally change me?  
Change me, change  
Oh, here in London  
"Home of the brash, outrageous and free"  
You are repressed  
But you're remarkably dressed  
Is it real?  
And you're always busy  
  
Really busy  
Busy clippers  
Oh, hairdresser on fire  
All around Sloane Square  
  
And you're just too busy  
To see me  
Busy clippers  
Oh, hairdresser on fire  
(Only the other day)
