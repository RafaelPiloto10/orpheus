I am lost There's no spark  
I am tumbling around in the dark  
All alone out of sight  
I am desperately seeking a light  
  
Can't believe,  
I can't believe that you are gone  
But I am trying to move on  
Someone tell me it's just a bad dream  
That it's just not true  
  
Say you will be home for dinner or  
Say you will be working late, but  
Say you will come home to me  
Like you used to do, cause I'm missing you so  
  
Say you will lay down beside me and  
Say you will just smile and kiss me and  
Say you will be holding me  
Like you used to do  
Cause I still love you  
  
As a wife, as a mom  
We were waiting for our third to come  
You and I had it all  
But it was changing from a simple call  
  
Could not breathe  
And my whole world was falling apart  
Leaving pain inside my heart  
Someone tell me it's just a bad dream  
That it's just not true  
  
Say you will be home for dinner or  
Say you will be working late, but  
Say you will come home to me  
Like you used to do, cause I'm missing you so  
  
Say you will lay down beside me and  
Say you will just smile and kiss me and  
Say you will be holding me  
Like you used to do  
Cause I still love you  
  
And even if you're gone you're still not far  
You're here with me, you live inside my heart  
Nothing in this world will be the same  
Except my love will never change...  
  
Say you will be home for dinner or  
Say you will be working late, but  
Say you will come home to me  
Like you used to do, cause I'm missing you so  
  
Say you will lay down beside me and  
Say you will just smile and kiss me and  
Say you will be holding me  
Like you used to do  
Cause I still love you
