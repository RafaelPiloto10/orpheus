[Verse 1]  
I don't like to wait too long, to wait too long, wait too long  
Figured out I'm burning slow, but I burn babe  
I feel the pain and it feels good, I know it would  
Your heart burns slow, I feel the pain and I cry out  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I need you, I need you  
Baby I want to breathe you in  
Like oxygen, like oxygen  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I'm a house on fire  
And I want to keep burning  
Going on up in flames  
And you're to blame  
Yeah, you're to blame  
Baby I'm a house on fire  
And I want to keep burning  
I want to keep burning  
I want to keep burning  
I want to keep burning  
Baby I'm a house on fire  
I want to keep burning  
I want to keep burning  
I want to keep burning  
Baby I'm a house on fire  
  
[Verse 2]  
So take me to the heavens now  
As we burn down, as we are found  
Take me to the heavens now  
My heart screams out  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I need you, I need you  
Baby I want to breathe you in  
Like oxygen, like oxygen  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I'm a house on fire  
And I want to keep burning  
Going on up in flames  
And you're to blame  
Yeah, you're to blame  
Baby I'm a house on fire  
And I want to keep burning  
I want to keep burning  
I want to keep burning
