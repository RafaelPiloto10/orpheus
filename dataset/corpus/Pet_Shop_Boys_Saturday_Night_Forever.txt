I don't care what these commentators say  
I swear I don't care  
For what difference do they make?  
I go where I go and I get there fast  
Don't stop me  
I know that it's not gonna last  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
If you see someone gorgeous  
Then you think am I in with a chance?  
Should I try?  
Buy a rink?  
Or maybe it's too much  
Like hard work tonight  
But if they look my way  
I might alright  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
I go where I go and I get there fast  
Don't stop me  
I know that it's not gonna last  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)  
Forever, forever  
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
