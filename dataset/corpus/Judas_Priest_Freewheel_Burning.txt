Fast and furious we ride the universe  
To carve a road for us that slices every  
curve in sight  
We accelerate, no time to hesitate  
This load will detonate whoever would  
Contend it's right  
Born to lead  
At breakneck speed  
With high octane  
We're spitting flames  
Freewheel burning  
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt  
Unearthing every fault, go headlong  
into any date  
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat  
We blaze with scorching heat obliterations  
everywhere  
Look before you leap has never been  
the way we keep  
Our road is free  
Charging to the top and never give in never  
stops the  
Way to be  
Hold on to the lead with all your will and  
concede  
You'll find there's life with victory on high
