Valentino's got a bookie shop and what he takes  
He gives for what he's got  
And what he's got he says he has not  
Stole from anyone  
  
It's not that he don't tell the truth  
Or even that he misspent his youth  
It's just he holds the proof  
But you know something's wrong  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
  
Valentino's in a cold sweat, but he lost all his money on that last bet  
Against all the odds he smokes another cigarette  
Says it helps him to forget  
He's a nervous wreck  
  
It's not that he misses much  
Or even that he lost his lucky touch  
It's just he gambles so much  
And you know that it's wrong  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting just to catch your eye  
Waiting for an alibi  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Try to say I told you I told you  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting just to get you  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Just to say I told you  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
  
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
