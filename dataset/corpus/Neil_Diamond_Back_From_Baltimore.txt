Hey, see how she kissed me  
Yeah, no reason for the girl to lie  
She say she gonna miss me  
Yeah, smile on my face, I wave goodbye  
  
But I've been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby, where are you?  
Where are you?  
  
Yeah, I'm about to crumble  
Yeah, come see me die before your eyes  
Yeah, my thoughts all jumbled  
And my throat is dry from asking why  
  
But I've been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby, where are you?  
Where are you?  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Girl, I've been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby where are you?  
Well, I've been back from Baltimore  
For a week or two  
I hurried back from Baltimore  
Baby, where are you?  
Where are you?
