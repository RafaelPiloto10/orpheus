Lord my path has gone astray  
I'm just tryin' to find my way  
Wandered here from far away  
I'm just tryin' to find my way  
  
You were never meant to see  
All those things inside of me  
Now that you've gone away  
I'm just tryin' to find my way  
  
Uh uh uh oh  
Uh uh uh oh  
Uh uh uh oh (Ooh)  
Uh uh uh oh  
  
I have made a great mistake  
Pray The Lord my soul to take  
Ghosts of who we used to be  
I can feel them come for me  
It looks as thought they're here to stay  
I'm just tryin' to find my way  
  
Uh uh uh oh  
Uh uh uh oh (Ooh)  
Uh uh uh oh  
Uh uh uh oh  
  
I have been to everyplace  
I have been to everywhere  
I'm just tryin' to find my way  
Oh dear Lord hear my prayer  
  
I have been to everyplace  
I have been to everywhere  
I'm just tryin' to find my way  
Oh dear Lord hear my prayer
