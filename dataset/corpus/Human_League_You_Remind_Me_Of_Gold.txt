Baby, when I think about you  
And that's when I think  
I think about gold  
You remind me of gold  
And when I see the sunrise in the sky  
And when I hear your brakes come squealing by  
I forget  
Everything I've been told  
Chorus:  
You remind me of gold  
You remind me of gold  
You remind me of gold  
Baby I always think about you  
I think of the life and glory you hold  
You remind me of gold  
And even though there was no sun today  
And though you are a thousand miles away  
You remind me of gold  
Chorus repeats to fade
