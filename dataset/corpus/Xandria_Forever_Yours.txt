It feels like  
Keeping and holding a star in the sky  
Born to be born again with you  
The days of thunder cry their goodbye  
And for the first time I know what to do  
I just keep on being one with you  
forever yours, forever yours  
I'm here to stay  
Cause in your arms, in your arms  
I feel so save  
forever yours, forever yours  
I'm here to stay  
Cause in your arms, in your arms  
I feel so save  
loving and fighting the mirror I need  
Dearest I'm down on the ground  
Waitind to see whereto the storm leads  
It's my blood that bleeds from your wounds  
Dearest you're all that I need  
forever yours, forever yours  
I'm here to stay  
Cause in your arms, in your arms  
I feel so save  
forever yours, forever yours  
I'm here to stay  
Cause in your arms, in your arms  
I feel so save  
and when I kiss you  
Your lips are the onla food I need  
Your fingertips open  
Spaces that make me complete  
Dearest you're all that I need  
forever yours, forever yours  
I'm here to stay  
Cause in your arms, in your arms  
I feel so save  
forever yours, forever yours  
I'm here to stay  
Cause in your arms, in your arms  
I feel so save  
forever  
loving - fighting  
Holding - losing  
Giving - taking  
wanting forever you  
loving - fighting  
Holding - losing  
Giving - taking
