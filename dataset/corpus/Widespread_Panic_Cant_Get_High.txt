I've been working all day  
I've been shaking it loose  
It's been raining for hours  
I've been spilling my juice  
Nothing means nothing  
I couldn't care less  
And now that you're gone,  
I can't even guess  
I've got snakes in my cellar  
I've got blood in my bed  
Bombs in the closet  
They're all painted cherry red  
And a feel like a mad scientist  
I've got loose change in my head  
Nothing but trouble these days  
I eat bullets in my bread  
  
Now that you're gone  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't get right  
  
Violent romantic  
On a seven day binge  
Losin' a gamble  
But I get my revenge  
Start thinking about thunder  
And I get mad again  
Soaking up electricity  
Like bourbon and gin  
  
Now that you're gone  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't get right  
  
Hallucinated green light  
And I slammed on the gas  
My performance ain't perfect  
But it's loud and it's fast  
Set sail for the new world  
And I burned down the mast  
Well, it wasn't the first time  
And I know it won't be the last  
  
Now that you're gone, honey,  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't - get - right  
Get right
