Why did you come here, what do you need  
Don't look at me like you want me to plead  
My friends are dying to make rock and roll stand  
While we've been living in A country rock band  
We've got to slow down - come down  
We got to get off of this merry-Go-Round  
  
Where did you go, marilyn monroe  
If you see james dean, tell him I said hello  
Janis sang here, jimmy did too  
They're saving A place there for me and you  
There's gonna be A rock and roll holiday  
We've got to get there in time to play  
  
Tune up the fiddle, rosin the bow  
We could be the only country band on A rock and roll show  
We've got to get up, no time to hit up  
There's another crowd waiting for the music to play  
  
Slow down - come down  
Don't take A ride on death's merry-Go-Round
