Whatever it is, it'll keep till morning  
Haven't we both got better things to do, midnight blue  
Even though simple things become rough  
Haven't we had enough  
  
I think we can make it  
One more time, if we try  
One more time for all the old times  
For all the times you told me you need me  
Needing me now is something I could use, midnight blue  
Wouldn't you give your hand to a friend  
Maybe it's not the end  
  
And I think we can make it  
One more time, if we try  
One more time for all the old times, midnight blue, midnight blue  
I think we can make it  
I think we can make it  
Wouldn't you give your hand to a friend  
  
Think of me as your friend  
And I think we can make it  
One more time, if we try  
One more time for all of the old old times  
Midnight blue, midnight blue, midnight blue, midnight blue
