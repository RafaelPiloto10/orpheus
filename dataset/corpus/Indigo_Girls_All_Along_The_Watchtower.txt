"There must be some kinda way out of here"  
Oh, said the joker to the thief  
I want to tell you now there's just too much confusion  
And I can't, no, I can't get no relief  
Ah, these businessmen, they all, they drink our wine  
And the plowman, well, he dig my earth  
And you know that ah none of them along the line  
Can show me what any of this is worth  
You know we wanted to see it now, didn't we? Didn't we?  
"There ain't no reason to get excited"  
Ah, the thief, you know he kindly spoke  
Well, now there are those among us right here, right now  
Who still see life as some kind of a joke  
But you and I, we have been through that  
I tell you that this, this is not our fate, no no no  
Now, let us all not talk falsely now  
You know the hour, well, it's getting late  
I said all along the watchtower, the princes, they kept the view  
While the women, the women, they came and then they went  
Oh, and the barefoot servants too, that's me, that's you  
But outside there's a cold distance  
Listen for the wildcats, here them growl  
Two riders were approaching as the wind began to howl  
Oh, there are those among us right here, right now  
Who still see life as some kind of a joke  
All along the watchtower, said, all along this watchtower  
Those of you who still have eyes to see, ears hear me  
You will be saved by grace in the end  
Saved by time if you don't understand  
That your hatred is rooted in your fear  
And your paranoia and insecurities  
Well, they don't belong here  
You got to take someones hand  
You got to learn to make your stand  
And it's a one, two, three, four  
Look at the sky, you can open the door  
And take my hand, take my hand, take my hand  
Ah, don't you want to touch  
Don't you want to feel  
Don't you know that this is real  
I said shelter me, shelter me  
Shelter me, shelter me  
And save yourself, save yourself  
Save, save, save  
Save, save, save  
Save, save, save  
Save, save  
And you, and you  
And you are a part of the world  
You, you, you are a part of the world  
You gotta learn to touch, to feel  
You know that you are real  
I said, learn learn  
You are a part of the world
