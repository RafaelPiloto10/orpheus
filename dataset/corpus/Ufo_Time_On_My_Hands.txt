[Chorus]  
Long, long year I've sat in this place  
Baby, baby, what's good I've had  
When you don't know where I want to go  
Find a reason love's left me cold  
I've got it, time on my hands  
Been drinkin' with the sailor boy  
Been tryin' hard to understand  
Lines here in my hand  
Left me hopin' the wild thoughts I had  
My lost feelin' made me so sad  
Tried so hard, the smile on my face  
Can't get it back a gain, back home with you  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus]
