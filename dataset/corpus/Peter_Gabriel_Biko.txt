September '77  
Port Elizabeth weather fine  
It was business as usual  
In police room 619  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Yihla Moja, Yihla Moja  
The man is dead  
The man is dead  
  
When I try to sleep at night  
I can only dream in red  
The outside world is black and white  
With only one colour dead  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Yihla Moja, Yihla Moja  
The man is dead  
The man is dead  
  
You can blow out a candle  
But you can't blow out a fire  
Once the flames begin to catch  
The wind will blow it higher  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Yihla Moja, Yihla Moja  
The man is dead  
The man is dead  
  
And the eyes of the world are watching now, watching now
