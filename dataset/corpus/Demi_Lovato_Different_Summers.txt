We're like a melody with no words  
Until we figure it out  
We sing  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
  
I know it's simple yeah, but it's worked right up 'til now  
It's up to now  
Yeah, every day's been like a dream world  
Oh but now your not just  
In my head, oh no  
  
Will we remember different summers  
It's like tossing your heart to see where it land  
Heads is easy  
Tails is harder to plan  
If we're starting all over again, and again, and again, oh  
  
You know that I can't help but wonder  
What's gonna happen next  
I'm a little curious, oh yeah  
Every star that I stood under  
When you were under it too  
Did you ever think about us?  
I hope you did, 'cause I can tell you  
That's something I'll never forget  
I won't forget  
  
If we remember different summers  
It's like tossing your heart to see where it lands  
Heads is easy  
Tails is harder to plan  
If we're starting all over again  
  
Don't need friends just beginning  
But I hope that we will find it again  
So we can go from here, oh  
  
Will we remember different summers  
It's like tossing your hearts to see where it lands  
Heads is easy  
Tails is harder to plan  
If we're starting all over again, again, and again, and again, and again  
And again, and again, and again  
Will we remember different summers
