Hey buds below... Up is where to grow  
Up with which below can't compare with.  
Hurry - it's lovely up here...  
Life down a hole takes an awful toll,  
What with not a soul there to share with  
Hurry - it's lovely up here!  
Wake up, bestir yourself, it's time that you disinter yourself  
You've got a spot to fill - a pot to fill  
And what a gift package of showers, sun and love  
You'll be met above everywhere with,  
Fondled and sniffed by millions who drift by,  
Life here is rosy - if you're a posy  
Hurry it's lovely here!  
Climb up geranium, it can't be fun subterran-ium  
On the exterior, it's cheerier  
Rsvp peonies, pollinate the breeze,  
Make the queen of bees hot as brandy  
Come give at least a preview of Easter  
Come up and see the good we're giving  
Come up and see the grounds for living  
Come poke your head out,  
Open up and spread out,  
Hurry it's lovely here!
