A perfect day, the sun is sinkin' low  
As evening falls, the gentle breezes blow  
The time we shared went by so fast  
Just like a dream, we knew it couldn't last  
But I'd do it all again  
If I could, somehow  
But I must be leavin' soon  
It's your world now  
  
It's your world now  
My race is run  
I'm moving on  
Like the setting sun  
No sad goodbyes  
No tears allowed  
You'll be alright  
It's your world now  
  
Even when we are apart  
You'll always be in my heart  
When dark clouds appear in the sky  
Remember true love never dies  
  
But first a kiss, one glass of wine  
Just one more dance while there's still time  
My one last wish: someday, you'll see  
How hard I tried and how much you meant to me  
  
It's your world now  
Use well the time  
Be part of something good  
Leave something good behind  
The curtain falls  
I take my bow  
That's how it's meant to be  
It's your world now  
It's your world now  
It's your world now
