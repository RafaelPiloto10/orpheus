Here am I with my desire  
Feel it burning just for you  
My, o my, this love divine  
Is talking me to somewhere new  
  
Just slide  
Get your body down, down, down  
And glide  
I got to feel you all around  
  
Boy you got me wanting more, more, more  
Give it all up for love babe  
You got me saying more, more, more  
Wind me up, wind me up  
You know I want you more, more, more  
Gotta give it all up for love, babe  
You got me saying more, more, more  
Baby just fill me up to the top  
No more  
  
Here am I and deep desire  
I got a little spot for you  
Make me sigh with sheer delight  
As baby you caress and soothe  
  
Just slide  
Get your body down, down, down  
And glide  
I got to feel you all around  
  
Coro  
  
Give it up, give it up  
I just can't get enough  
So give me more, more, more, more, more
