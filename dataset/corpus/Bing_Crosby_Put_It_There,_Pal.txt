I don't care where I'm going  
Just as long as I'm with you  
Put it there, pal. Put it there  
  
I'll be just like your horses  
And I'll stick to you like glue  
Put it there, pal. Put it there  
  
I'm glad you're fooling Pepsodent (oh, that happy snow)  
Stealing all that cash  
I hear your show on Thursdays (nice, huh?)  
What a lot of eggs you smash  
  
Well at least I don't depend upon  
Cologne's big moustache (oh, he gave me the brush)  
You're faithful and you're fair  
Put it there (skin me Dad, skin me)  
  
You've got that something in your voice  
So right for selling cheese (hustle a lot of the stuff)  
Put it there, pal. Put it there (put that back in the bowl)  
  
You know, I think your jokes are great (really?)  
It's just that folks are hard to please (they're just snobs, that all)  
Put it there, pal. Put it there  
  
Your face could make a fortune  
Just your nose should make a lot (how do you siphon?)  
I like the way you wear those gaudy-colored shirts you've got, boy  
The only time a rainbow ever covered up a pot  
You're such a perfect square (oh-oh, is that on the paper?)  
(Where? Where?)  
  
Shall we dance  
Sorry, I have my heavy underwear on  
Oh, just to once around, to the adrenalin, huh  
Well, OK, if I lead  
  
My colleague, my crony, my cohort, my friend  
Companions, confederates, chums to the end  
Like meat and potatoes, or salt and tomatoes  
Boy, what a blend  
  
Don't put it in the paper (don't worry about me)  
Don't put it on the air (I'll finish it)  
Don't put it in your pipe  
Put it there  
  
Confidentially, do you like this as well as singing  
Leave your name with the girl when you go out  
We may get to you for some crowd noises  
Be sure and call me  
All right
