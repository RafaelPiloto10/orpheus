Alright now!!  
Won't you listen?  
  
When I first met you, didn't realize  
I can't forget you, for your surprise  
You introduced me, to my mind  
And left me wanting, you and your kind  
  
I love you, oh you know it  
  
My life was empty forever on a down  
Until you took me, showed me around  
My life is free now, my life is clear  
I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear  
  
Come on now, try it out  
  
Straight people don't know, what your about  
They put you down and shut you out  
You gave to me a new belief  
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf
