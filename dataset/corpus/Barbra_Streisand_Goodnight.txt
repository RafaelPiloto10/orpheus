Now it's time to say goodnight  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the sun turns out his light  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dreams for me.  
  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Close your eyes and I'll close mine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the moon begins to shine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Close your eyes and I'll close mine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the sun turns out his light  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dream for me  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Goodnight,  
Everybody, everybody  
Everywhere,  
Goodnight,
