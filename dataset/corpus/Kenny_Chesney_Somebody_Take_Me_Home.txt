Same ol' bedroom floor  
Same ol' empty sheets  
I hate this haunted bed  
So down here's where I sleep  
  
Tryin' to find a place  
To hide what you have left  
Some things never change  
My heart hasn't yet  
  
Well I don't wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I can't be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Can't somebody take me home  
Can't somebody take me home  
  
The hope that we had left  
Wrapped around your ring  
That river just rolled on by  
When I watched it sink  
  
Well I don't wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I can't be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Can't somebody take me home  
Can't somebody take me...  
  
Out of this bar  
Out of this heartache  
Out of this town  
That just keeps breakin' down  
Keeps breakin' down...  
  
Well I don't wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I can't be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Can't somebody take me home  
  
I don't wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I can't be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Can't somebody take me home  
Can't somebody take me home  
Won't you take me home
