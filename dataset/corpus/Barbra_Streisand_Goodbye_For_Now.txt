(Stephen Sondheim)  
  
Yes I know, goodbye for now,  
How long? A year, a day?  
Yes I love you, yes you're with me,  
Here now, next to me, and worlds away!  
See I free you, and I'll see you when I see you,  
Fine, ok?  
Goodbye for now, again  
Goodbye until whenever then  
We're free, that's what we said we'd be,  
At leave to come an' go, you as well as I,  
Somehow each "hello" makes it worth "goodbye"  
For now
