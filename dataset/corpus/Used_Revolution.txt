"All revolutions are impossible until they happen, then they become
inevitable."  
  
It's not enough to kill the past, be blind to history.  
And all at once there's a black cloud coming made of gasoline.  
I'm feeling too upset the price, make sure that nothing's free.  
One way to move forward is to learn who's stopping me.  
  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution.  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution.  
Burn! Like a fire in the ring, like a fire in the ring.  
This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution. Yeah!  
  
We looked at the price tag, and it's one we can't afford.  
We were taught that progression means accumulating more.  
Yeah, if it's up to protect ourselves well why are we at war?  
And isn't it obvious we're adding up the score?  
  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution.  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution.  
Burn! Like a fire in the ring, like a fire in the ring.  
This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution. Yeah!  
  
I'll never turn my back on where I'm from.  
I'll never stop believing. I'll always love my home.  
But if all I love and know has just been burned,  
I know it's just still bleeding since the fire has grown.  
  
So from now on I pledge allegiance,  
To a world that's so much different.  
No one suffers, everyone is free.  
Revolution starts with me.  
  
Revolution! Revolution! Calling for a revolution!  
Revolution! Revolution! Calling for!  
  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution.  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, (This is the end)  
  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution.  
Yeah! This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution.  
Burn! Like a fire in the ring, like a fire in the ring.  
This is the end, this is the end, calling for revolution. Yeah!  
  
Calling for revolution! Yeah! Calling for revolution!  
  
"One of the things that's happened, is that this movement has acquired an air
of inevitability"
