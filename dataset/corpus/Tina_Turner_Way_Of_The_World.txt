Baby, I need a hand to hold tonight  
And one bright star to remind me  
How dear is this life  
And baby, I've never known anyone like you  
There's something very special about you  
I can't imagine living without you  
  
It's the way of the world and its motion  
And no ocean can keep us apart  
When the moment is right and you're holding me tight  
You capture the beat of my heart  
In my heart there's s fire always burning  
And there isn't a thing I can't do  
I'm resigned to the fact that there's no turning back  
And I'll never regret loving you  
  
Baby, I will go anywhere you need  
As long as you're there beside me  
Baby, that's all I need  
Hold me, hold me and never let me go  
I'm always gonna care about you  
I never want to be without you  
  
It's the way of the world and its motion  
And no ocean can keep us apart  
When the moment is right and you're holding me tight  
You capture the beat of my heart  
In my heart there's s fire always burning  
And there isn't a thing I can't do  
I'm resigned to the fact that there's no turning back  
And I'll never regret loving you  
  
You're everything I believe in  
So don't ever lose the feeling  
Don't ever lose the feeling
