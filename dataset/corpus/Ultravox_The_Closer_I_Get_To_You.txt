My obsession  
Your desire  
Come let me lead you  
To the fire  
Show some mercy  
My pounding heart  
Can't take much more of this  
You've got play your part  
Bodies yearning  
Is this for real?  
Words cannot express the way I really feel  
Passion burning  
You ignite the flame  
We touch, we come alive  
We'll never be the same again  
Chorus:  
The closer I get to you  
The more I reveal is true  
And something inside of me  
Burns my reality  
Use your imagination  
Exorcise  
See your future  
Through my eyes  
No salvation  
Nowhere to hide  
We're one dimension  
We're one inside  
Is this perfection  
Taken to extreme?  
We're drowning in a sea of possibilities  
Pure emotion  
You can't conceal  
We touch, we come alive  
We'll know that this time it's for real  
(Chorus)  
Bodies yearning  
Is this for real?  
Words cannot express the way I really feel  
Passion burning  
You ignite the flame  
We touch, we come alive  
We'll never be the same again  
(Chorus)
