We are 138, we are 138, we are 138  
We are 138, we are 138, we are 138  
We are 138, we are 138, we are 138  
In the eyes of Tiger  
  
Do you think we're robot clean  
Does this face look almost mean  
It's time to be an android not a man  
  
Whose pleasantries are gone  
We are stripped of all we've won  
In the eyes of Tiger  
  
We are 138, we are 138, we are 138  
We are 138, we are 138, we are 138
