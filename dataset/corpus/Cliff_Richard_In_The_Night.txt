You waken from a dream  
You step outside  
To find the world is changing  
Under your feet  
Somewhere in the past  
Is the world you knew  
Soon you'll find that freedom  
Is not so sweet  
I can't imagine why you'd throw it all away  
After everything i've said to you today  
When you turn around to find there's  
No one then you finally realize what you've done  
  
In the night when there's no one there at all  
In the night do you hear somebody call  
You see someone and you tell yourself you're wrong  
You hear a voice and you know it must belong  
To the night just a shadow on the wall  
And there's no one there at all  
  
I gave you everything  
Everything i had endlessly  
Believing your love was true  
And you will never know just how it hurt  
To find that you were turning to someone new  
I know that we can't ever change  
What has been said but how can i  
Believe our love is really dead  
When you turn around to find there's no one  
Then you finally realize what you've done  
  
In the night when there's no one there at all  
In the night do you hear somebody call  
You see someone and you tell yourself you're wrong  
You hear a voice and you know it must belong  
To the night just a shadow on the wall  
And there's no one there at all  
-solo-  
And when you turn around to find there's no one  
Then you finally realize what you've done  
In the night...
