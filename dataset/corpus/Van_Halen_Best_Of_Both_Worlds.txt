I don't know what I been livin' on but it's  
Not enough to fill me up  
I need more than just words can say  
I need everything this life can give me  
Come on baby close your eyes let go  
This can be everything we've dreamed  
It's not work, that makes it work no  
Let the magic do the work for you  
  
Cause something reached out and touched me  
Now I see that all I want  
  
I want the best of both worlds  
And baby I know what it's worth  
We can have have the best of both worlds a little  
Heaven right here on earth  
There's a picture in the gallery of a fallen angel  
Looked a lot like you  
We forget where we come from sometimes  
I had a dream it was really you  
  
Cause something reached out and touched me  
Now I see that all I want  
  
I want the best of both worlds  
And baby I know what it's worth  
We can have have the best of both worlds a little  
Heaven right here on earth  
There's a picture in the gallery of a fallen angel  
Looked a lot like you  
We forget where we come from sometimes  
I had a dream it was really you  
  
You don't have to die to go to heaven  
Or hang around to be born again  
Just tune into what this place has got to offer  
Cause we may never be here again  
  
I want the best of both worlds  
And baby I know what it's worth  
We can have have the best of both worlds a little  
Heaven right here on earth  
There's a picture in the gallery of a fallen angel  
Looked a lot like you  
We forget where we come from sometimes  
I had a dream it was really you
