Well I finally found somebody,  
Who lives to give their love to me, only me.  
She takes away my worries,  
Shows me how true love's meant to be, what a relief.  
  
Now love don't have to be a ball and chain,  
Or somebody pullin' on a puppet string.  
Danglin' you around,  
Like you got no mind all.  
  
Love don't fade when the dog days come,  
And hangs in tough 'til it sees the sun.  
And I finally found somebody who,  
Lets that love light shine on through.  
  
Well I finally found somebody,  
Who welcomes me with open arms, into their heart.  
Thank God, my search is over.  
I found a four-leaf clover, love took me long enough.  
  
Now love don't have to be a ball and chain,  
Or somebody pullin' on a puppet string.  
Danglin' you around,  
Like you got no mind all.  
  
Love don't fade when the dog days come,  
And hangs in tough 'til it sees the sun.  
And I finally found somebody who,  
Lets that love light shine on through.  
  
Lets that love light shine on through.  
Well I finally found somebody.  
Well I finally found somebody.  
I finally found somebody.  
I finally found somebody.
