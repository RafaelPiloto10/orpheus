Here by I return your love  
I just want to give it back  
I am fading  
The silence can be beautiful but also very cold  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Cause one thing I know  
Somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
The choices can be hard to make  
Is it luck or is it love  
I am waiting  
I'm waiting for the voice inside me to tell me what I'm not  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Cause one thing I know  
Somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Cause one thing I know  
Somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere outhere there's a place where I belong  
Somewhere outhere(8x)
