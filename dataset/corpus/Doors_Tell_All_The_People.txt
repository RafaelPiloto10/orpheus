Tell all the people that you see  
Follow me  
Follow me down  
Tell all the people that you see  
Set them free  
Follow me down  
You tell them they don't have to run  
We're gonna pick up everyone  
Come out and take me by my hand  
Gonna bury all our troubles in the sand, oh yeah  
Can't you see the wonder at your feet  
Your life's complete  
Follow me down  
Can't you see me growing, get your guns  
The time has come  
To follow me down  
Follow me across the sea  
Where milky babies seem to be  
Molded, flowing revelry  
With the one that set them free  
Tell all the people that you see  
It's just me  
Follow me down  
Tell all the people that you see  
Follow me  
Follow me down  
Tell all the people that you see  
We'll be free  
Follow me down  
Tell all the people that you see  
It's just me  
Follow me down  
Tell all the people that you see  
Follow me  
Follow me down  
Follow me down  
You got to follow me down  
Follow me down  
Tell all the people that you see  
We'll be free  
Follow me down  
Tell all the people you see  
Follow me  
You got to follow me down
