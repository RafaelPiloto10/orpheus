Out on the road there are fireflies circling  
Deep in the woods, where the lost souls hide  
Over the hill there are men returning  
Trying to find some peace of mind  
  
Sleep my child  
  
Under the fog there are shadows moving  
Don't be afraid, hold my hand  
Into the dark, there are eyelids closing  
Buried alive in the shifting sands  
  
Sleep my child  
  
Speak to me now and the world will crumble  
Open a door and the moon will fall  
All of your life, all your memories  
Go to your dreams, forget it all  
  
Sleep my child
