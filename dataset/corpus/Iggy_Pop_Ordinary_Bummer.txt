Lovely games of yesterday  
Have left me with my soul today  
Felicity flies out the door  
When people lose their warmth  
That's a very ordinary bummer  
I'll hold out for summer days  
  
Stand and laugh and run  
In a quiet movie of mine  
I saw a girl with eyes like fire  
I had to look away  
She was swearing like a sailor  
And demanding her own way  
That was when I knew I had to love her  
  
I opened up my sad old eyes  
And let the feelings run  
With a quiet beauty of mine  
Maybe sometimes we do bad things  
And then other times we do good  
And sometimes from something very bad  
Comes something very good  
In a quiet year of mine
