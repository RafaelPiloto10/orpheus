Overbearing panic attack entrenching my veins, (fuck)  
In an hour i'll be ok  
I pray this pain will go away permanently someday  
I've seen more than...  
I should have to...  
I've seen this on my own (great)  
This song is a,  
Poem to myself,  
It helps me to live...  
In case of fire,  
Break the glass, (fuck)  
And move on into your own... Your own...  
Reoccurring drowning effect entrenching my veins,  
I hope you'll be ok someday,  
So I can say that you moved on in the right way...  
We've seen this and  
We've breathed this and  
We've lived this on our own... (your own)  
This song is a,  
Poem to myself,  
It helps me to live...  
In case of fire,  
Break the glass,  
And move on into your own...  
This song is a,  
Poem to myself,  
It helps me to live...  
In case of fire,  
Break the glass,  
And move on into your own...  
Your own...  
Break  
This song is a,  
Poem to myself  
It helps me to live  
In case of fire  
Break the glass  
And move on into your own...  
(2x)  
Your own... Your own... Your ooowwwnnn..... Your own  
This is a Taproot song, not a Korn song.
