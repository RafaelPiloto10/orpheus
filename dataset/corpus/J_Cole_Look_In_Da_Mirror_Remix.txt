Six in the mornin' I'ma call Wale  
Tell J. Cole to meet us down in the A  
And bring Wiz Khalifa 'cause the green look pure  
We some real niggas, we just lookin' in the mirror  
  
I'm on fire, whole hood blazin'  
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin'  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
  
Look like a chandelier, look in the mirror  
Ice super clear, you lookin' in the mirror  
Who you heard see, when you look in the mirror  
If you a real nigga you lookin' in the mirror  
  
D.C. all up in this bitch, 'bout time I got my respect  
And now these hoes are on my line like Sally Mae on college deck  
Gotti here I'm in this shit, hey J. Cole come here this shit  
I bet you hear that white music but I don't mean top 40 hits  
  
Talk to the mirror and I don't need a cure  
And when I'm done with this muthafucker  
It'll need a urn shoppin' I'll be in Paris  
You plottin', don't even worry  
You walk in my closet your favorite style is some beaten birds  
  
You out where? We don't ever see ya  
My niggas out here they spot me like Chippy D.  
And I'm probably smokin' reefer till I got that emphysema  
How else can I emphasise I'll only let the mirror see ya  
  
It go microphone check, one, two, yola  
Two chains, two guns, he bipolar  
Two baby mama's, three kids, two Rovers  
That's too many problems, too late to think over  
  
The cars off the showroom, clothes off the mannequin  
Hoes off the centerfold, I be going ham at ten  
One bitch from Howard, another bitch from Grambling  
College girl goin' wild and Gotti be the camera man  
  
Bird talk feather man, Louis jacket, leatherman  
Fresh to death that bullshit irrelevant  
Man in the mirror if I can't get my shot again  
My bitch like a Coke bottle, yo' bitch like a Pepsi can  
  
I'm on fire, whole hood blazin'  
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin'  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
  
Look like a chandelier, look in the mirror  
Ice super clear, you lookin' in the mirror  
Who you heard see, when you look in the mirror?  
If you a real nigga you lookin' in the mirror  
  
Mirror, mirror on the wall, bitch I was born to ball  
While y'all took the summer off, my money did a somersault  
Backflips, cartwheels, Carolina Tar Heel  
Ain't no nigga touchin' my style it got a forcefield  
  
Magneto, blew up like a torpedo  
The view from my condo be makin' hoes say neato  
Game strong like the arm on Marino  
I stack Cheetos and Doritos like casinos  
  
Fresh to death like I'm buried in a tuxedo  
At times I look in the mirror to boost my fuckin' ego  
I say it's yo' world, Cole World to be exact  
With a flow that's so thorough  
No sir, you can't reenact, nigga  
  
Hundred fifty on my chain, ballin' but it's not a game  
High that's why they call us planes  
All the bitches know my name  
I take 'em home fuck her, get high and never call again  
  
And my niggas all the same, now that's what you call a game  
Hundred thousand dollars and that's on champagne  
Bitches choose and they excuses my new car's to blame  
Wanna dump her nigga, fuck a nigga, with a lot of fame  
Don't want nothing from a nigga he all kinds of lame  
  
Try doin' what I'm doin' but it's out of range  
Niggas takin' shots, don't know how to aim  
Don't know 'bout you but I see a real nigga  
When I'm lookin' in the mirror with some diamonds in my ear  
Motherfucker  
  
I'm on fire, whole hood blazin'  
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin'  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
  
Look like a chandelier, look in the mirror  
Ice super clear, you lookin' in the mirror  
Who you heard see, when you look in the mirror?  
If you a real nigga you lookin' in the mirror
