Well I can't believe I'm sittin' here today  
Picking on my banjo with a big smile on my face  
Writin' new words to an old school melody  
Hey there ain't no doubt that God's been good to me  
  
Oh the sun is shinin' on down in Tennessee  
And right now where I'm right where I want to be  
I've never felt so loved, so peaceful and so free  
Hey there ain't no doubt that God's been good to me  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause he put me smack dab in the middle of Paradise  
In the heart of the city where my dreams have come alive  
And everything I have, and everything I see  
Is just another reminder that God's been good to me  
  
This golden road's been long  
And sometimes I've lost my way  
I've been down some darkened detours  
Leanin' heavy on my faith  
But where the devil had me chained  
Lord your love done set me free  
Hallelujah! God's been good to me  
  
[Chorus: x2]
