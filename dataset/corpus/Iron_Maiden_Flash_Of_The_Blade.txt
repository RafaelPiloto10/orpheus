As a young boy chasing dragons with your wooden sword so mighty,  
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.  
Times change very quickly,  
and you had to grow up early,  
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll die as you lived  
In a flash of the blade,  
In a corner forgotten by no one.  
You lived for the touch  
For the feel of the steel  
One man, and his honor.  
  
The smell of resigned leather  
The steely iron mask  
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.  
He taught you all he knew  
To fear no mortal man  
and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the  
Screams of evil men.  
  
[Chorus]
