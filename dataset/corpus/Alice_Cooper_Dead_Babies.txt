Little Betty ate a pound of aspirin  
She got them from the shelf up on the wall  
Betty's mommy wasn't there to save her  
She didn't hear her little baby call  
Wah!  
  
Dead babies  
Can't take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Can't take things off the shelf  
Well we didn't want you anyway  
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la  
  
Daddy is an agrophile in Texas  
Mommy's on the bar most every night  
Little Betty's sleeping in the graveyard  
Living there in burgundy and white  
  
Dead babies  
Can't take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Can't take things off the shelf  
Well we didn't love you anyway  
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la  
  
Goodbye Little Betty  
Goodbye Little Betty  
So long Little Betty  
So long Little Betty  
Betty, so long  
  
Dead babies  
Can't take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Can't take things off the shelf  
Well we didn't need you anyway  
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la  
  
Goodbye, Little Betty  
  
Order in the court! Order in the court room!  
Order! Order in the court! Order!
