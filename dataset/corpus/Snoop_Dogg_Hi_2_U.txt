A brother sayin hi to you (say it)  
I really wouldn't lie to you  
I want to get inside of you  
Inside of you, what you try to do (can I hit it)  
A brother sayin hi to you (wish me luck)  
I really wouldn't lie to you (yea)  
I want to be inside of you (fo real)  
And after I do, goodbye to you  
  
[Verse 1:]  
Watch my floors fo' sho', hock up the kitchen  
Suck me dry, let's get high, then wash the dishes  
You get three wishes if you're cute and ambitious  
Like Tisha and Denisha, boy them chickens was vicious  
Wicked, how I kick it, I stick it in the eye  
Oops, slid it on the accident  
But, when I first met her she was so ???  
So it made no sense why she did that for the hell of it  
We did it on the wall, me and my dogg  
And I met her at the mall  
Lakewood, so good, when I be inside of you  
I'm just tryna freak it, make it fly for you  
Make you want to come back and get another piece  
And share with your peoples and tell your little niece  
My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket  
Ride it, divide it, and please don't knock it til you tried it  
  
[Chorus:]  
A brother sayin hi to you  
I want to be inside of you  
I know I'm lookin fly to you  
I wouldn't lie to you, what'cha tryna do  
A brother sayin hi to you  
You know I wouldn't lie to you  
I want to be inside of you  
And after I do, goodbye to you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Ay ay, baby who with cause your thang like tendin girl  
Get it wit your fit in, and welcome to my world  
Fancy cars, yachts n pools, basketball courts that's made for high schools  
Backyard full of dogs, got a pawn full of fish  
But a bad girl, I think that's all that's missin from my list  
Unless you want to be the girl that fill that void-acap
