Out of my sight  
But the vision is still the same  
Out of my mind  
But the memory remains unchanged  
Stones thrown in anger hold twice the hurt  
Return to sender could only make things worse  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl, you've got to break these chains around my heart  
Cause I've been lonely too long  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life  
  
Don't ask me why  
Why I've lived with this all alone  
Locked up inside  
And it's cutting me to the bone  
Love is a stranger avoiding me  
Beware of danger's the only sign I see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Are you listening  
Is there something that you'd like to say  
Am I getting through  
Are you just gonna leave me this way  
  
Girl you've got to break these chains around my heart  
Before it tears me in two  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
That's all I am asking of you  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
Cause I've been lonely too long  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life
