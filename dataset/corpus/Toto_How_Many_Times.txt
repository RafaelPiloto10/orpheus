How many years keep on slipping away  
And it seems that your life doesn't matter, you never had a chance  
  
How many ways is a love torn apart  
And you look to your heart for some answers, don't let it slip away  
  
Can't blame myself anymore, I've been beaten and accused before  
Well I took some bad advice, and I paid too high a price  
I could sell my soul, you know I wouldn't think twice  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
How many times must a man fall down, I said whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh  
How many dreams have to fall to the ground  
It goes on an' on an' on an' on an' on, yeah  
  
How many times do you look for some sign  
That there's hope, and your life has some meaning, almost every day, hey, hey  
  
Maybe I was born to wander, I got no high hopes any longer  
So tell me my friend, just where does it end  
Is nothing ever gonna free me from this hell I'm living in  
  
Can't blame myself anymore, I've been beaten and accused before  
So tell me my friend, just where does it end  
I'm sick and tired of living in a rat race that no one ever wins
