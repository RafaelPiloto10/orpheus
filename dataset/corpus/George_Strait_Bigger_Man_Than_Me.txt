Never thought too much about her leavin'  
I'd find someone there was no doubt  
But this time the feelin' is strange and different  
Since she's been gone there's one thing I found out  
  
[Chorus]  
It takes a mighty man to live with lonesome  
Some big men might live with misery  
But there's one thing I know, for sure it's certain  
It's for sure it's gonna take a lot bigger man than me  
  
I've never suffered much in the hurtin' line  
I've always been as good as any man  
But show me who can lose in love and like it  
And I'll be the first to proudly shake his hand
