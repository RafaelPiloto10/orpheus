Hey, I can see all your dreams  
Lying scattered in your fragile heart  
You think your world's come apart  
But hey, I believe there's gonna be  
  
A brighter day that shines for you my friend  
It's waiting around the bend  
You've been dancing on the wire  
Walking through the fire  
  
Thinking you're all alone  
But you're not on your owe  
There's a faithful hand to guide you  
God always be beside you  
  
All because he is love  
And love won't leave you now  
So fly, on the wings of your dreams  
To the place he is taking you  
  
You're gonna make it through  
And, if you doubt. Just think about  
All the promises that he has made  
You don't have to be afraid  
  
Through the smiles, through the sorrow  
He was faithful yesterday, and he'll be faithful tomorrow.
