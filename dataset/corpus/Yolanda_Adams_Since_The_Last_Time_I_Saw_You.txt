Since the last time I saw you  
God has moved another mountain out of my way  
Led me to green pasture turned my midnight into day  
Placed my feet up on a rock to stay  
  
Since the last time I saw you  
God has calmed another raging storm in my life  
Led me into safety turned my darkness into light  
Now I stand in the power of his might  
  
You would have thought that God already done enough for me  
When he took my place at Calvary  
But he done so much more and more  
Right before my eye's  
And I have no other choice  
But to stand and testify, stand and testify  
  
Since the last time I saw you  
God has worked another wondrous miracle for me  
Led me into triumph  
Now my blinded eyes can see that Christ the lord  
Performs victoriously  
  
You would have thought that he done enough for me  
When he took my place at Calvary  
But he's done more and more and more every day  
He makes a way and he's made a way  
  
Since the last time I saw you things have changed  
I'm not the same since the last time
