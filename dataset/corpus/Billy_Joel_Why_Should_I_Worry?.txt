One minute I'm in Central Park  
Then I'm down on Delancey Street  
From the Bow'ry to St. Marks  
There's a syncopated beat  
  
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo  
I'm streetwise, I can improvise  
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo  
I'm streetsmart, I've got New York City heart  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
I may not have a dime  
But I got street savoire faire  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
It's just bebopulation  
And I got street saviore faire  
  
The rhythm of the city  
But once you get it down  
Then you can own this town  
You can wear the crown  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
I may not have a dime  
But I got street savoire faire  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
It's just bebopulation  
And I got street saviore faire  
  
Ev'rything goes  
Ev'rything fits  
They love me at the Chelsea  
They adore me at the Ritz  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
And even when I cross that line  
I got street savoire faire
