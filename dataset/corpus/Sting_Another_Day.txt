Every day that goes by  
A new hungry baby starts to cry  
Born astride a painful grave  
Drowned in hunger's tidal wave  
Pick a child that you can save  
It'd be the only one  
  
If Africa escapes starvation  
Not only food but education  
The desert grows with every minute  
Trapping everybody in it  
All the children look the same  
They wonder why they came  
But it's hard to tell the poison from the cure  
It's harder still to know the reason why, why, why  
The only thing I really know for sure  
Is that another day, another day's gone by  
  
Every day that goes by  
A brand new missile points towards the sky  
We're survivors of a game of chance  
Beneath an arms race avalanche  
If you survive this winter's cold  
You'd be the only one  
  
If we escape annihilation  
Not only hope but education  
The world is ruled by Bellophiles  
Adding to their weapon piles  
Imagine what your taxes buy  
We hardly ever try  
But it's hard to tell the poison from the cure  
It's harder still to know the reason why, why, why  
The only thing I really know for sure  
Is that another day, another day's gone by, bye,bye  
  
That this too solid flesh  
Would melt and resolve into a dew  
Suffocating lassitude  
Drowning in my platitude  
Trapped by insecurities  
I'm not the only one  
If I survive this dislocation  
Have to use my education  
  
Chief of inactivity  
Wasted creativity  
Distances our revolution  
Silence is consent  
But it's hard to tell the poison from the cure  
It's harder still to know the reason why, why, why  
The only thing I really know for sure  
Is that another day, another day's gone by
