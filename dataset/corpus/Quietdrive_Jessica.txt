I never really thought I'd want to know  
I never thought I'd end this stand, but you know  
It's hard for me to just ignore  
Oh, it's just a matter of time  
Before I take your phone and I'll call everyone you know  
So hate me for letting go  
But you'll leave me if I try to stay  
  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me than you'll know  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean more to me  
They mean more to me than you'll know  
  
Are you living a lie, or are you living away?  
Does he know he is only just a place to stay?  
So let's just stop and rewind  
Before I lose my mind  
Before I don't wanna hear you say  
It's the worst of our types that go  
The worst who stay  
  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me than you'll know  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean more to me  
They mean more to me than you'll know  
  
You tear apart my mind  
And make me wonder where you are  
But I still remember everything  
That happened before dawn  
I'm begging you for honesty  
And all you're spitting out are lies  
Do you even have an alibi?  
I don't know, I don't know  
  
(Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica)  
(Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica)  
  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean to more to me  
They mean more to me than you'll know  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, give it up, give it up for Jessica  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me  
You mean more to me than you'll know  
More to me  
You mean more to me than you'll know
