I don't know why you bother  
Nothing's ever good enough for you  
I was there  
And it wasn't like that  
You came here  
Just to start a fight  
  
You had to piss on our parade  
You had to shred our big day  
You had to ruin it for all concerned  
In a drunken punch up at a wedding  
  
Hypocrite opportunist  
Don't infect me with your poison  
A bully in a china shop  
  
When I turn around you stay  
Frozen to the spot  
The pointless snide remarks  
Of hammer headed sharks  
The pot will call the kettle black  
  
It's a drunken punchup at a wedding, yeah
