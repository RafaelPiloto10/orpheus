With Chris Forde  
  
Seeing you again  
Tryin' to pretend  
That I've been fine  
Smilin' all the while  
Hoping you can see behind my smile  
  
Hearing how you laugh  
Knowing what I have and what I've lost  
Trying not to touch  
Trying not to let it show too much  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Were we so right together  
Were the best thing ever  
Never two so strong  
  
Where did we go wrong?  
  
Asking for your friends  
Trying to pretend  
There is someone new  
Wondering of you cared  
Go ahead to face my lonely room  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Weren't we so right together  
Weren't in love forever  
Has it been so long  
Where did we go wrong  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Didn't we belong together  
Weren't we the best thing ever  
Never two so strong  
Where did we go wrong  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Weren't we so right together  
Weren't we in love forever  
Has it been so long  
Where did we go wrong  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Weren't we so right together  
Weren't we in love forever  
Has it been so long  
Where did we go wrong
