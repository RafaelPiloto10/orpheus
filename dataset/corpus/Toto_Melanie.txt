Watching, driving through the night, I'm all alone  
Empty endless road, a thousand miles to go  
Midnight five million thoughts are passing in a row  
Will you still be waiting there God only knows  
  
I can still see your face in my mind, with every turn I take  
The wind through my heart feels so cold, as it calls out your name  
  
Melanie, nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me  
Oh, Melanie, reach inside this emptiness and you can set me free  
  
Morning, sun's in my eyes, I'm tied to your soul  
One chance, one solitary life, how could I let you go  
Got a phone call, or was it a dream, a voice spoke to me  
I could swear it was you that I heard crying desperately  
  
Melanie, nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me  
Oh, Melanie, reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free  
  
I can still see your face in my mind, with every turn I take  
The wind through my heart feels so cold, as it calls out your name  
  
Melanie, nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me  
Oh, Melanie, reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free  
  
Melanie, nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me  
Oh, Melanie, reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free
