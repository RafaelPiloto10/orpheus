This is gonna sound  
A little obsessive  
A little bit strange  
I have one thing to say  
Before I turn and I walk away  
This is gonna sound  
A little impulsive  
This is gonna sound  
A little insane  
I know you don't know me yet  
But you and I  
We will be together  
Someday  
Someday  
  
I know, I know, I sound  
Like I'm on drugs  
But listen to me now  
When I say  
  
That ever since when I first saw you  
Sitting on your car outside  
You asked for a cigarette  
I couldn't stop staring  
At your eyes  
  
Ever since when I first saw you  
Looking bored in that plastic chair  
With the lights of the office  
Around you  
Those blond streaks  
They look so pretty  
In your black hair  
  
You look cool and alternative  
With that disaffected stare  
You want people to think  
That you just don't care  
  
Hey you can be with me  
'cause I just might be the one  
Who will treat you like you're perfect  
Who will always make you come  
  
You can be with me  
I will always let you win  
I will never be like those other guys  
I will never be your  
Unemployed boyfriend  
  
This is gonna sound  
A little bit out there  
This is gonna sound  
A little insane  
But I keep having the same dream  
That you will  
Be the mother of my children  
Someday  
  
Someday  
  
I heard you sleep with that  
Obnoxious guy  
I know he is in that famous band  
You look so sad when you  
Are with him  
I never see him reach  
To hold your hand  
  
You can be with me  
Yes I will treat you like a queen  
I will go to all those  
Chick flick movies  
That I really don't want to see  
  
You can be with me  
No I will never let you down  
I will never make out  
With your girlfriend  
When I know you're not around  
  
You can be with me  
Yeah I just might be the one  
Who will treat you like you're special  
I will always make you come  
  
You can be with me  
I will always let you win  
I will never be like those other guys  
I will never be like those other guys!  
I will never be your  
Unemployed boyfriend
