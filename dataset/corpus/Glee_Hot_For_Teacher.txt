Oh, wow, man,  
Wait a second, man  
What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?  
  
Uh, oh!  
Oh yeah!  
  
T-T-teacher stop that screamin'  
Teacher don't you see?  
Don't wanna be no uptown fool  
Maybe I should go to hell  
But I am doing well  
Teacher needs to see me after school  
  
I think of all the education that I've missed  
But then my homework was never quite like this!  
  
Whoa! Got it bad,  
Got it bad,  
Got it bad,  
I'm hot for teacher!  
I've got it bad, so bad  
I'm hot for teacher!  
  
Hey, I heard you missed us  
We're back!  
I brought my pencil  
Give me something to write on, man!  
Whoa  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I heard about your lessons  
But lessons are so cold  
I know about this school  
Little girl from Cherry Lawn  
How can you be so bold?  
How did you know that golden rule?  
  
I think of all the education that I've missed  
But then my homework was never quite like this!  
  
Whoa! Got it bad,  
Got it bad,  
Got it bad,  
I'm hot for teacher!  
I've got it bad, so bad  
I'm hot for teacher!  
  
Whoa!  
  
Oh, I think the clock is slow man  
What are you doin' this weekend?  
I don't feel tardy  
  
Class dismissed!  
Oh yeah!  
  
I've got it bad,  
Got it bad,  
Got it bad,  
I'm hot for teacher!  
  
Whoa!  
Oh! Oh, yes I'm hot  
Wow!  
  
Whoa!  
Oh! Oh, yes I'm hot  
Wow!  
  
Oh my God!  
Wo!
