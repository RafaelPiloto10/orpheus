Forever and ever!  
  
Shadows grow taller,  
And I'm sleeping on my scars  
Lonely, I hold her  
And crave for your warmth (And it hurts hard)  
  
There's no love,  
No love will be enough  
For what I'm feeling  
No love  
No love will be the end  
Of this dreaming of you  
  
Hell is freezing over  
And the light is long gone  
And I wonder where you are  
  
There's no love  
No love will be enough,  
For what I'm feeling  
No love  
No love will be the end  
Of this dreaming of you  
  
We're the stars  
In the drawing of the flame  
Making love to the rain  
  
There's no love  
No love will be enough,  
For what I'm feeling  
No love  
No love will be the end  
Of this dreaming of you
