Arthur J. did, indicate  
The boulevard will never be  
So full of life and love again - hey  
(Aw, say goodbye to your boots, man)  
  
Hot as Hades, early eighties  
Sing another song  
Make me feel like I'm in love again, hey  
(You gotta lose to win)  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh  
Please don't strip my mind  
Leave something behind  
Please don't strip my mind  
  
All in favor sign the waiver  
Bloody Carolina  
Won't you take another look inside, hey  
(Aw, it will make me cry)  
  
Operator, co-creator  
Come on baby Ellie  
Won't you blow another compensator, hey  
(Ah, you only get what you bring)  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh  
Please don't strip my mind  
Leave something behind  
Please don't strip my mind  
  
El Dorado won the lotto  
All the cash and not a clue  
But now you know what I've been through, hey  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh  
Please don't strip my mind  
Leave something behind  
Please don't strip my mind  
Leave something behind
