(kirsty maccoll)  
She called me up the other day  
And left a message on my machine  
She called to say you broke her heart  
And she'd wondered if I'd seen you  
I didn't know what to do, I never called her back  
Oh how can I break the news like that  
Now I don't want to see caroline  
Don't want to see her face when she finds out you're mine  
Can't look in her eyes and tell her love is blind  
Now I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline  
How can I want you so bad  
She has to lose again  
How could you walk out on her  
And turn to her best friend  
It was wrong from the start  
I wish I'd turned you away  
And my head said go, but my heart, my heart said stay  
And now I don't want to see caroline  
Don't want to see her cry when she knows you're mine  
Can't look in those eyes and tell her she'll be fine  
Now I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline  
I'm so ashamed of myself that I still want you  
What a terrible thing for a friend to do  
I think I've gone too far this time  
I leapt across that thin blue line  
God help this selfish heart of mine  
Now I don't want to see caroline  
I can never face caroline  
Now I lie here with you, can't get her out my head  
Do you think she knows that you share my bed  
Well I don't want to see caroline  
Don't want to see her face when she finds out you're mine  
How could a friend be so unkind  
Well I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline
