I see a pear falling down from the tree  
Winter is coming and it's plain to see  
I spend the cold nights in my lonely room  
Is it the winter to which I am doomed?  
Cold is the snow that will cover the ground  
I feel the presence of tears falling down  
Is it for pity or vain that I cry?  
Color is gone and the grass it must die  
Winter brings sadness that empties my soul  
Life is too short for a dog growing old  
He used to follow and play at my heel  
Love from his heart I no longer can feel
