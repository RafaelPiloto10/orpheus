Just down here said hello, tell me are you trying to get on  
I said "hey, now honey, I don't need your money,"  
Want you to push me around  
You know, I looked you in the eye,  
Said "hey baby show me which way to go "  
What I intend to do don't you make a move I got an interest in you  
Well you know, you know I need,  
Sweet little thing like you  
Well you know, you know I need,  
Sweet little thing like you  
  
Caught me by the arm, held on tight, I said hey what you trying to do  
If I'm gonna make it I'll make it with you I got nothing to lose  
Much too strong need a little help when you can help yourself  
What I intend to do don't you make a move I got an interest in you  
Well you know, you know I need, sweet little thing like you  
Well you know, you know I need, sweet little thing like you  
  
Well you know, you know I need, sweet little thing like you  
Well you know, you know I need, sweet little thing like you
