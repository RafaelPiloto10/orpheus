You made me love you, now I can't say goodbye  
You're way above me, but I'll never know why  
When I turn left and then you turn right  
And you say you're right, and you're wrong  
I know you're wrong  
  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
There wasn't much that I could do  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
I saw the light  
  
You made me like you, and now like you I am  
I try to stay me, but I don't know if I can  
Oh, when I say it's black and you say it's white  
And I say it's black and you're wrong  
I know you're wrong  
  
'Cause I saw the light in you  
There wasn't much that I could do  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
I saw the light  
  
Standing on the platform watching all the trains go past  
Keep on trying to catch one but you know they're much too fast  
I never seem to make it but I know the reason why  
I need to, need to, need to, need to get away  
  
You made me love you, now I can't say goodbye  
You're way above me but I'll never know why  
Oh, when I say it's black and you say it's white  
And I say it's right and you're wrong  
I know you're wrong  
  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
There wasn't much that I could do  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
I saw the light  
Oh, I saw the light with you  
There wasn't much that I could do  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
I saw the light  
Oh, I saw the light in you...
