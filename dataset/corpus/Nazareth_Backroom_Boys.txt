The backroom boys are playin' real hard  
There's a lot of money rollin' on the next card  
Some are goin' up some are goin' down  
Some'll never make it to the next round  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
You gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
  
They got--a room full of women  
A table full of booze  
Gettin' meaner with the dealer--'cause he can't lose  
Someone shouts out,"it's a goddamn shame"  
The dealer's gettin' meaner with the cocaine  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
Gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
Can't stay home get uptown  
Get your ear to the ground  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
  
Up all night, playin' it right  
Backroom boys  
Look in your eye, never say die  
Backroom boys  
  
The backroom boys are all the same  
Even take your money when they play games  
Take you when you're up, kick you when you're down  
You'll always be a loser in their town  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
Gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
Can't stay home get uptown  
Get your ear to the ground  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
  
Up all night, playin' it right  
Backroom boys  
Look in your eye, never say die  
Backroom boys  
  
The backroom boys are all the same  
Even take your money when they play games  
Take you when you're up, kick you when you're down  
You'll always be a loser in their town  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
Gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
Can't stay home get uptown  
Get your ear to the ground  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
Gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
Can't stay home get uptown  
Get your ear to the ground  
If you want to be a backroom boy
