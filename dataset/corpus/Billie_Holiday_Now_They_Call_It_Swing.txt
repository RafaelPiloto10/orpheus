Once they called it ragtime  
And it had its fling  
It's the same old syncopation  
Now they call it swing  
  
Then they played it jazz time  
To a buck-and-wing  
Once again it sweeped the nation  
Now they call it swing  
  
When singers used to sing  
They would go hot cha  
But with this modern thing  
Now they go dru-do do, dra-da-da  
  
Rhythm has its seasons  
Summer, fall and spring  
But for seven silly reasons  
Someone pulled the string  
And they started dancing  
Now they call it swing
