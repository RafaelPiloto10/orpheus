Tell me that you love me  
You say you don't but you don't know  
See you in my dreams  
And you are so fair  
I tried so hard to find you  
But you were never there  
You're my dream girl  
And none can compare  
You're always with me  
In our kingdom far away  
You will be her majesty  
And together we will reign  
You're my dream girl  
It'll always be that way  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah  
Walking into the night  
Just waiting to hear you say  
Everything will be alright  
And I will be okay  
You're my dream girl  
It'll always be that way  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Yeah  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Yeah  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say yeah  
You say you don't want to  
Tell me that you love me  
You say you don't but you don't know  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You're my dream girl  
You'll always be that way  
Wear you down  
you say you don't  
wear you down  
you say you don't  
You say you don't want to tell me  
that you love me  
You say you don't but you don't know  
You'll always be that way  
You'll always be that way  
You'll always be that way
