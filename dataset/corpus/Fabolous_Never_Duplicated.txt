Uh, yes I am often imitated  
But I am never duplicated, yeah  
Yes I am often imitated  
But I am never duplicated  
  
I can't deny it, you's a dick rider  
You can never flow like me, blow like me  
Why would a bitch like ya?  
She can see that I'm a fucking rider, you a hitch hiker  
I'm walking in some shoes, they can't make fit ya  
Got millions of paper that you can't take with ya  
I don't want to talk and I can't take pictures  
Listen to your demo, I'll handshake with ya  
Excuse you, who's you?  
If I need a stunt double I'll use you  
Pardon y'all, I don't want to step on y'all toes  
separate the authentic from the replica flows  
And the kid be places you could never be at  
So that can never be this, and this can never be that  
These niggas got some audacity  
Sell some records as fast as me  
Or sell some tickets out as fast as me  
Motherfucker  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Yes I am often imitated (yes he is often imitated)  
But I am never duplicated (but he is never duplicated)  
  
So all that y'all can do is hate it  
  
None of these wannabes really come close  
I feel like I'm watching the MTV show Christina Milian hosts  
Everybody know this brother got it  
Way before everybody and their mother got it  
They still wonder how he sound like he do  
If I was you, I'd want to sound like me too  
'Cause I got M's, they got G's and they all right  
But they not me  
They hear how I spit it on a station  
Now they want to put me on they singles just to get an imitation  
No, I can't make an appearance  
Give you a cheap fee or break on a clearance  
I'm what your label hoped it could be  
That's why they trying to mould your little ass, into a sculpture of me  
With the ladies it'll be like leader, she like real  
y'all trying to be like me and be like ill  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
So all that y'all can do is hate it  
  
I'm real  
It's the way I talk, the way I walk  
It ain't my fault  
I won't let nothin' on two legs stop me  
'Cause the real is always better than the bootleg copy  
Like I ain't show 'em the white and yellows at the same time  
Throw backs and pin wheels at the same time  
Like I'm scared to drop at the same time  
I'll show you how to do this young'n  
I ain't frontin'  
These Jordan's ain't comin'  
It ain't nothin'  
Keep the complaints comin'  
Can't hop on my bandwagon  
Jump in my blue flames  
You should not try, you are not I  
It's the dude with the Grammy grin  
It's no relation if it ain't a street family kin  
So won't the real Fabolous please stand up  
Please stand up  
Please stand up  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
So all that y'all can do is hate it
