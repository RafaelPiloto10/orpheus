In the name of love and life  
Turn your face to the lonely night  
But you're not alone when she calls you home  
And this your world is on the edge  
As good as lost but you know the way  
Through the faceless town  
And she pulls me down  
  
I know the place and the time (of our lives)  
So long ago  
And all through the years (never dies)  
All things must pass  
  
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and  
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow  
Invisible fingers and indescribable pleasure  
I get to find my personal god  
I get to find my personal god  
  
God of love, god of gold  
Ring of fire in the days of old  
It's what I'm living for and love's the only law  
So answer Mayday, S.O.S.  
Search me North, East, South, or West  
It's all I miss, just the one last kiss  
  
This is goodbye to the days (of our lives)  
My fair-weather friend  
I feel your sorrow and tears (they are mine)  
I share to the end  
  
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and  
Human animal magic  
How far can you go?  
The rolling of thunder and,  
You decide what you're after  
  
I get to find my personal god  
I get to find my personal god  
  
I surrender  
All or nothing  
You must spread your wings and fly  
  
I know the place and the time (of our lives)  
My fair-weather friend  
I feel your sorrow and tears (they are mine)  
We share to the end  
When an irresistible force meets an immovable object  
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow  
There's bound to be heartbreak  
You make it the hard way  
  
I surrender  
All or nothing  
You must spread your wings and fly
