Born alone and left to die  
Rejected, often criticized  
Hid behind the childhood lies  
Everything has changed since the blood  
Since the blood, since the blood  
Oh, the blood  
  
Born alone and left to die  
Rejected, often criticized  
Hid behind the childhood lies  
Everything has changed since the blood  
(Falling on us)  
Since the blood (it gave me purpose)  
Since the blood (it says you're for us)  
Since the blood (who can be against us)  
  
Hopeless fallen from the air  
Reaching but no hand is there  
Screaming, quiet, no one cares  
I might as well have died  
But the blood (falling on us)  
But the blood (it gave me purpose)  
But the blood (it says you're for us)  
Oh, the blood (who can be against us), oh  
  
Oh, the cleansing power  
That takes the guilt away (Jesus)  
The lamb was sacrificed now we  
No longer fear the grave (yes, Jesus)  
No more condemnation (hallelujah)  
The debt of man is paid  
  
By the blood (by the blood)  
But for the blood  
By the blood (by the blood)  
But for the blood  
  
Now we are never alone (your)  
Your blood, it makes us strong (now)  
Now there is power to move on (we are)  
Never, we are never alone  
  
Now we are never alone  
Your blood, it makes us strong  
Now there is power to move on  
Never, we are never alone
