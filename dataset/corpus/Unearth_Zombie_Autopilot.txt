It was last night on the midnight train back home  
I ran into this one yet unfamiliar tone I know I should have known  
It was last night I knew I should have known  
Chaos  
  
Our busy minds asleep  
We drudge across the land  
Is this the coming of our monarchy harmless  
We meet increased demands  
Is this the life we had in our dreams  
Our eternal nightmare all of us are blind to others  
Hide behind our plans to nothing  
Cage us  
  
We weep in self defeat  
All humanity is lost  
In this eternal nightmare  
All days are lost to conditioned zones  
All days are lost to what we know free us  
  
A piece of mind  
Gone are dreamers who strive to know  
All of us are blind
