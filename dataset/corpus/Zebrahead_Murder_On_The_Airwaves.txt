Broken words into thirds like a syllable  
Bullshit runs, 'cause if it walks, then it's killable  
Poison tongue on my lung licking everything  
Unsung kick drum kick, kick, killing me  
  
Well nothing can go wrong?  
Yeah so come and get it on  
Audio explosion  
And you drop it like a bomb  
Lying through your teeth  
Smoking TNT  
Talk is cheap  
Burn your bridges easily  
  
Wake up, wake up, wake up!  
Don't blow it!  
They're gonna eat you alive  
You can't control it!  
Wake up, wake up, wake up!  
Don't blow it!  
They're gonna eat you alive  
Ya know it!  
  
Murder on the airwaves  
Can't stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
Stab me in the back  
Right in front of me  
Murder on the airwaves  
Can't stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
There's no going back  
When you are dead to me  
  
Suffer ya sucker, your shifty eyes selling me  
Dumb motherfucker used to scream the songs that ya scream  
Glass in my eye from my life left shattered  
Bruises and excuses like nothing ever mattered  
  
Well nothing can go wrong?  
Yeah so come and get it on  
Light it up like dynamite  
And drop it like a bomb  
Lying and deceit  
Finger on repeat  
Talk is cheap  
Burn your bridges easily  
  
Wake up, wake up, wake up!  
Don't blow it!  
They're gonna eat you alive  
You can't control it!  
Wake up, wake up, wake up!  
Don't blow it!  
They're gonna eat you alive  
Ya know it!  
  
Murder on the airwaves  
Can't stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
Stab me in the back  
Right in front of me  
Murder on the airwaves  
Can't stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
There's no going back  
When you are dead to me  
  
Wake up, wake up, wake up!  
Don't blow it!  
They're gonna eat you alive  
You can't control it!  
Wake up, wake up, wake up!  
Don't blow it!  
They're gonna eat you alive  
Ya know it!  
  
Murder on the airwaves  
Can't stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
Stab me in the back  
Right in front of me  
Murder on the airwaves  
Can't stop the chaos  
Murder on the airwaves  
A rapid blood loss  
There's no going back  
When you are dead to me
