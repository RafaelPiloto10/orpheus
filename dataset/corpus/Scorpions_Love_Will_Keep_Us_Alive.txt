When I look at you  
I can see the sadness in your eyes  
In these desperate times  
We get pushed and shoved from every side  
  
I can't love you if you won't let me  
Can't touch me if you don't try  
I can feel you  
I know that you're ready to take it to the other side  
  
Love will keep us alive  
Let's make the moment right  
It's now or never  
Love will keep us alive  
Even the darkest night  
Will shine forever  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love, love will keep us alive  
  
When you walk away  
There's an empty feeling in my mind  
As the days go by  
We get caught up in our separate lives  
  
If you need me  
You know I'll come running  
Right to you  
Just give me a sign  
I won't leave you  
We'll make it together  
And take it to the end of time  
  
Love will keep us alive  
Let's make the moment right  
It's now or never  
Love will keep us alive  
Even the darkest night  
Will shine forever  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love, love will keep us alive  
  
Oh, I've got a lot of loving to show you  
You know I'd never want to control you  
I only want to be by your side  
  
I can't love you if you won't let me  
Can't touch me if you don't try  
I can feel you  
I know that you're ready to take it to the other side  
  
Love will keep us alive  
Let's make the moment right  
It's now or never  
Love will keep us alive  
Even the darkest night  
Will shine forever  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love, love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Alive  
Love will keep us alive
