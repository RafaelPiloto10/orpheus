I want to be in another place,  
I hate when you say you don't understand,  
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.  
  
I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night,  
Shining with the light from the sun,  
The sun doesn't give light to the moon,  
Assuming the moons gonna owe it one,  
And makes think of how you act to me, you do favors that rapidly,  
You just turn around and start asking me about things you want back from me,  
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this,  
Find another place to feed your greed,  
While I find a place to rest, I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this, find another place to feed your greed,  
While I find a place to rest.  
  
I want to be in another place, I hate when you say you don't understand,  
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.  
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to  
  
Two Two Three Three Ya Ya Ya  
Gimme energon to keep me calm  
You and your mom keep on the drom  
Used to be a team, passed that baton  
But you flop that bod as you drop that bomb  
Take it to the john in your babylon  
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on.  
I don't really give a dang you pissed on my lawn  
Took a dump like a punk now the battles on.  
  
So sick of you stressin'  
Sick of you fessin'  
Sick of you actin' like I owe you some  
Find another place to feed your face  
If you don't we gonna bump, get it up, get crunk.

I want to be in another place, I hate when you say you don't understand,  
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.  
You try to get the best of me, go away, go away, go away,  
you try to take the best of me, go away (repeat to end)
