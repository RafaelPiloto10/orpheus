If you're thinkin' you're too cool to boogie  
Boy oh boy have I got news for you  
Everybody here tonight must boogie  
Let me tell ya, you are no exception to the rule  
  
Get on up, on the floor  
'Cause were gonna boogie oogie oogie  
Till you just can't boogie no more  
Ah boogie, boogie no more  
You can't boogie no more  
Ah boogie, boogie no more  
Listen to the music  
  
There's no time to waste let's get the show on the road  
Listen to the music and let your body flow  
The sooner we break down the longer we got to groove  
Listen to the music and let your body move  
  
Now get on up, on the floor  
'Cause were gonna boogie oogie oogie  
Till you just can't boogie no more  
Ah boogie, boogie no more  
You can't boogie no more  
Ah boogie, boogie no more  
Listen to the music  
  
Get down boogie oogie oogie  
Get down boogie oogie oogie  
Get down boogie oogie oogie  
Get down boogie oogie oogie
