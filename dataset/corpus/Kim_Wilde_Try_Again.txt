I can't see your face  
Hear the excuses for  
The mistakes that you make  
I've heard all your lies  
I don't know how much I can take  
Before I break  
I've tried to be so strong  
While you broke the promises  
All the vows that we made  
We know something's wrong  
But we carry on anyway  
Day by day  
You're the one who let me down  
And now I find it hard to forgive  
In my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
But I'll try again  
To forget all the pain  
And love you again  
I'll try again  
Though you hurt me I know  
I can't let you go  
  
How can we forget  
The sweetness of yesterday  
We just can't let it go  
Lost in bitterness  
I'm losing my self control  
And my soul  
Cause you'll be the one who let me down  
And now I find it hard to forgive  
In my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh why, why do we hurt each other more  
When there's a way  
Cause we never really found  
What we were looking for  
Can we try again  
  
Cause you're the one who let me down  
And now I find it hard to forgive  
In my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, I'll try again
