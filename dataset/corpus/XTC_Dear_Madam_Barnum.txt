I put on a fake smile  
And start the evening show  
The public is laughing  
I guess by now they know  
So climb from your high horse  
And pull this freak show down  
Dear Madam Barnum  
I resign as clown  
You said I was the master of all I surveyed  
But now I'm sweeping up  
The last in line in your circus parade  
Children are clapping  
As I fall to the floor  
My heart torn and broken  
And they just scream for more  
If I'm not the sole fool  
Who pulls his trousers down  
Then dear Madam Barnum  
I resign as clown  
You tread the high wire  
Between truth and lies  
Your safety net just walked out  
Much to your surprise  
Strike up the band love  
And let the show begin  
For this is the last time  
I'm painting on a grin  
If I'm not the sole fool  
Who pulls his trousers down  
Then dear Madam Barnum  
I resign as clown
