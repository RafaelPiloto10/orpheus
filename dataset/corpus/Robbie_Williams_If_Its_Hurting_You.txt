Please don't think of me  
If you do gotta block it  
I got chills tonight  
And you can't be here to stop it  
I'm not a parasite  
It's just a lonely night  
Tonight  
  
I walked from the bar  
'Cause they were only laughing  
I wished our our star  
But they covered it in satin  
I'm not a gigalo  
That's what I want you to know  
Tonight  
  
Ooh Ooh  
I'm hurt you I can see  
Ooh Ooh  
Do you think it's not hurting me  
  
Ooh Ooh  
The grass ain't always green  
And it's hurting you  
You know that it's hurting me  
You know that it's hurting me  
  
You'll meet other men  
Who will break your heart  
If I see you with them  
It's gonna tear me apart  
  
Maybe in another life  
We wouldn't be alone  
Tonight  
  
Ooh Ooh  
I've hurt you I can see  
Ooh Ooh  
Do you think it's not hurting me  
  
Ooh Ooh  
The grass ain't always green  
And if it's hurting you  
You know that it's hurting me  
You know that it's hurting me  
You know that it's hurting me  
You know that it's hurting me
