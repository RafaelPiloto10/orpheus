I walk along the road and past your door  
Then I remember things you said  
I know in time we could've been so much more  
But if you wanna come back home, go right ahead  
But I don't believe in miracles  
I don't believe in miracles  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are  
I believe I was your game, your ball (your ball)  
If you tossed me up then I would fall  
And so you've won again, ah, you win them all  
But I believe I'd run to you, if you should call  
But I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are (tell me where you are)  
I believe that somewhere there's someone  
Who's gonna light the way when things go wrong  
The bullet that shot me down came from your gun  
The words that turned me round were from your song  
But I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are (tell me where you are)  
But I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are
