Don't you leave me Father Time  
Take me with you  
Tell me does your sun still shine  
Come squeeze the world and drip it down my throat...oh yeah  
Down my throat again...woooah  
  
You got to breathe man, breathe!  
Coming up for air  
Breathe man, breathe!  
Coming up for air  
  
Touch me so I think I'm here  
Skin my senses  
Barely breathing  
Minus human  
Please squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again  
Down my throat again...woooah  
  
You got to breathe man, breathe!  
Coming up for air  
Breathe man, breathe!  
Coming up for air  
  
You got to breathe man, breathe!  
Coming up for air  
Breathe man, breathe!  
Coming up for!
