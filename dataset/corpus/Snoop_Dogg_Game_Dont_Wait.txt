Cheese and please and the reason the season  
The click's off the heezy, Mr. Warren G Z  
Gots to make it easy, for Snoop D Z  
They come back, and drop raps and make snaps so easy  
The most hunted, and most wanted  
With a pocket full of hundreds, you know how we run it  
  
Snoop D woop pass the M-I-C  
Anticipation 213  
We contemplate, and regulate  
Now we got the game tight, its money to make (money, money, money)  
The game wont wait but you can wait for the game  
Worldwide tour, with skirts screamin our name  
  
The hits dont stop because the game wont change

The hits dont stop because the game dont wait  
I got no time for no payin much rate  
I gotta go out and buy some brand new clothes

The hits dont stop because the game dont wait  
And the girls dont stop because the dick is straight
