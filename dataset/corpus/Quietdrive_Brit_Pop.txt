Anything goes on in your trip  
Did you happen to plan on selling out  
All your fake and original riffs  
Did you happen to think  
That they're true  
And it's all  
That I have  
And I feel  
Like I'm busting  
My ass  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is there anybody?  
(True that it's gone)  
Can't someone stop me?  
(It's taking too long)  
It's running through my body  
(Finding a sound)  
And we're sitting on it  
(Just get off the ground)  
Can you feel it, honey  
(Coming around)  
Yeah, I've  
Been there before  
  
How did I start off with this gig  
Did I think I would make some money, yeah  
Getting away with all this shit  
Some people might even think  
That it's me  
On the drums  
On the bass  
Filling in  
My guitar  
In your face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is there anybody?  
(Taking my time)  
Can't someone stop me?  
(Reading the signs)  
It's running through my body  
(Driving to go)  
And we're sitting on it  
(With all that we know)  
Can you feel it, honey  
(We're coming around)  
Yeah, I've  
Been there before  
  
And didn't you say it'd make you happy?  
Well are you happier right now?  
Why do we sing to make you happy?  
Well are you happier right now?  
'Cause didn't you say?  
Didn't you say?  
Didn't you say?  
Didn't you say?  
Didn't you say?  
It'd make you happy?  
  
[Chorus]
