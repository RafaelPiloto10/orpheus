I thought for the rest of my life  
You'd see me through it  
Guess, all along I knew it  
Nothing mattered, everything was all right  
When you saw to it  
Before I knew it you were gone, long gone  
You said, you would always be there  
When I believed you  
I was a fool to need you  
Gave my love then I gave you my heart  
And then you flew it  
Before I knew it you were gone, long gone  
Hard facing another day  
Just crying the night away  
Said more than I meant to say  
When I knew that you were gone  
Hard facing another day  
Just crying the night away  
Said more than I meant to say  
When I knew that you were gone  
Hard facing another day  
Just crying the night away  
Said more than I meant to say  
When I knew that you were gone  
Hard facing another day  
Just crying the night away  
Said more than I meant to say  
When I knew that you were gone  
I thought for the rest of my life  
You'd see me through it  
Yes, all along I knew it  
Didn't matter and it didn't seem right  
And then you flew it  
Before I knew it  
You were gone, long gone  
Gone long gone  
You were gone, long gone
