Listen to the tales and romanticize,  
How we follow the path of the hero.  
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun.  
How we rise to the height of our halo.  
  
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,  
Our way into the arms of the savior.  
Fading all the trials and the tribulations,  
None of us have actually been there.  
Not like you.  
  
Ignorant fibbers in the congregation.  
Gather around spewing sympathy.  
Spare me  
None of them can even hold a candle up to you,  
Blinded by choices hypocrites won't see.  
  
But enough about the collective Judas  
Who could deny you were the one who illuminated.  
Your little piece of the divine.  
  
This little light of mine,  
The gift you passed onto me.  
I'll let it shine,  
To guide you safely on your way.  
Your way home.  
  
What are they going to do when the lights go down?  
Without you to guide them all to Zion?  
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun?  
Other than tremble incessantly.  
  
High is the way, but our eyes are upon the ground  
You were the light and the way that they'll only read about.  
I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out.  
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough.  
You're going home.  
  
You're the only one who can hold your head up high.  
  
Shake your fist at the gates saying:  
I have come home now.  
Fetch me the spirit.  
The son, and the father.  
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.  
It's time now, my time now.  
Give me my, give me my, wings.  
  
Give me my,  
Give me my wings.  
  
You are the light, a way.  
That they will only read about.  
  
Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.  
Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers.  
You were my witness.  
My eyes, my evidence.  
Judith Marie, unconditional one.  
  
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.  
Difficult to see you in this light.  
Please forgive this bold suggestion  
Should you see your maker's face tonight.  
Look him in the eye  
Look him in the eye, and tell him.  
I never lived a lie, never took a life.  
But surely saved one, hallelujah.  
It's time for you to bring me home.
