What am I gonna do now that you're gone?  
What am I gonna do now that you're gone?  
Looking back how I wish I had told you what was on my mind  
Looking back, wish I had, said what was on my mind  
Reason away, reason away, I can't reason away my pain  
I cannot ease my pain  
  
What am I gonna do now that you're gone?  
What am I gonna do now that you're gone?  
I turn out the lights and I'm alone  
You're not coming home  
I miss your skin on my skin  
  
This feeling I know can't be compared  
Nothing can replace  
The feel of your skin on my skin  
I'm mystified, don't know how I let you slip away  
Mystified, don't know how I let you slip away  
Come back baby, come back is all that I can say  
  
Come back baby is all I can say  
I turn out the lights and I'm alone  
You're not coming home  
I miss your skin on my skin  
This feeling I know can't be compared  
Nothing can replace  
  
The feel of your skin on my skin  
Missin', I'm missin'  
the feel of your skin  
Missin', I'm missin', missin'  
On my skin  
Missin', I'm missin',  
Missin', I'm missin', missin'
