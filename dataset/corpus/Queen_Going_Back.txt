I think I'm going back  
To the things I learnt so well in my youth  
I think I'm returning to  
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth  
Now, there are no games  
To only pass the time  
No more colouring books  
No Christmas bells to chime  
But thinking young and growing older is no sin  
And I can't play the game of life to win  
I can recall a time  
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend  
And, now, I think I've got  
A lot more than just my toys to lend  
Now there's more to do  
Than watch my sailboat glide  
And every day can be  
My magic carpet ride  
And I can play hide and seek with my fears  
And live my days instead of counting my years  
Then everyone debates  
The true reality  
I'd rather see the world  
The way it used to be  
A little bit of freedom's all we lack  
So catch me if you can  
I'm going back
