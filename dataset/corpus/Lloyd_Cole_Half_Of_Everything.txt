You walk in my house with her lipstick over your face  
You tell me you got news for me  
Well, do you think I can't see straight?  
Do you think I can't recognize her perfume on your clothes  
You tell me you got news for me  
Well, I don't need to be told  
Let me guess, she's looking for a little peace of mind  
I don't want to cause any more pain  
But could I please have what's mine?  
She's got such a pretty please  
I never could say no  
Well just take her half of everything, and then please go  
Now I know right now you're thinking  
I'm some crazy kind of fool  
But the truth of the matter is I'm just like you  
She's some kind of voodoo woman  
She said she can't use me anymore  
That's what she said to me  
She said, I can't use you anymore  
I don't need your lovin'  
I don't need your kissin'  
I don't need for you to tell me  
All that I've been missin'  
I don't need your lovin'  
I don't need your kissin'  
I don't need for you to tear me down  
And tear me down again  
Every time you give a little more  
She could still use a little more  
Every time you give a little more  
She could still use a little more  
And when you can't give a little more  
She could still use a little more  
She could still use a little more  
She could still use a little more  
Tell her that she done me  
That she done me good  
Tell her that she done me  
Like a lady should  
I never ever seen her, and I hope I never do  
I might have to show her just what love can do  
The sun ain't gonna shine, and the rain is gonna fall  
'Cause I put a spell on you  
And all the years I cried  
All the years that I tried  
To save a stillborn love  
I know what you're thinking  
Pretty soon, I'll howl at the moon  
But you better believe me  
'Cause I was just like you  
Mister, read the writing on the wall  
Get out while you're still whole  
While you're still breathing  
I don't need your lovin'  
(I don't need your lovin')  
Kissin'  
(I don't need your kissin')  
Lovin', no I don't need  
Tear me down again  
(I don't need your lovin')  
Mmm, lovin'  
(I don't need your kissin')  
Mmm, kissin', and I don't need  
Tear me down again  
(I don't need your lovin')  
Yeah  
(I don't need your kissin')  
No, I don't need her to tear me down again
