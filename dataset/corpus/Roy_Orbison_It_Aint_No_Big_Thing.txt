You tell me to find somebody new.  
That you're not for me I'm not for you.  
It don't matter if you're right or wrong.  
It ain't not big thing just say "so long"  
  
It's been fun and laughter all the way.  
I will live to love another day.  
I will be alright can't you tell?.  
It ain't not big thing just say "farewell"  
  
It ain't not big thing I won't be blue.  
Just so you're happy and your dreams come true.  
It ain't not big thing my losing you.  
Just ain't no big thing, I'll get over you.  
  
It ain't not big thing to see you go.  
It ain't not big thing that you don't know.  
It ain't not big thing I've been lying.  
It ain't not big thing that I'm crying.  
It ain't not big thing that I'm dying
