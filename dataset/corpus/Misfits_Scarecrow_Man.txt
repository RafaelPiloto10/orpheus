How 'bout a little fire scarecrow?  
  
Hangin' in a field you'll never know I'm out here  
I'm telling you people best beware  
I creep into town, I'm hunting my prey  
Back on my post by the crack of day  
  
Lock your doors, watch your back, it's true  
Turn around how do you do  
I'm the scarecrow man, I'm the scarecrow man  
  
People dying every night  
Mutilations a terrible site  
Look 'round the victims really hard  
Scarecrow's death straw calling card  
  
And I'm coming and killing it's true  
Turn around how do you do  
I'm the scarecrow man, I'm the scarecrow man  
scarecrow man, scarecrow man  
  
I'm the scarecrow man  
I'm the scarecrow man  
  
Hangin' in a field you'll never know I'm out here  
I'm telling you people best beware  
I creep into town, I'm hunting my prey  
Back on my post by the crack of day  
  
I've come to kill you, I will  
I'm gonna eat you be still  
I'm the scarecrow man
