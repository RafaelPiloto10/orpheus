Hey yeah  
  
That's the way I like it  
  
Somebody told me that you're not my kind  
So have I lost my mind?  
You keep on doing all the things I like  
You've got me hypnotized  
But that's the way I like it  
  
Girl you make me wanna move  
It's the price I got to pay  
For all the things you do  
But I like it  
Gotta listen to the groove  
And you gotta listen well  
The way you do it  
That's the way I like it  
  
Everybody now  
I like it  
Everybody now  
That's the way I like it  
Everybody come on  
I like it  
Everybody come on  
That's the way I like it  
  
Oh mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like  
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)  
You're dangerous, oh baby  
Could you do me right?  
Will you come out to play?  
Cause that's the way I like it  
  
Gotta listen to the groove  
And you gotta listen well  
The way you do it  
That's the way I like it  
  
Everybody now  
I like it  
Everybody now  
That's the way I like it  
Everybody come on  
I like it  
Everybody come on  
That's the way I like it  
  
Everybody come on  
I like it  
Everybody come on  
  
Gotta listen to the groove  
And you gotta listen well  
The way you do it  
That's the way I like it  
Hey yeah  
  
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it [Repeat: x3]  
Everybody now, everybody now  
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it  
Everybody come on, everybody come on  
That's the way I like it  
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it  
Everybody now, everybody now  
That's the way I like it  
That's the way that I like it, that is the way I like it  
Everybody come on, everybody come on  
That's the way I like it
