Let's be undecided, let's take our time  
And sooner or later, we will know our mind  
We'll be on the outside, we won't care  
Cause we're together, that's somewhere  
And there's a big day coming, about a mile away  
There's a big day coming, I can hardly wait  
Let's wake up the neighbors, let's turn up our amps  
And we know we're used to without a plan  
We can play a Stones song, sitting on a fence  
And it'll sound pretty good, til I forget how it ends  
I woke up early, couldn't go back to sleep  
Cause I had been thinking of where it all would lead  
So I made you wake up, I said, "Let's take a walk,  
I wanna hold your hand, we don't have to talk"
