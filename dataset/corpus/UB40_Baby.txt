Baby be true and I'll give my love to you,  
I need you baby.  
Treat me right and I'll love you day and night,  
I mean it baby.  
  
When you're down I'll be around,  
To guide you baby.  
When you're free just call on me, baby.  
I'll give my heart to you , now babe.  
I'll do what you ask me too, now babe.  
I mean it baby.  
  
  
I'm gonna treat you, treat you right  
I'm gonna love you day and night  
I'm gonna give my heart away  
I'm gonna love you night and day  
Baby, baby.
