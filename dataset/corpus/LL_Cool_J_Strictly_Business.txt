Back in the days I made up my mind  
That I would be a king, you know, genuine  
Reign supreme at the top of the heap  
And like working all day, no time to sleep  
Destined to rise, in front of your eyes  
So we surmise, it's time for the prize  
The time has come, we gotta be number one  
The world is full of power and we got to get some  
No more beggin' and useless teardrops  
So I'm trading these teardrops for props  
Goin' all the way and with my powerful team  
Conquering the world and I'ma rise like cream  
All out, putting heads to bed  
'Cause I'm a grown man and I hate to get spoon-fed  
Wisdom, son, I rose in the east  
Till we reach the top, won't be no peace, 'cause it's  
  
[Chorus:]  
Strictly business, strictly business  
Ain't no way I'm gonna stop  
Strictly business, ain't no time to get more  
Gotta make it to the top  
  
Everything we do, gotta be brand new  
The moves we make, gotta make the earth shake  
Sitting at my desk, 'cause I manifest to my team  
Big plans that'll make us the best  
'Cause we can rule this game we all play  
Pop champagne and make everyday a holiday  
Smooth as a rose but hard like steel  
From now on, I'ma make my dreams real  
On a mission, gotta get there  
If you want to rule, you gotta be in there  
Our masterplan is the best  
And ain't a man alive that'll beat us to a conquest  
'Cause this is the reason we was born  
To rock on and on and on and on  
Look at my eyes, it's hypnotizing  
Word is bond, we gotta keep on rising  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'ma be a legend in all the books and mags  
Stuffin' the cash inside garbage bags  
Ain't no time to waste, we gotta motivate  
Pass anybody that stops to get gas  
Forever and a day, my destiny's set  
No sweat, I make it rougher than rougher gets  
Hold on tight, if not, get blown away  
Pick up the pieces 'cause we're known to say  
Radical things to get a champion's ring  
Give it up, punk, don't make me swing  
We planned ahead to get the butter and the bread  
Dressed in black and I'm stayin' out the red  
So when it comes to like taking charge  
Get props for where they do and stop frontin' on tar  
Gotta go for what you know to be the cream of the crop  
With the power of God, I'ma rise to the top, it's  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Uncle L (uhh!) (repeat 16X)
