His pulpit's a corner at 19th and Main  
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame  
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by  
He offers salvation from the savior on high  
  
His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks  
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks  
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold  
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold  
  
He points to the Bible he holds in his hand  
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man  
  
Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear  
Material possessions won't matter up there  
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing  
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king  
  
He's fightin' a fever, in spite of the chills  
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will  
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong  
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on  
  
'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more  
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore  
  
Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear  
Material possessions won't matter up there  
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing  
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king
