Tonight, I waited but my heart is so cold  
'Cause you never stay more than a minute, so I'm told  
I know you're just doing your job  
But what am I supposed to do?  
When all I want for Christmas, darling, is to be with you  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking, yeah  
I'm not asking for a miracle, just a night  
And if you just look in my eyes, you just might  
There'll be no other woman who'll treat you like I can  
(Come on over here)  
I'll be your loving, darling, you'll be my loving man  
Oh, I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking  
(Keep on walking)  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
You just keep on walking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby
