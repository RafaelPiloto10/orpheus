We're a death-marching band  
Peter Pan off the wagon  
Entertain but never trust anyone sober  
We're tasteless but taste good  
My (S)top Hat's top hat(ed)  
Unsafe cheerleaders with  
Porn poms and pipe bombs  
I won't do it with you  
I'll do it to you  
I hope this hook gets caught in your mouth  
I won't do it with you  
I'll do it to you  
Don't Say No  
Just Say Now  
I like a big car, cause  
I'm a big star  
I make a big rock and roll hits  
I'd like to love you  
but my heart is a sore  
I am, I am, I am so yours  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
I'd like to la la la la love you  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
I'd like to la la la la love you  
I'm the leader of the club  
And I've shrugged off my mouse ears  
We fly No-Class Dumbo jets  
And drive harcore-vettes  
We fight war with drugs  
And our sex always formal  
We wear lawsuits when  
We get high high high  
  
I won't do it with you  
I'll do it to you  
I hope this hook gets caught in your mouth  
I won't do it with you  
I'll do it to you  
Don't Say No  
Just Say Now  
I like a big car, cause  
I'm a big star  
I make a big rock and roll hits  
I'd like to love you  
but my heart is a sore  
I am, I am, I am so yours  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
I'd like to la la la la love you  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
I'd like to la la la la love you  
"Inhale, exhale, let's all hail"  
It's a depraved new world  
"Inhale, exhale, let's all hail"  
It's a depraved new world  
After all  
I like a big car, cause  
I'm a big star  
I make a big rock and roll hits  
I'd like to love you  
but my heart is a sore  
I am, I am, I am so yours  
I am a big car and  
I'm a strip bar  
You call it fake,  
I call it, "good as it gets."  
Nothing in this world is for real  
Except you are for me and  
I am so yours  
Ka-boom ka-boom
