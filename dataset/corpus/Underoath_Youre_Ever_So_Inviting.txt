The time has come for you  
To sit this out  
To fit inside your mold  
And would be to sell myself short  
  
This ground we tread upon  
Is now filling up our necks  
We turn the pages left to right  
We see everything  
  
Oh, my story's growing, it is  
On my last request  
Don't make me feel so contradicting  
There's no room for cheating and being  
Yourself  
  
Failure leaves such a bitter taste in their  
Mouth  
  
And on the last hour  
We write so many new chapters again  
And on the outside  
Wehre there are no surprises  
  
Oh, it's getting longer  
To see it through their eyes  
Would bring me so much closer  
You can do this night after night  
Failure leaves such a bitter taste in my  
Mouth  
  
Taste and see, I swear I know what's good  
Be still and know that they won't lie to you  
Every single time you're facing lies  
I know why you never take your eyes off me  
I've used my lungs for everything but  
Breathing  
  
I find myself dried up in this conversation  
So pull me out, pull me aside
