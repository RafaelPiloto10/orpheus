People get ready  
There's a train a-coming  
You don't need no baggage  
You just get on board  
All you need is faith  
To hear the diesels humming  
Don't need no ticket  
You just thank the Lord  
  
People get ready  
For the train to Jordan  
Picking up passengers  
From coast to coast  
Faith is the key  
Open the doors and board them  
There's room for all  
Among the loved the most  
  
There ain't no room  
For the hopeless sinner  
Who would hurt all mankind just  
To save his own  
Have pity on those  
Whose chances are thinner  
Cause there's no hiding place  
From the Kingdom's Throne  
  
So people get ready  
For the train a-comin'  
You don't need no baggage  
You just get on board  
All you need is faith  
To hear the diesels humming  
Don't need no ticket  
You just thank, you just thank the Lord  
  
Yeah  
Oh  
Yeah  
Oh  
  
I'm getting ready  
I'm getting ready  
This time I'm ready  
This time I'm ready
