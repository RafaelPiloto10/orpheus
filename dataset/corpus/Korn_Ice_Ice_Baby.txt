All right stop  
Collaborate and listen  
Ice is back, I got a brand new invention  
Something grabs a hold of me tightly  
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly  
Will it ever stop?  
Yo--I don't know  
Turn off the lights and I'll glow  
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal  
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.  
  
Too cold, Too cold (x3) Too cold  
  
Don't you be talkin that shit (x6)  
  
Dance  
Bum rush the speaker that booms  
I'm killin your brain like a poisonous mushroom  
Deadly, when I play a dope melody  
Anything less that the best is a felony  
Love it or leave it  
You better gain way  
You better hit bull's eye  
The kid don't play  
If there was a problem  
Yo, I'll solve it  
Check out the hook while my dj revolves it  
  
Ice Ice Baby (4X)  
  
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet  
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it  
My town, that created all the bass sound  
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground  
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill  
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel  
Conducted and formed  
This is a hell of a concept  
We make it hype and you want to step with this  
Dj plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja  
Cut like a razor blade so fast  
Other dj's say, "Damn"  
If my rhyme was a drug  
I'd sell it by the gram  
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose  
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice  
If there was a problem  
Yo--I'll solve it!  
Check out the hook while dj revolves it.  
  
Ice Ice Baby (x4)  
  
Too fuckin cold  
  
Ice Ice baby Too Cold Too cold  
Ice Ice baby Too Cold Too cold  
Ice Ice baby too cold too cold  
Ice Ice Baby too cold too cold
