Well I see you in the morning  
Putting on your pretty clothes  
And I watch you do your make-up  
Like they do in all those fashion shows  
Then you turn to me so that I can see  
If you put yourself together right  
Then you go away and you're gone all day  
But I know you're coming home tonight  
And when you're home,  
Darling all you've got to be is you  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
Well it's alright if you're tired  
When your day is done  
You can see when you look at me,  
You're not the only one  
It's a cold, cruel world for a working girl  
But you can't let them see you cry  
It's a fact of life, now man and wife  
Work full time to just get by  
And when we're home all  
It's gonna be is me and you  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
I've done some strange things I  
Never thought I'd do before  
But if the strain brings happiness,  
More or less.  
More or less.  
  
Then I don't mind masquerading  
With all those other fools  
I don't mind the games I'm playing,  
Because I've learned the rules  
And when times are tough, I've got just enough  
If you're standing right by my side  
Darling more and more I get hungry for  
All the ways you keep me satisfied  
On our own there ain't nothing  
That we can't get through  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
Then I don't mind masquerading with all those other fools  
I don't mind the games I'm playing,  
Because I've learned the rules  
It doesn't matter when we're home, all alone  
All we've got to be is me and you  
On our own there ain't nothing  
That we can't get through  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
Swing that hammer and break that stone  
Push those buttons and answer that phone  
Coffee in the morning and martinis at night  
Everybody's working up a big appetite  
Do as the Romans do.
