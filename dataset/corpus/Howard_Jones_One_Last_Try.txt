Give me one last try  
Hold on for me  
Believe my alibi  
Keep strong  
Don't set me free  
Well this weakness makes me wrong  
I'll show you I can be strong  
And this time it is for real  
I know the hurt I've made you feel  
But I won't let you down  
No one else would have me 'round  
You gave your love so honestly  
Is heaven's grace too good for me  
I know I've pushed my luck  
So many times  
I'm slippin' slowly now  
Loosin' track, of my mind  
Well this shadow I've become  
Will step out to meet the sun  
And this time it is for real  
I know the hurt I've made you feel  
But I won't let you down  
No one else would have me 'round  
You gave your love so honestly  
Is heaven's grace too good for me  
And when the darkness comes  
And I lose sight,  
Of the precious world  
That you put right  
You've the strength to pull me through  
One last try I'm asking you  
And this time it is for real  
I know the hurt I've made you feel  
But I won't let you down  
No one else would have me 'round  
You gave your love so honestly  
Is heaven's grace too good for me
