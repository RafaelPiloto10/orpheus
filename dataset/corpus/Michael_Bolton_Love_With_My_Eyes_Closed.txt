I close my eyes  
And now I pray,  
That you are out there  
Doing the same  
Long for the touch  
It stands alone  
It needs no vision  
To find its home  
  
I've seen beauty in the mountains  
I've seen rivers meet the sea  
I've seen light above the horizon  
Shining down all over me  
I've seen beggars turn to rich men  
Seen the birth of my own child  
  
I don't wanna find this feeling  
Just to let it go  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
Wanna feel you inside my soul  
Want your warm body next to me  
So I can feel what my heart knows  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
  
Deep in my mind  
I touch your skin  
The risk of emotions  
In life so thin  
And will you love me  
When I am old  
When I'm no longer  
Strong to hold  
  
I've seen beauty in the mountains  
I've seen rivers meet the sea  
I've seen light above the horizon  
Shining down all over me  
I've seen beggars turn to rich men  
Seen the birth of my own child  
  
I don't wanna find this feeling  
Just to let it go  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
Wanna feel you inside my soul  
Want your warm body next to me  
So I can feel what my heart knows  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
Wanna live in the afterglow  
Wanna trust then I can believe  
Everything that my heart knows  
Wanna love with my eyes closed, yeah  
  
I don't wanna find this feeling  
Just to let it go  
  
I wanna love with my eyes closed, yeah  
I want your warm body next to me  
So I can feel what my heart knows  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
Wanna live in the afterglow  
Wanna trust then I can believe  
Everything that my heart knows  
Wanna love with my eyes closed  
  
I've seen beauty in the mountains  
I've seen rivers meet the sea  
I've seen light above the horizon  
Shining down all over me  
I've seen beggars turn to rich men  
Seen the birth of my own child  
  
I don't wanna find this feeling  
Just to let it go  
  
Wanna love with my eyes closed
