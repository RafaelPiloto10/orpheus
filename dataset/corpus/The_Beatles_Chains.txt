Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,  
And they ain't the kind, that you can see  
Whoa, these chains of love,  
Got a hold on me, yeah  
  
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains,  
Can't run around 'cause I'm not free  
Whoa, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah  
  
I want to tell you pretty baby,  
I think you're fine  
I'd like to love you, but,  
Darling, I'm imprisoned by these  
  
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,  
And they ain't the kind, that you can see  
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah  
  
Please believe me when I tell you, your lips are sweet  
I'd like to kiss them but I can't break away from all these  
  
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,  
And they ain't the kind that you can see  
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah  
  
Chains, chains of love  
Chains of love  
Chains of love
