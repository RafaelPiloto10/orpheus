Overwhelming as they are  
Breeding hope by counting stars  
Merge the bitterness the pain  
Which I'm sure  
You can explain again  
  
One gets hurt when she feels small  
(And she's longing for some peace )  
Being the center of it all  
(Slow attack but fast release )  
Hear the difference in vain  
Out of tune but just not quite the same  
  
Overwhelming as they are  
(With their mystifying glow )  
Breeding hope by counting stars  
(As they hunger for the show )  
Hear the difference in vain  
Out of tune but just not quite the same
