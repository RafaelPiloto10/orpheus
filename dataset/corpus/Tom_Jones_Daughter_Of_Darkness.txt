Woman, I can remember a woman  
Warm were her kisses and tender was she  
Lying there in my arms  
Why, why did you deceive me so  
What devil inside made you go  
When I needed you most of all  
  
Daughter of darkness  
Stay out of my life, my life  
You took my heart, you broke it apart  
Daughter of darkness  
Daughter of darkness  
Please leave me alone forever  
Daughter of darkness gone is the love  
That we shared together  
  
Heaven, we had our own kind of heaven  
Sharing together, the magic of love  
In a world of our own  
Then oh so suddenly you were gone  
The love I depended upon disappeared when you went away  
  
Daughter of darkness stay out of my life, my life  
You took my heart, you broke it apart  
Oh daughter of darkness  
Daughter of darkness leave me alone forever  
Daughter of darkness gone is the love  
That we shared together  
Daughter of darkness stay out of my life, my life  
You took my heart, you broke it apart  
Oh daughter of darkness
