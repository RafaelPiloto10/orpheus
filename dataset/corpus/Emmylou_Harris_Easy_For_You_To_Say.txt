These things happen  
Love never comes with a guarantee  
No hard meetings  
But it looks like this love was never meant to be  
  
That's easy for you to say  
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you  
That's easy for you to say  
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two  
You tell me it's better this way  
That's easy for you to say  
  
There'll be changes  
Times never been known to ever stand still  
Lonely losers  
Hold to a promise they'll never fulfill  
  
That's easy for you to say  
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you  
That's easy for you to say  
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two  
You tell me it's better this way  
That's easy for you to say  
  
You tell me you know hat it's wrong  
To walk out this way  
But in time my true love will come  
And I'll thank you some day  
  
That's easy for you to say  
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you  
That's easy for you to say  
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two  
You tell me it's better this way  
That's easy for you to say  
That's easy for you to say
