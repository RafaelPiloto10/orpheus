Let me say that since  
Since we've been together  
Loving you forever  
Is all I need  
Let me be the one you come running to  
I'll never be untrue  
  
Let's, let's stay together  
Loving you whether, whether  
Times are good or bad, happy or sad  
  
I'm so in love with you  
Whatever you want to do  
Is alright with me  
You make me feel so brand new  
I want to spend my whole life with you  
  
Let me say that since  
Since we've been together  
Loving you forever  
Is all I need  
Let me be the one you come running to  
I'll never be untrue  
  
Let's, let's stay together  
Loving you whether, whether  
Times are good or bad, happy or sad  
  
Why, oh tell me, why do people break up  
Turn around and make up  
I just came to see  
You'd never do that to me, would you baby?  
Cause being around you is all I see  
  
So baby let's we all stay together  
Loving you whether, whether  
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
