Have you been listening  
(Listen to the music)  
Have you been sleeping  
(The sermon's in the music)  
(The man standing next to you)  
(He must surely be your brother)  
(So brother please)  
Heed the call  
(The piper he's still piping)  
The magic in the music  
(The drummer he's still drumming)  
The message in the music  
(Sweet songs of loving)  
(You should be singing)  
(So brother please)  
Heed the call  
Listen to the music  
Listen to the music  
Listen to the music  
Heed the call of the music  
(Listen to the music)  
Heed the call of the music  
(Listen to the music)  
Heed the call of the music  
Heed the call of the music  
It's still early in our morning  
There's still time for singing  
Let's not waste our morning  
Join in the singing  
The outlaw of the midnight  
He all too soon comes winging  
(So brother please, please)  
Heed the call  
Listen to the music  
Listen to the music  
(Yeah)  
Listen to the music  
Listen to the music  
(Oh, oh)  
Listen to the music  
(Oh)  
Listen to the music  
([Incomprehensible])  
Listen to the music
