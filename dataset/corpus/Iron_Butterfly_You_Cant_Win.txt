What the man says is always right  
He'll cuff your hands so you can't fight  
There is no way of getting around it  
He'll lock you up and in your head he'll pound it  
  
Destruction is the only road you're headed for  
There isn't any road behind those steel doors  
You just can't win  
  
Destruction is the only road you're headed for  
There isn't any roads behind those steel doors  
You just can't win  
  
You can't win, you can't win  
You can't win, you can't win  
You can't win
