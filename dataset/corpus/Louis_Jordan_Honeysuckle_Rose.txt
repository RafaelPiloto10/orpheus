Every honey bee fills with jealousy  
When they see you out with me  
Goodness knows  
You're my honeysuckle rose  
  
When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh  
And I know the reason why  
Goodness knows  
You're my honeysuckle rose  
  
Don't buy sugar  
You just have to touch my cup  
You're my sugar  
It's sweeter when you stir it up  
  
When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips  
Seems the honey fairly drips  
Goodness knows  
You're my honeysuckle rose  
  
Goodness knows  
You're my honeysuckle rose  
  
Don't buy sugar  
You just have to touch my cup  
You're my sugar  
It's sweeter when you stir it up  
  
When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips  
Seems the honey fairly drips  
Goodness knows  
You're my honeysuckle rose
