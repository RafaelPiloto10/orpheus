I've seen the light  
And I've seen the flame  
And I've been this way before  
And I'm sure to be this way again  
For I've been refused  
And I've been regained  
And I've seen your eyes before  
And I'm sure to see your eyes again  
  
For I've been released  
And I've been regained  
And I've sung my song before  
And I'm sure to sing my song again  
  
Some people got to laugh  
Some people got to cry  
Some people got to make it through  
By never wondering why  
  
Some people got to sing  
Some people got to sigh  
Some people never see the light  
Until the day they die  
  
But I've been released  
And I've been regained  
And I've been this way before  
And I'm sure to be this way again  
  
One more time again  
Just one more time
