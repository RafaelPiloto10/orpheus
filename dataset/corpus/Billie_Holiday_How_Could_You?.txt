Just when romance got a start  
You decided it was time to part  
How could you?  
How could you?  
  
It was on a night like this  
You left me and didn't leave a kiss  
How could you?  
How could you?  
  
You know that love is just like apple pie  
It's either sweet or tart  
You could be the apple of my eye  
But you, you, you upset the apple cart  
  
I was looking forward to  
All those little things you didn't do  
How could you,  
Could you break my heart?
