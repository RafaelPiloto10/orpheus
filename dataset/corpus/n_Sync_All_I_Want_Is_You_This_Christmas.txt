Snowy night, where it's warm here by the fire  
Here with you, I have all that I desire  
(Here with you)  
It's been a long year but somehow we got by  
Now, it's Christmas eve and love is on our side  
I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree  
(Beneath the tree)  
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me  
Nothin' else will do, all I want is you this Christmas  
(This Christmas, this Christmas)  
Children sing Christmas carols at our door, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(Children sing)  
Spreading joy, that's what Christmas time is for  
(Spreading joy)  
Though we don't have much, you've got me and I've got you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah and with a little faith miracles come true  
And I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree  
(Beneath the tree)  
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me  
Nothin' else will do, all I want is you this Christmas  
(This Christmas, this Christmas)  
I don't want the love of any other girl  
I want only one thing in this whole wide world  
Nothing else will do, all I want is you this Christmas  
(This Christmas, this Christmas)  
Cheek to cheek, the lights are low, a kiss beneath the mistletoe  
Your face lit by the fire's glow, that's all I want tonight  
And I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree  
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me  
Nothin' else will do, all I want is you this Christmas  
(This Christmas, this Christmas)  
Nothin' else will do, all I want is you this Christmas, yes
