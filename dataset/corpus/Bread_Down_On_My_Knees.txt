I told you before, don't you hear what I say  
I won't take it no more, no more making me stay  
Down on my knees, you know I'm down on my knees yea  
Yes I've been down on my knees  
But I'm through begging please  
I won't get back on my knees.  
  
Nobody knows, what your putting me through  
Nobody knows, if it's worth it for you  
Nobody sees, you got me down on my knees  
Well I've been down on my knees  
And I'm through begging please  
Don't put me back on my knees.  
  
You know how I always loved you  
Never placed myself above you,  
  
Don't let me go, if I wish that I could  
Don't tell me no, if I wish that you would  
Down on my knees, you know I'm down on my knees  
Well I've been down on my knees  
But I'm through begging please  
Don't put me back on my knees.
