I'll throw a pie in the face of piety  
I'll torch a torah right off a bridge  
I am a reverend of irreverence  
I'm a shill for any sacrilege  
I understand that faith in a deity  
Helps the masses who are having hard times  
But blasphemy like prostitution  
Are clearly victimless crimes  
Blasphemy, blasphe-you, Jesus Christ the blackest Jew  
  
Blasphe-you, blasphemy, poisonous pedagogy  
I'm an unbeliever, I'm a heretic  
I'm gonna projectile puke off a pew  
I'm a trouble making immature imp  
I'm gonna turn your other cheek for you  
I understand we all need something to believe in  
I believe I'll never be given wings and  
I'm sorry if it's up there cuz I didn't think  
A song was gonna hurt its feelings  
Blasphemy, speaking deadpan  
Apparently this god has got a master plan  
Now they call foul, pure heresy  
But ya gotta wonder, does he have a plan B?  
  
Horus similar to Mithra, Attis analogous to Krishna  
Jesus, different name same story  
All based on ancient Egyptian allegory  
My position hasn't been occulted  
It can never be more overstated  
My intelligence has been insulted  
So my tongue lashes out in defense  
Anything that is your holy or sacred  
I'm gonna desecrate and use in jest  
But you'll never hear a crack about Mohammad  
  
Cause I don't wanna get shot in the chest  
Blasphemy, isn't this fun  
Rob a rabbi, bugger a nun  
Blasphemy, want some more?  
Mother Mary, the virgin whore
