In my dreams  
You belong to me  
She doesn't mean a thing  
She never wore your ring  
In my dreams  
My greatest wish comes true  
My arms are holding you  
In my dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
I hear your laughter  
And I taste your lips  
I feel you tremble  
At my fingertips  
Each night you're mine  
But each morning finds you gone  
  
In my dreams  
My soul is wide awake  
Craving the love we make  
In my dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In my dreams  
I'll hide this love I steal  
'Til you feel what my heart feels  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
In my dreams
