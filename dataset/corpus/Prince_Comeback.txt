Walking up the stairs  
Just the afternoon  
Sweet wind blew  
Not a moment to soon  
(Hoo) I cry when I realized  
That sweet wind was you  
  
Spirits come and spirits go  
Some stick around for the after show  
Don't have to say I miss you (don't have to say I miss you)  
Cause I think you already know  
If you ever lose someone  
Dear to you  
Never say the words their gone  
They'll come back, yeah  
They'll come back, yeah yeah  
They'll come back  
Tears go here  
Tears go here  
Tears go here  
Tears go here
