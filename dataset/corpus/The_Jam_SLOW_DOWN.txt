Well come on pretty baby  
Won't you walk with me  
Come on pretty baby  
Won't you talk with me  
Come on baby  
Give me one more chance  
Try to save me and our romance  
Slow down  
Baby,  
I'm not movin'away too fast  
You better give me a little love,  
Give a little love  
Baby what I love the best  
So I used to walk you home  
Baby after school  
Carry your books home too  
And now you got a boyfriend  
Down the street  
Baby what you tryin' to do?  
You better slow down  
Babe,  
I'm not movin'away too fast  
You better give a little love,  
Give a little love  
Baby what I love the best  
Solo  
So your a little lover  
Tell the way I do  
Come on pretty baby  
Walk two by two  
I'll let you love me  
Your so fine child  
The best woman I've ever had  
Slow down  
Babe,  
I'm not movin'away too fast  
You better give a little love,  
Give a little love  
Baby what I love the best  
Slow down  
Slow down  
Slow down  
Slow down baby  
Slow down  
Slow down
