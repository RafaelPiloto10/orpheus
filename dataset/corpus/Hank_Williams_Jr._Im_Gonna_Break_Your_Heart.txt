There's a time to laugh and there's a time to cry  
There's a time to live and love but my love for you has died  
I just don't want you anymore although you've done your part  
I can love you out of sympathy I'm gonna break your heart  
I always kinda like you dear and your cute little ways  
  
But I never meant for you to fall in love with me this way  
I should have never let you on and drag your love this far  
I'm sorry dear don't waste your tears I'm gonna break your heart  
The time to laugh is over and the time to cry has come  
  
But we shared a lot of good times I've thought we had a lot of fun  
I've stayed as long as I'm goin' to now I've just got to go  
But darling before I do there's something I want you to know  
I tried to make you happy dear I tried to do my part  
  
But love just died go on and cry I'm gonna break your heart  
But love just died go on and cry I'm gonna break your heart
