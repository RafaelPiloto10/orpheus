The bells are ringin' for me and my gal  
Birds are singin' for me and my gal  
Everybody's been knowin', to a weddin' they're goin'  
And for weeks they've been sewin' every Susie and Sal  
  
They're congregatin', bathin', waitin'  
For me an' my gal  
The Parson's waitin'  
For me and my gal  
  
An' sometime we're gonna build a little home  
For two or three or four or more  
In Loveland for me and my gal
