Winding you way down to baker street  
Light in your head and dead on your feet  
Well another crazy day  
You'll drink the night away  
And forget about everything  
  
This city's dance makes you feel so cold  
Its got so many people but its got no soul  
And its taken you so long  
To find out you were wrong  
When you thought it had everything  
  
You used to think that it was so easy  
You used to say that it was so easy  
But you're trying, you're trying now  
  
Another year and then you'll be happy  
Just one more year and then you'll be happy  
But you're crying you're crying now  
  
Way down the street there's a light in his place  
Opens the door  
He's got that look on his face  
And he asks you were you've been  
You tell him who you've seen  
And you talk about everything  
  
He's got this dream about buying some land  
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands  
And then he'll settle down  
In some quiet little town  
And forget about everything  
  
But you know he'll always keep moving  
You know he's never gonna stop moving  
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone  
  
When you wake up its a new morning  
The sun is shining its a new morning  
You're going, your going' home
