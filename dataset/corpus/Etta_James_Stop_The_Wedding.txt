If there's anyone here  
Who knows why these two people should not be joined together  
Let them speak now or forever hold their peace  
  
Wait, wait stop the wedding  
You just marrying her for spite  
If she knew the inside story  
She'd tell you what your doing just ain't right  
  
I know you don't wanna hurt me  
So stop this madness before it starts  
Revenge will only cause you regret  
So don't do it, don't do it  
Don't break two hearts  
(Don't break two hearts)  
  
'Cause you belong to me, oh darlin'  
And I belong to you and deep down inside me now  
I know you feel that way too  
So baby, don't do it (don't do it)  
Don't do it (don't do it) don't do it (don't do it)  
Oh, don't you break two hearts  
(Oh don't break two hearts)  
  
No, no, no baby don't do it (don't you do it)  
Don't do it (don't you do it)  
Stop the wedding (don't you do it)  
Oh, don't you break, don't you break two hearts  
(Oh don't break two hearts)  
No, no, no, no, don't do it (don't you do it)  
  
Don't do it (don't you do it)  
Stop the wedding (don't you do it)  
Oh, don't break two hearts  
(Oh, don't break two hearts)  
No,no, no,no, don't do it (don't you do it)  
Stop the wedding (don't you do it)  
Oh, oh don't you break two hearts  
(Oh, don't break two hearts)
