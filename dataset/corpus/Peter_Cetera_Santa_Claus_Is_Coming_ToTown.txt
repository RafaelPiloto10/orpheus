You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town!  
  
He's making a list  
And checking it twice,  
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town!  
  
Chorus:  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake.  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better be good tonight  
  
You better tin horns  
And lettle toy drums  
A rooty-toot-toot  
And a tum-tum-tum  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Chorus:  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake.  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better be good tonight  
  
You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town
