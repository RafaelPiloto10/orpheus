When Sunday morning dandruff turns out to be confetti  
And the cost of living in sin would make a poor man out of Paul Getty  
The girl in your dreams would have you up on an under age charge  
And the man of the moment is the lifer at large  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you've got something to hide, if you've got something to sell  
If you've got somebody's pride she might kiss and tell  
Or wind up with a fight fan in the Hammersmith Hotel  
You better speak up now if you want your piece  
You better speak up now  
It won't mean a thing later  
Yesterday's news is tomorrow's fish and chip paper  
  
Your girl says she's leaving and this time she really means it  
You can just look at the pictures, you don't actually have to read it  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
There's a man in the launderette and he's looking through your underwear  
For clues  
And the milkman is working through the News of the Screws  
  
He says...  
[Chorus:]
