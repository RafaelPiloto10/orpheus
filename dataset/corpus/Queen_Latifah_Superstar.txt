[Chorus]  
You ain't gotta be no superstar  
I only want to find out who you are  
And we gotta be no Superman  
So if you wanna talk to me, you can  
  
My girlies caught me on a good day  
I was (something) to move a job  
So we took it to a club  
Nigga we would make out a little  
And plus at the time I was single, a little  
So I said "Fine, we could meet up about nine"  
  
So anyway we crossing the place where bub is flowing  
We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we knowin'  
Some people in the joint is yellin' "Hurt me, Hurt me"  
I'm working my way over to the bar cause I'm thirsty  
And then I see this guy  
Oh no, I think he likes me  
I smile cause he's fly  
He smiles back, I think he likes me  
  
Well then it takes a twist  
He sends his homeboy to talk to me cause he's scared to get dissed  
I don't walk baby  
I don't bite neither  
You coulda asked me yourself for my number to my beeper  
The worst thing I'da said was "No"  
So maybe next time you better push a (something)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Saturday moving in the house  
Lookin' at the videos  
At the same time I'ma tryna put on my clothes  
First date (First Date) with the guy's name was Nate  
Was he fly?  
Yes he was  
Word up, the type you have on a plate  
Cause I only met him last night  
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right  
So he pulls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo  
What is on his (something), are we expecting more?  
He showered me with gifts and then he kissed me on my hand  
Now what was in your plan?  
I really didn't understand  
We're only going to the movies  
Either you're trying to impress me or watch you're trying to get the poony  
  
Listen baby, I don't want a condo  
You can make me smile a little and give me convo  
All I might require from my man is intelligence  
And all them other material things is irrelevant  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Now if you ready to deal with a girl who consider herself a queen  
And you know how to treat a queen  
Then step to the scene  
We can sit alone in a room and deal  
We can take a ride listening to music and chill  
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do  
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you  
Cause you ain't gotta be no superstar honey  
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are  
Money ain't gone make me love ya  
And even with your car  
So cease with that attitude  
With that attitude you won't be getting far  
  
And I love all of my brothers with a passion  
Can't a sister get the same type of reaction  
(Yeah) If you cool like dat  
Take a trip to Jersey cause that's where I'm at  
  
[Chorus]
