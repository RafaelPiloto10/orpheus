(feat. Sarah Brightman)  
  
[Sarah:]  
There for me, every time I've been away  
Will you be there for me, thinking of me everyday  
Are you my destiny, words I never dared to say  
Will you be there for me?  
Just think of you and me, we could never tow the line  
It's such a mystery just to hear you say you're mine  
And while you're close to me, so close to me  
Just hold me  
  
[Josh:]  
When you're feeling cold and all the city streets are grey  
Walking all alone and watching how the children play  
Voices in the wind and faces from the past go dancing by  
They're asking why  
  
[Sarah and Josh:]  
Will you be there for me, everytime I go away  
Will you be there for me, thinking of me everyday  
Are you my destiny, words I never dared to say  
Will you be there for me?  
  
And while you're close to me, so close to me  
Just hold me  
  
[Josh:]  
Can you really want me more than for a little while?  
What are the stories hiding there behind your smile?  
Wishes in a dream and figures in a world that I could share  
And everywhere  
  
[Sarah and Josh:]  
Will you be there for me  
Will there ever come a day when all the world can see  
Things were meant to be that way  
Will you be there for me?  
Can you hear the people say  
That you're just  
There for me  
  
[Josh:]  
There for me  
  
[Sarah:]  
There for me
