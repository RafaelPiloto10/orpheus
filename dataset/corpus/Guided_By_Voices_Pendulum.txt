Come on over tonight  
We'll put on some Catt Butt and  
Do it up right  
No need to get all caught up  
In societies stipulations  
You're a member of the freak generation  
You're gonna burn to have delation  
When the pendulum swings it cuts  
When the big door swings open and shuts  
Yeah, we'll be middle-age children  
But so what  
I haven't changed so drastically  
They can talk so sarcastically  
They'll bust up  
But we''ll bust in  
Get my down back up again  
When the pendulum swings it cuts  
When the big door swings open and shuts  
Ohhhh, we'll be swollen ?  
But so what  
When the pendulum swings it cuts  
When the big door swings open and shuts  
Yeah, we'll be middle-children  
But so what  
Ohhhh, we'll be swollen  
But so what.
