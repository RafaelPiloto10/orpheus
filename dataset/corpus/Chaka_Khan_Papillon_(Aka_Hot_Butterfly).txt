A faded photograph I mailed to you  
With feelings I don't want to face  
And a long song of surrender in blue  
I remember when you took my breath away  
  
CHORUS:  
  
Chanson papillon, we were very young  
Like butterflies, like hot butterfly  
Chanson papillon, we had just begun  
We let it slide on by  
We didn't realize  
  
All our memories are burning in time  
Like a bittersweet perfume  
Can you tell me how a love that's so fine  
Could have climaxed in a single afternoon  
  
Gone are the days of instant romance  
And the nights of slow goodbyes  
That was a time of life when foxy was the dance  
But then you got wise to all my lies  
  
CHORUS  
  
Chanson papillon, chanson  
Chanson papillon, chanson  
Chanson papillon, chanson  
Chanson papillon, chanson
