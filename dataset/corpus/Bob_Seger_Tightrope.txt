Saw you walkin' on a backstreet honey  
Tryin' to slip away  
Did you find someone to take your money  
And did it make your day  
Take a lesson from someone who's been there  
There are lots of roads that lead you nowhere  
  
I can see it in your blank stare baby  
Someone's done you in  
Everybody hits the hard truth some time  
It's your time again  
So you're lonesome and the night's approachin'  
Honey this is where the tough get goin'  
  
Welcome to the tightrope  
Between memory and pain  
Welcome to the tightrope  
Between the freedom and the chain  
Welcome to the tightrope  
Stretched high above the street  
Welcome to the tightrope  
It's right beneath your feet  
  
Once you learn to balance truth and sorrow  
You can worry about the rest tomorrow  
  
Up there on the tightrope  
Oh it's a tightrope  
You're walkin' on a tightrope
