I've got a feeling '21  
Is going to be a good year.  
Especially if you and me  
See it in together.  
  
So you think '21  
Is going to be a good year.  
It could be good for me and her,  
But you and her - no, never!  
I had no reason to be over optimistic,  
But somehow when you smiled  
I could brave bad weather.  
  
What about the boy?  
What about the boy?  
What about the boy?  
He saw it all!  
  
You didn't hear it.  
You didn't see it.  
You won't say nothing to no-one  
Ever in your life.  
You never heard it.  
Oh, how absurd it  
All seems without any proof.  
You didn't hear it.  
You didn't see it.  
You won't say nothing to no-one.  
Never tell a soul  
What you know is the Truth.
