I know that I seem strange to you sometimes  
And who is it in here, you have often thought  
But what can I tell you  
That you don't know already?  
Yes, even the times like this  
Will roll away  
But I love you (I love you)  
I love you (I love you)  
That's all that I ever really wanted  
I know that it will work out all the same  
And whoever it is in here can overcome the pain  
A true friend's shoulder to lean on  
I'll make it through  
And over and over  
I feel for you  
But I love you (I love you)  
I love you (I love you)  
That's all that I ever really wanted  
Oh yeah, you know that sometimes a man  
He has nowhere to lay his head  
But what can I tell you  
That you don't know already?  
Yes, even the worst time like this  
Will blow away  
But I love you (I love you)  
I love you (I love you)  
That's all that I ever really wanted  
Oh yeah, you know that sometimes a man  
He has nowhere to lay his head, nowhere, I said nowhere  
Nowhere to lay his head  
Oh what can I tell you  
That you don't know already?
