I'm bored.  
I'm the chairman of the board.  
I'm a Lincoln monologue, I'm livin' like a God,  
I'm bored.  
  
I bore myself to sleep at night, I bore myself in broad daylight, 'cause I'm
bored.  
Just another slimy bore.  
  
I'm free to bore my well-bought friends,  
And spend my cash until the end,  
'cause I'm bored!  
I'm bored!  
I'm the chairman of the board.  
  
I'm sick.  
I'm sick of all my kicks.  
I'm sick of all the stiffs, I'm sick of all the dips, I'm bored.  
  
I bore myself to sleep at night, I bore myself in broad daylight,  
'cause I'm bored!  
I'm bored!  
Just another dirty bore!  
Alright now, face, come out and bore me!  
  
I am sick!  
I am sick of all my kicks!  
I'm sick of all the stiffs, I'm sick of all the dips, I'm sick!  
I'm sick when I go to sleep at night, I'm still sick in the broad daylight,  
'Cause I'm bored!  
I'm bored!  
I'm the chairman of the board!
