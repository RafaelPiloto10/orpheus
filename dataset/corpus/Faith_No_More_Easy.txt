I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain  
Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow  
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can  
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed  
Yeah...Ooo  
  
That's why I'm easy  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
I'm easy like Sunday morning  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
That's why I'm easy  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
Easy like Sunday morning  
  
I wanna be high  
So high  
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right  
I wanna be free  
Just me  
Oh babe...  
Ooh!  
  
That's why I'm easy  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
I'm easy like Sunday morning  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
That's why I'm easy  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
Easy like Sunday morning
