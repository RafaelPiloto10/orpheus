The sentimental sun in his teary sky  
Says he doesn't want to shine today  
You tell me to imagine myself with another lover  
That's easy for you to say  
  
The April that I knew with her cool soft rain  
Has turned into a flowerless May  
You tell me to go on with my life as if nothing's happened  
That's easy for you to say  
  
Maybe I should quote the letters that you wrote  
I was your Mr. Right, if you recall  
You tell me not to do it, but you're not going through it  
I guess I'm not so right after all  
  
The melancholy moon is awfully pale  
And while his light is dim you seem OK  
You tell me there are plenty of fish in the deep blue sea  
That's easy for you to say  
  
The melancholy moon is awfully pale  
And while his light is dim you seem OK  
You tell me there are plenty of fish in the deep blue sea  
But the only one I caught just got away  
It's easy for you, easy for you  
It's all so easy for you to say
