Let's talk about me for a minute  
Well how do you think  
I feel about what's been going on  
Let's talk about me for a minute  
Well how do you think  
I feel about what's gone wrong  
  
Let's talk about dreams  
I never learned to read the signs  
Let's think about what it all means  
I never seem to have the time  
  
Let's talk about you and your problems  
All that I seem to do is spend the night  
Just talking 'bout you and your problems  
No matter what I say I can't get it right  
  
Don't think about dreams  
Is it all a waste of time  
Don't think about what it all means  
If you are a friend of mine  
  
Talk about me, for a minute  
I'm the one who's losing  
Talk about me, for a minute  
I'm the one who's always losing out  
  
And how do you think  
I feel about what's been going on  
Let's talk about me for a minute  
Well how do you think  
I feel about what's gone wrong  
  
Let's think about dreams  
We never seem to have the time  
Let's talk about what it all means  
If you are a friend of mine  
  
Let's talk about me  
I'm the one who's losing out  
I'm the one who's losing out  
I'm the one who's losing out, losing out  
  
Talk about me, for a minute  
I'm the one who's losing  
Talk about me, for a minute  
I'm the one who's always losing out
