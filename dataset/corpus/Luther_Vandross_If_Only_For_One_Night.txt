Let me hold you tight if only for one night,  
Let me keep you near to ease away your fear  
It would be so nice  
If only for one night.  
I won't tell a soul  
No one has to know  
If you want to be totally discreet  
I'll be at your side  
If only for one night.  
If only for one night  
Your eyes say things I never hear from you  
My knees are shaking too  
But I'm willing willing to go through  
I must be crazy,  
Standing in this space  
Well I'm feeling no disgrace for asking.  
Let me take you home  
To keep you safe and warm  
Till the early dawn warms up  
To the sun it would be so nice  
If only for one night
