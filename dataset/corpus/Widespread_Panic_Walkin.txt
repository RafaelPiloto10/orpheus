Walkin' for your love  
Walkin' for your love  
Walkin' for your love  
Walkin' for your love  
  
I'm only going where my eyes are going  
I'm only going where my toes are pointed  
I just bought me this new pair of big shoes  
I'm only going if I can walk there with you  
  
Shinin' for your love  
Shinin' for your love  
Shinin' for your love  
Shinin' for your love  
  
I'm afraid to open my eyes  
I'm even afraid to look at you  
Right here, I'm gonna open my eyes  
I'm gonna move with you  
  
Disappearin' for your love  
Disappearin' for your love  
Disappearin' for your love  
Disappearin' for your love  
  
We're only going in this closet here  
I'm only going if the doorknob turns  
I'm only going if the light goes on  
I'm only going if I can boogie with you
