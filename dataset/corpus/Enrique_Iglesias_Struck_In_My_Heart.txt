Stuck In My Heart  
  
Can't you tell  
You've been all over me like a spell - I know  
(I never wanna let you go)  
  
Can't you see  
You've been changing the world around me - I know  
(I never wanna let you go)  
  
If you hold me close enough  
I can whisper you the words  
If the distance is to far  
I can't do nothing, cuz  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are  
  
Can't deny  
Since I met you that day I've been blind - to see  
(Now I wanna know for real)  
  
Inside me  
I'm afraid to wake up from a dream - and see  
(It never really happent to me)  
  
If you hold me close enough  
I can whisper you the words  
If the distance is to far  
I can't do nothing, cuz  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are  
  
You are...... Like a dream so deep inside of me  
  
You are...... The reason that I never sleep  
  
You are...... Stuck in my heart  
  
You are  
  
Can't you tell  
You've been all over me like a spell  
(I will never let you go, I will never let you go no, no)  
  
Can't you see  
You've been changing the world around me  
(I don't wanna let you go, no I'll never let you go no, no)  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are
