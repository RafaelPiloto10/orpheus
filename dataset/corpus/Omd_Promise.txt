A change of mind has moved around  
Takes me back to when we met  
Forever moved a promise kept  
This all implies I don't believe how this would be for  
To be with you  
Watching your eyes  
I can see it in your eyes  
Away go away  
To be by your side  
I travel all night  
Away go away  
  
Concept conceived to let me down  
And when you leave I can never make my mind up  
We're on the move removed too far  
Your way of life  
It's only me I'm not deceived at all  
To be with you  
Watching your eyes  
I can see it in your eyes  
Away go away  
To be by your side  
I travel all night  
Away go away  
  
So far from me to be the same  
I'll try again I'm here alone  
I shan't forget I feel this way  
And all the time you can dance until we meet again  
To be with you  
Watching your eyes  
I can see it in your eyes  
Away go away  
To be by your side  
I travel all night  
Away go away  
To be by your side  
I travel all night  
Away go away  
To be by your side  
I travel all night
