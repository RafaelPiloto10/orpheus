Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone  
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded  
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded  
I come alive in the neon light  
That's when I make my moves right  
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone  
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded  
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded  
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take  
This motor's revved up, fit to break  
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone  
I'm aiming for ya I'm gonna floor ya  
My body's coming  
All night long  
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded  
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded  
I set my sights and then home in  
The joint starts flying when I begin  
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
