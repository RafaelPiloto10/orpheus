Eleven times I been busted, eleven times I been to jail  
Some of the times I been there nobody could go my bail  
Well it seems to me, lord that this ol' boy just don't fit  
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like sh...  
  
Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me  
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said guilty  
I'm not one to complain now son I tell you true  
When the black cat cross your trail, lord  
It comes in misery times two  
  
[Chorus:]  
Double trouble--that's what my friends all call me  
(double trouble)  
I said, double trouble  
T-r-o-u-b-l-e  
  
Well I was born down in the gutter  
With a temper as hot as fire  
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doin' the county's time  
Well now, even mama said son you're bad news  
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you
