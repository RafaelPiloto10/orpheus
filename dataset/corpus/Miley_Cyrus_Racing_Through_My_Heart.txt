Racers start your engines)  
  
The checkered flag  
Is a waving  
My heart is racing  
Racing for you  
It's too sad  
That you're leaving  
I thought maybe we could  
Be something  
Now I'm chasing you down  
In a fast car  
  
[Chorus:]  
The speed  
The sound  
The wind  
The crowd  
You can't stop my heart  
Oh oh yeah  
Racing through my heart  
Oh oh yeah  
  
You are  
Ah ah  
Racing through my heart  
In a fast car  
  
Don't go too fast  
You'll break my heart  
Then I don't know what to do  
'Cause I'm still in love  
With you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh yeah  
Racing  
Hey la  
Hey la  
Through my heart  
Oh yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(Fast car)
