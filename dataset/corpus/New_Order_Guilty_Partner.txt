Listen to me  
I know what I'm saying  
But lord it don't come easy  
To admit that I was wrong  
It took me far too long  
I counted on you  
To give me a reason  
Why the Sun don't shine in the season  
Grey sky surrounded me  
  
I'm not some kind of foolish lover  
I couldn't take this from no other  
You're not being cool with me  
'Cause I always know you'll come back to me  
Yes, you'll come back to me  
  
'Cause I always know  
What it takes to make you my lover  
  
You once said to me  
That I was a cruel man  
And you know  
That I almost believed you  
I was blind, and I couldn't see  
You took my sight from me  
  
And all of these words  
And all this emotion  
Can't explain my hopeless devotion  
Or change what had to be  
  
I'm not some kind of foolish lover  
I couldn't take this from no other  
You're not being cool with me  
'Cause I always know that you'll come back to me  
Yes, you'll come back to me  
Yes, you'll come back to me  
  
I'm not some kind of foolish lover  
I couldn't take this from no other  
You're not being cool with me  
'Cause I always know that you'll come back to me  
Yes, you'll come back to me  
  
I'm not some kind of foolish lover  
I couldn't take this from another  
It's no good being cool with me  
'Cause I always know  
What it takes to make you my lover
