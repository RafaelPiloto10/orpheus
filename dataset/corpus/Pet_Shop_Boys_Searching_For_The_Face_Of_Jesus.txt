He believed if you had a little faith  
you could stop the rain  
and he believed if you got a little love  
it would ease the pain  
but still he's suffering  
  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
Looking for the light we need  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
painted in the blood we bleed  
  
By the side of a giant swimming-pool  
with a mystic book  
Hanging out with the guys and playing the fool  
fat as King Farouk  
but look he's suffering  
  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
downtown Memphis, Tennessee  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
Science is a mystery  
  
Oh and sometimes there's a close shave  
They come, they go  
Keeps the flowers fresh at his mom's grave  
and talks to her as though...  
  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
Looking for the light we need  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
painted in the blood we bleed  
  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
downtown Memphis, Tennessee  
Searching for the face of Jesus  
Science is a mystery
