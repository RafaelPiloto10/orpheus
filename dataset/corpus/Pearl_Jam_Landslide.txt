(Fleetwood Mac cover)  
(taken from, Live 1995)  
I took my love, and I took it down  
I Climbed a mountain and I turned around  
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills  
'Till the landslide brought me down  
Oh, mirror in the sky  
What is love?  
Can the child within my heart rise above  
Can I sail thru the changing ocean tides  
Can I handle the seasons of my life  
Uh-uh I don't know  
Uh-uh  
Well, I've been afraid of changing  
'Cause I've built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Children get older  
I'm getting older too

(Gutiar solo)  
I've been afraid of changing  
'Cause I built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Children get older  
I'm getting older too  
I'm getting older too  
Oh, take this love, take it down  
Oh, If you Climb a mountain and turn around  
If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well the landslide will bring it down down  
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well maybe the landslide will bring it down  
Well well the landslide will bring it down
