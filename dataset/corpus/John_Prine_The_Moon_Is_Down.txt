The moon is down  
All over town  
The forecast is gray  
Now that she's gone away  
The stars in the skies  
Fell out of her eyes  
They shattered when they hit the ground  
And now the moon is down  
The sun will be fine  
It'll still shine all the time  
The sky will be blue  
And do what it's supposed to do  
You see gravity pulls  
But it can't keep you around  
It'll be one long day  
And now the moon is down  
The moon is down  
All over town  
The stars in the skies  
Fell out of her eyes  
The gravity pulls  
But it can't hold you down  
It'll be one long day  
Now the moon is down  
It'll be one long day  
Now the moon is down
