Why give orders?  
Why give speeches?  
  
No more questions  
No more answers  
All that's left is the fear  
  
I can feel they're here  
I can feel the cold  
I can't fight for long  
This machine runs down  
  
If I had a picture  
I could say it's all for you.  
  
Why give orders?  
And why make speeches?  
Give me a reason to stay  
  
This dying machine  
I can hear me scream  
I've nowhere to run  
I've nowhere to hide  
  
I can only wonder  
I can only wonder why  
  
Why give orders?  
And why make speeches?  
Give me a reason to die  
  
This shape comes apart  
Everything breaks down  
And me, I'm trapped inside  
And here inside it ends.  
  
There's nothing I can do  
There's nothing I can do now  
If I had a picture  
I could say it's all for you  
I can only wonder  
I can only wonder why
