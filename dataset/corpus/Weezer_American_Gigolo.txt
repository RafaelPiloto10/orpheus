Sit down and quiet everybody  
You got a long way to go  
I told you once before that  
You better not stop the show  
  
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on  
Keep on, keep on, keep on, yeah  
  
If you want me  
You can't have me  
But you've got to  
Please accept me  
  
Back off now, baby I'm a loner  
You got a lotta things to see  
I told you once before that  
You better not take it from me  
  
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on  
Keep on, keep on, keep on, yeah  
  
If you hate this  
Oh, I can't blame you  
But I'm hurting  
So I'll flame you  
  
I've seen this game before  
My love walks right to your door  
There ain't no hope for me anymore  
Ah ha ha ha... yeah  
  
If you hate this
