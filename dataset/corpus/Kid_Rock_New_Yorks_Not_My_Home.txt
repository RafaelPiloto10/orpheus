Burnin  
Oh no, oh no, here we go now  
Oh no, oh no, here we go now  
Oh no, oh no, here we go now  
Oh no...  
  
Went to New York to cut my first LP  
Ridin down Broadway in a taxi  
Hang a right at 25th  
Just a little too swift, jo'  
  
Let me out, I'm gonna walk from here on  
Here's 4 bucks you drive like a moron  
Lost in The Apple and I'm all alone  
  
'Cause New Yorks Not My Home  
  
In the village chillin' with a 40 in a brown bag  
I'm seein' freaks, and also fags  
I see a set of nice legs in my site  
But its a fuckin' transvestite  
  
Walkin' in the daylight  
Now I'm trippin' and I'm like blown  
But I take another sip and say to each his own  
He'de get dissed in Detroit, but I'll leave him alone  
  
'Cause New Yorks Not My Home  
  
Now if your sounds are knockin' to the cool Kid Rockin'  
Has got your girl jockin'  
Take a chill pill young man, close your flap  
'Cause like the Piston Joe, I'm goin back to back  
  
With a track, uh, that's just too clean  
I got my pistol packed and a fifth of Jim Beam  
Only 19, and my name ain't Wilbur  
But I pull more hoes then Long Jon Silver  
  
I don't dress up, or try to look pretty  
Instead I rock the house in every major city  
From the tip of Maine to the coast of Cali'  
I get down and I yodel in the valley  
Can't say I'm from the Bronx or Brookland zones  
  
'Cause New Yorks Not My Home  
  
Ate ave in the 40 deuce, its like a freak show  
A lot of hookers try to pop that week, so  
I walk with a limp when I pimp through  
Or co-mack those hoes if I'm illin' with the Beast Crew  
  
It's pickin' up, ill check this fact  
These Mother Fuckers pay over 2.50 for a big mac  
Conjested, overcrowded, see ya I'm gone  
  
'Cause New Yorks Not My Home
