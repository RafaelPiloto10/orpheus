Everybody, everybody, everybody but me  
Everybody's got someone carin'  
Everybody's got a love they're sharin'  
Everybody, everybody but me  
Everybody's gettin' ready  
Everybody is goin' steady  
Everybody, everybody but me  
I stay home on a Friday nights  
I go to bed at eight  
Saturday nights I'm all alone  
'Coz I still ain't got a date  
Everybody's out romancin'  
Havin' fun and they're going dancin'  
Everybody, everybody but me  
Everybody, everybody but me  
Well, I stay home on a Friday nights  
I go to bed at eight  
On Saturday nights I'm all alone  
'Coz I still ain't got a date  
Everybody's got someone carin'  
Everybody's got a love they're sharin'  
Everybody, everybody but me  
Everybody, everybody but me  
Everybody but me
