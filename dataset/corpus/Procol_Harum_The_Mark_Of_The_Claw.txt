A question of judgment decided in haste  
A case of malfunction an error of taste  
A moment of madness occasioned by stress  
A classic misjudgment a God-awful mess  
  
The moment of panic preceding the crash  
The sickening terror the defeating smash  
A loud wail of sirens descend on the scene  
The camera dissolves a crescendo of screams  
  
The memory's imprinted like some dreadful sore  
The fearful reminder: the mark of the claw  
  
A question of judgment concerned in the case  
The method of access regarding the place  
The possible motive the absence of blood  
The theories unanswered regarding the thud  
  
The outcome was certain the jury was hung  
Their verdict resolved by ruling of thumb  
The judgment was mercy: they tendered the plea  
The judge raised his hand and the prisoner was free
