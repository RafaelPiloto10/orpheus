Some call it country with a little bit of rhythm and blues  
And when the boys start rockin'  
There's a beat that you just can't lose  
Where it's gonna take us nobody knows  
It sure feels good to the body and soul  
  
[Chorus]  
I love the slide of a steal guitar  
I love the moan of an old blues harp  
I love the shake of a tambourine  
I love the bass when it's low and mean  
So put on your shoutin' shoes  
And turn it loose  
Turn it loose  
  
You feel like dancin'  
And you just can't stay in your seat  
Your knees start knockin'  
And you can't help stompin' your feet  
Before you even know it you'll be singin' a long  
Makes me want to stay hear all night long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Turn it loose  
Everybody put on your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose  
Grab your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose
