I get along without you very well, of course, I do  
Except when soft rains fall and drip from leaves  
Then I recall the thrill of being sheltered in your arms  
Of course I do, but I get along without you very well  
  
I've forgotten you just like I should, of course, I have  
Except to hear your name  
Or someones laugh that's just the same  
But I've forgotten you just like I should  
  
What a guy, what a fool am I?  
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon  
What's in store, should I fall once more?  
No it's best that I stick to my tune  
  
I get along without you very well, of course, I do  
Except perhaps in spring  
But I should never ever think of spring  
For that would surely break my heart in two  
  
What's in store, should I fall once more?  
No it's best that I stick to my tune  
  
I get along without you very well, of course, I do  
Except perhaps in spring  
But I should never ever think of spring  
For that would surely break my heart in two
