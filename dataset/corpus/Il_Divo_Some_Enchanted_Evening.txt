Some enchanted evening  
You may see a stranger, you may see a stranger  
Across a crowded room, and somehow you know,  
You know even then  
That somewhere you'll see her again and again  
  
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing  
You may hear her laughing  
Across a crowded room and night after night, as strange as it seems  
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams  
  
Who can explain it?  
Who can tell you why?  
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try  
  
Some enchanted evening  
When you find your true love  
When you feel her call you  
Across a crowded room  
Then fly to her side, and make her your own  
Or all through your life you may dream all alone  
  
Once you have found her never let her go  
Once you have found her never let her go
