[Chorus]  
You better turn me loose  
Turn me loose you know that I can't stay  
You better turn me loose  
Well turn me loose you know I'll make it anyway  
  
Well why don't you tell me  
Just what's goin' on  
Both of us lyin' here  
And we both know it's wrong  
So why don't you let me  
Why don't you leave it alone  
And don't keep hangin' on to a love that's dead and gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well you can't see it's over  
That's really a shame  
Well our love didn't make it  
No one's to blame  
So why don't we say goodbye  
Why don't we just say we're through  
And I'll be on my way  
And I'll get by without you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Turn me loose you know I'll make it anyway
