Rolling (rolling) the ball, rolling (rolling) the ball, rolling (rolling) the
ball to me  
Rolling (rolling) the ball, rolling (rolling) the ball, rolling (rolling) the
ball to me  
  
They arrived at an inconvenient time  
I was hiding in a room in my mind  
They made me look at myself  
I saw it well, I'd shut the people out of my life  
So now I take the opportunities  
Wonderful teachers ready to teach me  
I must work on my mind  
For now I realize  
Everyone of us has a heaven inside  
  
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot  
Them heavy people help me  
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot  
Rolling the ball (rolling), rolling the ball (rolling), rolling the ball to me  
  
They open doorways that I thought were shut for good  
They read me Gurdjieff and Jesu  
They build up my body, break me emotionally  
It's nearly killing me, but what a lovely feeling!  
I love the whirling of the dervishes  
I love the beauty of rare innocence  
You don't need no crystal ball  
Don't fall for a magic wand  
We humans got it all, we perform the miracles  
  
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot  
Them heavy people help me  
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot  
Rolling the ball (rolling), rolling the ball(rolling), rolling the ball to me
