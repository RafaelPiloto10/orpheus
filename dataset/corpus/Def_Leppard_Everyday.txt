I gave in when you gave out  
You showed me the way to love  
There ain't no doubt  
Always together and never apart  
  
Disappeared, didn't say a word  
Slept right through, guess I never heard  
Now I'm awake but I wish I was dreamin'  
  
Everyday without you in my heart  
Everyday I'm fallin' apart  
And I know you know I think about you  
Everyday  
  
I woke up and you were gone  
Just one night without you  
Is too long  
  
Sleeping with the ghost of you  
Dying with or without you  
Don't want to feel this way tomorrow  
  
Everyday without you in my heart  
Everyday I'm fallin' apart  
And I know you know I think about you  
Everyday  
  
Don't know what you got until it's gone  
  
Everyday without you in my heart  
Everyday I'm fallin' apart  
And I know you know I think about you  
Everyday 'til I see you again  
Everyday I'll try to pretend  
That I know you know I think about you  
  
Everyday  
Outta my head all the days are confused  
Everyday  
I'm lost but it's you that I don't want to lose  
Everyday  
We're torn 'til we're givin' ourselves to each other
