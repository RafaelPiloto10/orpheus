Operator, number, please:  
It's been so many years  
Will she remember my old voice  
While I fight the tears?  
Hello, hello there, is this Martha?  
This is old Tom Frost,  
And I am calling long distance,  
Don't worry 'bout the cost.  
'Cause it's been forty years or more,  
Now Martha please recall,  
Meet me out for coffee,  
Where we'll talk about it all.  
  
And those were the days of roses,  
Poetry and prose and Martha  
All I had was you and all you had was me.  
There was no tomorrows,  
We'd packed away our sorrows  
And we saved them for a rainy day.  
  
And I feel so much older now,  
And you're much older too,  
How's your husband?  
And how's the kids?  
You know that I got married too?  
Lucky that you found someone  
To make you feel secure,  
'Cause we were all so young and foolish,  
Now we are mature.  
  
And those were the days of roses,  
Poetry and prose and Martha  
All I had was you and all you had was me.  
There was no tomorrows,  
We'd packed away our sorrows  
And we saved them for a rainy day.  
  
And I was always so impulsive,  
I guess that I still am,  
And all that really mattered then  
Was that I was a man.  
I guess that our being together  
Was never meant to be.  
And Martha, Martha,  
I love you can't you see?  
  
And those were the days of roses,  
Poetry and prose and Martha  
All I had was you and all you had was me.  
There was no tomorrows,  
We'd packed away our sorrows  
And we saved them for a rainy day.  
  
And I remember quiet evenings  
Trembling close to you.
