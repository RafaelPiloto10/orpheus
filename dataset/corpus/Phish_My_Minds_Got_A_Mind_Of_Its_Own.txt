My mind's got a mind of its own  
It takes me out a walkin' when I'd rather stay at home  
Takes me out to parties when I'd rather be alone  
My mind's got a mind of its own  
  
I've been doing things I thought I'd never do  
I've been getting into trouble without ever meaning to  
I'd as soon settle down but I'm right back up again  
I feel just like a leaf out in the wind.  
  
(chorus)  
I seem to forget half the things I start  
I try to build a house and then I tear the place apart  
I freeze myself on fire and then I burn myself on ice  
I can't count to one without thinking twice  
  
(chorus)  
I tell myself to do the things I should  
And then I get to thinkin' that them things ain't any good.  
I tell myself the truth but know I'm lying like a snake  
You can't walk on water at the bottom of a lake.
