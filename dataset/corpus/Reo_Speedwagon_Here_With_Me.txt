Maybe it's too late  
But this feelin' is runnin' through my soul  
I think I learned what love is, but I'm afraid I let it go  
Maybe it's too late  
Maybe you've already changed your mind  
Turned lovin' into leavin'  
And I'm on the outside  
  
You can take these words to bed with you  
And hold on to them at night  
They can erase the emptiness  
And make everything alright  
But your laughter and your tenderness  
Will never disappear  
No matter where you are tonight  
A part of you is here with me  
  
Here with me  
I don't know where you are  
All I know is I need you to be  
Here with me  
I know it's not too late  
to turn around and get it straight  
It's my fate to have you here with me  
  
I can hear your voice  
Promising your love will never die  
I can feel your golden skin on mine  
Beneath the desert sky  
So how can it be true  
How can you just turn and let me go  
Let the story of your life with mine  
Forever go untold  
  
I can take these words to bed with me  
And hold on to them at night  
They can erase the emptiness  
And make everything alright  
Cause your laughter and your tenderness  
Will never disappear  
No matter where you are tonight  
A part of you is here with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
Here with me (are you here with me)  
I don't know where you are (don't know where)  
All I know is, I need you to be, ohohwhoa  
Here with me  
I know it's not too late (know it's not too late)  
To turn around and get it straight  
Here with me...
