Broken windows and empty hallways  
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today  
  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to chase love away  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today  
  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
Think I'll kick it down the street  
That's the way to treat a friend  
  
Bright before me the signs implore me  
To help the needy and show them the way  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today
