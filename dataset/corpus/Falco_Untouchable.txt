She's not just another pretty face in a magazine  
This girl is real - She's every schoolboy's dream  
She fills my fantasies, my eyes and my ears  
But every time I try to touch her - She disappears  
Oh oh oh oh oh She's untouchable  
Oh oh oh oh oh untouchable delight  
Oh oh oh oh oh She's untouchable  
Oh oh oh oh oh She's outta- sight  
In my mind I'm always with her - moans and sighs  
I touch her full red lips - her silken thighs  
We meet in the city, she begs, "please take me home"  
But when I wake up in a cold sweat: I'm all alone
