Standing in the bog of a west end bar  
Guy on the right leaning over too far  
Money in my pocket gonna put it in the slot  
Open up the pack see what type I got  
  
I didn't want to hold you  
I didn't want to use you  
Protex, protex blue  
All want to do  
  
It's a fab protective for that type of a girl  
But everybody knows that she uses it well  
It's the therapeutic structure I can use at will  
But I don't think it fits my b.d. drill  
  
Sitting in a carriage of a bakerloo  
Erotica my pocket got a packet for you  
Advert on the escalator on my way home  
I don't need no skin flicks, I want to be alone  
  
I didn't want to hold you  
I didn't want to use you  
Protex, protex blue  
All I want to do  
  
Johnny, Johnny
