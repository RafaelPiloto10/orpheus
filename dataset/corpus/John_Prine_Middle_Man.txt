I was sitting in a diner  
With a girl named Flo  
She wouldn't say yes  
But she couldn't say no  
She said, ?Darling, can I get a middle man??  
She was engaged to a fellow  
On the lay a way plan  
But she carried all her money  
In a coffee can  
She said, ?Darling, can I get a middle man??  
The cook looked over  
With a short order face  
Dropped a fork  
And he saw Flo's legs  
Straightened his apron  
And burnt my eggs  
I got competition  
Everywhere I go  
These days  
She was leaning on the juke box  
And was lookin' real good  
Like Natalie Wood  
On a Pontiac hood  
I said, ?Darling, I think I need a little hand?  
Ya see, I've seen my downs  
I've seen my ups  
I seen miniature dogs  
In coffee cups  
But ?Darling I ain't never seen a middle man?  
Flo talked slow  
Like real wet paint  
She said, ?A middle man's there  
When the other ones ain't  
He's got a left handed manner  
That leans to the right, sleeps all day  
And keeps it up all night?  
I got an aunt in Ohio  
And a boat that won't row  
Some veterans insurance  
And nowhere to go  
?Darling, Can I be your middle man?  
If I could get the money in that coffee can?  
I could open me up a lemonade stand  
Send all the kids off to Pakistan  
Make flo happy  
If I can  
Jerry Mahoney and Johnny B. Goode  
Are gonna buy me a house in Hollywood  
Darling I think, I got the perfect plan  
We're gonna save half a dollars  
And sell 'em to France  
Buy us a record  
And learn how to dance  
And darling, I'll always be your middle  
Darling, go buy a griddle  
Darling, I wanna be your middle man
