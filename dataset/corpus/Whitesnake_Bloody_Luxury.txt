Now when I first met you  
I was rolling along,  
Just a bar room crooner  
Singing heartbreak songs,  
An' I supposed I could never get next to you  
But, you seemed quite happy with my company  
You kept my body heat steady at 103,  
With your mouth full of gimme  
An' your body full of much obliged  
  
It's bloody luxury  
What you mean to me,  
Bloody luxury  
What you do to me  
It's bloody luxury  
What you mean to me,  
'cause no matter what you do to me  
It's bloody luxury  
Bloody luxury  
  
You're a five star woman,  
An' you know what to give  
To fill a part time loser  
Full of reasons to live,  
But, there's no doubt about it  
I'm taking a chance on you  
Becos' you get my heart beating heavy,  
Make my knees go weak  
You get me so damn nervous  
I can hardly speak,  
But, nothing's gonna stop me  
Hanging on my good luck charm  
  
It's bloody luxury  
What you mean to me,  
Bloody luxury  
What you do to me  
It's bloody luxury  
What you mean to me,  
'Cause no matter what you do to me  
It's bloody luxury  
Bloody luxury  
  
It's bloody luxury  
What you mean to me,  
Bloody luxury  
Honey what you do to me  
It's bloody luxury  
What you mean to me,  
'Cause no matter what you do to me  
It's bloody luxury  
  
Bloody luxury  
What you mean to me,  
Bloody luxury  
Honey what you do to me  
It's bloody luxury  
What you mean to me,  
'Cause no matter what you do to me,  
No matter what you do to me,  
No matter what you do to me,  
It's bloody luxury  
Bloody luxury  
  
Bloody luxury
