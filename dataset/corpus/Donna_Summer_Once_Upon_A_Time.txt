Once upon a time  
There was a girl  
Who lived in the land  
Of dreams unreal  
  
Hiding from reality  
Treated like a stranger  
Living in her fantasies  
Trapped within their world  
  
Once upon a time  
Her hopes had died  
No one there to hear  
Her futile cries  
  
Living in a house of stone  
No one on her side  
Family in name alone  
No place left to hide  
Aah!  
  
Once upon a time  
Once upon a time  
Once upon a time  
Once upon a time  
  
Once upon a dream  
A man will come  
And give her everything  
She wants and loves  
  
But in the morning  
She'll awake  
To face the room around her  
It's just another lonely day,  
  
And bitterness surrounds her  
Bitterness surrounds her  
Aah!
