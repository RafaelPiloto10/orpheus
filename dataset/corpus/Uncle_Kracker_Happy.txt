You spark the stars, you wear a smile  
Like every day's your birthday  
  
Summertime is in your eyes, even on a rainy Thursday  
Look at you, spinning around  
Like the world's your merry-go-round  
And there's no stopping you now  
  
Wherever you are, I hope that you're laughing  
Whoever you're with, I hope that you're having  
The time of your life and everything's right  
Whatever you wish, I hope that you get it  
When love walks in, I hope that you let it  
And baby be glad when you look back at me  
I'll never be sad as long as you're happy  
  
You leave your mark on every heart  
If no one ever tells ya  
So paint your name on the rain  
The world is your umbrella  
  
Look at you spinning and spinning  
Sometimes goodbye is just the beginning  
  
Wherever you are, I hope that you're laughing  
Whoever you're with, I hope that you're having  
The time of your life and everything's right  
Whatever you wish, I hope that you get it  
When love walks in, I hope that you let it  
Baby be glad when you look back at me  
I'll never be sad as long as you're happy  
  
Look at you, spinning around  
Your feet don't even touch the ground  
  
Wherever you are, I hope that you're laughing  
Whoever you're with, I hope that you're having  
The time of your life and everything's right  
Whatever you wish, I hope that you get it  
When love walks in, I hope that you let it  
Baby be glad when you look back at me  
I'll never be sad, I'll never be sad  
  
Wherever you are, I hope that you're laughing  
Whoever you're with, I hope that you're having  
The time of your life and everything's right  
Whatever you wish, I hope that you get it  
When love walks in, I hope that you let it  
Baby be glad when you look back at me  
I'll never be sad as long as you're happy
