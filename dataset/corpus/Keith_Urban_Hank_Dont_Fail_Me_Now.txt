I had a heck of a time gettin' into my house today  
There was a big ass you-Haul trailer in my way  
And she was headed for the car ...so I grabbed my old guitar  
I got one more chance before she drives away  
So  
  
[Chorus]  
Hank don't fail me now  
You've always bailed me out  
"Your Cheatin' Heart"  
Could set that suitcase down  
Give me one more song to whine  
That'll make her change her mind  
Cause she's walkin' out  
Hank don't fail me now  
  
Yeah she was throwin' stuff, cussin' like a sailor at me  
She was waving her arms around like she was fightin' bees  
If I could yodel her a lick  
That just might do the trick  
If I sang "I Saw The Light" would she believe  
(I don't think so)  
So  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
She's walkin' out  
Hank don't fail me now  
She's walkin' out  
Hank don't fail me now
