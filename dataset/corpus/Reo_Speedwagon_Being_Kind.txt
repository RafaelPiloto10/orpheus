Please don't worry now about the mornin'  
When it's time we'll sip our wine and sleep  
Woah, but I've been known  
To love more than one person  
Woah, and I've been shown  
That bein' kind can hurt someone sometimes  
  
Listen to my words now look no further  
What you've seen is what I mean no more  
Woah, but I've been known  
To love more than one person  
Woah, and I've been shown  
That bein' kind can hurt someone sometimes  
  
Don't dream of answers cause you know I've none to give  
They burn like cancers they just won't let you live  
  
I've been known  
To love more than one person  
And I've been shown  
That bein' kind can hurt someone sometimes  
  
Don't dream of answers cause you know I've none to give  
We move like dancers steppin on each other to live  
And pouncin hard  
Like animals in the yard  
And there's no healin, lookin, feelin  
There's no denyin that bein kind can hurt  
Someone sometimes  
Oh, there's no denyin, woah lord there's no denyin  
That bein' kind can hurt someone sometimes  
(solo)
