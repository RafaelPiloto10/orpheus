You really took me by surprise  
You're someone I've needed for a lifetime  
Your heart was cleverly disguised  
But it didn't look that way in my mind  
  
Tell me how can it be I was the last to know  
Darling I couldn't read what was in your mind  
To turn around and to love me  
  
Chorus  
With no explanation  
I gave you everything I had  
I didn't know that you would take it  
With sweet consideration  
And after all that we've been through  
I can't believe it's true  
Until I hear you say  
  
My mouth is still wet from our last kiss  
Was loving me your one intention  
What were the signs and the times that I missed  
Oh I need you more than I could mention  
  
I won't ever accept you leaving for someone else  
Baby and when something is wrong  
Darling I need to know  
Don't ever leave me  
  
Repeat chorus
