I should have known you'd bid me farewell  
There's a lesson to be learned from this and I've learned it very well  
Now I know you're not the only starfish in the sea  
If I never hear your name again, it's all the same to me  
  
And I think it's gonna be all right  
Yeah, the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
  
You never care for secrets I confide  
To you, I'm just an ornament, something for your pride  
Always running, never caring, that's the life you live  
Stolen minutes of your time were all you had to give  
  
And I think it's gonna be all right  
Yeah, the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
  
The story's in the past with nothing to recall  
I've got my life to live, and I don't need you at all  
The roller coaster ride we took is nearly at an end  
I bought my tickets with my tears, that's all I'm gonna spend  
  
And I think it's gonna be all right  
Yeah, the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
  
And I think it's gonna be all right  
Yeah, the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
It's bouncing and it's shining like a red rubber ball
