You can gamble for match sticks, you can gamble for gold  
The stakes may be heavy or small  
But if you haven't gambled for love and lost, you haven't gambled at all  
  
They call me a moonlight gambler  
I've gambled for love and lost  
When I gamble for love and it isn't in the cards  
Oh, what heartaches it can cost me  
  
Win or lose, I'm a moonlight gambler  
And a winner is what I long to be  
So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live  
Till the day Lady Luck smiles at me  
  
You can gamble for match sticks  
You can gamble for gold  
The stakes may be heavy or small  
But if you haven't gambled for love and lost  
Then you haven't gambled at all  
  
No, if you haven't gambled for love in the moonlight  
Then you haven't gambled at all  
  
So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live  
Till the day Lady Luck smiles at me  
  
They call me the moonlight gambler  
They call me the moonlight gambler
