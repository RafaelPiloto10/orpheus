When I first came to town, people  
I was walking down Hasting Street  
Everybody was talkin' about, Henry Swing Club  
I decided to stop in there for awhile  
And man, when I got there  
Yeah, they were really havin' a ball  
  
Well, I feel so good  
I want to boogie, I want to boogie, I want to boogie  
Well, to the break of day  
(Say, it again)  
  
Well, I feel so good  
I want to boogie, I want to boogie, I want to boogie  
Well, to the break of day  
(Alright)  
  
When I was a young boy  
I was layin' down one night  
And I heard ma and pa talkin'  
I heard pa tell ma  
"Hey, come on, let that boy boogie-woogie  
'Cause you know it's in him  
And it's just got to come out"  
'Cause it's in him  
And it's just got to come out  
  
Well, feels so good, child  
I want to boogie, I want to boogie, I want to boogie  
Lord, 'til the break-a day  
(Chillein', I'm chillin' here)  
  
Well, feels so good, now Lord  
I want to boogie, I want to boogie, I want to boogie  
Yeah-ow, 'til the break of day
