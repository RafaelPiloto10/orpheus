Into Your courts I run  
With praises flowing from my heart  
Everyday I wake  
I sing Your song  
It's the anthem of my life  
  
I want to spend my days  
In Your presence, Lord  
Bowed before Your throne  
In the house of God  
Is where I find my peace  
It's where I find my  
Home is Heaven  
One day Lord I will live  
In Your courts You'll find me  
In worship at Your feet  
Hide me now  
In the shadow of Your wings  
Where I will be  
Where I will be  
  
Your love is all I need  
So desperately I have sought Your face  
I know You hear my every cry  
And petition that I make  
  
Jesus  
Oh, You are my treasure
