I want for to lay down, I'm waiting 'till sundown  
I'm searching the haystacks, water is sunshine, wait for the moment  
The moment between us, the fire is made now, harder to touch  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right with you  
Bakers dozen parades, stand and debate  
Out single file, nine in a row, swear if you must  
Keeping your boots on, float with the now, hot to the touch  
Concrete underground, cast out everyday, the dregs of society  
Underbelly, inside of me, rejoice and follow thee  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right with it, with you  
With...you...  
Yeah  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right
