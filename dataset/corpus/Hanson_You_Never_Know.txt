Whoa, whoa, whoa  
You don't know  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Whoa, whoa  
You don't know  
  
You walk around and, baby, there's something you're missing  
Hallucinations happen in your head  
This look you're giving me is not even focusing  
Something I did or maybe something I said  
  
[Chorus]  
You never know, baby  
You never know, baby  
You never know, baby  
You never know  
You judge us all by the lie that was told, baby  
You never know, baby  
You never know  
  
Yeah  
Whoa, whoa  
You don't know  
  
I speak these words  
But, baby, you don't even listen  
These things I say  
Just going through your head (going through your head)  
I've got my gun,  
But I'm low on ammunition  
I am like a book that is waiting to be read  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you ever wonder?  
Don't you ever wonder, baby  
Who's spell your under?  
Don't you ever wonder, baby?  
Do you ever wonder?  
Don't you ever wonder, baby?  
We've got your number  
Don't you ever wonder?  
  
You never know  
Do you ever know?  
(Do you ever know?)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Whoa, oh  
Whoa, oh  
  
You don't know  
Whoa, what's the source of all this  
Baby, you've been dishin'  
Could they be lies that maybe you've fed (that you fed)?  
Consider well the kind of stream where you've been fishin'  
I'm like a book that's waiting to be read  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, you never know  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
You never know  
(You don't know)  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Whoa, whoa, you don't know
