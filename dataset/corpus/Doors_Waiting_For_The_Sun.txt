At first flash of Eden, we race down to the sea.  
Standing there on freedom's shore.  
  
[Chorus]  
Waiting for the sun  
Waiting for the sun  
Waiting for the sun.  
  
Can you feel it, now that Spring has come,  
That it's time to live in the scattered sun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Waiting for the sun.  
  
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Waiting for you to come along  
Waiting for you to hear my song  
Waiting for you to come along  
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong.  
  
This is the strangest life I've ever known.  
  
Can't you feel it, now that Spring has come,  
That it's time to live in the scattered sun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Waiting for the sun.
