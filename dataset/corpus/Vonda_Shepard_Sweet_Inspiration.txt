I need your sweet inspiration  
I need you here on my mind  
Every hour of the day  
Without your sweet inspiration  
The lonely hours of the night  
Just don't go my way  
A woman in love  
Needs sweet inspiration  
Yeah, and, honey, that's all I ask  
That's all I ask from you  
I've gotta have your sweet inspiration  
You know there just ain't no tellin'  
What a satisfied woman might do  
The way you call me baby, baby  
Is such a sweet inspiration  
The way you call me darlin', darlin'  
Sets my heart to skating  
And if I'm out in the rain, baby  
And in a bad situation  
You know I just reach back in my mind  
And there I find your sweet, sweet inspiration  
Sweet inspiration  
Oh, what a power  
And I've got the power  
Every hour of the day  
I need your sweet inspiration  
To go on, to go on living  
To keep on giving this way  
I need your sweet inspiration  
Sweet inspiration, sweet inspiration, sweet inspiration  
Sweet, sweet inspiration  
Sweet, sweet inspiration  
I need sweet inspiration
