I woke up this morning  
My baby was gone  
I woke up this morning, Lord  
My baby was gone  
I thought that she loved me  
It seems that I'm wrong  
Yes, I am wrong  
  
I cried every night, darling  
For you to come home, yes, I do  
I cried every night, darling  
For you to come home  
I'm feeling so lonely, darling  
I'm left all alone  
Yes, I'm left all alone  
  
I woke up this morning, Lord  
The rain was falling down  
I woke up this morning, Lord  
The rain was falling down  
I'm getting so lonely, darling  
Oh, yeah, baby, I wish I could cry  
Oh, yes, the rain is falling on the ground
