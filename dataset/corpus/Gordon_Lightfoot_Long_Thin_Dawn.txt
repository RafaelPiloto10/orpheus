That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
I've seen the hills of Frisco and the streets of Montreal  
In every town I've been to I've had someone to call  
From Winnipeg to Edmonton, Vancouver to St. Paul  
I've had so many good friends I couldn't miss them all  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Last night I came to Denver beneath the snowcapped ridge  
I thought about my darling as I stood beneath the bridge  
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now she's learned  
That any time I've wandered I always have returned  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Right now I'm on a highway just east of Omaha  
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw  
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill  
All the way to Windsor, we've got some miles to kill  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
While climbing up a hillside, Bill drops her down a gear  
And the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear  
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can  
Driving like the restless wind across this precious land  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Says Bill, "The air is clean tonight", as he puffs a big cigar  
"And if this rig keeps rolling, my boy you'll travel far  
But when you are a trucker you'll come to realize  
The only thing a man can do is watch the world go by"  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again
