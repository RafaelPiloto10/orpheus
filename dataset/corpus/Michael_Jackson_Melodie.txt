I woke up yesterday  
Knowing I was lost and passed away  
I felt my destiny were sad the rain  
Going know her way  
  
There's sound of the melody  
I got song you enchanted me  
And the sound of your voice  
Make my heart keep turn  
To the music got to love that filled my mind  
Melodie, you're my symphony  
All the song to me  
You're my only  
  
Melodie, you're my everything  
Make me want to sing  
For you only  
Oh, oh  
(I see you love me)  
  
The long and winding road  
Is much shorter now that you're here with me  
But when you lend my mind  
Have an answer now love don't hold me  
All the girls have brighten now  
And the darkness is lighter now  
Is my mind I can hear  
The band start to play  
Hello tomorrow  
Goodbye you today  
  
Melodie, you're my symphony  
All the song to me  
You're my only  
  
Melodie, you're my everything  
Make me want to sing  
For you only  
  
Beautiful morning  
Oh happy day  
And you know there's music to my ears  
Every word that you say  
  
Melodie, you're my symphony  
All the song to me  
You're my only  
  
Melodie, you're my everything  
Make me want to sing  
For you only
