Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright  
'cause I only have eyes for you, dear  
The moon may be high  
But I can't see a thing in the sky  
'cause I only have eyes for you.  
  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here, so am I  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
Cause I only have eyes for you  
  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here, so am I  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
Cause I only have eyes for you
