It's been forty days since I heard from you this waiting game  
You put me through  
I feel the silence  
Killing me  
Day to day  
Losin' hope, I lose myself, it's got me thinkin'  
There's someone else  
We need to talk  
You give me metaphors,  
By the way  
What are you tryin' to say  
  
Tryin' to not think about you  
I'm not a dead man walkin' without you  
You know I'll be alright  
I'm showing signs of life  
You left me barely breathin'  
I've had time for the healing  
Now I've opened my eyes  
I'm showing signs of life  
  
Lyin' next to me  
Were you ever mine  
Just wasted love and wasted time  
Did you ever find what you were lookin' for,  
The nights you took my breath away  
I'll miss your love  
Miss your touch, but this holdin' on it hurts too much  
Now it's my time to walk away  
I'll be okay  
  
Tryin' to not think about you  
I'm not a dead man walkin' without you  
You know I'll be alright  
I'm showing signs of life  
You left me barely breathin'  
I've had time for the healing  
Now I've opened my eyes  
I'm showing signs of life  
  
Well, tell your friends that you stole my heart  
But you'll never get a piece of my soul  
You took my love, tore my life apart  
There's more to me than you'll ever know  
  
Tryin' to not think about you  
I'm not a dead man walkin' without you  
You know I'll be alright  
Showing signs of life  
Tryin' to not think about you  
I'm not a dead man walkin' without you  
You know I'll be alright  
I'm showing signs of life  
  
You left me barely breathin'  
I've had time for the healing  
Now I've opened my eyes  
I'm showing signs of life  
Seeing signs of life
