Where you are that's where I want to be  
And through your eyes all the things I want to see  
And in the night you are my dream  
You're everything to me  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the love of my life  
And the breath in my prayers  
Take my hand lead me there  
What I need is you here  
  
I can't forget the taste of your mouth  
From your lips the heavens pour out  
I can't forget when we are one  
With you alone I am free  
  
Everyday every night, you alone  
You're the love of my life  
Everyday, every night, you alone,  
You're the love of my life  
  
We go dancing in the moonlight  
With the starlight in your eyes  
We go dancing till the sunrise  
You and me we're gonna dance, dance, dance
