Who'd believe with the way things are here  
We'd be going anywhere telling people how to live?  
Who'd believe we'd spend more shippin' drugs and guns  
Than to educate our sons? Sorry but that's what they did  
I can't help but think,  
Someone's forsaken you and me  
Luck deserted me and the truth beat out my brains  
Men rise on stepping stones of their selves to higher things  
I've stepped over a lot of bodies on my way  
Thanks for the information don't need no more anything  
We are the damned of all the world with sadness in our hearts  
The wounded of the wars, we've been hung out to dry  
You didn't want us anyway and now we're making up our minds  
You tell us how to run our lives, we run for Youthanasia
