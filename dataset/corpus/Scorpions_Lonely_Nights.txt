Since you're gone  
There is an empty space  
Since you're gone  
The world is not the same  
  
I go back to the places we've been  
It feels like you're still there  
I live all those moments again  
Wishing you were here  
  
Since you're gone  
There is an lonely heart  
Since you're gone  
Nothin' is like it was  
  
There are memories all over the place  
Bringin' it back all so clear  
Remember all of those days  
Wishing you were here  
  
All those lonely nights  
I gotta fight for you, yes I do  
Yes I do  
  
Since you're gone  
There is a heart that bleeds  
Since you're gone  
I'm not the man I used to be  
  
I follow you steps in the snow  
The traces disappear  
We know what we've lost when it's gone  
I'm wishing you were here  
  
All those lonely nights  
I gotta fight for you, yes I do  
Yes I do
