I've been through ups and downs  
I haven't known which way to turn  
And when I wander through this town  
I only think of you  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
On the day that I was born  
The cards were dealt, the dice were thrown  
I think my destiny was drawn  
I can only be with you  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
In My heart is only you.  
  
And my soul is all there too  
  
I built myself a prison cell  
The walls are painted blue  
Only you can let me out  
Only you  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good, girl  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
Only you, only you
