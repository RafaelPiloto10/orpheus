I've changed my hair, my clothes, almost  
Everything about myself  
I can't believe I tried to be somebody I'm not  
For someone else, yeah  
It took finding you to finally understand  
What it's like to be loved for who I am  
  
Me  
That's all I have to give  
What you get is what you see, yeah  
No second guessing, no pretending  
With you, all I ever have to be is me  
  
I can laugh or cry, don't have to hide  
The way I feel  
Rain or shine, by my side proving we've got  
A love that's real  
An old pair of jeans or an evening gown  
You still see the same girl that you found  
  
Me  
That's all I have to give  
What you get is what you see, yeah  
No second guessing, no pretending  
With you, all I ever have to be is me  
  
Me  
That's all I have to give  
What you get is what you see, yeah  
No second guessing, no pretending  
With you, all I ever have to be is me  
All I ever need to be, oh yeah  
All I ever have to be is me
