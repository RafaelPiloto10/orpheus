Feel the way it goes when the words have left the mark  
With the promise of tomorrow,  
That tricks and leaves you in the dark  
There's something in the air,  
And there's something rising up  
Not one but a million that have had enough  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey,yo, no  
I'm not good at going away  
I got something more to say  
Kickin', screaming, it knocks you down, it knocks you down  
Hey yo, go, underneath we'll tear you down  
Secrets from the underground,  
Ain't gonna stop so far!  
  
This is not an anthem,  
Or a threat in someone's name  
But a promise that tomorrow  
Will rock and burn, and things won't change!  
There's something in the air,  
There's something rising up  
Not one but a million that have had enough!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Underneath we'll tear you down  
Oh, oh, oh, secrets from the underground  
  
Hey, no, no  
I'm not good at going away  
I got something more to say  
Kickin', screaming, it knocks you down, it knocks you down  
Hey yo, go, underneath we'll tear you down  
Secrets from the underground,  
Ain't gonna stop so far!  
Hey yo, go  
Hey yo, go  
Secrets from the underground,  
Ain't gonna stop so far!
