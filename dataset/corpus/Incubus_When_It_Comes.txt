It's comin' around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
It's comin' around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
When it comes  
It comes abrupt  
  
When it feels, it feels like trading brains with an imbecil, for real  
Yes I feel empathetic about not being static  
And not buying philosophies that are sold to me at a steal  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to think  
In comes mental piracy  
What I'm looking for cannot be sold to me  
I wish they all would stop trying  
?Cause what I want and what I need  
Is and always will be free  
  
It's comin' around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
It's comin' around again  
When it comes  
It comes unannounced  
  
And it feels like a matador is taunting me  
With his reddest red cloth and I am the bull  
Yes I feel empathetic about not being static  
And not eating the bullshit that's being fed to me no more  
?Cause now I'm full  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to think  
In comes mental piracy  
What I ?m looking for cannot be sold to me  
I wish they all would stop trying  
?Cause what I want and what I need  
Is and will always be free
