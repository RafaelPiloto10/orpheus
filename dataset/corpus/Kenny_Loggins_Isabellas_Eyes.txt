Somewhere out in space  
A moonlit face was watching  
Lookin' to find a time to become.  
Slowly two lovers lay hypnotized  
Holding the moment in their eyes.  
World in changes.  
Lightly one by one,  
We try to hide the mirrors.  
But baby they just keep turnin' up  
And I know you can't look away from you  
When you're lookin' in into  
[CHORUS]  
Isabella's eyes  
Shine your light and make your mama smile.  
All our angels come  
To welcome the awakening one  
Awakening wonder  
(Repeat Chorus after second verse, then go down to 3rd verse)  
(Repeat Chorus after third verse)  
Once I met a man who knew where he was goin'  
And let everybody tag along.  
But suddenly love had another plan.  
Shook him and took him by the hand.  
World in changes.  
'N' there's a boy I know  
Believes that he's in danger  
He'll never give up without a fight.  
If you open your heart  
There's no way to lose  
So just surrender to  
[BACK TO CHORUS]  
Millions of dreams are part of the plan,  
But you are the one dream that's real.  
This changes everything  
Now that I am  
In the spell of Isabella's eyes.  
[BACK TO CHORUS]
