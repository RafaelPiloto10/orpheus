The treetops, the chimneys, the snowbed stories, winter grey  
Wildflowers, those meadows of heaven, wind in the wheat  
  
A railroad across waters, the scent of grandfatherly love  
Blue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly's wings  
  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door  
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there  
Where's the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare  
  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for  
Before the years take me  
I wish to see  
The lost in me  
  
I want my tears back  
I want my tears back now  
  
A ballet on a grove, still growing young all alone  
A rag doll, a best friend, the voice of Mary Costa
