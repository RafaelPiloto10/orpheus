I got off the airplane 'long about 7:30 in L.A.  
What a drag to realize that everything's so different and so same  
All my California friends are searchin' for their minds and it's been right
there in their heads all the time  
  
[Chorus]  
L.A. Blues, L.A. Blues  
You want me to be like you  
Well, there ain't no way  
  
California Charlie met me at my room when I got in  
We toasted country pickin' and the health of all our good and mutual friends  
Before the mornin' came we put a handle on the world and decided that we'd
give it to the squirrels  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Soakin' up that sunshine an' eatin' eggs and bacon over light  
Sleepin' through the daytime an' contemplatin' sin throughout the night  
Please hand me my hat and darlin' give me back my things Ol' T's got a bunch
o' songs to sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I like California, I wouldn't put it down-- no way  
But I heard what you're thinkin' and it ain't exactly what I want to say  
Some day California I'll come roarin' back to you if you don't fall in the
ocean 'fore I do  
  
[Chorus]
