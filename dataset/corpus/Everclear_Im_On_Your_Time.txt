I'm on your time,  
Yeah you do that blue spark too,  
I do those that I fought,  
No one can push my buttons like you do.  
  
My weak arms can't hope to hold you,  
I'm on your time.  
  
Yeah I'm on your time,  
Yeah you really give me quite a muse,  
I say "I wish that you could just get over yourself", yeah yeah,  
You say we're in this for the abuse.  
  
I'm a reckless mile behind you,  
Baby you know I get so violent sometimes,  
My weak arms can't hope to hold you,  
I'm on your time.  
  
Yeah we will never forget,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget,  
What we do to each other,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget.  
  
Yeah we will never forget,  
No we will never forget.  
  
Oh I'm on your time,  
You said we can't go on this way,  
I say I wish that you could fix this broken thing in me,  
Cause there'll be a happy happy day,  
I'm a reckless mile behind you,  
Baby you know I get so fucked up inside,  
My weak arms can't hope to hold you,  
I'm on your time.  
  
Yeah yeah yeah,  
I'm on your time,  
Woah woah woah,  
I'm on your time.  
  
No,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget,  
What we do to each other,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget.
