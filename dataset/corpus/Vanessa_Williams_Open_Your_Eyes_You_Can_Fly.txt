Never be afraid to love  
Never be afraid to just be  
Just cast away the chains of doubt  
Have the courage to be free  
  
Don't cloud your rise with father's lies  
See only what you want to see  
To supplicate the simple truth  
Have the courage to be free  
  
Open your eyes you can fly  
Open your eyes you can fly  
You can fly (uh uh)  
You can fly  
  
Never be afraid to love (no, no, no)  
Never be afraid to just be  
Cast away the chains of doubt  
Have the courage to be free  
  
Open your eyes you can fly (fly away)  
Open your eyes you can fly  
You can fly (fly, fly, fly)  
  
Open your eyes (yeah) you can fly (fly away)  
Open your eyes you can fly  
You can fly (mhh)  
You can fly (fly away mhhm)  
  
Remember,  
You can't wait for others to applaud what you do  
So just congratulate yourself  
And start something new  
  
Open your eyes you can fly (open your eyes)  
Open your eyes you can fly (you can fly with me)  
You can fly (fly)  
  
Open your eyes (eyes) you can fly (baby yeah)  
Open your eyes (fly away with never) you can fly (fly away with never)  
You can fly  
You can fly (mhh fly away way way)  
  
Open your eyes (open your eyes) you can fly  
Open your eyes (baby) you can fly  
You can fly (no open this)  
  
Open your eyes
