The fish swam  
Out of the ocean  
And grew legs  
And they started walking  
And the apes climbed down  
From the trees  
And grew tall  
And they started talking  
  
And the stars  
Fell out of the sky  
And my tears  
Rolled into the ocean  
Now I'm looking  
For a reason why  
You even set my world  
Into motion  
  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then the stars  
Don't even matter  
Now I'm filled  
To the top with fear  
But it's all  
Just a bunch of matter  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then I don't want  
To be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold  
Black and gold  
Black and gold  
  
I looked up  
Into the grey sky  
And see a thousand eyes  
Staring back  
And all around  
These golden beacons  
I see nothing but black  
  
I feel a way of something  
Beyond them  
I don't see  
What I can feel  
If vision  
Is the only validation  
Then most of my life  
Isn't real  
  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then the stars  
Don't even matter  
Now I'm filled  
To the top with fear  
But it's all  
Just a bunch of matter  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then I don't want  
To be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold  
Black and gold  
Black and gold
