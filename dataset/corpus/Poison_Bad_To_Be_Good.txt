There's an alley cat slowly walkin' down a dirty street  
Watching a cop on the take marching to his city beat  
You got Five-fingers Johnny stealing everything in sight  
You gotta be bad to be good in the dead of the night  
Kick it  
  
You're dancing in fire, baby  
When you're takin' it to the streets  
Yeah, to the streets  
Baby, better watch your back  
Fast on your feet  
  
'Cause they're wheelin', dealin'  
Cheatin', stealin'  
Child, you're gonna learn  
  
[Chorus]  
You gotta be bad to be good  
If you know what I'm talkin' about  
What's that?  
So I say it again  
You gotta be bad to be good  
In the dead of the night  
  
When you got nothin', baby  
You got nothin' to lose, nothin' to lose  
It's an eye for an eye, baby  
And a tooth for a tooth  
Ain't it the truth?  
  
If you got nine lives, you might survive  
'Cause nothing's free on the other side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wheelin', dealin', cheatin', stealin'  
Just to stay alive  
They got love for sale, yes, for sale  
On the New York subway line  
Watch the working girls hanging out  
Turning tricks underneath the lights  
The lights  
  
One step from Hell  
The poor men sell their soul  
For a taste of wine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When it's said and done  
And you're on the run  
And the only law comes under the gun
