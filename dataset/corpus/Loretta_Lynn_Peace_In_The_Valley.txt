Oh well I'm tired and so weary but I must go along  
Till my Lord comes and calls me calls me away oh yes  
Oh well the morning's so bright and the lamb is the light  
And the night night is as black as the sea oh yes  
There will be peace peace in the valley for me some day  
There will be peace in the valley for me oh Lord I pray  
There'll be no sadness no sorrow no troubles I'll see  
There will be peace peace in the valley for me  
  
Well the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame  
And the lion shall lay down down by the lamb oh yes  
And the beast from the wild will be lead by little child  
And I'll be changed changed from this creature that I am oh yes  
There will be peace
