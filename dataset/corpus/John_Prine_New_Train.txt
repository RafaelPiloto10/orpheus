Full blown silence in an empty room  
A former bride and a former groom  
A folding table and a folding chair  
A folded hand of poker there  
All new directions must go everywhere  
Big round people in a cool little square  
You can't cut it with a boat or a plane  
Man it's gonna take a new train  
  
You'll be leaving on a new train  
Far away from this world of pain  
And when you look out your window you'll see  
Your home your baby and your family  
No melted ice cube in a paper cup  
Hell you'll be happy you'll be all shook up  
The friends that greet you will be  
Simple and plain  
When you step down from that new train  
  
Collected volumes of history say  
Man makes mistakes most everyday  
The half a pound of chopped ground round  
Is still a burger when it goes downtown  
No faded photographs of yesterdays  
Are in the books that I read these days  
To fly away from that memory town  
You must keep both your feet on the ground  
  
Cause you'll be leaving on a new train  
Far away from this world of pain  
And when you look out your window you'll see  
Your home your baby and your family  
No melted ice cube in a paper cup  
Hell you'll be happy you'll be all shook up  
The friends that greet you will be  
Simple and plain  
When you step down from that new train  
  
I'll be leaving on a new train  
Far away from this world of pain  
The friends that greet me will be  
Simple and plain  
When I step down from that new train  
New train, new train.
