The system's got too much control, and they don't wanna let it go  
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, I'm breaking out of captivity  
  
[Chorus]  
Be free, be free  
To be free  
  
Little by little, I'm losing control  
As little by little my rights erode  
I stop the deputy, now you know  
Mama don't try, you see I got to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The government's got too much control,  
Now is there some place that we can roll  
The politics of fear and oppression is everywhere now  
The law is closing in, just take what you can bring  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The system's got too much control,  
Now is there some place that we can roll  
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, the law is closing in  
Just take what we can bring
