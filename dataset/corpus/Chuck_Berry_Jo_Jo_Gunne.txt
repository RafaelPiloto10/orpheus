It was in ancient history, four thousand B.C.  
Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree  
Hanging on a branch up under the sun  
Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne  
Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain  
To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain  
Jo Jo the monkey started tellin' him jive  
About the elephant who was gonna skin him alive  
Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jo's tail  
Got mad and went roarin' through the jungle trail  
He ran upon an elephant beneath a tree  
And said, put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me  
An ol' eagle from Asia made a non stop flight  
Tryin' to make it in time, just to see them fight  
A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge  
Coming all the way from India on a local barge  
Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den  
But Jo Jo bet him three bucks the elephant wins  
Jo Jo yelled at Leo, Go on, knock him down  
He don't outweigh you but a thousand pounds  
Leo left wailin' with a left upper cut  
The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut  
Leo fired a beautiful short back cross  
That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw  
Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in  
The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in  
The buzzard said, they fought furious all day  
He couldn't understand how Leo got away  
Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news  
To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos  
A hoot owl reported everything he saw  
Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw  
Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised  
Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues  
Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down  
Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground  
Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat  
Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet  
Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes  
Said, please mister Leo, I apologize  
Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground  
I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds  
Leo got back to the square of the fight  
Jo Jo took a leap and jumped... out of sight
