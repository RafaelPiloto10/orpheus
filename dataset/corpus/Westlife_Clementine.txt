In a cavern down by a canyon  
Excavatin' for a mine,  
There lived a miner from North Carolina  
And his daughter, chubby Clementine.  
  
Now every mornin', just about dawnin'  
A'when the sun begins to shine  
You know she would rouse up, wake all a dem cows up  
And walk 'em down to her Daddy's mine.  
  
A'took the foot bridge, way 'cross the water  
Though she weighed two-ninety nine.  
The old bridge trembled and disassembled  
(Oops!) dumped her into the foamy brine.  
  
Hey, crackle like thunder, (ho, ho) she went under  
(ho, ho) blowin bubbles (bubble sound) down the line.  
Hey, I'm no swimm'a but were she slimm'a  
I might'a saved that Clementine.  
  
(Ho) broke the record, way under water  
I thought that she was doin' fine.  
I wasn't nervous ya until the service  
That they held for Clementine.  
  
Hey you sailor (ho, ho) way out in your whaler  
With a harpoon, your trusty line.  
If she shows now, yo, there she blows now,  
It just may be chunky Clementine.  
  
(One more time)  
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin'  
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin' sweet Clementine,  
You may be gone  
But!  
You're not forgotten,  
Fare thee well  
So long, Clementine  
(Bubble sound) Bye!
