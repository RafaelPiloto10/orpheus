Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and far away  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
The shepherds all were watching  
Over their sheep at night  
When a guiding star shone from heaven  
And the followed that holy light  
  
Got tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
They found a lovely manger  
Where the humble Christ was born  
And God sent out salvation  
On that blessed Christmas morn  
  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
He brought with Him forgiveness  
He live to show us the way  
He came to redeem all creation  
And to wash all our sins away  
  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born
