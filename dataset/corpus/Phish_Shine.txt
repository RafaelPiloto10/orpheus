Give me a word and give me a sign  
Show me where to go and tell what will I find  
What will I find?  
  
Lay me on the ground and fly me through the air  
Show me where to go and tell me will love be there?  
Will love be there?  
  
Yeah  
  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down
