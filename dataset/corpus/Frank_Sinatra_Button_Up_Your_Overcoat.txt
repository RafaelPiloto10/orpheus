Listen, big boy  
Now that you got me made  
Goodness, but I'm afraid  
Somethin's gonna happen to you!  
Listen, big boy  
You gotta be hooked, and how  
I would die if I should lose you now!  
Button up your overcoat  
When the wind is free  
Take good care of yourself  
You belong to me!  
Eat an apple every day  
Get to bed by three  
Oh, take good care of yourself  
You belong to me!  
Be careful crossing streets, ooh-ooh  
Cut out sweets, ooh-ooh  
Lay off meat, ooh-ooh  
You'll get a pain and ruin your tum-tum!  
Wear your flannel underwear  
When you climb a tree  
Oh, take good care of yourself  
You belong to me!  
Button up your overcoat  
When the wind is free  
Oh, take good care of yourself  
You belong to me!  
Boop-boop-a-doop!  
When you sass a traffic cop  
Use diplomacy  
Just take good care of yourself  
You belong to me!  
Beware of frozen funds, ooh-ooh  
Stocks and bonds, ooh-ooh  
Dockside thugs, ooh-ooh  
You'll get a pain and ruin your bankroll!  
Keep the spoon out of your cup  
When you're drinking tea  
Oh, take good care of yourself  
You belong to me!  
Don't sit on hornet's tails, ooh-ooh!  
Or on nails, ooh-ooh!  
Or third rails, ooh-ooh!  
You'll get a pain and ruin your tum-tum!  
Keep away from bootleg hooch  
When you're on a spree  
You belong to me!
