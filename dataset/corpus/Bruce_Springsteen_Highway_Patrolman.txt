My name is Joe Roberts I work for the state  
I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville barracks number eight  
I always done an honest job as honest as I could  
I got a brother named Frankie and Frankie ain't no good  
  
Now ever since we was young kids it's been the same come down  
I get a call over the radio Frankie's in trouble downtown  
Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away  
But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way  
  
Yeah me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin'  
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band  
Played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"  
  
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother would  
Man turns his back on his family well he just ain't no good  
  
Well Frankie went in the army back in 1965  
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife  
But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we were gettin'  
Robbed  
Frankie came home in '68, and me, I took this job  
  
Yeah we're laughin' and drinkin'  
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band  
Played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"  
  
I catch him when he's strayin' teach him how to walk that line  
Man turns his back on his family he ain't no friend of mine  
  
Well the night was like any other, I got a call 'bout quarter to nine  
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line  
There was a kid lyin' on the floor lookin' bad bleedin' hard from his head  
There was a girl cry'n' at a table and it was Frank, they said  
  
Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights  
Well I musta done one hundred and ten through Michigan county that night  
It was out at the crossroads, down 'round Willow bank  
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates. Behind the wheel was Frank  
  
Well I chased him through them county roads  
Till a sign said "Canadian border five miles from here"  
I pulled over the side of the highway and watched his tail-lights disappear  
  
Me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin'  
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band  
Played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"
