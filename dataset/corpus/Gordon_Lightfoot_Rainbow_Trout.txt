In the name of love she came  
This foolish winsome girl  
She was all decked out like a rainbow trout  
Swimmin' up stream in the world  
And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way  
The current is too strong  
In the name of love, kind sir I pray,  
In the name of love"  
  
So I took her by the hand,  
She took me by the will  
She was all dolled up like a blue eyed pup  
Looking for something to spill  
And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way  
The current is too strong  
In the name of love, kind sir I pray,  
In the name of love"  
  
In the name of love she came  
This foolish winsome girl  
She was all decked out like a rainbow trout  
Swimmin' upstream in the world  
And she gave one flip  
Of the rainbow tip of her tail  
And she swam back down  
  
And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way  
The current is too strong  
In the name of love, kind sir I pray,  
In the name of love
