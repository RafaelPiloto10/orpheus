Just look my way  
And I'm ready to go  
Oooo-oo-oo, your sweet lovin'  
I can't leave it alone  
You start my heart to pumpin'  
Just walkin' my way  
I don't care if I feel like a fool  
Ohh, sweet feelin'  
Got me rockin' and a reelin'  
Actin' like a fool  
Ohh, sweet feelin'  
Got me rockin' and really in love  
Well, I know it's always said  
That love will break your heart  
That ain't so  
'Cause I gave my heart to you  
And now I know  
Ooooo, Sweet feelin'  
Got me dancin' on the ceiling  
Actin' like a fool  
I don't care if I feel like a fool  
It's just a, ohh, sweet feelin'  
Got me rockin' and a reelin'  
Actin' like a fool  
Ohh, sweet feelin'  
Got me rockin' and really in love...
