Hooded in the mists of time in distant lands of dust  
Here they live and forge the steel that carves out human lust  
Thulsa doom his flesh and bone control of all that's fake  
Lifting head and staring eyes that guide the sinful snakes  
The truth that lies within the riddle of steel  
Where all our lives begin the riddle of steel  
Armies of followers who are guided by his throne  
Blindly walk to Thulsa's steps that foot the black kings home  
On and on the warrior that stalks the beast that killed  
The families of his friends and foe that fall unto his will  
The truth that lies within the riddle of steel  
Where all our lives begin the riddle of steel  
Snakes that come together over palaces of pain  
Gates of flesh that open up to let in acid rain  
All the smells of blasphemy are deep within this hall  
Writhing here in ecstasy awaiting Thulsa's call  
Stretching out and forged in steel a blade drwn from his arm  
Searching for the sacred neck to cure the world of harm  
Slashing through the snakelike scales deep into the core  
Splitting into bone and blood and settling the score  
The truth that lies within the riddle of steel  
Where all our lives begin the riddle of steel  
Steel steel steel steel steel steel steel steel steel
