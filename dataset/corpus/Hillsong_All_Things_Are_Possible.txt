Almighty God, my Redeemer  
My Hiding Place, my Safe Refuge  
No other name like Jesus  
No power can stand against You.  
  
My feet are planted on this Rock  
And I will not be shaken  
My hope it comes from You alone  
My Lord and my salvation.  
  
Chorus:  
  
Your praise is al - ways on my lips  
Your word is living in my heart  
And I will praise You with a new song  
My soul will bless You, Lord  
You fill my life with greater joy  
Yes, I delight myself in You  
And I will praise You with a new song  
My soul will bless You, Lord.  
  
Bridge:  
  
When I'm weak  
You make me strong  
When I'm poor, I know I'm rich  
For in the power of Your name  
All things are possible  
All things are possible  
All things are possible  
All things are possible
