I would have waited all my life  
Just to make love out of something other than spite  
But the beauty is the beast you're baiting  
Should really be worth the waiting  
  
[Chorus:]  
You do something very special to  
Mr. Average  
Now the lamb lies with the lion  
He's just a little savage  
  
And so you turn your back on me  
And all the hot air that only echoes stale tobacco  
  
Actions speak louder now than words  
By just a fraction  
What's the use of saying I love you whe I'm drinking to distraction  
We save our sanity  
By saying such and such  
After all its been discussed  
You say you must be touched  
  
[Chorus]
