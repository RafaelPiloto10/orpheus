We're ready to go  
Ticking like a bomb that's about to blow  
It's taking control  
Pulling at your feet like an undertow  
You don't really know  
If you're all that capable  
But you've been told  
  
Figure it out  
Don't pretend you're stupid  
Sort it out  
Go make yourself useful  
  
You're better than dead  
You really made a mess with the words you said  
So easily fed  
The flames of the fire rise above your head  
They want to be led  
You've joined the ranks instead  
There's a voice in your head  
  
I can't figure it out  
Any more than the generation before me  
I can't figure it out  
How we got where we are today  
I can't figure it out  
Any more than the generation before me  
I can't figure it out  
We've got to fight not to fade away
