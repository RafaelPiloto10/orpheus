Love you so much, can't count all the ways  
I'd die for you girl, and all they can say is  
"He's not your kind"  
  
They never get tired of puttin' me down  
And I never know when I come around  
What I'm gonna find  
Don't let them make up your mind  
Don't you know  
  
Girl, you'll be a woman soon  
Please come take my hand  
Girl, you'll be a woman soon  
Soon you'll need a man  
  
I've been misunderstood for all of my life  
But what they're sayin', girl, just cuts like a knife  
"The boy's no good"  
  
Well, I finally found what I've been looking for  
But if they get the chance, they'll end it for sure  
Sure they would  
Baby, I've done all I could  
It's up to you  
  
Girl, you'll be a woman soon  
Please come take my hand  
Girl, you'll be a woman soon  
Soon you'll need a man
