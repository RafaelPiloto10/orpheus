He rocks in the treetops all the day long  
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singing this song  
Every little bird, every little bee  
Loves to hear the robin go tweet-tweet-tweet

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee  
Every little bird in the old oak tree  
Wise old owl, big black crow  
Put out their wings singing go bird go

The chief bird standing at the birdbath stand  
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand  
Start goin' steady and bless my soul,  
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
