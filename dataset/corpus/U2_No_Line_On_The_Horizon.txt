I know a girl who's like the sea  
I watch her changing every day for me  
Oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
One day she's still, the next she swells  
You can hear the universe in her sea shells  
Oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
No, no line on the horizon, no line  
  
I know a girl with a hole in her heart  
She said infinity is a great place to start  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
She said "Time is irrelevant, it's not linear"  
Then she put her tounge in my ear  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
No, no line on the horizon, no line  
No, no line  
No, no line on the horizon, no line  
No, no line  
  
The songs in your head are now on my mind  
You put me on pause  
I'm trying to rewind and replay  
Every night I have the same dream  
I'm hatching some plot, scheming some scheme  
Oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I'm traffic cop, due de marais  
The sirens are wailing but it's me that wants to get away  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
No, no line on the horizon, no line  
No, no line  
No, no line on the horizon, no line  
No, no line
