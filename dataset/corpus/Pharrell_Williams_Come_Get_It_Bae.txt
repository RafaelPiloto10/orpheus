You miss me?

All of you girls standin' together like that, I can't take it  
  
Women, I can do anything you like  
I can do anything you need  
Ain't I got a better body  
Than the magazines you read  
  
None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy  
And if they tried, they can not do it just like me  
  
I know you certainly been gone  
And it's been much too long  
And there's some things we need to do  
So I know you need to get home  
  
Come get it bae  
Come get it bae  
Come get it bae

Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high too  
Take it easy on the clutch, 'cause girl I like you  
  
I can see it the way you like  
I can do anything you need  
I can give you dirty looks  
Like them niggas on Soul TV  
  
None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy  
And if they tried, they can not do it just like me  
  
I know you certainly been gone  
And it's been much too long  
And there's some things we need to do  
So I know you need to get home

You'll need a sugar please, baby  
There comes a time, and you won't believe what you'll do  
When that sugar's callin' you  
Girl, this is Sho-time, this is where you wanna be

And there will come a time, this is where you wanna be  
'Cause it's everything you need, you were lonely mindin' me
