Baby, It's alright  
Stop your cryin' now  
  
Nothing is here to stay  
Everything has to begin and end  
A ship in a bottle won't sail  
All we can do is dream that the  
Wind will blow us across the water  
A ship in a bottle set sail  
  
Baby, It's alright  
Stop your cryin' now  
  
There was a weakling man  
Who dreamed he was strong as a hurricane  
A ship in a bottle set sail  
He took a deep breath and blew across the world  
He watched everything crumble  
Woke up a weakling again  
  
Some might tell you there's no hope in hand  
Just because they feel hopeless  
But you don't have to be a thing like that  
You'll be a ship in a bottle set sail  
  
Baby' It's alright stop your cryin' now  
It's alright so stop your cryin' now  
  
You'll be a ship in a bottle set sail
