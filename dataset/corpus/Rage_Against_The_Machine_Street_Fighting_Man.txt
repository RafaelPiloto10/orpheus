Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy  
'Cause summers here and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy  
Tell me what can a poor boy do  
'Cept for sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
'Cause in this sleepy L.A. town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
A street fighting man  
  
Do you think the time is right for a palace revolution  
Where I live the game to play is compromise solution  
Well then what can a poor boy do  
'Cept for sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
'Cause in this sleepy L.A. town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man  
  
A street fighting man (x3)  
  
Well what else can a poor boy do? (x4)  
  
Hey my name is called disturbance  
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants  
Well what can a poor boy do  
For sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
In this sleepy L.A. town  
There's just no place for  
For a street fighting man  
  
A street fighting man  
For a street fighting man  
A street fighting man  
For a street fighting man  
A street fighting man  
For a street fighting man  
A street fighting man  
For a street fighting man  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
A street fighting man
