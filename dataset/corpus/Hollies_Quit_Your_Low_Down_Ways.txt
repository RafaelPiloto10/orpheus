Oh, you can read out of your Bible  
You can fall down on your knees  
Pretty mama, and pray to the Lord  
But it ain't gonna do you no good  
You're gonna need  
You're gonna need my help someday  
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'  
Please quit your lowdown ways  
Well, you can run down to the White House  
You can gaze at the Capitol Dome  
Pretty mama, you can pound on the President's gate  
It'll do you no good  
You're gonna need  
You're gonna need my help someday  
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'  
Please quit your lowdown ways  
Well, you can run down to the desert  
Throw yourself on the burnin' sand  
You can raise up your right hand, pretty mama  
But you better understand  
You're gonna need  
You're gonna need my help someday  
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'  
Please quit your lowdown ways  
You can hitch hike on the highways  
You can stand alone by the side of the road  
You can try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama  
But you can't ride in my car  
You're gonna need  
You're gonna need my help someday  
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'  
Please quit your lowdown ways  
Oh, you can read out of your Bible  
You can fall down on your knees  
Pretty mama, and pray to the Lord  
But it ain't gonna do you no good  
You're gonna need  
You're gonna need my help someday  
Well, if you can't quit your sinnin'  
Please quit your lowdown ways  
Quit your lowdown ways  
Quit your lowdown ways  
Quit your lowdown ways  
Quit your lowdown ways  
Quit your lowdown ways  
Quit your lowdown ways  
Quit your lowdown ways  
Quit your lowdown ways
