Laid back and wasted driven to drinking a woman ain't nothing to lose  
Don't ever doubt it I'll live without it I'll give you the blues  
I spent a lifetime looking for the answers somewhere in search of my soul  
I lost it in Nashville I found it in Austin I sold it in New Mexico  
Ten thousand miles of road dust can't cover the scars that I put on my arm  
And the bridges I'm burning will never erase the scars that they've put on my
heart  
Dying looks easy drifting gets harder I don't know which one to choose  
Don't ever doubt it I'll live without it I'll give you the blues  
Laid back and wasted driven to drinking a woman ain't nothing to lose  
Don't ever doubt it I'll live without it I'll give you the blues  
Don't ever doubt it I'll live without it I'll give you the blues
