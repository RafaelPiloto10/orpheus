Yeah  
Uh, uh  
Uh  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
There could be dark clouds up over me, yeah  
Still I know I can stand tall, yeah  
And I can be the only man in the middle of the sea  
And still somehow I wouldn't feel small, no, no  
  
Ever since I found you, baby, it's been my attitude,  
Yes, it has  
I wouldn't trade you for the world, uh-uh  
If I bet my money on you, baby, I would never lose, no  
'Cause you're my inspiration, girl  
With you by my side, I believe  
  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Yes, I  
(I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(I believe) Yes, I  
  
Now there could be a roadblock right in front of me,  
Mmm  
And it wouldn't be in my way, no  
Even if they locked me up and threw away the key, yeah  
Somehow I know it would be okay, yeah  
  
'Cause ever since I met you, girl, I've been positive,  
Oh, yes  
You gave me a reason why, yes, you did  
I kinda gave up on life, but now I wanna live, yeah  
'Cause in the tunnel you were my light  
And with you by my side, I believe  
  
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe, yeah  
(I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Woo I  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(I believe) Oh, ho, I believe  
  
And I remember when I wrote this song  
It was at a time when I, I couldn't go wrong  
But since I met you  
  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Said I  
(I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Yeah  
(I believe) Yes, I, when the clouds are hanging over  
Us, woo  
  
(Oh, I believe) And the going's tough  
(Oh, I believe) I  
(I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) If we stand tall, yeah  
(Oh, I believe) I believe, yeah  
(I believe) I believe  
  
(Oh, I believe) I believe, yeah  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(I believe) Oh, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Whoa, oh, I believe  
(I believe) I believe, Yes, I do  
  
(Oh, I believe) If the mountain's too high and the  
Valley's too low  
(Oh, I believe) We can do all things  
(I believe) If we believe  
(Oh, I believe) Ho, whoa, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Hey, yea, ey, yea  
(I believe) Hey, I believe  
  
(Oh, I believe) Said America  
(Oh, I believe) America

(Oh, I believe)
