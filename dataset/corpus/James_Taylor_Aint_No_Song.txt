There ain't no melody and I can't find a harmony.  
If there were a way to say it, you know I would have played it.  
Well, I'm a man of few words, trying to find a rhyme  
And finally it occurred to me that I'm wasting my time.  
  
There ain't no rhyme or reason, ain't no time or season,  
Ain't no way around it, I know I would have found it.  
There ain't no song in the whole wide world could hardly sing without you.  
There ain't no song in the whole wide world to tell you the way that I feel.  
  
Painters use their eyes to show us what they see  
But when that canvas dries we all see it differently.  
There ain't black or white, there ain't no day or night.  
There ain't no way around it, y.ou know I would have found it  
  
There ain't no song in the whole wide world could hardly sing without you.  
There ain't no song in the whole wide world to tell you the way that I feel.  
No, no, no, I might as well pack it on up,  
Not even this song's gonna tell you the way that I feel.
