When I was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw  
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw  
If I had known it would be like this I might have given it a second thought  
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have
bought  
  
Look at me  
I'm the great white hope  
Can't you see  
I'm up against the ropes  
Don't you know  
It's so hard to cope  
When you feel  
Like the great white hope  
  
Now you've paid your money you're sitting in your ringside seat  
And I know that some of you out there, might want to see the champ get beat  
If I had known it would be like this I might have given it a second thought  
But real life sure isn't like school, there's some lessons that just can't be
taught  
  
Look at me  
I'm the great white hope  
Can't you see  
I'm up against the ropes  
Don't you know  
It's so hard to cope  
When you feel  
Like the great white hope
