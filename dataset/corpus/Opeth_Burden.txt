I once upon a time  
Carried a burden inside  
Some will ask goodbye  
A broken line but underlined  
There's an ocean of sorrow in you  
  
Sorrow in me  
  
Saw movement in their eyes  
Said I no longer knew the way  
Given up the ghost  
A passing minds and its a fear  
And the wait for redemption ahead  
  
Waiting to fade  
  
Fading again  
  
If death should take me now  
Count my mistakes and let me through  
Whisper in my ear  
Taken more than we've received  
And the ocean of sorrow is you
