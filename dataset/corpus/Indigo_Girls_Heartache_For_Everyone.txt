You spent five years saying you'd come my way  
Well that's a little more waiting than a heart can take  
Yeah but now that I know it's just a fantasy  
I feel a hard time coming around for me  
  
I said oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
There's a heartache for everyone  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
There's a heartache for everyone  
  
I spent two years saying give me a chance  
(oh oh oh)  
Yeah clean it all up and I'll take your hand  
(oh oh oh)  
But not forever it was understood  
(oh oh oh)  
Yeah but just for a while, it would do us some good (oh oh oh)  
  
I said oh  
(I'm waiting)  
Oh oh  
(to restore)  
Oh oh  
(my love)  
There's a heartache for everyone  
(I'm waiting)  
Oh oh  
(to restore)  
Oh oh  
(my faith)  
There's a heartache for everyone  
I'll wait for you until I know  
There's a heartache for everyone  
  
Hey valentine I'm just a stumbling around  
Who knew that Paris was such a lonely town  
I'll meet you at the bridge where we wanted to kiss  
Or take the high road and be done with this  
  
Hey valentine I'm just a stumbling around  
Who knew that Paris was such a lonely town  
I'll meet you at the bridge where we wanted to kiss  
Or take the high road and be done with this  
  
I'll give you six more weeks baby just in case  
You can change your mind, you won't be replaced  
Are we looking at a lifetime of regret  
(are we looking at a lifetime of regret)  
Or just the one little moment that I'll never forget  
(or just the one little moment that we'll never forget)  
  
I said oh

There's a heartache for everyone
