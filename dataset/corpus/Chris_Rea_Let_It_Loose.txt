There's no sense in waiting  
So lets make a start  
I got a poisoned finger  
On a broken heart  
Don't have time for reasons  
Or feel inclined to quiz  
The past is over  
That's just the way it is  
  
Start it up  
Start it up  
And let it loose on me  
Let it loose on me  
  
We could sit forever  
Or we could take all night  
Of the whys and where fores  
Of the wrongs and rights  
Crazy situation, anyhow  
Turning on frustration  
So tell me why not now  
  
Let it loose on me  
  
Start it up  
Start it up  
And let it loose on me  
Let it loose on me
