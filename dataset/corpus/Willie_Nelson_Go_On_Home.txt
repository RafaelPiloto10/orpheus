Your watching your watch and I know what's on your mind  
There's someone home waiting and you're away over time  
What should be so right is as wrong as can be  
Go on home you don't belong here with me  
I love you I love you I love only you  
But the one home who's waiting he loves you too  
He's worried and he's wondering where can you be  
Go on home you don't belong here with me  
Go on home you don't belong here with me  
Though I want you and I need you desperately  
But to hide here in the darkness is as wrong as can be  
Go on home you don't belong here with me  
Go on home you don't belong here with me
