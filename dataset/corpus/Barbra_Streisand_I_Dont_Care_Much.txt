I don't care much  
Go or stay  
I don't care very much  
Either way  
Hearts grow hard  
On a windy street  
Lips grow cold  
With the rent to meet me  
So if you kiss me  
If we touch  
Warning's fair,  
I don't care very much  
I don't care much  
Go or stay  
I don't care  
Very much  
Either way  
Words sound false  
When your coat's too thin  
Feet don't waltz  
When the roof caves in  
So if you kiss me  
If we touch  
Warning's fair  
I don't care  
Very much
