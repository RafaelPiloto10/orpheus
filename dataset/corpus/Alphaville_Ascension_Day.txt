These are the days of evil perfection  
This is the world of torture and fame  
This is the age of most vicious infection  
These are the times of terror and pain  
  
Let them inside and they build you a nightmare  
Show them, you fool, it'll not be in vain  
Here is your costume of deepest surrender  
These are the times of terror and pain  
  
I want to ride on a crest of sensation  
I want to scream in the whirlpools of love  
I want to drown in a climax of thunder  
I want to be with the fools in the storm  
  
Do what you want and then die when you want to  
We're gonna walk on the blood of the meek  
We're gonna sail through the oceans of wonder  
We're gonna live in the dreams that we seek  
  
Send in the parasite clowns on their horses  
Send in the idiots and let them advance  
Send in the monsters of your own creation  
Send them all in and give them a chance  
  
We're gonna dance to the sweetest of music  
We're gonna play with the whores in the rain  
We'll dissipate the lord's last temptations  
All in a crossfire of torture and fame
