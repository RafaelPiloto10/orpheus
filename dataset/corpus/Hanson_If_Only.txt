Cause I need you.  
Cause I need you.  
  
Every single time I see you  
I start to feel this way  
It makes me wonder if I'm ever  
Gonna feel this way again  
There's a picture  
That's hanging at the back of my head  
I see it over and over  
  
I want to hold you, love you.  
In my arms and then.  
I want to need you,  
Cause I need to  
Be with you 'til the end.  
Then I hear myself reply  
You've got to hold it in.  
This time, tonight.  
  
[Chorus]  
If only,  
I had the guts to feel this way.  
And if only,  
You'd look at me and want to stay.  
And if only,  
I'd take you in my arms and say,  
I won't go, 'cause I need you.  
Cause I need you  
  
I sit here waiting wondering,  
Hoping, gotta make this right.  
Cause all I think about  
Is your hands, your face,  
And all these lonely nights.  
There's a feeling, screaming,  
In the back of my head.  
Saying over and over.  
  
Gonna hold you, love you.  
In my arms and then.  
Don't want to leave you,  
Cause I need to  
Be with you 'til the end.  
Then I hear myself reply  
She'll never let you in.  
This time, tonight.  
  
If only,  
I had the guts to feel this way.  
And if only,  
You'd look at me and want to stay.  
And if only,  
I'd take you in my arms and say,  
I won't go, 'cause I need you.  
Please don't go, 'cause I need you now.  
  
I want to hear you say,  
It'll always be this way.  
We'll be hand in hand  
For ever night, and ever day.  
I want to scream and shout.  
Cause I'm losin' any doubt.  
Cause all I care about is  
You and me, and us, and now.  
  
Oh yeah.  
  
If only,  
I had the guts to feel this way.  
And if only,  
You'd look at me and want to stay.  
And if only,  
I'd take you in my arms and say,  
I won't go, 'cause I need you.  
Please don't go.  
Cause I need you now, yeah  
Cause I need you  
(if only)  
Cause I need you now.  
(if only)  
Cause I need you  
I need you  
(if only)  
Cause I need you  
(if only)  
Cause I need you  
(if only)  
(if only)  
Cause I need you now, yeah
