You know I spent a little time out in Malibu  
I spent quite a bit down in Nashville too  
Cuz I like the beach and loves to honky tonk  
But the place that I call home  
Is where I never have to feel alone  
It's the place where I was raised and I was born  
  
And the grass don't get much greener  
And life can't get no sweeter  
I got a funny cigarette and a two-dollar bottle of wine  
And there's no need for new beginnings  
More money or window trimmings  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high  
  
Flyin' high  
In an old lawn chair  
Flyin' high  
With an ice cold beer  
Got nowhere to go, no place I'd rather be  
Yeah the grass don't get much greener  
And life can't get no sweeter  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high  
  
You know I've traveled on yachts thru the south of France  
Think I even got a pair of Versace pants  
But all that makes me feel is like a fool  
Cuz a pontoon boat, and a bottle of Beam  
A couple good friends, and some cut off jeans  
Has made us realize, you can't buy cool  
  
And the grass don't get much greener  
And life can't get no sweeter  
I got a funny cigarette and a two-dollar bottle of wine  
And there's no need for new beginnings  
More money or window trimmings  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high  
  
Flyin' high  
In an old lawn chair  
Flyin' high  
And my family near  
Nowhere to go no place I'd rather be  
Yeah they mock me because I stand out  
But I ain't never had to take a handout  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high.
