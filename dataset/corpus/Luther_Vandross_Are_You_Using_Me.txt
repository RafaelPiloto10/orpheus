Wait a minute  
Let's try something different  
This is Luther  
With the masters at work  
  
Last night I had some trouble sleeping..  
  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
  
No more will I let it be  
You called his name out in your sleep  
You're doing things so suspiciously  
And I think that you're using me, yeah  
  
Don't hang on me for security  
Love is never free  
Are you using me?  
  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
  
You pretended like we were friends  
I was blinded by sentiment  
You complicated what love should be  
And I could swear that you're using me  
  
I keep seeing things I shouldn't see  
I've been watchin' you  
Are you using me?  
  
Are you, are you  
Are you using me?  
  
Listen, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me  
Ooh, come on now and talk to me, talk to me  
Hey talk to me, talk to me  
Hey talk to me, talk to me  
  
For my money, for my money  
For my money, for my money  
For my money, for my money  
(Tell the truth)  
For my money, for my money  
  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
Are you, are you, are you using me?  
  
For my body, for my body  
For my body, for my body  
For my body, for my body  
For my body, for my body  
  
Don't hang on to me for security  
Love is never free, tell me are you  
  
Using, using me, using, are you using me  
Using, using me, using, are you using me?  
  
I keep seeing things I should not see  
I've been watching you, are you using me?  
  
One time, one time (one time, one time)  
One time, one time (one time, one time)  
One time, one time (one time, tell me)  
One time, one time (It's my desire)  
Don't be such a liar
