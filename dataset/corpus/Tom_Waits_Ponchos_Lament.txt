Well the stairs sound so lonely without you  
And I ain't made my bed in a week  
Coffee stains on the paper I'm writing  
And I'm too choked up inside to speak  
  
And Yes, I know our differences pulled us apart  
Never spoke a word heart to heart  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
  
Well my guitar still plays your favorite song  
though the strings have been outta tune for some time  
Every time I strum a cord, I pray out to the lord  
That you'll quit your honkey-tonkin' sing my song  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
  
So I'll throw another log onto the fire  
And I'll admit I'm a lousy liar  
As the coals die down and flicker  
I hear that guitar picker  
Play the song we used to sing so long ago  
I'm glad that you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
And I'm glad, damn glad you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home
