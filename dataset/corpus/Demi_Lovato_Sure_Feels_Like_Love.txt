Like a sunset on a hot summer night, like making up after our first big fight  
Wind swept hair, when the moons just right  
Ohh, your a perfect sight  
Come on baby, let me take that wheel  
I'm ready to show you how I fell  
If waht I'm dreaming might be real  
Then I don't wanna waste time, I just wanna make you mine  
Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby  
Ain't got no if's, no and's, no doubts, no maybes  
Well I knew at once, when I looked in your eyes I had the answer before  
You said "goodnight, love"  
Sure feels like love tonight  
  
-Music- (For six seconds)  
  
Your oh so sweet, just my luck  
Like a extra marshmellow in my cocoa cup  
Oh no, I can never get enough  
I wonder if you realize, don't need a crown to be my king your already my
Everything  
The words I write and the songs I sing  
The lullaby here inside the melody, I can't deny  
Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby  
Ain't got no if's, no and's, no doubts, no maybes  
Well I knew at once, when I looked in your eyes I had the answer before  
You said "goodnight, love"  
Sure feels like love tonight  
  
-Music- (For seven seconds)  
  
My whole worlds turnin' upside down  
Standing still on a merry go round  
Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby  
Ain't got no if's, no and's, no doubts, no maybes  
Well I knew at once, when I looked in your eyes I had the answer before  
You said "goodnight, love"  
(Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby)  
(Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby)  
Sure feels like love tonight  
Sure feels like love!
