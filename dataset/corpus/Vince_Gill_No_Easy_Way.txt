From my room I can hear you laughing  
You spend all your time with my best friend  
Oh, I wish you knew how bad I've fallen for you  
There's no way to know how things may end  
  
Cause babe, I don't know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There ain't no easy way into your heart  
  
In my mind I can see us together  
Crazy in love and paintin' the town  
When you look at him I know there's no way I can win  
I came running for you, would you turn me down?  
  
Cause babe, I don't know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There ain't no easy way into your heart  
  
Babe, I don't know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There ain't no easy way into your heart  
  
Babe, I don't know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There ain't no easy way into your heart
