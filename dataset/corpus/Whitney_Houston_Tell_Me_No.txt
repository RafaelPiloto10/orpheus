Reaching for my dreams and  
You're so quick to say what I can't do.  
You criticize my actions but  
I don't see you standing in my shoes.  
I'm going the wrong way  
And doing the wrong things  
Every word just gives me fuel  
So come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on!  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me no  
I'll show you I can  
Tell me no  
I'll dig my feet right in  
Tell me no  
Just tell me that I can't win  
Come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong  
Come on and go!  
Tell me no!  
  
For every step I take you're right there  
Trying to block my next move.  
And if you're making me feel bad,  
Then tell me then do you feel good?  
I'm just human and all I'm doing  
Is what my heart tells me I should  
So come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No no no no no no  
It motivates me more and more  
And I think it's time you know  
You're giving me something to look forward  
And I can't wait for the day  
I can rub things in your face  
I ain't gon stop til I'm done  
I've reached the top, I'm Number One  
But every time you try and tell me no  
Oh it makes me keep on keeping on  
  
[Chorus]
