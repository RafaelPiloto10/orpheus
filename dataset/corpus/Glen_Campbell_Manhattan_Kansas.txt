Manhattan, Kansas ain't no place to have a baby  
When you got no man to give it his last name  
And her folks back in Manhattan didn't want her or her bundle  
So she took her child and caught an evenin' train.  
  
She found a job in Denver washing dishes in a diner  
At least it buys her baby milk to drink  
He once told her she was pretty but the only ring it got her  
Was the ring of grease that runs around the sink.  
  
Yes she lay beside him gentle  
'Cause he told her that he loved her  
And he made her dance before the music played  
But at least she didn't beg him  
She'd rather wash her dishes  
It makes her feel as if her hands are clean.  
  
At night she stands there thinkin'  
'Bout the man back home in Kansas  
And how her folks just turned away the shame  
She stares down through the soap suds  
Reaches down and pulls the drain plug  
And watches as Manhattan drains away.  
  
Yes she lay beside him gentle  
'Cause he told her that he loved her  
And he made her dance before the music played  
But at least she didn't beg him  
She'd rather wash her dishes  
It makes her feel as if her hands are clean.  
  
Yes it makes her feel as if her hands are clean
