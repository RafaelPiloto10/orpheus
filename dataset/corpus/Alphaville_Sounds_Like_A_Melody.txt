It's a trick of my mind  
Two faces bathing in the screen light  
She's so soft and warm in my arms  
I tune it into the scene  
My hands are resting on her shoulders  
When were dancing away for a while  
Oh we're moving, we're falling,  
We step into the fire  
By the hour of the wolf in a midnight dream  
There's no reason to hurry  
Just start that brand new story  
Set it alight, we're head over heels in love  
Head over heels  
The ringing of your laughter  
It sounds like a melody  
To once forbidden places  
We'll go for a while  
  
It's the definite show  
Our shadows resting in the moonlight  
It's so clear and bright in your eyes  
It's the touch of your sighs  
My lips are resting on your shoulder  
When we're moving so soft and slow  
We need the ecstasy, the jealousy,  
The comedy of love  
Like the Cary Grants and Kellys once before  
Give me more tragedy, more harmony  
And fantasy, my dear  
And set it alight, just starting that satellite  
Set it alight  
  
The ringing of your laughter  
It sounds like a melody  
To once forbidden places  
We'll go for a while
