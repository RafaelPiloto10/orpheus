I have been a wayward child,  
I have acted out,  
I have questioned sovereignty,  
And had my share of doubts,  
  
And though sometimes,  
My prayers feel like they're bouncing off the sky,  
The hand that holds won't let me go,  
And is the reason why  
  
I will stumble, I will fall down  
But I will not be moved  
I will make mistakes, I will face heartache,  
But I will not be moved  
  
On Christ the solid rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand,  
I will not be moved  
  
Bitterness has plagued my heart,  
Many times before,  
My life has been a broken glass,  
That I have kept restored,  
Of all my shattered dreams,  
And though it seemed,  
  
That I was far too gone,  
My brokenness helped me to see,  
It's grace I'm standing on.  
  
I will stumble, I will fall down  
But I will not be moved  
I will make mistakes, I will face heartache,  
But I will not be moved  
  
On Christ the solid rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand,  
I will not be moved  
  
And chaos in my life,  
Has been a badge of war,  
And though I have been torn,  
I will not be moved  
  
I will make mistakes, I will face heartache,  
But I will not be moved  
  
On Christ the solid rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand,  
I will not be moved
