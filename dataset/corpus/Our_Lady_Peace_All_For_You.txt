A suburban man  
At my door  
But I don't think I'll let him in  
He wants discipline  
Discipline  
Control over the way I live  
  
He wants the best for me  
Old school philosophy  
So I can't turn my back on him  
He'd buy me anything  
But I just need a friend  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all for you  
You've got me where you want  
It's all for you, oh  
Just stop breaking my heart  
You're the blood, I'm the seed  
And it's all that I need  
You've got me where you want  
It's all for you, oh  
You've got me, oh, you've got me  
  
Jack Kerouac  
Kerouac  
On the road and in my head  
I need relevance  
Intelligence  
A new tattoo and lots more sex  
  
Broken families  
Are the new enemies  
And you will not make up for this  
This suburban man  
He wants discipline  
Discipline  
But I just need a friend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where you want  
  
Alone  
Leave me alone  
  
It's all for you  
You've got me where you want  
It's all for you, oh  
Just stop breaking my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's all for you  
(Just stop breaking my heart) [Repeat x6]  
  
Leave me alone
