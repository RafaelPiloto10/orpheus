Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
I have no guts, I have no pride  
My heart is weak, my love is blind  
When your game is up, I'll still be by your side  
If you love me at all, let this be the last time  
That you break my heart  
That you break my heart  
That you break my heart  
You hurt me so much, but I love you forever  
'Cause when you tear me up, you always put me back together  
Ever so gently, ever so gently  
Baby, let this be the last time, yeah  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
I bite my lip and hold my head up high  
I try my best not to let you see me cry  
I can take a joke and you can be unkind  
If you love me at all, let this be the last time  
That you break my heart  
That you break my heart  
That you break my heart  
You hurt me so much but I love you forever  
'Cause when you tear me up, you always put me back together  
Ever so gently, ever so gently  
Baby, let this be the last time, yeah  
You hurt me so much but I love you forever  
'Cause when you tear me up, you always put me back together  
Ever so gently, ever so gently  
Baby, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time  
Let this be the last time, let this be the last time
