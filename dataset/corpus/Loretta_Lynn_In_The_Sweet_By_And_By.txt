In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore  
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore  
There's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it apart  
For the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there  
In the sweet by and by...  
  
To a wonderful father above we shall offer our tribute of praise  
For the glory as gift of his love and the blessings that hallow our days  
In the sweet by and by...
