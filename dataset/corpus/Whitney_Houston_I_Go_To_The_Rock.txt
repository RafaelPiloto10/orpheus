Where do I go when there's nobody else to turn to?  
Who do I talk to when nobody wants to listen?  
Who do I lean on when there's no foundation stable?  
  
I go to the rock  
I know he's able  
I go to the rock  
  
I go to the rock for my salvation  
I go to the stone that the builders rejected  
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me  
  
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ, the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend  
I go to the rock  
  
Where do I go, where do I go  
When the storms of life are threatening?  
Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrow blow?  
And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation?  
  
I go to the rock  
I know He's able  
I go to the rock  
  
I know He's the rock for my salvation  
I know He's the stone that the builders rejected  
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me  
  
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ, the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend  
I go to the rock  
  
I know He's the rock for my salvation  
I know He's the stone that the builders rejected  
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me  
  
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ, the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend  
I go to the rock  
  
I go to the rock  
I go to the rock  
I go to the rock  
I go to the rock  
  
You can go to the rock  
You can go to the rock  
You can go to the rock  
You can go to the rock  
  
I go to the rock  
I go to the rock  
I go to the rock  
I go to the rock  
  
I go to the rock  
I go to the rock  
I go to the rock  
I go to the rock  
  
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ, the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend  
I go to the rock
