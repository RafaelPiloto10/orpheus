These notes are marked return to sender  
I'll save this letter for myself  
I wish you only knew how good it is to see you  
See you, see you, ooh, ooh  
  
These steps I take don't get me anywhere  
I'm gettin' further from myself  
One thins is always true, how good it is to see you  
See you, see you, ooh, ooh  
I'm done resenting you, you represented me so well  
And this I promise you  
  
How could I end up in this hands of someone else?
