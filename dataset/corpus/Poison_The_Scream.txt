A verdict heard by the jury's word...they're lying  
I watch as the victims of the slave ships battle with the demons inside  
But no wrong ever righted or proved by the innocent dying  
I pray from the ashes of the ruins, the answer will rise  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey (the scream)  
Hear their screams as they rise from the ashes  
Hey  
Lord save the soul who can hear the scream  
  
A child is born to a world that is slowly dying  
He chooses to march to the beat of a different drum  
A man lays dead in the street, his mama is crying  
The people, they measure this man by the damage he's done  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lord praise the man who can hear the scream  
  
Forgive us for our sins, I never meant the things I did  
I never meant, I never meant, I never meant  
  
[Chorus: x2]
