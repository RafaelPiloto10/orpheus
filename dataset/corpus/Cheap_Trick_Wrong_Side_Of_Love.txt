She said that she's got something else on her mind  
I'm spending my money, but I'm wasting time  
It looks to me like the end of the line  
Well, she plays both sides and she's making me choose  
It's heads, she wins, and tails I lose  
Each time I call, it's another excuse  
  
I thought I was finally doin' everything right  
Now it looks like I'm the one left lonely tonight  
I picked the wrong side of love  
And I wound up on the losin' end  
The wrong side of love  
Now I'm starting all over again  
  
She makes me feel like I'm out of control  
She comes on hot but she turns ice cold  
Her light says stop when I'm ready to go...go  
  
She set me up, now she's puttin' me down  
Sometimes I feel like a face in the crowd  
One day I'm in, the next day I'm out  
  
I thought I was finally doin' everything right  
Now it looks like I'm the one left lonely tonight  
I picked the wrong side of love  
And I wound up on the losin' end  
The wrong side of love  
Now I'm starting all over again  
  
I picked the wrong side of love  
Right place, wrong time  
The wrong side of love  
Well honey, point me in the right direction  
  
I thought I was finally doin' everything right  
Now it looks like I'm the one left lonely tonight  
I picked the wrong side of love  
And I wound up on the losin' end  
The wrong side of love  
Now I'm starting all over again  
I picked the wrong side of love  
And I wound up on the losin' end  
The wrong side of love  
Now I'm starting all over again  
  
I picked the wrong side of love  
Is there a bad side to love?  
I picked the wrong side of love  
The wrong side of love  
I picked the wrong side of love  
Is there a bad side to love?  
I picked the wrong side of love  
I picked the wrong side of love  
I picked the wrong side of love
