Dommage, dommage  
Our love was once exciting  
Now it's just a game we play  
To bad but nothing last forever  
All at once we've lost our way  
  
Hello, goodbye,  
And suddenly it's over  
And there is nothing  
We can do  
Dommage, dommage  
Too bad we couldn't make  
  
Our dreams come true  
  
Hello, goodbye,  
And suddenly it's over  
And there is nothing,  
Nothing we can do  
  
Dommage, dommage  
Too bad we couldn't make  
Our dreams... Come... True
