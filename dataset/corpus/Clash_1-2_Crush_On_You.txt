Standing in a queue of a school canteen  
Guys on the corner they were laughin' at me  
But I don't mind if they see it all  
You know I gotta come clean  
I gotta come clean  
I got a crush on you  
  
My mind don't need it but my body do  
A little bit of loving and attention for you  
Although we're only strangers  
They don't need to know  
I gotta cum clean, I gotta cum clean  
Ooh, I got a crush on you  
  
I want to get serious right away  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
What you doin' today or any other day?  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
Just one look and I go insane  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
  
Your daddy never comes to get you  
Cause lives so far away  
But his I-talian chauffeur shows up every day  
But I'll get you in the corner, I'll get you all  
alone  
I gotta cum clean, I gotta come clean  
  
I got a crush on you  
  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
I said one-two  
I got a crush on you  
  
Why should I get a crush on yet?
