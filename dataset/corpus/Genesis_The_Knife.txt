Tell me my life is about to begin  
Tell me that I am a hero,  
Promise me all of your violent dreams  
Light up your body with anger.  
Now, in this ugly world  
It is time to destroy all this evil.  
Now, when I give the word  
Get ready to fight for your freedom  
Now  
  
Stand up and fight, for you know we are right  
We must strike at the lies  
That have spread like disease through our minds.  
Soon we'll have power, every soldier will rest  
And we'll spread out our kindness  
To all who our love now deserve.  
Some of you are going to die -  
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide.  
  
I'll give you the names of those you must kill,  
All must die with their children.  
Carry their heads to the palace of old,  
Hang them high, let the blood flow.  
Now, in this ugly world  
Break all the chains around us,  
Now, the crusade has begun  
Give us a land fit for heroes,  
Now  
  
Stand up and fight, for you know we are right  
We must strike at the lies  
That have spread like disease through our minds.  
Soon we'll have power, every soldier will rest  
And we'll spread out our kindness  
To all who our love now deserve.  
Some of you are going to die -  
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide.  
  
We are only wanting freedom  
We are only wanting freedom  
We are only wanting freedom  
We are only wanting freedom ("Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom...")  
We are only wanting freedom ("Things are getting out of control here today")  
We are only wanting freedom ("OK men - fire over their heads!")  
We are only wanting freedom  
  
We have won
