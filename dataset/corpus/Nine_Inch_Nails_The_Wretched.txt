Just a reflection  
Just a glimpse  
Just a little reminder  
Of all the what abouts  
And all the might have  
Could have beens  
Another day  
Some other way  
But not another reason to continue  
And now you're one of us  
The wretched  
  
The hopes and prays  
The better days  
The far aways  
Forget it  
  
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it?  
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it?  
  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
The clouds will part and the sky cracks open  
And god himself will reach his fucking arm through  
Just to push you down  
Just to hold you down  
Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss  
And it's hard to believe it could come down to this  
Back at the beginning  
Sinking  
Spinning  
  
And in the end  
We still pretend  
The time we spend  
Not knowing when  
You're finally free  
And you could be  
But it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  
It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it  
  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
  
You can try to stop it but it keeps on coming  
You can try to stop it but
