In a world that can be so insane  
I don't think it's very strange  
For me to be in love with you  
I want to know more than your brain  
  
Into my life you were injected  
Not something that I expected  
Now I smile from your affection  
We have made a soul connection  
Just for whom does your bell toll  
Don't be cold show me your soul  
  
Sentimental gentlemen are not afraid  
To show you when I am you  
You're my best friend  
Show me your soul  
  
In a world that can  
  
Yes I find you so appealing  
When you show me how you're feeling  
You my friend need not be kneeling  
Open up and stop revealing  
Trust in me, my heart is whole  
I need to see  
Show me your soul  
  
Sentimental gentlemen  
  
In a world that can  
  
Don't expect too much from me  
Perfection is no test for me  
Because the best I'll ever be  
I just like you, a human being  
You won't offend, I need to know  
Please my friend  
Show me your soul  
  
Sentimental gentlemen
