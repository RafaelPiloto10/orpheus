You're taking a walk on the wild side  
If you're gonna take a chance with me,  
I'm gonna make you take a look on the inside  
And you might not like what you see  
So don't you knock on my door  
If you don't want an answer  
Or gimme a beat  
If you don't want a dancer  
  
I've got my love gun loaded,  
I've got you in my sight,  
I never take no for an answer,  
So you'd better say yes tonight  
I told you the score  
Right from the start,  
You'll never get to heaven  
If you break my heart  
  
So if you don't mean business  
Knock on someone else's door,  
'Cause it's a mean mean business  
Staying alive if you fool with me  
  
You say you want my money,  
I say you've got no sense,  
If you just want to bleed me dry  
Stay on your side of the fence  
No mercy you can see  
'Cause seven to eleven made a fool out of me  
  
So if you don't mean business  
Knock on someone else's door,  
'Cause it's a mean mean business  
Staying alive if you fool with me  
  
You're taking a walk on the wild side  
If you're gonna take a chance with me,  
I'm gonna make you take a look on the inside  
And you might not like what you see  
So don't you knock on my door  
If you don't want an answer  
Or gimme a beat  
If you don't want a dancer  
  
So if you don't mean business  
Knock on someone else's door,  
'Cause it's a mean mean business  
Staying alive if you fool with me
