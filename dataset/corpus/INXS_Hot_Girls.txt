Looking out my window  
At some girl as I'm writing this and  
I watch her eat a peach  
The way she's biting it biting it  
And I probably shouldn't stare  
But I am fighting it fighting it  
And I think that she's aware  
And kind of liken it liken it  
  
Hot girls  
They can break me break me  
Hot girls  
You know what your doin' now  
Hot girls  
Come and break me break me  
Hot girls  
Take me where you are going  
  
On her motor bike the way  
She's riding it riding it  
And she says it feels so good  
But now she is hiding it hiding it  
Wet lips to cigarette and now she's  
Striking it lighting it as she  
Looks me in the eye  
Hell she must know she's inviting it  
  
Hot girls they can break me break me  
Hot girls you know what your doin' now  
Hot girls come and break me break me  
Hot girls take me where you're goin'  
  
I got nothing to prove  
Ain't got nothing to loose  
If you need someone to use  
I can take the abuse  
Holding up some paper to her window  
She's writing her name  
And number and I'm laughing  
As I'm dialing it dialing it  
I got nothing to prove  
Aint got nothing to loose  
If you need someone to use  
I can take the abuse  
  
Hot girls they can break me break me  
Hot girls you know what you're doin' now  
Hot girls come and break me break me  
Hot girls take me where you're goin'  
Hot girls they can break me break me  
Hot girls you know what you're doin' now  
Hot girls come and break me break me  
Hot girls take me where you're goin'  
Hot girls  
Hot girls  
Hot girls
