You're my fatal attraction  
Oh, no, I can't stop  
You're my midnight fantasy  
You're my cream of the crop  
  
I'm comin' home girl  
I'm comin' home  
  
You're my soaking wet ecstasy  
Like sex on the beach  
I want to take you home now girl  
Gonna practice what I preach, dig  
  
I'm comin' home girl  
I'm comin' home now  
  
I can taste your sweet emotion  
I can feel it runnin' hot  
Our veins of passion pumping so strong  
We're like gas and fire  
got a burnin' desire  
Them sparks are gonna fly and we'll be  
  
[Chorus]  
Shakin' shakin'  
Tearin' down the walls  
Little by little, inch by inch  
Tearin' down the walls  
Screamin' scratchin'  
Tearin' down the walls  
Little by little, inch by inch  
Tearin' down the walls  
  
I just want to eat you up  
Like a lion in a cage  
Just get a little bit closer girl  
And that's all I'll need to say  
  
I'm comin' home girl  
I'm comin' home now  
  
You're like a slave to the rhythm  
I'm gonna put you to the test  
You turn up the heat turn on the light  
And I'll do the rest  
  
I'm comin' home girl,  
I'm comin home now  
  
I can taste your sweet emotion  
I can feel it runnin' hot  
Our veins of passion pumping so strong  
We're like gas and fire  
got a burnin' desire  
Them sparks are gonna fly and we'll be  
  
[Chorus]
