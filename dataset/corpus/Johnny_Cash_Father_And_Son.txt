It's not time to make a change, just relax, and take it easy  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to know  
Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy  
To be calm when you've found something going on  
But take your time, think a lot  
Why, think of, everything you've got  
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not  
  
How can I try to explain, when I do, he turns away again  
It's always been the same, the same old story  
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go  
  
It's not time to make a change, just sit down, and take it slowly  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to go through  
Find a girl, settle down, if you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
All the times that I cried, keepin' all the things I knew inside  
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it  
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them you know not me  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go
