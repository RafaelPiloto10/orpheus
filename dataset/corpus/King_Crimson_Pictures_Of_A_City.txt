Concrete cold face cased in steel  
Stark sharp glass-eyed crack and peel  
Bright light scream beam brake and squeal  
Red white green white neon wheel.  
  
Dream flesh love chase perfumed skin  
Greased hand teeth hide tinseled sin  
Spice ice dance chance sickly grin  
Pasteboard time slot sweat and spin.  
  
Blind stick blind drunk cannot see  
Mouth dry tongue tied cannot speak  
Concrete dream flesh broken shell  
Lost soul lost trace lost in hell.
