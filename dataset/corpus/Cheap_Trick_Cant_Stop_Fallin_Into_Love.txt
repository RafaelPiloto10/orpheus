  
Hey, little ladies, there's some cool young dude  
just standin' in line waitin' for you.  
There's a girl in the corner with a jacked up dress,  
she's got legs for miles, but her face is a mess.  
  
There's always somethin' for ev'ryone, but a love can be suicide.  
It's just what you've been waiting for, and I know it can't be denied, Yeah.  
Can't stop fallin' into love.  
What's my heart been dreaming of?  
Who's that falling into love, who?  
Is it you I'm thinkin' of?  
  
Hey, rock'n rollers, what's a happ'nin' with you?  
Well, you've got the itch well, I've got it, too.  
it's hard to be a winner ev'ry time,  
but I know you can take it, you can make it alright.  
  
It's time that you just can't hide, but I can't control myself.  
I know what you've been waitin' for, 'cause love can't be denied, yeah.  
Can't stop fallin' into love.  
What's my heart been dreaming of?  
Who's that falling into love, who?  
Yeah, it's you I'm thinkin' of?  
  
There's always somethin' for ev'ryone, and I know what you mean in my eyes.  
I just can't control myself and I fall for it ev'ry time, oh, yeah.  
Can't stop fallin' into love.  
What's my heart been dreamin' up?  
No matter what I think or do or say,  
I keep fallin' into love.  
  
I can't stop fallin' into love.  
What's my heart been dreamin' up?  
Who's that falling into love?  
Is it you girl I'm thinking of?  
  
I can't stop fallin' into love.  
what's my heart been dreamin up?
