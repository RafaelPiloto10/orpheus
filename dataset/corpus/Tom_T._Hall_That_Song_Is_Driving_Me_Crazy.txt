That song is driving me crazy, I gotta hear it again  
First time I heard it I was with some friends  
It's a simple little song you can sing along with an old time melody  
So would you play that crazy little song again for me?  
That song is driving me crazy  
I love that part about break my heart and baby please come home  
And I love that line about hurtin' my mind and my beer ain't got no foam  
That song is driving me crazy  
Well, you'll sing high and I'll sing low and everybody sing along  
But everybody quit while I get my kick singin' bring that boogie home  
Mhm, that song is a driving me crazy  
Okay gang, well, that song is driving me crazy  
That song is driving me crazy
