I'm driving  
Your girlfriend home  
And she's saying  
How she never chose you  
"Turn left", she says  
I turn left  
And she says  
"So how did I end up  
So deeply involved in  
The very existence  
I planned on avoiding?"  
And I can't answer  
  
I'm driving  
Your girlfriend home  
And she's laughing  
To stop herself crying  
"Drive on", she says  
I drive on  
And she says  
"So how did I end up  
Attached to this person  
When his sense of humor  
Gets gradually worser ?"  
And I can't tell her  
  
I'm parking  
Outside her home  
And we're shaking hands  
Goodnight, so politely
