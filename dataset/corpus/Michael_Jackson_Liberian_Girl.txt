(Naku penda piya-naku taka piya-mpenziwe)  
(I love you too-I want you too-my love)  
  
Liberian girl  
You came and you changed my world  
A love so brand new  
Liberian girl  
You came and you changed my world  
A feeling so true  
  
Liberian girl  
You know that you came  
And you changed my world  
Just like in the movies  
With two lovers in a scene  
And she says  
"Do you love me"  
And he says so endlessly  
"I love you, Liberian girl"  
  
(Naku penda piya-naku taka piya-mpenziwe)  
(I love you too-I want you too-my love)  
  
Liberian girl  
More precious than any pearl  
Your love so complete  
Liberian girl  
You kiss me then,  
Ooh, the world  
You do this to me  
Liberian girl  
You know that you came  
And you changed my world  
Just like in the movies  
With two lovers in a scene  
And she says  
"Do you love me"  
And he says so endlessly  
"I love you, Liberian girl"  
  
(Naku penda piya-naku taka piya-mpenziwe)  
(I love you too-I want you too-my love)  
  
Liberian girl  
You know that you came  
And you changed my world  
I wait for the day  
When you have to say  
"I do"  
And I'll smile and say it too,  
I love you, Liberian girl, all the time
