Sometimes my world goes upside down  
Sometimes I see things backwards  
When I go walking in town, can't get back home  
Someimes I see things right to left  
  
And I know that's not right at all  
But since I bumped into you, I bump into walls  
And no one knows what's wrong with me  
They think that I got dropsie  
  
Is dis love?  
Or is dyslexia  
Dyslexia  
Dyslexia  
  
I've got these glasses real thick and green  
Just like the bottoms of coke bottles  
I stumble 'round my house, so strange to me
