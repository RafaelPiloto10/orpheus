Well they'll tease you and they'll please you  
Make you better when you're feeling bad  
All hope is gone - singing  
Songs about love  
  
They'll upset you and they'll get you  
Slay your fantasy till you almost believe  
You're the only one - singing  
(songs about love)  
  
So don't believe they're writing all those songs for you  
Oh no 'cos you know they're only lies you're listening to  
Those songs about love  
  
It's all over now and nothing's right  
You're left crying every night  
(it ain't fair) oh no no  
(it ain't fair) singing all about love  
  
They'll deceive you, now they'll leave you  
Leave you so confused don't you know you've been used  
Now can't you see - singing  
All about love  
  
So don't believe they're writing all those songs for you  
Oh no 'cos you know they're only lies you're listening to  
Those songs about love  
  
It's all over now and nothing's right  
You're left crying every night  
(it ain't fair) oh no no  
(it ain't fair) so what you're gonna do about it  
Don't you see it's just not right  
To keep your feelings out of sight  
(feeling bad) oh no no  
(feeling bad) singing songs about love  
  
And if we'd never meet again  
(what would you do with your life)  
Do you think we could be friends  
(or would it hurt you hurt you)  
Don't you see they got to you and me  
With all their songs about love  
  
Well you know now, better go now  
Gonna mend your heart it's a brand new start  
Don't be afraid - singing  
Songs about love  
  
So don't believe they're writing all those songs for you  
Oh no 'cos you know they're only lies you're listening to  
Those songs about love  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Oh no no no no  
  
Don't you see it's just not right  
To leave your feelings out of sight  
Oh no no  
Singing songs about love
