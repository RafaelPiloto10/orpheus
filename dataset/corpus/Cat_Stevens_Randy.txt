Oh randy, if they knew.  
I think they'd take me away  
Just for loving you, you.  
All alone in my own quiet way  
'Cause that's the way that I want it.  
  
Wish I could see you now,  
You and your cherry black eyes.  
My heart would never lie down, down,  
'Cause that's the way my arrow flies,  
And that's the way that I want it.  
  
You never said it would rain.  
You only told me that the sun would come again.  
You never said it would rain.  
Oh randy if you did,  
It wouldn't mean a thing.  
It wouldn't hurt me a bit,  
'Cause only you can break my wings,  
And that's the way that I want it.  
  
You drew my face in the sand,  
And ever since that day you made me what I am.  
You drew my face in the sand.  
Oh randy if I could,  
There's nothing I wouldn't give  
To live with you for good.  
'Cause that's the way I'd like to live,  
And that's the way that I want it.  
  
Randy, oh my randy.  
Randy, oh my randy.  
Randy, oh my randy.
