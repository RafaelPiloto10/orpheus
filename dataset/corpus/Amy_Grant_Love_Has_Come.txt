Hurry now wake up your eyes  
Time for little ones to see  
Daddy's got a big surprise  
Hiding there beneath the Christmas tree  
How they are like the child in me!  
See the wonder in their eyes  
Like a fairytale come true  
One more time I realize  
All the love our lives found in you  
  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Sent his son  
  
If I could have a special dream  
Coming true on Christmas morn'  
I would want the world to see  
How his father smiled when Christ was born  
The greatest gift the world has known!  
So come on kids, look high and low  
For all the toys you've dreamed to find  
But I believe you'll never know  
A greater joy than Jesus' love inside  
  
(You gotta know!)  
(Know!)  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes, the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
(Don't you know that)  
Love has come  
For the world to know (know)  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes, the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes, the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
(Don't you know)  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes, the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
(i can see that)  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago
