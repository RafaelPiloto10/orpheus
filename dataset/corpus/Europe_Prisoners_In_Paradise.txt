I want to learn how to fly  
I want to be respected  
I want to get lucky  
I want to get out of this dump  
I just want to watch TV  
I want to be loved  
I want to be different  
I want a brother and sister  
I'd just rather be forgotten  
I want to save the world  
I want to be understood  
I want to be rich  
Man, I just want to be somebody  
  
Julie's got the word today  
She lost her job just one last pay  
Life don't come easy anymore  
Still strugglin' on by herself  
Got a picture of Jimmy  
There on the shelf  
And she looks at him and says  
Why did we let it go  
  
I know that sometimes baby  
We didn't see things eye-to-eye  
But I got just one question  
Did we have to say goodbye  
  
Just like prisoners in paradise  
Still far from heaven's door  
We had it all but still we  
Wanted more  
Now I realize that I can't  
Turn back the future's here  
To stay but hey  
We're just children of tomorrow  
Hangin' on to yesterday  
  
Jimmy still recalls the night  
When he took his guitar  
And headed on out  
To find the big time  
That was his dream  
He gave up his past  
And made it alright  
But there's something missin'  
In his heart tonight  
Sometimes what you want  
Ain't what you need  
  
He misses drivin' down  
To the lake at night  
Holdin' his baby  
In his arms so tight  
Ain't it hard to find illusions  
When you're livin' in a memory  
  
Just like prisoners in paradise  
So close but yet so far  
There will come a time  
No matter who you are  
When you ask yourself  
Was it right or wrong  
For me to turn away but hey  
We're just children of tomorrow  
Hangin' on to yesterday
