I don't want to be hurt anymore  
By a part-time love affair  
And I don't want to cry like before  
Why pretend, again, you care  
Please don't coax me back into your arms  
I've been fooled many times by-y your charms  
I know if I kissed you  
I might not resist you  
I don't want to be hurt anymore  
Please don't coax me back into your arms  
I've been fooled many times by-y your charms  
I know if I kissed you  
I might not resist you  
I don't want to be hurt anymore-ore
