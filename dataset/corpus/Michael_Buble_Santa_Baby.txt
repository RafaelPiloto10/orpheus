Santa baby, slip a Rolex under the tree  
For me  
I've been an awful good guy  
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Santa buddy, a sixty-five convertible, too  
Steel blue  
I'll wait up for you, dude  
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Think of all the fun I've missed  
Think of all the hotties that I never kissed  
Next year I could be just as good  
If you check off my Christmas list  
  
Santa paly, I want a yacht and really that's not, a lot  
I've been a sweetie all year  
Santa buddy, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Santa buddy, one thing that I really do need  
The deed  
To platinum mine  
Santa buddy, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Santa buddy, fill my stocking with Canucks tix  
For kicks  
Throw me on the first line  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonignt  
  
Come and trim my Christmas tree  
With some decorations bought at Mercedes  
I really do, believe in you  
Now let's see if you believe in me  
  
Santa papi, forget to mention one little thing  
Cha ching  
No I don't mean as a loan  
Santa buddy, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
Hurry down the chimney tonight,  
Oh hurry down the chimney tonight
