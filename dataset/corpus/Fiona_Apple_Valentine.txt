You didn't see my valentine  
I sent it via pantomime  
While you were watchin' someone else  
I stared at you and cut myself  
  
It's all I'll do 'cause I'm not free  
A fugitive too dull too flee  
I'm amorous but out of reach  
A still life drawing of a peach  
  
I'm a tulip in a cup  
I stand no chance of growing up  
I've made my peace I'm dead, I'm done  
I watched you live to have my fun  
  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you, you  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you, you  
  
I made it to a dinner date  
My teardrops seasoned every plate  
I tried to dance but lost my nerve  
I cramped up in the learning curve  
  
I'm a tulip in a cup  
I stand no chance of growing up  
I'm resigned to sail on through  
In the wake of tales of you  
  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you, you  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you  
You, you, you, you  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you
