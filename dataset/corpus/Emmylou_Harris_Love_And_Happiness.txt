(feat. Mark Knopfler)  
  
Here's a wishing well  
Here's a penny for  
Any thought it is  
That makes you smile  
Every diamond dream  
Everything that brings  
Love and happiness  
To your life  
  
Here's a rabbit's foot  
Take it when you go  
So you'll always know  
You're safe from harm  
Wear your ruby shoes  
When you're far away  
So you'll always stay  
Home in your heart  
  
You will always have a lucky star  
That shines because of what you are  
Even in the deepest dark  
Because your aim is true  
And if I could only have one wish  
Darling, then it would be this  
Love and happiness for you  
  
Here's a spinning wheel  
Use it once you've learned  
There's a way to turn  
The straw to gold  
Here's a rosary  
Count on every bead  
With a prayer to keep  
The hope you hold  
  
You will always have a lucky star  
That shines because of what you are  
Even in the deepest dark  
Because your aim is true  
And if I could only have one wish  
Darling, then it would be this  
Love and happiness for you  
And if I could only have one wish  
Darling, then it would be this  
Love and happiness for you
