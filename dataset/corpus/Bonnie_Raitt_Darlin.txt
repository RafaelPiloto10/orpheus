Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome  
I'd call you on the phone some  
But I don't have dime  
Darlin', you're so far behind me  
Tomorrow is gonna find me  
Further down the line  
Take a piece of paper  
A pencil in my hand  
I'm gonna write  
Darlin', I know I feel the cold nights  
Thinking of the old nights  
Spent alone with you  
Darlin', tears are in my eyes now  
Know that I should try now  
To make it back to you  
Darlin', I love you more than ever  
I wish we were together  
Darlin' mine  
Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome  
I'd call you on the phone some  
But I don't have a dime  
Darlin', you're so far behind me  
Tomorrow's gonna find me  
Further down the line  
Darlin', tears are in my eyes (oh, in my eyes)  
You that I should try now (I should try to make it back to you)  
To make it back to you
