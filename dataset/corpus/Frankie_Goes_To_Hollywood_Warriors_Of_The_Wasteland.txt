From diamond mine to the factory  
Everybody's doing what you've got to keep on doing for society  
Make this world a good place to be  
Let livin' be but don't work for free  
Playing isn't paying so work is what I'm saying  
Working for the world go round  
The battle cry don't mess with me  
I've traveled the world for eternity  
  
Warriors of the wasteland  
Sailboats of ice on desert sands  
Warriors of the wasteland  
  
It seems to me that the powers that be  
Keep themselves in splendour and security  
Armoured cars for megastars  
No streets, no bars, yours wealth is ours  
They make the masses, kiss their assets  
Lower class jackass, pay me tax take out the trash  
Working for the world go round  
Your job is gold, do as you're told  
They pay you less then run for congress  
  
Warriors of the wasteland  
Sailboats of ice on desert sands  
Warriors - what a waste, man  
I'm working for the world go round, go round  
  
Diamond mine to the factory, yeah  
Make this a world, a good place to be  
  
Warriors - what a waste, man  
  
Warriors  
  
We're rats in a cage  
  
Suicide a go go
