Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass  
Who could have known tonight would be your last  
Now I'm left with just your memory  
You won't be coming home tonight  
  
A wasted driver twisted in your path  
Your life was taken from you in a flash  
There ain't no reason, just insanity  
Without the answer how can I be free?  
  
I can see you, I can see you  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see it, I can see it  
I can see it over and over again  
  
I saw it happening like deja-vu  
I tried to tell you but I couldn't get through  
And now the victim, what a waste of life!  
I wish to God that you had seen the light  
  
I can see you, I can see you  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see it, I can see it  
I can see it over and over again  
  
Ohh, who turned off the lights?  
Ohh, a shadow in the night  
Ohh, it wasn't meant to be  
You won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
No no, you won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
  
Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass  
Who could have known tonight would be your last  
Now I'm left with just your memory  
I guess some things were never meant to be  
  
I can see you, I can see you  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see it, I can see it  
I can see it over and over again  
  
Ohh, who turned off the lights?  
Ohh, a shadow in the night  
Ohh, it wasn't meant to be  
You won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
No no, you won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
  
Ohh, who turned off the lights?  
Ohh, a shadow in the night  
Ohh, it wasn't meant to be  
You won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
No no, you won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight
