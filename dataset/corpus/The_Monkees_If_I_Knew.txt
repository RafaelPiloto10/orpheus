If I knew what was bothering you  
I would run to your side  
I don't know why  
I would just die if you left me  
  
Can't you see  
What you're doing to me  
Are you playing a game  
Is it always the same  
Am I to blame?  
Or is anyone?  
  
I don't want to settle down  
With any other girl, but you  
So I'm just gonna wait around  
'Til you decide what you're gonna do  
  
Can't you see  
What you're doing to me?  
Are you playing a game?  
It's always the same?  
Am I to blame?  
Or is anyone?  
  
I don't want to settle down  
With any other girl, but you  
So I'm just gonna wait around  
'Til you decide what you're gonna do  
  
If I knew, what was bothering you,  
I would run to your side, I don't know why,  
I would just die, if you left me.  
  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Are you playin' a game? It's always the same.  
Am I to blame, or is anyone?  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to settle down with any other girl but you,  
So I'm just gonna wait around,  
'Til you decide what you're gonna do. (do)  
  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Are you playin' a game? It's always the same.  
Am I to blame, or is anyone? (anyone, anyone)  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh.
