Well, I looked for my baby ?bout the break of day  
I said, "I looked for my baby ?bout the break of day"  
But a blue train took my baby away  
Now the rail is rusted and the road is long  
I said, "The rail is rusted and the road is long"  
And that blue train won't bring my baby home  
I hear that whistle moaning, steel whinning on the track  
I hear that whistle moaning, steel whinning on the track  
But that blue train won't bring my baby back, no no no  
I'm going down to the station, down that road I'm going  
I'm going down to the station, down that road I'm going  
Gonna catch that blue train, bring my baby home  
Gonna catch that blue train, bring my baby home  
Gonna catch that blue train, gonna bring my baby back  
Gonna catch that blue train, gonna bring my baby back  
Gonna catch that blue train, gonna bring my baby back  
Blue train, blue train, blue train  
Gonna catch that blue train  
Blue train, blue train, blue train  
Gonna catch that blue train
