I'm nearly sober  
And I can see the truth  
I'm not immune to the sorrow that you put me through  
All I ever wanted  
Was a little more respect from you  
  
I used to love you  
But now I feel abused  
I was a fool to be blind to the things you do  
All I ever wanted  
Was a little more respect from you  
  
I'll never understand  
The habits of a man out on the town  
And where he hangs around  
  
Now you think it over  
Decide what to do  
I couldn't fall for your story if I wanted to  
All I ever wanted  
Was a little more respect from you  
  
I tried to make you see  
That you were losing me but every day  
You still went out to play  
  
And now I'll say for the last time  
You had the chance  
And I won't dance for you baby like you want me to  
All I ever wanted  
Was a little more respect from you  
  
All I ever wanted was a little more respect
