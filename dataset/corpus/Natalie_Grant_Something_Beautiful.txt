This is a song for anyone whose ever been  
Knocked down and can't get back again  
Stuck in the corner, can't move forward  
All alone and you think you're going nowhere  
This is a song for anyone whose ever stood underneath the sun  
And felt so small, two feet tall and so out of place  
  
He sees yo, He knows you, He loves you  
And He wants you to know that  
  
The life that you've been living, the days that you've been given  
Were made for something beautiful  
Life - don't let it pass you by  
Because you were created for something beautiful  
  
Heaven holds a dream that's just for you  
And there are things only you can do  
So step by faith, put the past away so step by faith, don't be afraid  
It'll take you to a better day put the past and your fears away  
Second to minute to hour to life  
Time always seems to fly  
It's on the go and before you know  
Your days are through  
  
But he sees you, He knows you, He loves you  
And he wants you to know that  
  
The life that you've been living, the days that you've been given  
Were made for something beautiful  
Life don't let it pass you by  
Because you were created for something beautiful  
  
What are you waiting for  
What are you waiting for  
What are you waiting for  
There's something beautiful
