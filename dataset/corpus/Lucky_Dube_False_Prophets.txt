We see them everyday  
Movin' up and down  
Holding their bibles in their hands yeah  
Going to church every Sunday  
Telling people they're Christians yeah  
Ye man, we read in the Bible  
And over stand  
It's telling us of all the false prophets  
When the Messiah's  
Gonna come down here  
Them a gonna' say these words  
Jesus I want to be like you  
  
[Chorus:]  
False prophets lies and elution  
  
A dem a go around  
Lamping da creation yeah  
I and I no like da Babylon style  
I and I no like da Babylon style  
Cause' dem a go around lampin' Jah creation  
Dem a go around telling dem lies  
Jesus I want to be like you  
  
[Chorus]
