As I walk this land of broken dreams  
I have visions of many things  
But happiness is just an illusion  
Filled with sadness and confusion  
  
What becomes of the brokenhearted?  
Who have loved, that's now departed  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind, baby  
  
The roots of love grow all around  
But for me they come a tumblin' down  
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger  
I can't stand this pain much longer  
  
I walk in shadow, searching for light  
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight  
Hoping and prayin' for someone to care  
Always movin' and goin' nowhere  
  
What becomes of the brokenhearted?  
Who have loved, that's now departed  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind, help me, please  
  
I'm searching though I don't succeed  
Someone's love, there's a growing need  
All is lost, there's no place for beginning  
All that's left is an unhappy ending  
  
Now, what becomes of the brokenhearted?  
Who have loved, that's now departed  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind  
I'll be searching everywhere  
Just to find someone to care  
  
Now, what becomes of the brokenhearted?  
Who have loved, that's now departed  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me now  
I'll find a way somehow  
I'll be lookin' everywhere  
I know I'm gonna find a way
