I'm not invited to the party  
Been sitting here all night  
I'm all alone at the party  
I don't feel alright  
Ain't got no black coat  
Ain't got no tie  
I gotta shape up now  
Come on baby you gotta know why  
  
Take off!  
Dancer, dancer  
I can't live with it, I'm gonna die without it  
Dancer, dancer  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Dancer, dancer  
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes  
And come and ride with me? Cool.  
  
You're the life and soul of the 'funktion'  
It took me all night  
To get hold of the right introduction  
Blew me out of sight  
I taste your lipstick  
I look in your eyes  
You feel fantastic  
My body cries  
  
Take off  
Dancer, dancer  
I can't live with it, I'm gonna die without it  
Dancer, dancer  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Dancer, dancer  
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes  
And come and ride with me?  
Hot space let's go!  
  
Yeah, can I see you baby?  
Dancer, dancer  
I can't believe you're dancing  
Dancer, dancer  
Can't take you home  
I can't take you dancing  
Dancer, dancer  
Bring out the funk and dance the night away  
Dancer, dancer  
We got bully  
Dancer, dancer  
  
Dancer dancer [Repeat]  
Dance, dance, dance, dance  
Dancer, dancer.
