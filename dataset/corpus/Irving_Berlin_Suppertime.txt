Supper time  
I should set the table  
'Cause it's supper time  
Somehow I'm not able  
  
'Cause that man o'mine  
Ain't comin' home no more  
Supper time  
Kids will soon be yellin'  
  
For their supper time  
How'll I keep from tellin'  
Them that man o'mine  
Ain't comin' home no more?  
  
How'll I keep explainin' when they ask me where he's gone?  
How'll I keep from cryin' when I bring their supper on?  
How can I remind them to pray at their humble board?  
How can I be thankful when they start to thank the Lord?  
  
Lord!  
Supper time  
I should set the table  
'Cause it's supper time  
  
Somehow I'm not able  
'Cause that man o'mine  
Ain't comin' home no more
