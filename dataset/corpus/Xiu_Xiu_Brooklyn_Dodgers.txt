Sorry I walked away when you told me what you were scared of the night that
you turned 12  
Trying not to cry in front of your older brother  
He knows where I live, he's not interested  
I can't have nice things,  
Like a boy who stays who stays around  
When I needed him the most on your walk  
Hold your head up high and when you watch me fall  
Please look back for the last time  
Brooklyn dodger
