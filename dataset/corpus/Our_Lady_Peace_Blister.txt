Lately I can't breathe  
Waiting they're chasing me  
No one listens but I'm OK with it (don't touch me)  
  
Only I wonder why  
If only my hands weren't tied  
The world's a blister  
But I'm OK with it (don't trust me)  
  
What if I was there  
What if I was scared  
I'm waiting for  
They're at my door  
But I'll be back again  
  
Lonely, I'm wandering  
Patrolling for enemies  
No one listens but I'm OK with it
