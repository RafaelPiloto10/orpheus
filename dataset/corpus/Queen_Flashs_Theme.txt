Flash, a-ah, saviour of the universe  
Flash, a-ah, he'll save everyone of us  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Flash, a-ah, he's a miracle  
Flash, a-ah, king of the impossible  
  
He's for everyone of us  
Stand for everyone of us  
He'll save with a mighty hand  
Every man, every woman  
Every child, with a mighty flash  
Flash, a-ah  
Flash, a-ah, he'll save everyone of us  
  
Just a man  
With a man's courage  
He knows nothing but a man  
But he can never fail  
No one but the pure in heart  
May find the golden grail  
Oh oh, oh oh  
Flash.
