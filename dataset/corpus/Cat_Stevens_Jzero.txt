Well I ain't got nothing,  
But it don't worry me.  
I came to this life like a free-walking tree.  
No need to be tied, no need to be.  
They call me Jzero.  
  
Well I ain't got nothing,  
And to nothing I belong.  
You won't find me right,  
Yet you won't find me wrong.  
If you think about me,  
Don't think too long.  
Jus' call me Jzero.  
  
Well I don't house no past,  
Never carried a key.  
My sun doesn't rise from under the sea.  
There is only one morning,  
Eternally, dee d'lee d'lee.  
  
Well he says he hasn't got nothing,  
But he seems to possess less.  
He waltzed through the door,  
Like a tapdance with death.  
What kind of fool is he?  
  
No need to guess, jus' call me Jzero.  
  
Well I don't eat a lot.  
I do work for nothing, so  
If there's a job I can fill the gap.  
I don't need a room, bed, or pillow, oh  
Once you've decided to trust me with time,  
You won't need to look back  
A doo, de, doo, de, doo.  
  
Well I ain't got nothing,  
But it don't worry me.  
I came to this life like a free-walking tree.  
No need to be tied, no need to be.  
They call me Jzero.
