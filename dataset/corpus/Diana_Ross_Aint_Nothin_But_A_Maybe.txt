Could it be he's interested?  
Or am I just wanting it to be so?  
Do I dare speak to him?  
Should I let the moment go?  
  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside  
Should I let the feeling flow?  
Should I just let it flow?  
Ain't nothing maybe, baby  
I sure would like to know  
  
Could it be he's just friendly?  
That ain't nothing to get excited about  
On the other hand, he could be answering  
Good vibrations I'm sending out  
  
Well, I just don't know  
What I'm really seeing  
Should I make a move?  
Or keep on day dreaming?  
  
Ain't nothing maybe, baby  
I sure would like to  
I want to know  
I want to know  
I want to know  
I sure would like to  
  
Could it be he's interested?  
Should I let the moment go  
Forget this feeling inside  
Forget this feeling inside?  
  
Should I let the feeling flow?  
Should I just let it flow?  
Ain't nothing maybe, baby  
I sure would like to  
I want to know  
I want to know  
I want to know  
  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside  
Should I let the feeling flow?  
Should I just let it flow?  
Ain't nothing maybe  
Ain't nothing maybe, baby  
  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside  
Should I let the feeling flow?  
Should I just let it flow?  
Ain't nothing maybe, baby  
Ain't nothing maybe, baby  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside
