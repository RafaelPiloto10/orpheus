Storm clouds cruising cross the blue skies  
Shadows float across the fields of barley  
I find myself an island in an island  
I have to sort things out just my way  
  
And all I find is my bar  
To laugh, to me I say  
Like all you know is true  
Is for every time we know it's mine  
  
I saw clouds cruise floating cross the blue sky  
Shadows float across the fields of barley  
Hero down the right way  
Everything will come out my way  
  
Now I know, I see, I find  
It's the only way I ever felt the way I do today  
All I say, I play the game  
I know I never could be sure of all the places that I've seen  
  
Clouds cruising cross the blue skies  
Shadows float across the fields of barley  
Every self an island in an island  
Working every problem out my way  
  
Now I see, I feel, I know  
It's the only way that anything could sort out to the way  
I say you'll find it's out of mind  
It's the only way I could have been  
It's the only way I stand  
  
Clouds cruise  
Float upon the barley
