Belligerent ghouls  
Run Manchester schools  
  
Spineless swines  
Cemented minds  
  
Sir leads the troops  
Jealous of youth  
Same old suit since 1962  
  
He does the military two-step  
Down the nape of my neck  
  
I want to go home  
I don't want to stay  
Give up education  
As a bad mistake  
  
Mid-week on the playing fields  
Sir thwacks you on the knees  
  
Knees you in the groin  
Elbow in the face  
Bruises bigger than dinner plates  
  
I want to go home  
I don't want to stay  
  
Da-da-da ...  
  
Belligerent ghouls  
Run Manchester schools  
  
Spineless bastards all ...  
  
Sir leads the troops  
Jealous of youth  
Same old jokes since 1902  
  
He does the military two-step  
Down the nape of my neck  
  
I want to go home  
I don't want to stay  
Give up life  
As a bad mistake  
  
Please excuse me from gym  
I've got this terrible cold coming on  
He grabs and devours  
He kicks me in the showers  
Kicks me in the showers  
And he grabs and devours  
  
I want to go home  
I don't want to stay...  
  
Da-da-da ...
