If I leave here tomorrow  
Would you still remember me  
For I must be travelin' on now  
There's too many places I got to see  
  
If I stay here with you girl  
Things just couldn't be the same  
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now  
And this bird you cannot change  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
And the bird you cannot change  
And this bird you cannot change  
Lord knows, I can't change  
  
Bye and bye baby, it's been sweet love, yeah yeah  
Though this feelin' I can't change  
Please don't take it so badly  
'Cause Lord knows, I'm to blame  
  
And if I stay here with you girl  
Things just couldn't even be the same  
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now  
And this bird you cannot change  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
And the bird you cannot change  
And this bird you cannot change  
  
Lord knows, I can't change  
Lord help me, I can't change  
Lord I can't change  
Won't you fly high free bird yeah
