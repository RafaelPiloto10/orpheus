He is a man forced to live with the rats  
But he is dying for a smile from you  
He is a man without a home in his life  
Is that a reason to walk on the line  
  
It's like a game - don't mess around  
Don't be a fool so just go on  
  
No life of double standard what he's looking for  
Only a dream of tender delight  
No more a bloody fool in this dirty town  
So get away take your own line  
  
Hard is the game - don't turn around  
You make the rules so hold your ground  
  
He's got a heart of gold  
The brain to realize he leads the better life  
He's got a heart of gold  
So free your mind - live with a smile  
  
Heart of gold - just like a diamond in the rough  
He is dying for a touch from you  
No more a bloody fool in this god damned town  
Please be strong for just one time  
  
So play this game and move the pawns  
It's up to you so just go on  
  
He's got a heart of gold  
The heart to free his soul, the heart to reach the goal  
Sweet little a heart of gold  
So free and fine - live with a smile  
  
Live with a smile on your face  
Hard is the game - don't turn around  
No more a fool so just go on  
  
He's got a heart of gold  
The brain to realize he leads the better life  
He's got a heart of gold  
So free your mind - live with a smile  
  
He's got a heart of gold  
The heart to free his soul, the heart to reach the goal  
Sweet little a heart of gold  
So free and fine - live with a smile  
  
Just live with a smile on your face  
He is dying for a smile from you  
So just go on - go on - go on  
With your heart of gold  
  
Don't turn around  
You make the rules so hold your ground  
Sweet little a heart of gold
