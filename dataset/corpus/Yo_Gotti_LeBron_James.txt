Big wheels on my Phantom, got it sittin' crooked  
Three birds for a show, nigga gon' book it  
I'm LeBron James, you a fuckin' rookie  
Your broad want a ticket I'mma go and book it  
Book it, book it  
Book it, book it  
I'mma go and book it  
Big dollars in my pocket, got me sittin' crooked  
  
A hundred racks in my pocket, I can't even walk  
Fifty hitters with me nigga, I set it off  
Poppin' bottles, blowing money, I'm just having fun  
Me and my niggas fresh to death, upper echelon  
I got buckles on my shoes and they gold bitch  
Open my doors in reverse, this that Rolls bitch  
CMG Bentley coupe, that's a cold kit  
See the bird, double R, that's some cold shit  
All I rock is white, them on my old shit  
All my niggas solid, all my hoes thick  
DJ drop that Gotti, this that dope boy shit  
Smelling like a bag, I'm looking like a brick  
  
Big wheels on my Phantom, got it sittin' crooked  
Three birds for a show, nigga gon' book it  
I'm LeBron James, you a fuckin' rookie  
Your broad want a ticket I'mma go and book it  
Book it, book it  
Book it, book it  
I'mma go and book it  
Big dollars in my pocket, got me sittin' crooked  
  
They say I signed to Tip, I say when I do that  
Me and Tip, we're conversating bout where them choppas at (bang bang)  
I be where them goonies and them robbers at (I am)  
So when you see that Phantom dog don't follow that  
Ridin' in a rental, gettin' that pack off  
Fish scale yay I call it bath salts  
Trap doing good, I can't complain  
It's been a damn good month, I moved like 20 things  
Then went and bought that new Jeep, that SRT  
Yo ho suck dick on sight, ASAP  
Just got a yellow AP and that bitch nasty  
When I popped out my second week I coulda bought a Aston  
  
Big wheels on my Phantom, got it sittin' crooked  
Three birds for a show, nigga gon' book it  
I'm LeBron James, you a fuckin' rookie  
Your broad want a ticket I'mma go and book it  
Book it, book it  
Book it, book it  
I'mma go and book it  
Big dollars in my pocket, got me sittin' crooked
