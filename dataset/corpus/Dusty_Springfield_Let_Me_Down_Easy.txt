Ahh-haa  
Now, if you're gonna let me down  
Let me down easy  
So I won't be too hurt  
After you've gone, ahh honey  
  
If you're gonna set me down  
Set me down easy  
From that special cloud  
You put me on, ooh-hoo  
  
Let me down easy  
Oh baby  
Let me down slow  
So slow and easy, oh  
And if you're gonna leave me, baby  
Baby please leave me  
A little memory  
To soften the fall, ooh-hoo  
  
Let me down easy, easy  
You gotta do it  
You gotta do it  
You gotta let me down slow  
So slow, slow  
  
If you're gonna let me down  
Sweet baby  
Let me down so easy  
So I can't be too hurt after you've gone, ooh baby, ah, ha, yeah  
  
Ahh, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Do it for me, do it, do it, ahh, yeah  
(From that special cloud)  
You put me on  
You put me on it, oh, yeah  
Now if you're gonna let me down  
Let me down easy
