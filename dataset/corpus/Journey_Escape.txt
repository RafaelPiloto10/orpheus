He's just a young boy out of school  
Livin' his world like he wants to  
They're makin' laws, but they don't understand  
Turns a boy in to a fightin' man  
They won't take me  
They won't break me  
No one could tell him what to do  
Had to learn everything the hard way  
He's on the street, breakin' all the rules  
I'm tellin' you that he's nobody's fool  
They won't take me  
They won't break me  
Now he's leavin', gettin' out from this masquerade  
Oh gotta go  
  
I'm finally out in the clear and I'm free  
I've got dreams I'm livin' for  
I'm movin' on where they'll never find me  
Rollin' on to anywhere  
I'll break away, yes I'm on my way  
Leavin' today, yes I'm on my way  
Just when you think you had it all figured out  
Runnin' scared can change your mind  
I never knew I had so much to give  
How hard times can fool ya  
Oh I'm okay, I'm alright  
Feelin' good out on your own  
  
I'll break away, I'll break away tonight  
I've got dreams I'm livin' for  
I'll break away  
Yes, I'm on my way  
I'm leaving', leavin' today  
Yes, I'm on my way  
This is my escape  
Yes, I'm on my way  
I'll break away  
Yes, I'm on my way
