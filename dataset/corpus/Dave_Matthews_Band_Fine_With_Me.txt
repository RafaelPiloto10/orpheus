I must admit  
I can't remember your name  
I know we just met,  
But since then I've had a lot to think about  
Before we part ways, well, there's something that I'd like to say  
I realize it's late  
But if you'll hear out I'm sure  
Dave Letterman can wait  
And if you'd like to  
Maybe continue, what we started with a smile  
From across the room  
That'd be fine with me  
When I first saw  
  
Your face, I knew for sure  
That from now on  
Things would be different than before  
I walk in weak  
From yet another day  
I need you to say  
That tomorrow I'm gonna hear your voice again  
And if you'd like to, maybe continue,  
What we started with a smile from across the room  
That'd be fine with me  
And I only hope that I can be what you were looking for  
Cause all I ask is that you look my way  
And that'd be fine with me  
I know it's clich
