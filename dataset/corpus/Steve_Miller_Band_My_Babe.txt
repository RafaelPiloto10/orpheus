My babe, she don't stand no cheatin', my babe  
Oh no, she don't stand no cheatin', not my babe  
Oh yes, she don't stand no cheatin'  
She don't stand none of that midnight creepin'  
My babe, true little baby  
That's my babe, true little baby  
  
My babe, I know she loves me, my babe  
Oh yes, I know she loves me, my babe  
Oh yes, I know she loves me  
She don't do nothin' but kiss and hug me  
My babe, true little baby  
That's my babe, true little baby  
  
My babe, she don't stand no foolin', my babe  
Oh no, she don't stand no foolin', my babe  
Oh no, she don't stand no foolin'  
When she's hot there ain't no coolin'  
My babe, true little baby  
That's my babe, true little baby  
  
She's my baby, true little baby  
She's my babe, true little baby  
She's my baby, true little baby  
She's my babe, true little baby
