(Avril)  
  
And I'd give up forever to touch you  
'cause I know that you feel me somehow  
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be  
And I don't want to go home right now  
  
And all I can taste is this moment  
And all I can breathe is your life  
'cause sooner or later it's over  
I just don't want to miss you tonight  
  
And I don't want the world to see me  
'cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
(Johnny)  
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming  
Or the moment of truth in your lies  
When everything feels like the movies  
Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive  
  
(Both)  
And I don't want the world to see me  
'cause I don't think that they'd understand  
When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me

When everything's made to be broken  
I just want you to know who I am  
  
I just want you to know who I am  
I just want you to know who I am  
I just want you to know who I am
