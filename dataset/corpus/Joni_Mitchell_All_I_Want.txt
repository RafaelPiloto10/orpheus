I am on a lonely road and I am traveling  
Traveling, traveling, traveling  
Looking for something, what can it be  
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some  
I love you some  
Oh I love you when I forget about me  
I want to be strong I want to laugh along  
I want to belong to the living  
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive  
I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive  
Do you want, do you want, do you want  
To dance with me baby  
Do you want to take a chance  
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby  
Well, come on  
  
All I really really want our love to do  
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too  
All I really really want our love to do  
Is to bring out the best in me and in you  
I want to talk to you, I want to shampoo you  
I want to renew you again and again  
Applause, applause, life is our cause  
When I think of your kisses  
My mind see-saws  
Do you see, do you see, do you see  
How you hurt me baby  
So I hurt you too  
Then we both get so blue  
  
I am on a lonely road and I am traveling  
Looking for the key to set me free  
Oh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling  
It's the unraveling  
And it undoes all the joy that could be  
I want to have fun, I want to shine like the sun  
I want to be the one that you want to see  
I want to knit you a sweater  
Want to write you a love letter  
I want to make you feel better  
I want to make you feel free  
Hm, hm, hm, hm,  
Want to make you feel free  
I want to make you feel free
