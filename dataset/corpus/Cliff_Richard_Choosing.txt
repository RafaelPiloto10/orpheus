  
I've tried to ignore  
All the stench of your life  
Only holding back  
For my wife  
Even she has seen  
Your poisoned soul displayed  
Seen each move you've made  
Contaminate, degrade  
  
Who's this juvenile?  
Who's this infantile clown?  
He's not ever worth  
Knocking down  
Stamp your tiny foot  
My precious little lamb  
Bleat ad nauseam  
But i don't give a damn  
  
Where to go? heart ever hounded  
Coward? no - spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release  
God alone can give me peace  
Watching me scream and hate  
Only choosing when it's too late  
  
May this imbecile  
Cause your heart to feel joy  
You did after all  
Choose the toy  
Do you now suppose  
I'll leave with no reply?  
Basic laws apply  
An eye demands an eye  
  
Where to go? heart ever hounded  
Coward? no - spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release  
God alone can give peace  
Watching me scream and hate  
Only choosing when it's too late
