Under the sun  
There's nothing to hide  
Under the moon  
A stranger waits inside  
People disappear  
The music fades away  
Splashing through the rain  
I'll dream with them one day  
  
It's raining, raining  
On the streets of New York City  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
  
I may have wasted all those years  
They're not worth their time in tears  
I may have spent too long in darkness  
In the warmth of my fears  
  
Take a look at yourself  
Not at anyone else  
And tell me what you see  
  
I know the air is cold  
I know the streets are cruel  
But I'll enjoy the ride today  
  
It's raining, raining  
On the streets of New York City  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
Raining deep in heaven  
  
I may have wasted all those years  
They're not worth their time in tears  
I may have spent too long in darkness  
In the warmth of my fears  
And as I walk through all my myths  
Rising and sinking like the waves  
With my thoughts wrapped around me  
Through a trial of tears  
  
Hidden by disguise  
Stumbling in a world  
Feeling uninspired  
He gets into his car  
Not within his eyes to see  
Open up, open up  
Not much better than the man you hate  
  
Still awake  
I continue to move along  
Cultivating my own nonsense  
Welcome to the wasteland  
Where you'll find ashes  
Nothing but ashes  
Still awake  
Bringing change  
Bringing movement, bringing life  
A silent prayer  
Thrown away  
Disappearing in the air  
Rising  
Sinking  
Raining deep inside me  
Nowhere to turn  
I look for a way back home  
  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven
