[Chorus]  
We only have one world, We only have one love  
We have so little time together you and I  
And all we have to do is try  
  
We've got so many road before us  
There are mountains we must climb  
But who will show us  
  
There's a hundred million stories in the sand  
But there's only one thing we must understand  
If we can, Yes we can, Ah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We've got so much pain and confusion  
Are we living for the truth or an illusion?  
  
All this fighting cannot get us very far  
If we don't stop and see just who we are  
Can't go far, We can't go far, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We just need to walk together  
We just need to talk together  
We just need to come together  
In our hearts  
  
[Chorus]
