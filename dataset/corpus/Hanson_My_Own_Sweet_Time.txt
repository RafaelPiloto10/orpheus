Hello, goodbye my friend  
Feels like the start all over again  
But I'd rather not pretend  
There aren't things still left to mend  
Somebody break my fall  
I'm slipping down all over again  
  
I'm doing it all over  
Taking my own sweet time  
I may make it slower  
But I'm taking my own sweet time  
I'm taking my own sweet...  
  
Tell me where I begin  
You can't deny what's already been  
I won't break but I can bend  
Shaping the scars that I can't mend  
Feel your fingers around my throat  
There's nothing but bones beneath my skin  
Somebody break my fall  
I'm slipping down all over again  
  
I'm doing it all over  
Taking my own sweet time  
I may make it slower  
But I'm taking my own sweet time  
I'm taking my own sweet...  
  
I'm doing it all over, my friend  
You know I'd do it all over again  
  
Hello, goodbye my friend  
Until we start all over again  
Somebody break my fall  
I'm slipping down all over again  
  
I'm doing it all over  
Taking my own sweet time  
I may make it slower  
But I'm taking my own sweet time  
I'm taking my own sweet time
