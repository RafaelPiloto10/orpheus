Once, we did run  
How we chased a million stars  
and touched as only one can  
Once, we did play  
How the past delivered you  
Amidst our youth we'd dream away, away  
As if I knew the words I'm sure you'll hear  
Of how we met as you recall so well  
Once, we did love  
Long ago how did I forget  
Holding you so closely  
Look, how I move  
Chance would have me glance at you  
To know how you move me, me  
All barriers fall around us as we hear  
Of memories known and matters long ago, so clear  
[interlude]  
Once, we did run  
How we chased a million stars  
And touched as only one can
