Stand and face each other  
Don't know what to say  
But that look in your eyes  
Give it all away  
You say you've got these feelings  
You can't put into words  
But you don't have to say a thing  
'Cause I've already heard  
Give me one good reason  
Why this has to be  
That's all I'm asking for  
Don't say that it's over  
When you and I both know  
You can't put out this love  
The fire burns below  
We've been through so much together  
We've laughed and we've sometimes cried  
To say our love ain't working, well we  
Haven't really tried  
But why let's talk things over  
Love can't be bought and sold  
One more night together's what the future holds  
What the future holds  
Well, give me one good reason  
Why this has to be  
I said that's all I'm asking for  
Can't you see I said  
You can't put out the fire down below
