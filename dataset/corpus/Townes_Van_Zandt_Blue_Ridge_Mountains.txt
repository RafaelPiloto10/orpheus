My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
And I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
I had me a mother that could pray, boys  
She prayed for me both night and day, boys  
And I tore down every down every prayer that she could say, boys  
And I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
I want to find me a lady fair and tender  
Want to play her song on my steel strings  
Gonna lay her down in a bed of clover  
Then I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
I've seen this whole wide country over  
From New York city down to Mexico  
And I've seen the joyful and the sorrow  
And I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
So Mister [Sinby] can you hear me  
Down there in [Gracel], Louisana-O  
I'll lay a joint upon your grave, Sir  
Then I ain't comin' back here anymore  
  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
My home is in the Blue Ridge mountains  
And I ain't comin' back here anymore
