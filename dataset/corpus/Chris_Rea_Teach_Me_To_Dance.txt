I'm a boat without an ocean  
I'm a boat without a wave  
I'm a sail without a strong wind  
And I want someone to save, to save me  
  
Teach me to dance  
  
I'm a car without a driver  
I'm a plane without a wing  
I see you standing by my doorway  
But I don't know how to let you in  
  
Teach me to dance  
  
I've been watching too much tv  
I can't feel myself no more  
I'm tired of all those macho movies  
That ain't what this life is for  
  
I don't want to hurt nobody  
Just laughing, that's how I wanna be  
Cause when that brick goes through that window  
It don't make nobody free  
  
Teach me to dance
