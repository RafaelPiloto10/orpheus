Seems like we're holding on forever  
I gotta let it go  
Times up, you pushed me to surrender (tonight)  
Who knows what's happens now whatever  
Wherever the wind blows  
And I'm there as long as were together  
Alright  
  
Lets have the time of our lives!  
Like there's no one else around  
Just throw your hands up high  
Even when they try to take us down  
We'll have the time of our lives  
Till the lights burn out  
Let's laugh until we cry  
Life is only what you make it now  
Let's have the time of our lives!  
  
Dreamers don't care if it's right  
I think I'm really into you  
Restless, let's leave it all behind  
And tonight  
  
Crazy when you cross my mind  
Oh the trouble we could get into  
So what let's just give this a try  
Alright  
  
Let's have the time of our lives!  
Like there's no one else around  
Just throw your hands up high  
Even when they try to take us down  
We'll have the time of our lives  
Till the lights burn out  
Let's laugh until we cry  
Life is only what you make it now  
Let's have the time of our lives!  
  
Lookin' back what are we waitin' for?  
Take the chance  
Now's all we got for sure!  
  
Let's have the time of our lives!  
Like there's no one else around  
Just throw your hands up high  
Even when they try to take us down  
We'll have the time of our lives  
Till the lights burn out  
Let's laugh until we cry  
Life is only what you make it now  
Let's have the time of our lives!
