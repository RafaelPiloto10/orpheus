A man can lose his past, in a country like this ? Wandering aimless ?  
Parched and nameless ?  
A Man could lose his way, in a country like this ? Canyons and cactus ?  
Endless and trackless  
  
Searching through grim eternity  
Sculptured by prehistoric sea ?  
  
Seven Cities of Gold ?  
Stories that fired my imagination  
Seven Cities of Gold ?  
A splendid mirage in this desolation  
Seven Cities of Gold ?  
Glowing in my dreams, like hallucinations  
Glitter in the sun like a revelation  
Distant as a comet or a constellation  
  
A man can lose himself, in a country like this  
Rewrite the story ?  
Recapture the glory ?  
A man could lose his life, in a country like this ? Sunblind and friendless ?  
Frozen and endless ?  
The nights grow longer, the father I go  
  
Wake to aching cold, and a deep Sahara of snow ?  
That gleam in the distance could be heaven's gate  
  
A long-awaited treasure at the end of my cruel fate
