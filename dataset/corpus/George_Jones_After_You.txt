So September follows August, I don't mind  
So three and four and the fifth comes after two  
Will anything mean anything, do I care what tomorrow brings  
I only wonder what comes after you.  
  
After you when someone smiles at me I wonder what to trust  
After you I'll be suspicious of anything that's nice  
I don't know that I'll get over you and if I ever do  
I'll never doubt this much again, not after you.  
  
Loving you it's just to good to last forever  
So the world could end tomorrow I won't care  
After you when someone tells me there's no heaven on this earth  
I can say that I know better, I've been there.  
  
After you when someone smiles at me I'll wonder what to trust  
After you I'll be suspicious of anything that's nice  
I don't know that I'll get over you and if I ever do  
I'll never doubt this much again, not after you...
