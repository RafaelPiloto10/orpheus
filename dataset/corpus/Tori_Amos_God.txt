God sometimes you just don't come through  
God sometimes you just don't come through  
Do you need a woman to look after you  
God sometimes you just don't come through  
  
You make pretty daisies pretty daisies love  
I gotta find what you're doing about things here  
A few witches burning gets a little toasty here  
I gotta find why you always go when the wind blows  
Tell me you're crazy maybe then I'll understand  
You got your nine iron in the back seat just in case  
Heard you've gone south well babe you love your new four wheel  
I gotta find why you always go when the wind blows  
  
(Give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings)  
  
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky fall  
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky  
  
God sometimes you just don't come through  
God sometimes you just don't come through  
Do you need a woman to look after you  
God sometimes you just don't come through
