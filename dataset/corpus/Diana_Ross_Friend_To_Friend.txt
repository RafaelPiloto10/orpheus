When I gave all of my love to you  
I said you were a dream come true  
  
Good to you,  
So good to you  
Is what I'm gonna be  
And I hope you fall in love with me  
  
Persevere is what we'll do  
What we'll do to make  
Our love everlasting  
  
Oh, friend I owe all of my life to you  
I said you were a dream come true  
I don't want  
No, I don't want to be so cold to you  
It's just a defense that I sometimes use  
  
I have often thought that I  
Had no love to give  
But it's yours for the asking  
Ooh  
  
I have often thought  
I had no love to give  
It's yours  
Yours for the asking  
  
Oh friend  
I give my life to you  
I say you are a dream come true  
Oh friend,  
Oh friend  
I give my life to you  
I say you are  
You are a dream come true  
  
Friend to friend
