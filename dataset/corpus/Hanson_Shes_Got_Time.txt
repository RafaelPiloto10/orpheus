She caught my eye with the moves she makes,  
She knew I meant to make her mine  
'cause' there'll be heat in this seduction  
I didn't read between the lines  
  
She's got time to lose your mind  
  
I know her looks are meant to kill  
That is not what she realized  
Her wits so sharp, so shrill  
She'll bang you slowly with her mind  
  
She's got time to blow your mind  
  
Chorus: She'll keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up, she can't stop  
Getting it tough, she'll keep spinning you around (round, round)  
She'll keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up, she can't stop  
Getting it tough, you'll keep banging em' down (down, down)  
  
She says the words you want to hear  
She's been rehearsing every line  
The love you need to have to lead me  
Forget your moves, she'll rob you blind  
  
She's got time to lose your mind  
  
Her body moves to gain corruption  
Her tender touch like none before  
Feel that twist so deep seduction  
To steal that halo off your door  
  
She's got time to lose your mind  
  
Chorus: She'll keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up, she can't stop  
Getting it tough, she'll keep spinning you around(round, round)  
She'll keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up, she can't stop  
Getting it tough, you'll keep banging em' down (down, down)  
  
(undestinguishable rap section)  
  
So her looks are meant to kill  
That is not what she realized  
Her wits so sharp, so shrill  
She'll bang you slowly with her mind  
  
She's got time, to blow your mind..  
  
Chorus x3
