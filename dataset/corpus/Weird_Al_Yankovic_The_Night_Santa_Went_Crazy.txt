Down in the workshop all the elves were making toys  
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys  
When the boss busted in, nearly scared 'em half to death  
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath  
From his beard to his boots he was covered with ammo  
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo  
And he smiled as he said, with a twinkle in his eye,  
"Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!"  
  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night St. Nick went insane  
Realized he'd been gettin' the raw deal  
Something finally must have snapped in his brain  
  
Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it  
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet  
And he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage  
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage  
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger  
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddie Krueger  
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen  
And he took a big bite and said, "It tastes just like chicken!"  
  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night Kris Kringle went nuts  
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole  
Without stepping in reindeer guts  
  
There's the National Guard and the F. B. I.  
There's a van from the Eyewitness News  
And helicopters circling around in the sky  
And the bullets are flying, the body count's rising  
And everyone's dyin' to know, oh Santa, why?  
My my my my my my  
You used to be such a jolly guy  
  
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time  
In a federal prison for his infamous crime  
Hey, little friend, now don't you cry no more tears  
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years  
But now Vixen's in therapy and Donner's still nervous  
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service  
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night  
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights  
  
They're talkin' 'bout  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night St. Nicholas flipped  
Broke his back for some milk and cookies  
Sounds to me like he was tired of getting gypped  
  
Wo-oh, the night Santa went crazy  
The night St. Nick went insane  
Realized he'd been gettin' a raw deal  
Something finally must have snapped in his brain  
Wo-oh, something finally must have snapped in his brain  
Tell ya, something finally must have snapped, in his brain
