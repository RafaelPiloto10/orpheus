Looking back  
I can see the things  
I should'a done, could'a done  
I see so much of my life I let go by  
But when you're young  
All you know how to do is wrong  
Life can play tricks sometimes, you know  
You think you got everything  
When you got nothing at all  
The only way you know where you're going  
You gotta take a fall, you've got to lose it all  
I've been through love  
(I'm coming home)  
I've been through some pain I know  
(I'm coming home)  
Changes in my life  
(I'm coming home)  
Now I know what's meaningful  
(I'm coming home)  
Looking back  
I hear my family calling me  
All my friends and loves I let go by  
They wanted me to stay  
But I was on a journey  
There are so many faces  
There are so many stories I know  
But when I opened my eyes I had to realise  
There's only one place to go,  
This time I'm sure  
I've been through love  
(I'm coming home)  
I've been through some pain I know  
(I'm coming home)  
Changes in my life  
(I'm coming home)  
Now I know what's meaningful  
(I'm coming home)  
Through all the things that I've been through  
There's only one thing left to do  
This time I'm gonna get it right (uh huh)  
I've been through love  
(I'm coming home)  
I, I've been through some pain I know  
(I'm coming home)  
Changes in my life  
(I'm coming home)  
Now I know what's meaningful  
(I'm coming home)  
I've been through love  
(I'm coming home)  
Pain I know  
(I'm coming home)  
Changes in my life  
(I'm coming home)  
Now I understand what's meaningful  
(I'm coming home)  
So much love (Love)  
(I'm coming home)  
Pain I know (Pain)  
(I'm coming home)  
I, I've had some changes in my life  
(I'm coming home)  
Now I know what's meaningful  
(I'm coming home)  
What's beautiful, it's so beautiful  
I'm coming home  
(I'm coming home)
