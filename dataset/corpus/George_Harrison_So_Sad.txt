Now the winter has come  
To eclipse out the sun  
That has lighted my love for sometime  
And a cold wind now blows  
  
Not much tenderness flows  
From the heart of someone feeling so tired  
And he feels so alone  
With no love of his own  
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad  
  
While his memory raced  
With much speed and great haste  
Through the problems of being there  
In his heart at arm's length  
  
Held within its great strength  
To ward off such a great despair  
But he feels so alone  
With no love of his own  
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad  
  
Take the dawn of the day  
And give it away  
To someone who can fill the part  
Of the dream we once held  
  
Now it's got to be shelved  
It's too late to make a new start  
And he feels so alone  
With no love of his own  
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad
