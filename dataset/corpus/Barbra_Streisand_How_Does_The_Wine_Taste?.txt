How does the wine taste?  
Does it stain your lips?  
What is the fruit-like?  
Just beyond my finger tips?  
Just out of reach, I see so much  
I cannot taste and mustn't touch  
Tied to my little world  
My safe little world  
What would it be like  
If I broke the string?  
Would it be lovely  
And a little frightening?  
There is so much I've never understood  
How does the wine taste? Is it good?  
How does the wine taste?  
Does it make you glow?  
How does the wine taste?  
How does the wine taste?  
How does the wine taste?  
I think I know
