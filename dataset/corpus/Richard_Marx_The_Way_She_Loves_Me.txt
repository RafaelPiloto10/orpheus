I'll have this feeling 'till the day that I die  
When I hear my baby calling  
A simple motion, a look in her eyes  
And I'm helplessly falling  
I'd give all of somebody else  
For any piece of her heart that's left  
She knows me better than I know myself  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me tell you 'bout the way she loves me  
Ooh, I want the world to know  
I'm crazy 'bout the way she loves me  
Ooh, I'm proud to let it show, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Came close to letting this train pass me by  
Just like a fool second guessing  
I could've spent my life wondering why  
I didn't cherish the blessing  
If I'd have known she'd come my way  
The lonely nights would have been okay  
I have her promise that she's gonna stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody else could do me right  
A breath of heaven in my darkest night  
I'm gonna hold on with all of my might  
  
[Chorus]
