I'm not  
Crawling around  
Looking for a friend.  
I'm not  
Thinking the big I am.  
I'm not  
Down on the ground  
Looking for a cure.  
I'm not  
Saying that I'm the man.  
  
And I'm not asking for your opinion.  
I'm not asking for a miracle.  
And I'm not asking you to remember me,  
Not asking for the ghost to call.  
  
I'm  
Cold and corrupt  
Looking for a heart.  
I'm  
Trying to hide my scars.  
I'm  
Talking to you  
Like a shadow in the dark.  
I'm  
Just trying to survive.  
  
(Call my name, hide my shame)  
I call this human emotion.  
(Save my soul, save my soul)  
I call this human corrosion.  
  
And I'm not asking you for emotion,  
I'm not asking for the sky to mend.  
And I'm not asking you for nostalgia,  
I'm not asking for the world to end.  
And I'm not asking for your opinion,  
I'm not asking for a miracle.  
And I'm not asking you to remember me,  
Not asking for the ghost to call
