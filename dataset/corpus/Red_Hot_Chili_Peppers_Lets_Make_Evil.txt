Let's make evil  
Let's make good  
I'd do anything I could  
Just to get you in my dirt word  
Go down on you  
  
Seventeen and thirty-one  
I am just my mother's son  
Brown eyes and a silver tongue  
All the mothers come undone  
At the sight of me  
  
Chorus:  
The water's falling clear  
Interiors decieve I fear  
I think I'll kiss my shame away  
My prudence is not dear  
Inside out and feeling weird  
I think I'll kiss my shame away  
  
Let's get soft  
Let's get hard  
Let's get off in my backyard  
Where the desert wind  
Will wash our skin  
A lighter red  
  
Let's make peace  
Let's make war  
Let's break into heaven for  
A dance with heaven's devils or  
Is that more than you can store  
Inside your head  
  
Chorus  
  
I don't want to live alone  
Get on my throne  
Slay my shame  
Slay my shame  
  
Let's get gentle  
Let's get pissed  
Get your knickers in a twist  
Cause the angel and the devil kiss  
They fell in love  
  
Some seem dirty  
Some say clean  
Something from a madman's dream  
Am I really what I seem?  
Rising to my head like cream  
It feels so strange  
  
Chorus  
  
Slay my shame  
Slay my shame  
I don't want to live alone  
Get on my throne  
Slay my shame  
Slay my shame
