I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And what was in those ships all three,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
And what was in those ships all three,  
On Christmas day in the morning?  
  
Our Saviour, Christ, and His Lady,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
Our Saviour, Christ, and His Lady,  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And all the angels in Heaven shall sing  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
And all the angels in Heaven shall sing  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And let us all rejoice and sing  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
And let us all rejoice and sing  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
La da la la la la la la...
