Oh, the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird, and she warbles when she flies  
But she never hollers cuckoo till the fourth day of July.  
I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler and I lay my money down  
But I never start gamblin' when the cuckoo bird's around, round.  
Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird, and she warbles when she flies  
But she never hollers cuckoo till the fourth day of July.  
Said Jack o'Diamonds, well Jack o'Diamonds, Lord, I know you of old,  
Honey you robbed me of my silver and out of my gold.
