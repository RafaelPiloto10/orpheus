TELL ME OF SPRING  
Come to me at Spring  
Every little thing  
Just makes me want you so  
I, I'm like the worn leaf  
Blowing to and from  
Until I find my home  
You appear, I'm alive,  
Forget my fears, forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside.  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
I fall to the ground  
Send my prayer to the clouds  
There are no choices  
Hear the silence of sound  
Lay your head down  
And drink from the voices  
You appear I'm alive  
Forget my fears, forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside.  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
(SHORT MUSICAL INTERLUDE)  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)(TWICE)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
(SHORT MUSICAL INTERLUDE)  
Come to me at Spring  
Every little thing  
Just makes me want you so
