And with this message  
That I bring to you  
A beacon of light  
To see you through  
For time is on our side  
And a holy man  
Does say to me  
To always to be blind  
And never to see  
It's not the way he planned it  
Oh no  
  
The time has come to gather up your thoughts  
For you have said your piece  
The lords of light will change this land  
From famine into feast  
The buildings that once stood tall  
Have crumbled to the ground  
The silver warriors who came in force  
Are nowhere to be found  
  
Time is the essence the priests do say  
To restore your faith in man  
For the job you do and the role you play  
Will help rebuild this land  
Through empty streets and dusty fields  
We'll fight for what we need  
Protected by our swords and shields  
We can replant the seed  
  
The roads ahead are long and winding  
On which the bandits thrive  
But we have the power of finding  
Illusion to keep us alive  
So through the valleys and over the hills  
We'll march and sing in rhyme  
We'll fight until we lose our will  
For essence is our time  
  
The sun the moon  
The darkened sky  
The morning dew  
Reflecting in my eye  
The rising mist  
The dampened earth  
Are just reminders of what life's worth  
Whoah yeah  
Whoah yeah  
Whoah yeah  
  
And with this message  
That I bring to you  
A beacon of light  
To see you through  
For time is on our side  
For time is the essence
