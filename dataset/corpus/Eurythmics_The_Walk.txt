I could be contended  
I don't need to suffer  
You're beautiful  
Good to talk to  
You make an impression  
To take my attention  
And when you touch my skin  
I smell disaster  
  
Step away, walk away  
All I want is the real thing  
(nothing but the real thing)  
  
Walking on pavements  
We collect in bars  
Asleep in the houses  
So alone,  
Looking inside herself  
She breaks the glass  
Turns her head backwards  
She's fallen down again
