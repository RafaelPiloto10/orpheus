You've lived on beans and rice  
And fell for Jesus Christ  
And if your pants are nice  
Mother nature's son,  
Never made sense until you begun  
To play the kids for fun  
  
Maybe start a TV show  
A service in day-glo  
Watch your ethics grow  
  
Mother nature's kid,  
Just keep the money hid  
As if you never did sell  
  
Mother nature's son  
Never made sense until you begun  
To play the kids for fun  
  
You've never tasted hell  
'cause Judas signed you well  
And if the story sells  
  
Mother nature's kid,  
Just keep the money hid  
As if you never did sell  
  
Mother nature's son  
Never made sense until you begun  
To play the kids for fun
