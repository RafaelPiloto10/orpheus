I'm standing here on the ground  
The sky above won't fall down  
See no evil in all directions  
Resolution of happiness  
Yeah, things have been dark for too long  
I don't change for you  
Don't change a thing for me  
Yeah, don't change for you  
Don't change a thing for me  
I found a love I had lost  
It was gone for too long  
Hear no evil in all directions  
Execution of bitterness  
Message received loud and clear  
  
I'm standing here on the ground  
The sky above won't fall down  
See no evil in all directions  
Resolution of happiness  
Yeah, things have been dark for too long
