(graham russell)  
A long time ago, from the valley of the sun  
Came the holy power,  
When the gods were one  
Searching for a new home,  
Searching for this land  
Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen  
The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find  
(chorus)  
It is the roar of the wind,  
The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again  
And it's here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see  
  
(chorus)  
Our love, has brought us both together  
And it's our love that will go on forever  
There is no love that can become as one  
Before it's time  
  
(chorus)  
It is the trees in the earth,  
It is the rivers that run  
And through us this secret flows  
And now our destiny calls,  
You'll remember it all  
Our love for the heart of the rose
