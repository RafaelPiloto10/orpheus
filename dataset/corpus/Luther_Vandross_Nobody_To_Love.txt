Hey baby, what's your game?  
I ask you the question and the answer's still the same  
How can you go on day to day  
Without someone to care  
If I wanted to take that chance  
If I wanted to be your man  
You tell me that you feel lonely  
But you won't love nobody  
You tell me that you got a big heart  
But you won't love no one  
You lie and you moan and you bitch and you groan  
But you won't let nobody in to love  
What am I gonna do?  
Hey there baby, you're not shy  
We talk for hours and you seem just fine girl, but...  
Every time I bring up love  
You run for cover  
Suppose I told you something that's true  
Suppose I told you that I want you  
You tell me all the guys want you  
But you won't love nobody  
You keep your heart in seclusion  
And you won't love no one  
You game and you flirt and you talk a lot of dirt  
But you don't want nobody to love  
What are you gonna do?  
Heart feels empty, there's no one home  
Nights are longer when you're alone  
You tell me that you feel lonely  
But you won't love nobody  
You tell me that you got a big heart  
But you won't love no one  
You lie and you moan and you bitch and you groan  
But you won't let nobody in to love  
What am I gonna do?  
You tell me all the guys want you  
But you won't love nobody  
You keep your heart in seclusion  
And you won't love no one  
You game and you flirt and you talk a lot of dirt  
But you don't want nobody to love  
What are you gonna do?
