Six Days on the Road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.  
Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh headed down the eastern seaboard.  
I got my deisel wound up and she's runnin' like never before.  
My hometown's commin' in sight, if you think I'm happy your right.  
Six Days on the Road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.  
Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye.  
I could have a lot of women, but I'm not like some other guys.  
I could have one to hold me tight,  
But I could never make believe it's alright.  
Six Days on the Road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.  
Well the ICC is a checkin' on down the line.  
I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind.  
Nothin' bothers me tonight, I can dodge all the scales alright.  
Six Days on the Road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.  
Got a ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive.  
I'm takin' little white pills and my eyes are open wide.  
I just passed a Jimmy and White, I've been passin' everything in sight.  
Six Days on the Road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.  
Six Days on the Road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.
