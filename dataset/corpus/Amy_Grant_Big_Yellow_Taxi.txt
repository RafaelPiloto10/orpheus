They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging hot spot  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop  
  
They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum  
And then they charged all the people twenty-five bucks just to see 'em  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop  
  
Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT now  
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
I say, they paved paradise and they put up a parking lot  
  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop  
  
Late last night I heard the screen door slam  
And a big yellow taxi carried off my old man  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and they put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop  
  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop  
  
Oh, now, they paved paradise and they put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop  
Hey, steam rolled paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
