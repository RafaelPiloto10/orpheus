Black on white  
The background chess  
You're racing time  
When are you coming to town?  
  
Before the fall  
Before the flood  
After the sinking feeling and the final cut  
What are you going to do?  
We're all waiting for you  
Loud bound train is always late  
We stay lost inside our day  
Impound train, engine blows  
Approaches home, never slows  
  
Loud bound train is flashing red  
We stay lost inside our head  
Impound train, engine blows  
Approaches home, never slows  
  
What are you going to do?  
We're all waiting for you
