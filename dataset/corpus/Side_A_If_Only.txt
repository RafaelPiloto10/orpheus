If only you can hear me  
I'd let you know, how I miss you so  
Forgive me, I was blind to see  
I was a fool to ever let you go  
Believe in me, I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
That I have realized with no one  
Else I'd rather be  
But then I know that you have  
Found yourself somebody new  
Hope I could find you in another  
Place and time  
I've proven it's true  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Every night, I've been dreaming  
About the time when you were mine  
The memories, I will be keeping  
Oh I was so wrong to let our  
Chance go by  
So listen now, I never will deny  
  
[Chorus]  
That I have realized with no one  
Else I'd rather be  
But then I know that you have  
Found yourself somebody new  
Hope I could find you in another  
Place and time  
I've proven it's true  
I'm still in love with you  
  
If only, you can hear me  
I'd let you know, oh how I miss you so  
Believe in me, I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
That I have realized with no one  
Else I'd rather be  
But then I know that you have  
Found yourself somebody new  
Hope I could find you in another  
Place and time  
I've proven it's true  
I'm still in love with you [Repeat: x 2]
