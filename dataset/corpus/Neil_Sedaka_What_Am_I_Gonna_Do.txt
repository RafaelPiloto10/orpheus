What am I gonna do when the sun goes down  
And all the lights are low,  
What am I gonna do when I recall  
The love we used to know.  
I remember the happiness we knew,  
Darling can't we make up soon  
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.  
  
What am I gonna do on Wednesday night  
When I used to call you on the phone,  
What am I gonna say at the Record Hop  
When I show up alone.  
There all ask me what's become of you,  
Darling can't we make up soon  
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.  
  
At the movies or at the football game,  
Please believe me, nothing's gonna be the same.  
  
So what am I gonna do on Saturday night  
Whan everything goes wrong,  
How am I gonna feel when the radio  
Plays our favourite song.  
I'm so lonely just like Mr. Blue,  
Darling can't we make up soon  
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.
