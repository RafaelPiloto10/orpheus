You just don't get it  
What it is...well, you're not really sure  
You move like you're walking on this ice  
Talking like you're still insecure  
  
Time is a spiral, space is a curve  
I know you get dizzy, but try not to lose your nerve  
Life is a diamond you turn into dust  
Waiting for rescue, and I know you just  
Don't get it  
You just don't get it  
  
Neurotica...Exotica  
It's just Erotica...Hypnotic  
It's just Psychotic...Chaotic  
It's just Exotica...Neurotica  
  
You just don't get it  
Baby, don't you ask yourself why?  
If you don't like the answer, forget it  
You know I hate to see you cry  
  
Fortune is random... Fate shoots from the hip  
I know you get crazy, but try not to lose your grip  
Life is a diamond you turn into dust  
Looking for trust, and I know that you just  
Don't get it  
You just don't get it  
  
Snap!  
Hide in your shell, let the world go to hell  
It's like Russian roulette to you  
Snap!  
Sweat running cold, you can't face growing old  
It's a personal threat to you  
Snap!  
The world is a cage for your impotent rage  
But don't let it get to you  
Snap!
