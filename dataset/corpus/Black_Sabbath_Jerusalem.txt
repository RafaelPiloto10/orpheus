The highway's screamin', callin' out your name  
'Cause every road that you travel on  
There's a price to pay  
A thousands eyes are starin'  
But the blind still lead the blind  
  
[Chorus]  
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong and you're on the run  
Jerusalem?  
  
You say you walked through the valley  
You say you've seen the signs  
Echoes call you from a distant age  
Or is it in your mind?  
  
Then a thousands souls rise from the sea  
Holding up the sun  
And an angel cries beware your lies'  
It could be the end of it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody knows your name, every road leads to anger  
Will it always be the same, is there reason to return?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When an angel cries - Jerusalem  
Better watch your lies - Jerusalem  
When an angel cries - Jerusalem
