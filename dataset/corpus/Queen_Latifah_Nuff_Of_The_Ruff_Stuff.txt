Get funky with it  
I told you before: you burn when you play with fire  
So take off your hats, matter of fact hail the new Sire  
You're hungry as hell, so i'm cookin up the chowder  
It's laced with ingredients, gon' come on like gunpowder  
Pom-pom! lick a shot, then I got to order  
I'm runnin for the border for causin disorder  
Pom-pom! lick a shot, got on my defenses  
I'm runnin for the fences, of course I'm relentless  
The particular name of this queen is Latifah  
I've often been classified as a feminine teacher  
Collectively capture the heart of a nation  
Love my culture and show appreciation  
You're lookin for the black influ'?  
I do want too give it to you  
What are you mad?  
Give me some of what you had!  
You can huff-huff, puff-puff and bluff-bluff  
But I got nuff of the ruff stuff  
  
(Ruff and tuff)  
(And all that stuff)  
  
Now nuff of the ruff stuff, that's what I do, and I do it well  
The proof is in the puddin, I show and prove, not show and tell  
Talk tales, you get caught up in a crossfire  
Buckshot must be what you want and desire  
I write concepts, I don't be frontin or be buggin  
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin  
It's a love thang, the Queen doin her thang  
If I was a liquid, you would drink me like Tanq'  
You think I'm kickin things that I myself don't even heed?  
I rap not for the love of music, but for greed?  
"Latifah's booty, yo, she could never succeed"  
Shiiit...  
You watch me do it and boom it, the Flavor Unit will snap necks  
You a-fi listen a likkle, you fi go buy the cassette  
You're starvin, cause you ain't had enough  
That's right, nuff of the ruff stuff  
  
(Ruff and tuff)  
(And all that stuff)  
  
You talk about flavor...  
I got enough flavor to make a grapefruit sweet  
Get old ladies jumpin out of their seats  
Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun 'n rays  
I got flavor for days  
Now I'm the type that the fellas call a honey, and  
From me you know you get a worth for your money, and  
This is no meaningless attack, I gave you a chance  
Matter of fact, yo, I ordered them to 'dance  
For me', they tried to turn me 'inside out'  
They felt the 'wrath of my madness', I let them 'come into my house'  
It's called 'latifah's law', for the criminal to curse  
And all the gentlemen know its rule: 'ladies first'  
Not the typical female that tends to  
Fall vitim to the 'evil that men do'  
Small puff, I call your bluff  
I'm not mad, I just had enuff of the ruff stuff  
  
(Ruff and tuff)  
(And all that stuff)  
  
Everybody know Latifah love positivity  
Now positivity erase negativity  
Mi comin inna di dance (?)  
Me rollin with the Flavor Unit posse  
As a black woman mi want equality  
Equality, and di freedom to be me  
Mi have a mother Rita, only call her Mommy  
Likkle brother and sister, Angelo and Kelly  
A brother in them laws, but mi call him Winki  
Lost mi daddy and (?) family  
(?) black (?) black country  
Believe in one God, one tribe, one destiny  
Cease!
