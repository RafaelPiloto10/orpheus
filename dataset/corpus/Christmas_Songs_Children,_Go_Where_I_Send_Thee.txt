Children, go where I send thee,  
How will I send thee?  
I'm gonna send thee one by one  
One was the little bitty - baby  
Born, born, born in Bethlehem.  
  
Children, go where I send thee,  
How will I send thee?

Two for Paul and - Silas  
One for the little bitty - baby  
Born, born, born in Bethlehem.
