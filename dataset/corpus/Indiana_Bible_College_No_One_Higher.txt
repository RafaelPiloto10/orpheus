Our Father, Creator  
You hold our hearts together  
There is no one higher than you

Our great and mighty Savior  
There is no one higher than you

Astounded by your mercy and love  
Our hands are lifted high in surrender

Let my life forever praise the glory of your name  
There is no one higher than you

There is no one higher  
No one greater  
No one like our God  
There is none more able
