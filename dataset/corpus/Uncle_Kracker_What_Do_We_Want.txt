The birds outside my window  
Want to drive this stupid song into my head  
I wake up in this empty bed alone  
I guess it's somethin' that I said  
I tried to open up a door between us  
But I guess it was a wall instead  
And I try and I try  
And it tears me all up inside  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean?  
And what do we want from each other?  
Where do we go?  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other?  
  
Seven forty five  
I got a flight  
But you're still mad about last night  
Tear apart Pandora's box  
I try to open every lock in sight  
And I try and I try  
And it tears me all up inside  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean?  
And what do we want from each other?  
Where do we go?  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other?  
  
Another Sunday mornin' comin' down  
But I'm tryin' to see the bright side  
Another cold and unforgiving dawn  
I wish I was on your right side (right side)  
I wish that you could understand  
That words can fail the best intentions, ma'am  
And I try and I try  
And it tears me all up inside  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean?  
And what do we want from each other?  
Where do we go?  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other?  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean?  
And what do we want from each other?  
Where do we go?  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other?  
  
And them birds outside my window  
Wanna drive this stupid song into my head
