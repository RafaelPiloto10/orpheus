A million miles away  
Your signal in the distance  
To whom it may concern  
I think I lost my way  
Getting good at starting over  
Every time that I return  
  
Learning to walk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Where do I begin?  
Learning to talk again  
Can't you see I've waited long enough?  
Where do I begin?  
  
Do you remember the days?  
We built these paper mountains  
Then sat and watched them burn  
I think I found my place  
Can't you feel it growing stronger  
Little conquerors  
  
Learning to walk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Where do I begin?  
Learning to talk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Where do I begin?  
  
Now,  
For the very first time  
Don't you pay no mind  
Set me free, again  
To keep alive, a moment at a time  
That's still inside, a whisper to a riot  
The sacrifice, the knowing to survive  
The first decline, another state of mind  
I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign  
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die  
  
I never wanna die  
I never wanna die  
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die  
I'm dancing on my grave  
I'm running through the fire  
Forever, whenever  
I never wanna die  
I never wanna leave  
I'll never say goodbye  
Forever, whenever  
Forever, whenever  
  
Learning to walk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Where do I begin?  
Learning to talk again  
Can't you see I've waited long enough?  
Where do I begin?  
  
Learning to walk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Learning to talk again  
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
