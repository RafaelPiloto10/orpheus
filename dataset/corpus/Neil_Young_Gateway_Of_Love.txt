Try to find  
The perfect time  
To say something to you  
Filled with meaning  
Filled with truth  
  
If I could just live my life  
As easy as a song  
I'd wake up someday  
And the pain will all be gone  
Help me now I'm sinking fast,  
I gotta get along  
To the Gateway of Love  
Gateway Of Love  
  
Background noise  
On a changing sky  
You'll be making love to me  
I still feel you  
In my heart's eye  
  
But I'm just a dusty soul  
With nothing much to say  
Down here in the hay,  
Bound to stay that way  
I've got almost everything  
Except that little key  
To the Gateway of Love  
Gateway of Love  
  
Some will say  
There's a place on high  
Where angels rip their wings  
And babys learn to fly  
Some will say  
There's a place on high  
  
But I'd like to stay down here,  
Try to love someone  
Here in this life  
Where we watch the bouncing sun  
I'd just like to hold her hair  
And bring her back to me  
At the Gateway of Love  
Gateway of Love  
  
If I could just live my life  
As easy as a song  
I'd make up some game  
And the pain would all be gone  
Help me now I'm sinking fast,  
I gotta get along  
To the gateway of love  
Gateway of Love
