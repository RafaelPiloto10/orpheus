The pressure is mounting,  
I'm ready and countin'  
There's something I've got to be  
  
I'm fearless, I'm feeling  
Scared senseless, who needs this,  
Still something I've got to be  
  
There is no going back, this is what we know  
We come to entertain, asking you to follow  
Be born to self-destruct, here it comes again  
A desire to go down in flames  
  
My heart's racing, my legs shakin',  
Is more drama in the making  
I had a feeling this day would come  
  
So are we really good or just delirious,  
But if you stop us now it could get serious  
I'm sorry, mama, for what I've become  
  
There is no going back, this is what we know  
We come to entertain, asking you to follow  
Be born to self-destruct, here it comes again  
A desire to go down in flames  
  
You can turn it off, but it never stops,  
Madness or not, I risk everything I've got  
And if I've got to do it all over again  
I'd still believe in these friends  
And the mess they get me in  
  
There is no going back, this is what we know  
We come to entertain, asking you to follow  
Be born to self-destruct, here it comes again  
A desire to go down in flames  
  
Flames flames
