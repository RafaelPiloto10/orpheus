Here I am on my own again  
The days rush by  
The nights all seems so slow  
Guess I've let you down  
In my way, some how  
If you take me back  
I know we'll make it  
We'll make a promise  
And then break it  
  
On my honor I will try  
Always do the best I can  
Though the tears  
May fall like drops  
From my eyes honey  
On my honor I will try  
  
If you want me to be strong  
I'll give it everything I have  
You'll never have to worry  
'Cause we're not in a hurry  
On my honor I will try  
  
It's a lover's dance  
In a fiery chant  
Don't be afraid to face the music now  
It's a gambler's chance  
Not a lost romance  
And I'm not you  
And you're not me and  
Sometimes we feel differently  
  
On my honor I will try  
Always do the best I can  
Though the tears  
May fall like drops  
From my eyes honey  
On my honor I will try  
If you want me to be strong  
  
I'll give it everything I have  
You'll never have to worry  
'Cause we're not in a hurry  
On my honor I will try  
I will try  
I will try  
I'll try
