Well I don't need a caddy to make me happy  
Or a flat up on park avenue  
I don't need riches or treasures  
All those high priced pleasures darling  
All I need is you  
  
[Chorus]  
I know I don't need nothing you ain't got  
If you were coffee in the morning  
Well I'd drink that whole pot  
Cause you got everything all them others do not  
Darling I don't need nothing you ain't got  
  
Now Lord knows you ain't a saint  
Robert Redford you ain't  
But you got a heart of gold through and through  
And when it comes to loving  
All that kissing and hugging  
Ain't nobody else ever gonna do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well now who thought I'd be satisfied  
With just one guy by my side  
Oh Lordy, Lordy look at me  
But hon you're different from the rest  
I'm here to confess  
That love from you is all I'm ever gonna need  
  
Well I don't need a caddy to make me happy  
Or a flat up on park avenue  
I don't need riches or treasures  
All those high priced pleasures darling  
All I need is you  
  
[Chorus]
