I'm a-waitin' around, nothin' to do  
Lookin' at your picture, thinkin' of you  
Spinnin' like wheels, waitin' for a date  
Wonderin' how I'll make it till tonight at eight  
'Cause I can't wait, till I get you in my arms tonight  
I can't wait, till you tell me that my kiss is right  
I can't wait, 'cause I need your love so bad  
  
You're the livin' end, you're the golden rule  
I been a-diggin' your style, it's nothin' but cool  
I'm a twiddlin' my thumbs, blowin' my top  
Baby you're the only one can make me stop  
'Cause I can't wait, till I get you in my arms tonight  
I can't wait, till you tell me that my kiss is right  
I can't wait, 'cause I need your love so bad  
  
The clock's strikin' five, three hours to go  
I wonder if you're home, I'd sure like to know  
I'm nervous as a cat, lookin' for a mouse  
Maybe I'll see you if I walk by your house  
'Cause I can't wait, till I get you in my arms tonight  
I can't wait, till you tell me that my kiss is right  
I can't wait, 'cause I need your love so bad  
  
I'm a hurryin' baby, I'm a hurryin' baby  
I just gotta see ya, oh baby  
I love you baby, I wanna see more of you
