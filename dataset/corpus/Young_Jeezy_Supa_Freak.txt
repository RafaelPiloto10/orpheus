[Chorus]  
Last night it was Kush and Ciroc, I was super geeked  
Cash flowing, money flowing, yeah that's a super week  
Got 'em for the twenty-six five, now that's super-cheap  
Can't you niggas tell? I'm just looking for a super-freak  
Super-freak, super-freak, yeah you know I want a  
Super-freak, super-freak, yeah you know I need a  
Super-freak, super-freak, yeah you know I want a  
Super-freak, super-freak, yeah you know I need a  
  
What it do? What it is? What you working with?  
Every time you see me on the grind, stay on that working shit  
All I ever wanted a bad bitch and a Chanel bag  
All the street niggas want her cause they know she got Chanel swag  
Straight like that, yea I fuck with her the long way  
Been bragging to my partners, I been talking 'bout her all day  
Pull up in that Super-coupe, you know them diamonds glistening  
Too much money in the room, guess I hit her in the kitchen then  
Get her to myself man, I ain't hit that girl yet  
Now that I got her to myself man, you know I'm tryna get that girl wet  
Keep it one thousand with you, I really think I'm diggin' her  
Can't hear nothing but the money so she might just think I'm big enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rick James, super freak  
She got that wet-wet, now that's a super leak  
Tell your baby daddy that he's super weak  
Fucked your girl last night, it only took a week  
Two Chains charm cost a hundred stacks  
Ten-thousand with my shirt off that's a hundred carats  
OK I'm done with that, you can run with that, I'mma switch it up  
This bitch I'm with is thick as fuck, I'm rich as fuck  
Laying in the bed and I still got my semi tucked  
Going online like "when they gonna make that Bentley truck?"  
My bankroll make 'em pay attention  
The white girl like it when I whip it, whip it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She with me if I'm wrong or I'm right, yea she my type  
Baby girl go and get the bread she know what I like  
Meet her at my low-key apartment, never at the house  
Every time we got pulled over, never ran her mouth  
Fuck with real niggas, get money baby, off the chain  
Long as baby stay getting money, how can I complain?  
Favorite girl, guess she got the skills just to pay the bills  
Last nigga she was fuckin' with was worth a couple mil  
Even when she going for the low, says she's not a ho  
Yeah you know that thing is super-wet, call it sloppy Joe  
Said she like it when I whip it fast then I whip it slow  
Even though she got a lot of names, I just call her "blow"  
  
[Chorus]
