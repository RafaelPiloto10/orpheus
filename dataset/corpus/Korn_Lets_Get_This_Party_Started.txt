The man is crying  
Take me to a different place  
Which you don't often find  
I see a family walking, always thinking of being somewhere else in time  
So I fall face down in a rut I can't seem to get out of  
Please wake me  
Please give me some of it back  
The feelings I had  
Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you, it doesn't matter  
Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth, I can't handle!  
  
[Chorus]  
Lets get this party started!  
I'm sick of begging you!  
You make me feel insane  
Which I did to you!  
Lets get this party started!  
You make me feel insane!  
I want to be the one!  
To make my self sane!  
  
Time is ticking  
It makes me feel content  
With what I have inside  
Constant paranoia  
Surrounds me  
Everyone I see  
Is out to get me  
So I fall face down in a rut I can't seem to get out of  
Please wake me  
Please give me some of it back  
The feelings I had  
Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you  
It doesn't matter  
Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth  
I can't handle!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You make me feel insane  
You make me feel insane  
You make me feel insane  
You make me fell insane  
You make me fell insaaaaaannnnnneeee  
Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you  
It doesn't matter  
Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth  
I Can't handle  
  
[Chorus]
