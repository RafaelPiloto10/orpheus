Tommy found his daddy's gun  
And Joey had never seen one  
Real cowboy all dressed up  
As he held it in his hand  
Said, "You be good and I'll be bad"  
Then he pulled the trigger back  
Stopped little Tommy in his tracks  
And said, "Get up, man"  
People came from miles to say goodbye  
To the Wilson's youngest son  
His innocent life had just begun  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not supposed to go like that  
It's not intended to end that way  
Life is a journey constantly turning  
Down an unknown path  
But it's not supposed to go like that  
  
Jimmy had his daddy's car  
And the keys to Jenny's heart  
A fifth of whiskey on the floorboard  
Almost gone  
Havin' the time of their life  
Had only one thing on their mind  
Never saw the flashin' lights  
Or the train comin' on  
Now there's a wreath and two small crosses  
On the right side of the road  
Reminders of a love that won't grow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wonder if guardian angels cry  
When they see it all played out  
And as they stand with their hands tied  
Oh, do they cry out loud  
  
It's not suppose to go like that  
No, it's not supposed to go like that  
No, it's not supposed to go like that  
No, it's not supposed to go like that  
No, it's not supposed, it's not supposed to go like that  
No, no, no, it's not supposed to go like that
