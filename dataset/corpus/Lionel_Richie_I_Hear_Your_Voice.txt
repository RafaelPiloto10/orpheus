So many nights thought that I was doing fine  
Thought that time had chased your picture from my mind  
So many times thought my heart was finally strong  
Now I find this heart of mine was so wrong  
I, I thought I'd finally learned to get on with my life  
Then it all comes back  
I hear your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
The way it used to do  
I feel my heart  
(Fall)  
My heart  
(Fall)  
I try to keep you off my mind  
But every time I do, I hear your voice  
So many days I thought that I could love again  
But any fool in love would know that's all pretend  
You, you always seem to find your way  
Back in my dreams and I can't break free  
I hear your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
The way it used to do  
I feel my heart  
(Fall)  
My heart  
(Fall)  
I try to keep you off my mind  
But every time I do, I hear your voice  
You know I tried so many times  
Just to forget you  
I've tried to walk away from you  
Oh girl, it's just no use  
I hear your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
Calling me, calling me the way  
I feel my heart  
(Fall)  
Oh, my heart  
(Fall)  
I try to keep you off my mind  
But every time I do, I hear your voice  
I hear your voice  
I hear your voice
