It seems like it only happened yesterday  
Now that I think about it  
Tears cannot bring you joy  
But joy can bring you tears  
Even though I cry today  
I will not hide it  
It is for a different reason  
That is why I'll shout it out  
For the world to hear  
I say, "Hello, hello happiness  
Oh Jah, thank you  
For another day"  
I say  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
I say  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Another tear drop falls  
But I don't care  
I took a wrong turn in life before  
But I've paid my dues  
Objects in the rear view mirror  
They appear closer than they are  
If you don't talk the talk  
Don't walk the walk  
If you won't please, don't tease  
Another lesson learned  
I'm gonna shout it out again  
"Hello, hello happiness  
Oh God, thank you  
For another chance"  
There is no future in the past  
So shout it out  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
They say  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Hey Ringo come and dance with me  
Come on, come on  
Rasta  
Come and spend my shoes  
Hey Greek women  
Rasta
