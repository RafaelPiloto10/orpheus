Oh yeah  
Mm  
Still don't know what I was waiting for  
And my time was running wild  
A million dead-end streets and  
Every time I thought I'd got it made  
It seemed the taste was not so sweet  
So I turned myself to face me  
But I've never caught a glimpse  
Of how the others must see the faker  
I'm much too fast to take that test  
  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Don't want to be a richer man  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Just gonna have to be a different man  
Time may change me  
But I can't trace time  
  
I watch the ripples change their size  
But never leave the stream  
Of warm impermanence  
So the days float through my eyes  
But stil the days seem the same  
And these children that you spit on  
As they try to change their worlds  
Are immune to your consultations  
They're quite aware of what they're going through  
  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Wheres your shame  
Youve left us up to our necks in it  
Time may change me  
But you can't trace time  
  
Strange fascination, fascinating me  
Ah changes are taking the pace I'm going through  
  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Oh, look out you rock n rollers  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Pretty soon now you're gonna get a little older  
Time may change me  
But I can't trace time  
I said that time may change me  
But I can't trace time
