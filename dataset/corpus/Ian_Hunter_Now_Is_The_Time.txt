I can smile on a warm summer day  
I can laugh, I can listen to the children play  
But I'm going to miss the killer with the kiss  
He was a friend of mine  
Now is the time, now is the time  
It?s going to rain, hope it don't rain on you  
There's going to be a lot of pain before this thing is through  
If Jesus was alive, he'd be standing on the M5  
Holding up a neon sign screaming  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time, so many people can't see  
They think that love is blind but it ain't free  
There's a line, so many people have crossed and now  
Their love is lost, say, "Goodbye", my funny valentine  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time, now is the time  
I can run just as far as my eyes can see  
And I'm free, yeah, just as free as I want to be  
But I won't ever forget that crazy little planet  
He was a friend of mine  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time
