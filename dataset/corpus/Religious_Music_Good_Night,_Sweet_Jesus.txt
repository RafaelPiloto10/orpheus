Goodnight, Sweet Jesus,  
Goodnight, goodnight.  
  
Goodnight, Sweet Jesus,  
Guard us in sleep,  
Our souls and bodies,  
In Thy love keep.  
  
Waking or sleeping,  
Keep us in sight,  
Dear gentle Saviour,  
Goodnight, goodnight.  
  
Goodnight, Dear Jesus,  
Goodnight, goodnight.  
  
Goodnight Sweet Jesus,  
Pray that each day,  
Of our lives mortal,  
Thus pass away.  
  
Thy love o'er watching,  
Guiding our right,  
Dear gentle saviour,  
Goodnight, goodnight.  
  
Goodnight Dear Jesus,  
Goodnight, goodnight...
