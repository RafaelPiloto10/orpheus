Heaven is paved with broken glass,  
Since your hammer struck my heart,  
This world, a hell of trees and grass.  
All is wrong like north gone south,  
There's a bad taste in my mouth.  
  
Everything was stars,  
'Til you had a notion to leave,  
Beauty marks turned to scars,  
Bet you had a laugh up your sleeve.  
  
Congratulations love, love, love, love.  
You made a fool of me and physics.  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass,  
Since your hammer struck my heart,  
This world, a hell of trees and grass.  
All is wrong like north gone south,  
There's a bad taste in my mouth.  
  
Everything was gold,  
'Til you thought you were above me,  
Soldier turns to rogue,  
Pretty turns to pretty ugly.  
  
Congratulations love, love, love, love,  
You made a fool of me and physics.  
  
And I'm feeling cheated,  
And I'm feeling used,  
And what's even worse is,  
You just look amused.  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass,  
Since your hammer struck my heart,  
This world, a hell of trees and grass.  
Since your hammer struck my heart.  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass.
