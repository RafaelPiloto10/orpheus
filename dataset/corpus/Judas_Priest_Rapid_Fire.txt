Pounding the world like a battering ram  
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam  
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done  
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none  
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might  
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright  
Fast devastating and desolating the curse  
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth  
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination  
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed  
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage  
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free  
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled  
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war  
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding  
That withered and waned till the world seemed all drained fills the bay  
Pounding the world like a battering ram  
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam  
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done  
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none  
Second to none
