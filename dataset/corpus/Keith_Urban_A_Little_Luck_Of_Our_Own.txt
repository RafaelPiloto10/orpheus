The cards are stacking up against us  
These days our luck is running low  
It's hard to explain but a little bit of rain  
Seems to follow us wherever we go  
  
Black cat sittin' on a ladder  
Broken mirror on the wall  
We're not a bit superstitious  
No need to worry at all  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause when we can't roll a seven  
And our last lucky penny is gone  
This world can be tough  
But I know when our love is this strong  
We can make a little luck of our own, luck of our own  
  
The storm is only temporary  
But you and I are here to stay  
Baby can't you see true love is all we need  
So just throw that rabbit's foot away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh we can make it baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can make a little luck of our own  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh we can make it baby  
Make a little luck of our own
