Everybody needs a someone  
Waitin' to be there when things are a-lookin' down  
So if you feel a little lonely  
Go out, find your one and only  
Somewhere out there  
Someone will care for you and then...  
Never let her go  
Never let her go  
  
You may wonder how you know love  
When the moment comes that you've been a-dreamin' of  
Well true love takes a little longer  
Your heart beats a little stronger  
You'll know it's real  
Inside you'll feel you're home at last... Then  
Never let her go  
Never let her go  
  
So if you feel a little lonely  
Go out, find your one and only  
Open your heart  
Give love a start and watch it grow... And  
Never let her go  
Never let her go
