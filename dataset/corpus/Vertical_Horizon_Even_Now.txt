Even now  
After all these years  
I think about you with both joy and pain  
Even now  
I remember when you left  
I walked all night through the rain  
Broken and lost swearing I'd never love that way again  
  
Even then you were aiming much higher  
Somewhere higher  
Then you thought i could fly  
  
Even then you were looking for rainbows  
Something more  
Then the cloudless blue sky  
  
Now you tell me you were wrong  
You never should have left me for an empty dream  
And now you spill out your regrets  
A mighty river to a bitter stream  
Lying awake thinking about all that might have been  
I guess we're even now  
I guess we're even now  
  
Even now  
More often then I'd like  
I think of you and the place we used to share  
  
Even now  
I remember all the songs  
And the perfume in your hair  
I was carried away until you cut me down in mid air  
  
Even then  
There was something inside you  
Something bright  
That was burning so cold  
  
Even then  
There was something about you  
Something dark  
That I couldn't hold  
  
And now you tell me that your life  
Has never been the free flight you thought it would be  
And now you know it's way to late  
All we've got is history  
You know that when I lost you, you lost me  
I guess we're even now  
Oh  
I guess we're even now  
I think we're even now  
  
Even then  
You were looking for rainbows  
Even then  
In a perfect blue sky  
  
I guess we're even now  
I guess we're even now  
I think we're even now  
Could be we're even now  
I think we're even now  
I think we're even now  
I think we're even now  
  
All that summer  
In the moonlight  
You were dreaming  
I was believing  
  
All that summer  
(All that summer)  
In the moonlight  
(In the moonlight)  
You were dreaming  
(You were dreaming)  
I was believing
