We're the Velvet Underground and we have come to play  
It's been 28 years since we've been here to the day  
  
There's Maureen, she's on the drums, she's havin' lot of fun  
Let's hear it for Moe Tucker, beat those skins for everyone  
  
There is Sterling Morrison, he's playing the guitar  
He's a guitar hero, kicks their asses really far  
  
Now you got here John and me  
Now you got here John and me, we want no part of this  
That's because we think it is real pretentious shit
