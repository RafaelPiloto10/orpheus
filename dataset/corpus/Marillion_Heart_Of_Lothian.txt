Wide boys, wide boys, wide boys,  
Born with hearts of Lothian  
Wide boys, we were wide boys,  
Born with hearts of Lothian  
Wide boys, we were wide boys,  
These hearts of Lothian.  
  
It's six o'clock in the tower blocks  
Stalagmites of culture shock  
And the trippers of the light fantastic,  
Bow down, hoe-down  
Spray their pheromones on this perfume uniform.  
  
And anarchy smiles in the Royal Mile  
And they're waiting on the slyboys, flyboys, wideboys  
Rooting, tooting cowboys  
Lucky little ladies at the watering holes  
They'll score the Friday night goals.  
  
I was born with a heart of Lothian  
I was born with a heart of Lothian  
With a heart of Lothian  
  
I was born with a heart of Lothian,  
With a heart of Lothian.
