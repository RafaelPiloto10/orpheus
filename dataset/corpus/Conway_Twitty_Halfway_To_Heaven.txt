We're halfway to heaven  
Don't leave me, now  
  
The angels are singing  
Your lips are so near  
The bells are ringing  
And all 'cause you're hear  
Now we're halfway to heaven  
Darlin' stay, say you'll stay, with me.  
  
Your heavenly kisses  
Could take me there  
Oh, don't leave me stranded  
My heart's in midair  
Now we're halfway to heaven  
Darlin' stay, say you'll stay, with me.  
  
Oh, don't you know  
The closer you hold me  
The closer we'll be  
The gates of heaven  
Are now in sight  
If you really love me  
You'll be there tonight  
Oh, we're halfway to heaven  
Darlin' stay, say you'll stay, with me.  
  
Oh, don't you know  
The closer you hold me  
The closer we'll be  
The gates of heaven  
Are now in sight  
If you really love me  
You'll be there tonight  
Oh, we're halfway to heaven  
Darlin' stay, say you'll stay, with me
