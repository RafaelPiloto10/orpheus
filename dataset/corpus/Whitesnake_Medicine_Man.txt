You never leave her alone,  
I can see you never learn  
When you're playing with fire,  
You get your fingers burned  
There ain't no use in crying,  
Baby don't delay,  
You can call your doctor,  
I'll be there right away  
  
I'm the medicine man,  
Your doctor of love  
Medicine man,  
Doctor of love  
  
When there's a feeling inside,  
That just can't be denied,  
I will be your medicine man  
  
Now don't you ever worry,  
If you feel the fever rise,  
You'll never fool nobody,  
When there's fire in your eyes  
There ain't no use denying,  
When you need it deep inside  
You've got your witch doctor  
To keep you satisfied  
  
I'm the medicine man,  
Your doctor of love  
Medicine man,  
Doctor of love  
  
When there's a feeling inside,  
That just can't be denied,  
I will be your medicine man.  
  
You never leave her alone,  
I can see you never learn  
When you're playing with fire,  
You get your fingers burned  
There ain't no use in crying,  
Baby don't delay,  
You can call your doctor,  
I'll be there right away  
  
I'm the medicine man,  
Your doctor of love  
Medicine man,  
Doctor of love  
  
When there's a feeling inside,  
That just can't be denied,  
I will be your medicine man  
Your doctor of love  
I'm medicine man,  
Doctor of love
