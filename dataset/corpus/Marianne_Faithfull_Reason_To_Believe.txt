If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that its all true  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone like you makes it hard to live  
Without somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give  
Never thinking of myself  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find reason to believe
