I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons  
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break  
Some things unknown are best left alone foreverand if a vow is what it takes  
Haven't you paid for your mistakesafter the moment passes  
And the impulse disappearsyou can still hold back  
Because you don't crack very easilyit's a time-honored resolution  
Because the danger is always nearit's with you now  
But that ain't how it was supposed to be  
And it's hard to believe after all these years  
It still gives you pain and it still brings tearsand you feel like a fool  
'Cause in spite of the rulesyou've got a memorychorus
