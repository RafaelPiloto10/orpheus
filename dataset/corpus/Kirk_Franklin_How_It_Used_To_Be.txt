I ain't gonna lie  
I can't even count the days  
Or the many nights I tried living here alone  
A heart full of pride  
Couldn't see the enemy was me  
I was blind and thought my second chance was gone  
A ship without a sail  
Battered by the raging sea  
Taking any love I can to try and stop the rain  
While waiting to exhale I finally got on my knees  
I know it's been a long time  
Do you still remember my name?  
  
Can I go back in time?  
Can I have another try?  
But I can't change yesterday  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I  
Can't take another day without you  
Cause this heart don't beat the same without you  
I forgot who I was  
Got caught up in this world  
Jesus I apologize  
I should've lost my mind without you  
Not another sleepless night without you Jesus  
I'm sorry and I'm asking please  
Make us how we used to be  
  
I try and try to keep my mind on you  
But trouble keeps calling me  
Every time a wound heals  
Something else takes the healing away  
But even when I've gone too far  
You don't even call my name  
Mama said if you love let it go  
And if it comes back then it's back to stay  
You already knew I belong to only you  
I run to your arms and say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never knew a life so cold  
Thought that things could fulfill my soul  
Tried to find love on my own  
It was hard to admit I was wrong  
No money, no cars, no fame, no lies, no games my life is taken  
  
Now we've come to the break  
Tell me what you gone say (you gone say)  
I know (I know)  
I give my life right  
But you know  
You ain't promised tonight  
Babygirl  
Without you  
(I can't breathe)  
Without you  
(I can't exist)  
Without you  
(This world ain't got nothing for me  
I'm coming home)  
  
[Chorus 2x]
