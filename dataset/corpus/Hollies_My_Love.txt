Ooh my love, ooh ooh my love  
Please don t take my advances too lightly  
Don't be hasty, let the feelin' come straight from your heart  
You've been burned too many times before  
Accept my love I'm gonna give it to you  
Please don't forsake it and take it and make it my love  
I can see what you're thinkin' but I won't let you down  
Let your love show and don't think of the past  
Come tomorrow you'll be happy with the feeling you've found  
I'm no fool and I ain't clownin' around  
And if you should want to throw it all away,  
It'll be you who doesn't want to  
Want to make me stay  
Come on and do it my way  
Ooh my love, ooh ooh my love  
verse 4  
Please don't take my advances too lightly  
Let your love show and don't think of the past  
Accept my love, I'm gonna give it to  
Please don t forsake it and take it and make it  
Please don t forsake it and take it and make it my love  
Ooh my love, ooh ooh my love
