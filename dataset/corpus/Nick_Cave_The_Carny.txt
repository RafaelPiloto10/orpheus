And no-one saw the Carny go  
And the weeks flew by  
Until they moved on the show  
Leaving his caravan behind  
It was parked out on the south east ridge  
And as the company crossed the bridge  
With the first rain filling the bone-dry river bed  
It shone, just so, upon the edge  
Away, away we're sad to say  
  
Dog-boy, Atlas, Man-drake, the geeks, the hired hands  
There was not one among them that did not cast an eye behind  
In the hope that the Carny would return to his own kind  
  
The Carny left behind a horse so skin and bone that he'd named Sorrow  
And it was a shallow unmarked grave  
That that old nag was laid  
In the then parched meadow  
  
And it was the dwarves that were given the task of digging the ditch  
And laying the nag's carcass in the ground  
While boss Bellini, waved his smoking pistol 'round  
Saying ''The nag was dead meat''  
''We can't afford to carry dead weight''  
The whole company standing about  
Not making a sound  
And turning to the dwarves on the enclosured gate  
The boss says ''bury this lump of crow bait''  
  
And the rain came hammering down  
Everybody running for their wagons  
Tying all the canvas flaps down  
The mangy cats growling in their cages  
The bird-girl flapping and squawkening around  
The whole valley reeking of wet beast  
Wet beast and rotten, sodden hay  
Freak and brute creation all packed up and on their way  
  
The three dwarves peering through their wagon's hind  
Moses says to Noah ''We shoulda dugga deepa one''  
Their grissom faces like dying moons  
Still dirty from the digging done  
  
And Charlie the Atlas to the three said  
"I guess the Carny ain't gonna show"  
And they were silent for a spell  
Wishing they'd done a better job at burrying Sorrow  
  
And the company'd passed from the valley into higher ground  
The rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow and on the mound  
Until nothing was left, nothing left at all  
Except the body of Sorrow that rose in time  
To float upon the surface of the eaten soil  
  
And a murder of crows did circle 'round  
First one, then the others flapping blackly down  
  
And the Carny's van still sat upon the edge  
Tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge  
  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
  
And no-one saw the Carny go  
And no-one saw the Carny go  
And no-one saw the Carny go  
I say its funny how things go
