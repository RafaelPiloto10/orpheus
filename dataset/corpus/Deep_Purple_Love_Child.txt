You can walk through fire  
Make the north wind blow  
Squeeze 'n' tease me honey  
When you shake your body  
You move my soul  
Let me be your lover  
Won't you let me be your child  
Take me through your universe  
Ya'know that when you smile  
You drive me wild  
  
Love child  
Driving me wild  
Love child  
Always teasin' me  
  
You can ride your pony  
Day dream in fairy tales  
All I know is I need more  
When I see you dance the seven veils
