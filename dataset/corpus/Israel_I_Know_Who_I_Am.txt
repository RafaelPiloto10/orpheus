Chorus:  
I know who I am  
I know who I am  
I know who I am  
I am yours  
I am yours (2x)  
  
And you are mine  
Jesus you are mine  
You are mine  
Jesus you are mine  
  
I was running, and you found me  
I was blind, and you gave me sight  
You put a song of praise in me  
I was broken, and you healed me  
I was dying, and you gave me life  
Lord, You are my identity  
  
I know, I know...  
Chorus  
  
I am forgiven, I am your friend  
I am accepted, I know who I am  
I am secure, I'm confident  
That I am loved, I know who I am  
I am alive, I am set free  
I belong to you and you belong to me  
  
Chorus
