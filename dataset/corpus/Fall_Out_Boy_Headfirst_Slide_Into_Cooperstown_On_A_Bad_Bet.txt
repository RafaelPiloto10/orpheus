Mr. Sandman showing his beam  
When he walks into the room  
The walls lean in to listen  
Surf out brain waves  
Click back and forth like old headlights  
Sniffing model glue again  
  
Head like a steel trap  
Wish I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't,  
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I don't  
Just want to be a footnote in someone else's happiness.  
  
Does your husband know the way that  
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band?  
Does he know the way to worship I know  
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?  
  
I will never end up like him  
Behind my back, I already am.  
Keep a calendar, this way  
You will always know.  
  
The last time you came through,  
Oh darling, I know what you're going through.  
The last time you came through,  
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling  
  
Tempest in a teacup,  
Get unique.  
Peroxide Princess shine like shark teeth  
It's a sign, (it's a sign)  
It's a sign, (it's a sign)  
It's a sign, what if you peaked early.  
  
Does your husband know the way that  
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band?  
Does he know the way, does he know the way  
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?  
  
Does he, does he know the way to worship our love?  
Does your husband know the way  
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?  
  
But, I will never end up like him.  
Behind my back, I already am.  
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know.  
  
The last time you came through  
Oh darling, I know what you're going through.  
The last time you came through,  
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling  
  
Does your husband know?  
Does your husband know?  
Does your husband know?  
  
Does he know?  
Does he know?  
Does he know?  
  
But, I will never end up like him.  
Behind my back I already am.  
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know.  
  
Oh, the last time you came through,  
Oh darling, I know what you're going through.  
Oh, the last time you came through,  
Oh darling, I know what you're going through.
