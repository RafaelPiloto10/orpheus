The truth of life is the greatest gift  
But I don't think I can make it fit  
And who would guess it would come to this  
When I've tried everything  
  
And I should know but I can't explain  
The endless noise sounding in my brain  
Who would've thought that you could feel such pain  
When you've tried everything  
  
Yea, you're a loser now  
Yea, you're a loser now  
  
I should be cool  
But I'm burning hot  
I should be good  
But I fell apart  
Don't look at me now don't even start  
Cause I've tried everything  
  
Yea, you're a loser now  
Yea, you're a loser now
