There's some kinda love  
And there's some kinda hate  
The maggots in the eye of love  
Won't copulate  
  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
I said whoah whaoh oh, oh oh oh  
  
Hear the cats cry  
Liitle tortured babies in pain  
Cracked necks by sttled limbs  
They don't hesitate  
  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
Baby whoah oh oh oh oh  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
I said whoah, whoah, oh  
  
There's some kinda love  
And there is some kinda hate  
I'm gonna tell you all about it now  
The maggots in the eye of love won't copulate  
  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
Baby whoah oh oh oh oh  
Baby whoah oh oh oh oh  
I said whoah whoah oh, whoah oh
