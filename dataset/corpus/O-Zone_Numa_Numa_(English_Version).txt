(Phrase 1)  
Hello, Salute, It's me, Your Duke  
And I made something that's real to show you how I feel  
Hello, Hello, It's me, Picasso  
I will paint, My words of love, with your name on every wall.  
  
(Chorus)  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Nu ma, nu ma iei, nu ma, nu ma, nu ma iei  
Every word of love I use to say.  
Now I paint them everyday.  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Hey little lover stay, or all my colors fade away  
Every word of love I use to say.  
Now I paint them everyday.  
  
(Phrase 2)  
I sold, my strings, my song and dreams  
And I bought some paints to match the colors of my love.  
Hello, Helloo, It's me again, Picasso.  
I will spray, my words of love with your name on every wall.  
  
(Chorus)  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Nu ma, nu ma iei, nu ma, nu ma, nu ma iei  
Every word of love I use to say.  
Now I paint them everyday.  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Hey little lover stay, or all my colors fade away  
Every word of love I use to say.  
Now I paint them everyday.
