Enough is enough  
I'm nobody's fool  
I won't take no more  
Oh now I'm out the door  
I won't live by anyone's rules  
  
I feel it's safe to say I'm on my own  
It's just another lesson learned  
  
No love lost  
  
Life's like gettin' blood from a stone  
We all live by cards that were dealt  
I don't want no promises, don't want no lies  
Go sell them to sombody else  
  
I think it's safe to say, I'm on my own  
It's just another lesson learned  
  
No love lost  
  
(We've had enough, can't take no more)
