Sleepin' very soundly on a Saturday morning  
I was dreamin' I was Al Capone  
Rumor goin' round gotta clear outta town  
Smellin' like a dry fish bone  
  
Here come the law gonna break down the door  
Gonna tear me away once more  
Never never never want it any more  
Gotta get away from the stone cold law  
  
Crazy  
Stone cold crazy yeah  
Rainy afternoon got a killer typhoon  
Playin' on my saxaphone  
  
Anymore anymore cannot take it anymore  
Gotta get away from the stone cold law  
Crazy  
Stone cold crazy (lets go)  
  
Walkin' down the street  
Shootin' people that I meet  
Fully loaded Tommy gun  
Here come the deputy tryin' fuckin' gettin' me  
  
Gotta fuckin' get up and run  
They got the sirens loose  
I run right outta juice  
They're gonna put me in a cell if I can't go to hell  
  
Lemme go to hell  
Crazy  
Stone cold crazy yeah
