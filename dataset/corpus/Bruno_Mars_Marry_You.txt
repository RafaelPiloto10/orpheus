It's a beautiful night, we're looking for something dumb to do  
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you  
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice  
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you  
  
Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard  
We can go  
No one will know  
Oh c'mon girl  
  
Who cares if we're trashed  
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow  
Shots of Patron  
And it's on girl  
  
Don't say no no no no no  
Just say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
And we'll go go go go go  
If you're ready, like I'm ready  
  
'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're looking for something fun to do  
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you  
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice  
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you  
  
Oh  
I'll go get a ring  
Let the choir bell sing like ooh  
So what you wanna do  
Lets just run girl  
If we wake up and you want to break up  
That's cool  
No I won't blame you  
It was fun girl  
  
Don't say no no no no no  
Just say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
And we'll go go go go go  
If you're ready, like I'm ready  
  
'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're looking for something fun to do  
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you  
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice  
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you  
  
Just say I do  
Tell me right now baby  
Tell me right now baby, baby  
Just say I do  
Tell me right now baby  
Tell me right now baby, baby  
  
Oh  
It's a beautiful night, we're looking for something fun to do  
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you  
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice  
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you
