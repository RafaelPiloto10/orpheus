Lying alone  
Touching my skin  
I'm falling under  
A girl like me  
And I can't hold it in  
It makes me wonder  
  
Is this for real?  
It's not what it seems  
You're like an angel  
I'm running now  
My feet off the ground  
  
Chorus:  
Take me  
Touch me  
Won't you hold me close?  
  
And then we kiss  
Your love comes alive on my lips  
I feel the rush  
Coming over me, over me  
And when we touch  
This moment when everything's still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss  
  
The feel of your hand  
As it touches my hair  
It makes me tremble  
Don't wanna let go  
Of the feelings we share  
So baby, go slow  
  
Our hearts beating fast  
And my body cries  
I want it to last,  
This burning inside  
We're getting deeper  
  
Chorus:  
Take me  
Touch me  
Won't you hold me close?  
  
And then we kiss  
Your love comes alive on my lips  
I feel the rush  
Coming over me, over me  
And when we touch  
This moment when everything's still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss  
  
You're drifting  
The sun comes up  
You're fading  
You seem so far  
I don't know  
If I'm awake  
Open my eyes  
And then we  
We kiss...  
  
Chorus:  
Take me  
Touch me  
Won't you hold me close?  
  
And then we kiss  
Your love comes alive on my lips  
I feel the rush  
Coming over me, over me  
And when we touch  
This moment when everything's still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss  
  
And then we kiss (x2)  
And when we touch  
This moment when everything's still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss
