When some loud braggart tries to put me down  
And says his school is great  
I tell him right away  
"Now what's the matter buddy  
Ain't you heard of my school  
It's number one in the state"  
(Hey hey take it away, get that ball and fight)  
  
So be true to your school now  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Just like you would to your girl, guys  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Be true to your school now  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Let your colors fly  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Be true to your school  
(Rah rah rah rah rah)  
  
I got a letterman's sweater  
With the letter in front  
I got for football and track  
I'm proud to wear it now  
When I cruise around  
The other parts of the town  
I got my decal in back  
  
So be true to your school, now  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Just like you would to your girl, guys  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Be true to your school now  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Let your colors fly  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Be true to your school  
(Do it again, do it again, we like it, we like it)  
  
(Music bridge: On Wisconsin)  
  
(Rah, rah rah)  
Come Friday we'll be jacked up on the football game  
And I'll be ready to fight  
We're gonna smash 'em now  
My girl will be working on her pom-poms now  
And she'll be yelling tonight  
  
So be true to your school now  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Just like you would to your girl, guys  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Be true to your school now  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Let your colors fly  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
Be true to your school  
(Push 'em back, push 'em back, way back)  
  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)  
(Rah rah rah rah sis boom bah)
