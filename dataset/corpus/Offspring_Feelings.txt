Feelings  
Nothing more than feelings  
Trying to forget my  
Feelings of hate  
  
Imagine  
Beating on your face  
Trying to forget my  
Feelings of hate  
  
Feelings  
For all my life i'll feel it  
I wish I'd never met you  
You'll make me sick again  
  
Feelings, oh oh feelings  
Of hate on my mind  
  
Feelings  
Feelings like I never liked you  
Feelings like I want to kill you  
Live in my heart  
  
Feelings  
Feelings like I want to deck you  
Feelings like I've gotta get you  
Out of my life  
  
Feelings, oh oh feelings  
The hate's in my eyes  
  
Feelings, oh oh feelings  
You're not very nice
