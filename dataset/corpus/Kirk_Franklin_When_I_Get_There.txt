[Verse 1:]  
The sun will shine  
My heart shall sing  
One thought of you Jesus  
What joy it brings  
My soul can't wait  
To see your face  
And I'll bless your name jesus  
When we get there  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You'll wipe my tears  
You'll say well done  
You'll hold me close  
And tell me I've overcome  
And you will exchange  
Joy for my pain  
And I'll bless your name jesus  
When we get there  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on lets go  
We'll cry no more  
We're gonna be just like jesus  
When we get there  
Come on lets go  
It won't be long  
We're gonna be just like Jesus  
When we get there  
[Verse 1 repeat]  
  
[Verse 2 repeat]  
  
[Chorus repeat]  
  
No more feeling alone  
When all my fear is all gone  
You tell me it won't be long  
When you call my name  
We shall be changed come on!  
  
[Repeat chorus until song ends]
