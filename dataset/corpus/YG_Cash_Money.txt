[Verse 1: YG]  
I go hard, no limit on my card  
Digested in your solar system, you hangin' with some stars  
Dick all in her jaws, the stash worth pack at  
I mix tequila with the yak, I'm so abstract  
Aw shit, I just had a flash back  
Of me runnin' in your shit like "where the cash at?"  
But now I'm a lab rat  
I'm 'bout to focus on droppin' back to back  
All classes bitch, Cadillac  
  
[Hook: Krayzie Bone]  
It ain't no conversation  
If the main lane is no translate, money  
I'm talkin' cashin' money, money  
Them crispy hundred dollar bills  
It ain't no conversation  
If the main lane is no translate, money  
I'm talkin' cashin' money, money  
Them crispy hundred dollar bills  
  
[Verse 2: YG]  
She be on that bullshit, I be on that bullshit  
She jump man dick to dick, really on that bullshit  
She pass that pussy like she Scottie Pippen  
Shots for the team, cause the streets ain't safe like Dennis Rodman, nigga  
Had a mirage back to back, billy coupe, I'm coppin' that  
Rolex with red faces, they like where you cop that at?  
I told 'em how I fucked this bitches, I told 'em how she sucked my dick  
Now they wanna go and hit, man, these niggas copycat  
  
[Hook: Krayzie Bone]  
It ain't no conversation  
If the main lane is no translate, money  
I'm talkin' cashin' money, money  
Them crispy hundred dollar bills  
It ain't no conversation  
If the main lane is no translate, money  
I'm talkin' cashin' money, money  
Them crispy hundred dollar bills  
  
[Verse 3: YG]  
Took me a lotta shit, nigga go and cop me that  
This money is too real, got a fixed wheel, look sloppy at  
Bob the builter how I built this shit up and got my profit back  
A hundred bloods and fifty crips, tell me how you stoppin' that?  
Okay, okay, okay, okay, I get it  
The (?) I'm with it  
Then them niggas gonna say that ballin' out  
Hit the dealer, cop the Rolls Royce then I haul out  
  
[Hook: Krayzie Bone]  
It ain't no conversation  
If the main lane is no translate, money  
I'm talkin' cashin' money, money  
Them crispy hundred dollar bills  
It ain't no conversation  
If the main lane is no translate, money  
I'm talkin' cashin' money, money  
Them crispy hundred dollar bills
