[Intro]  
  
Punishment  
Consequences and repercussions  
Understand me  
Y'all know what I do  
  
[Hook]  
  
Sic them youngins on 'em  
Sic them youngins on 'em  
Sic them youngins on 'em  
Sic them youngins on 'em  
  
[Verse]  
  
Try to go ham on porky pig  
Fucked up boy, that's what you did  
Barbed wire, come through, straight your wig  
Y'all can't wrestle with the giant squid  
Try to get that to the iron fist  
Act all green, I'm hot as (???)  
Yarn in my hand, no pinky wearing  
Godfather, nigga, I pull the strings  
Do what I tell'em, buy what I sell'em  
Fuck their master, I'm Jim Hanson  
See my muppets, they like duckets  
Y'all feeling wrong when you see that bucket  
Hit that coma, true when I wanna  
Get another jar for the organ donor  
Ice Cube, nigga, I know better  
But you ain't gotta fight  
When you got that Cheddar  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse]  
  
Try to have beef with a fucking bull  
With no teeth I'm about to pull  
I'm that dentist about to finish  
All the spoils go to the winners  
Don't go mad cause my hands are clean  
I'm the king, never flee on the scene  
Wizard of Oz, if you need a plane  
Need a heart? Here's a start!  
Don't you worry if you need the courage  
Y'all motherfuckers know where you heard it  
Gangsta, gangsta, thank me now  
rap god nigga, please take a bow  
Can't take bullshit from a cow  
Don't ask who, I'mma fuck it out  
Thirsting howl will get you murdered  
Come to the boss if you need some work  
Come to the boss if you need some herd  
White collar boy, if you check my shit  
Get on my sun, get likely burn  
Gotta get my boys a pop of dirt  
Putting the rap game on the lurp  
Fuck with them and I will revert  
Back to the old days, back to the old ways  
Back to the Ak's fucking up doorways  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse]  
  
Try to play chicken with a fucking rooster  
Don't you worry, I'm not the shooter  
I M A fucking computer, with a whole army of boosters  
Nigga got out one piece, five piece, dime piece  
Cause my crimmies move like zombies  
Wha? Being heads to the 90'  
Don't act like you don't know where to find me  
Now, if you wanna get by me  
Look at all the grinding,  
Niggas all behind me  
You don't wanna go to war so you start to sing  
Can we be friends? Pussy ass niggas by extent  
Pray to the God, repent your sins,  
Ice Cube ain't like the rest of them  
  
[Hook]
