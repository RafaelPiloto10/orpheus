I have given everything  
I have questioned my own faith  
Disbelief and discontent  
I still remember why I wanted this  
For you  
  
When you stumble, when you fall  
They talk about it all  
When you fall apart  
Is it right for me to wait?  
When it might be too late  
And still I play the part  
  
I've pretended I'm alright  
I have told a thousand lies  
I've become what I despise  
I have changed a dozen times  
For you  
  
I've searched for something I can't find  
Accept the truth with peace of mind
