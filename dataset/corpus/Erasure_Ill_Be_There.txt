When you throw your arms around me  
You know that I'll be there  
'Till you were lost in the way you found me  
You know that I'll be there  
  
We all need someone just to keep hanging on  
It's enough to hold you here in my arms  
  
The light that we share gonna light up the sky  
I sit and I stare as if I don't care  
It's just the child in me won't go away  
I beg you to stay this is my prayer  
  
When I was young I was selfish darling I wanted my own way  
You were the shock to the system darling  
A chance for sudden sway  
We all make mistakes I'm all over the place  
But you know that I'll be there in the end  
  
The light that we share gonna light up the sky  
I sit and I stare and I don't know why  
It's just the child in me won't go away  
I beg you to stay this is my prayer  
  
The light that we share gonna light up the sky  
I sit and I stare and I don't know why  
It's just the child in me won't go away  
I beg you to stay this is my prayer  
  
The light that we share gonna light up the sky  
I sit and I stare and I don't know why  
It's just the child in me won't go away
