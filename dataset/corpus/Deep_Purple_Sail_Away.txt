If you're driftin' on an empty ocean  
With no wind to fill your sail,  
The future, your horizon,  
It's like searchin' for the Holy Grail.  
You feel there's no tomorrow,  
As you look into the water below.  
It's only your reflection,  
And you still ain't got no place to go.  
  
Time will show,  
When, I don't know.  
  
Sail away tomorrow,  
Sailin' far away.  
To find it steal or borrow.  
I'll be there someday yea-yea-yeah yea-ye-yeah.  
  
Oh woman I keep returnin,  
To sing the same old song.  
The story's been told, now I'm gettin' old.  
Tell me, where do I belong?  
Feel like I'm goin' to surrender.  
Hard times I've had enough.  
If I could find a place, to hide my face,  
I believe, I could get back up.  
  
Time will show,  
When, I don't know.  
  
Sail away tomorrow,  
Sailin' far away.  
To find it steal or borrow.  
But I'll be there someday yea-yea-yeah yea-yea-yea-yeah.  
  
Sail away tomorrow,  
Sailin' far away.  
To find it steal or borrow.  
But I'll be there someday yea-yea-yeah yea-yea-yea-yeah.  
  
Sail away tomorrow,  
Sailin' far away.  
To find it steal or borrow.  
But I'll be there someday yeah yeah yeah yea-yea-yeah yeah yeah yeah.
