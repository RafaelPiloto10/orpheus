Its a good thing that I can't sleep  
But I stay up all night a start to weep  
Like a willow tree cought in the rain  
I get that thought again and agian  
I cloose my eyes but sece to dream  
Like I lost time an empty steam  
Of thoughts runnin through my head  
And I wake and wish world was dead  
  
Turn turnin in to sunlight  
My skin don't burn as I fall fall in full flight  
I bloom with flower  
Soft the rain  
I'm stern like a tower  
Again and again  
I cry  
Cry with the wolves they stare  
And I think am I really there  
  
Walk down arond and around  
The people talking but theres no sound  
Climbing the mountain swimin the ocean  
Cry but see nothing is there some solotion  
  
Look down around  
Why can't I fall into picture  
No sound (no sound)  
Is there any victor  
  
Turn turnin in to sunlight  
My skin don't burn as I fall fall in full flight  
I bloom with flower  
Soft the rain  
I'm stern like a tower  
Again and again  
I cry  
Cry with the wolves they stare  
And I think am I really there  
  
I live a life of hurt and pain  
All wanta do is the chain  
Yeah yeah think about it  
People only stop to spit  
I'm out to steal I don't deserve  
Round the bend I drop the curve  
  
Turn turnin in to sunlight  
My skin don't burn as I fall fall in full flight  
I bloom with flower  
Soft the rain  
I'm stern like a tower  
Again and again  
I cry  
Cry with the wolves they stare  
And I think am I really there
