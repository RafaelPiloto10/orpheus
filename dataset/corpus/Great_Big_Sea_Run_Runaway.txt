I like black and white  
Dream in black in white  
You like black and white  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus]  
See chameleon lying there in the sun  
All things to everyone  
Run runaway  
  
If your in the swing  
Money ain't everything  
If your in the swing  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you got it sussed (to figure out)  
Don't beat around the bush  
If you got it sussed  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Oh now can't she wait?  
No no come on and wait  
Oh now can't she wait?  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I like black and white  
Dream in black in white  
You like black and white  
Run runaway  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
