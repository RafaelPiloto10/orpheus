Everybody needs inspiration  
Everybody needs a song  
A beautiful melody  
When the night's so long  
  
'Cause there is no guarantee  
That this life is easy  
  
Yeah, when my world is falling apart  
When there's no light to break up the dark  
That's when I, I  
I look at you  
  
When the waves  
Are flooding the shore and I can't  
Find my way home anymore  
That's when I, I  
I look at you  
  
When I look at you, I see forgiveness  
I see the truth  
You love me for who I am  
Like the stars hold the moon  
Right there where they belong  
And I know I'm not alone  
  
Yeah, when my world is falling apart  
When there's no light to break up the dark  
That's when I, I  
I look at you  
  
When the waves  
Are flooding the shore and I can't  
Find my way home anymore  
That's when I, I  
I look at you  
  
You appear just like a dream to me  
Just like Kaleidoscope colors that  
Cover me, all I need  
Every breath that I breathe  
Don't you know you're beautiful?  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
When the waves  
Are flooding the shore and I can't  
Find
