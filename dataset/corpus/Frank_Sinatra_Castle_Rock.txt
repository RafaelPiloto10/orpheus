I met her dancing to the Castle Rock,  
I held her tight and danced around the clock  
We rocked to romance to the Castle Rock,  
She kissed me and I kissed my heart goodbye.  
I felt like I was drifting 'cross the sky.  
We rocked to heaven to the Castle Rock.  
Music was soft and low, setting me all aglow,  
Holding it to my heart, how could I dream we'd part.  
Suddenly she was gone, leaving me dreaming on,  
Now everytime they play the Castle Rock,  
I'll take myself a walk around the block.  
Till she comes back to dance the Castle Rock.  
(Go get em, Harry [James], for old time's sake)  
I'm mad at dancing to the Castle Rock,  
I held her tight and danced around the clock.  
We rocked to romance to the Castle Rock.  
Now everytime they play the Castle Rock,  
I'll take myself a walk around the block,  
Till she comes back to dance the Castle Rock.  
Till she comes back to dance the Castle Rock.
