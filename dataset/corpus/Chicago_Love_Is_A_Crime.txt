Oooh Yeah  
Chicago  
  
If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me to life  
If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me  
Sentence me to life  
  
Some might say I'm guilty of love in the first degree  
If the jury wants to lock me up and throw away the key  
There's no greater punishment than what I face inside  
Won't tamper with the evidence cause there's nothing to hide  
  
He lives inside my heart  
I'm in the middle too  
You never had a clue  
Unless you felt it too  
  
If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me to life  
If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me  
Sentence me to life  
  
Swear tell the truth, just let me plead my case  
The thief who stole my heart from me I couldn't let escape  
He's my only alibi, but I won't drop a dime  
So how can I give up to you, my partner in crime  
  
He lives inside my heart  
I'm in the middle too  
You never had a clue  
Unless you felt it too  
  
If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me to life  
If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me  
Sentence me to life  
  
You can take away my freedom  
But you can't take my love from me  
I won't die a lonely prisoner  
'Cause my heart will set me free  
Oooh ooh yeah  
Whooh!  
Chicago  
  
I said  
If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me to life  
If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me  
Sentence me to life

If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right

I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me  
Sentence me to life  
  
I said love is a crime
