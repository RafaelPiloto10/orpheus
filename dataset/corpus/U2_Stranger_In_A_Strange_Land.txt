Stranger  
Stranger in a strange land  
He looked at me like I  
Was the one who should run  
We asked him to smile for a photograph  
Waited a while to see if we could  
Make him laugh  
  
A soldier asked for a cigarette  
His smiling face I can't forget  
He looked like you across the street  
But that's a long way here  
  
And I wish you were here  
And I wish you were here  
  
Stranger  
A stranger in a strange land  
He look at me like I  
Was the one who should run  
I watched as he watched us  
Get back on the bus  
I watched the way it was  
The way it was when he was with us  
  
And I really don't mind  
Sleeping on the floor  
But I couldn't sleep after what I saw  
I wrote this letter to tell you  
The way I feel  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
To see what I could see  
To hear  
And I wish you were here
