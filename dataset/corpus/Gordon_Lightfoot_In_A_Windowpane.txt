I looked into a windowpane  
Last evening in a city far away  
I was feelin' sad and blue  
I wondered then if I should really stay  
Wanting someone to be with me in the light of this uncertain time  
Waiting by the window for the man inside  
To please make up his mind  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw  
Never knowing never feeling anything  
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw  
I walked along the roadway to a fountain  
Where lovers come to meet  
A hobo walked up to me, I could tell  
He didn't have enough to eat  
He said, "good sir you look so kind  
And though the years have stripped me to the bone  
It seems I am the better man  
For in this place I've never walked alone  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw  
Never knowing never feeling anything  
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw  
"where will you be, my friendly, when your  
Telephone ain't givin' out no calls  
And when the seasons come to haunt you  
Will you still find springtime in the fall  
And when you're on your island  
Will you wave at every ship that passes by  
And will you feed a hungry man  
I thank you, sir,  
Now I'll just say goodbye"  
Don't you be one who passed through but never saw  
Never knowing never feeling anything  
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw  
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw
