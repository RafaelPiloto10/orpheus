Two a.m. with the lost and the lonely  
Walkin' past the kids, comin' back from the party  
Smiles on their faces, you remember so well how it was  
Nights in the back of that Buick that you got runnin'  
Your baby by your side, told the whole world you're comin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Work so hard to do what is right  
Believed in what you're doin',  
But so many fights  
Trusted too many, believed too much,  
Workin' your life to the bone  
  
There's a wolf at your door,  
He wants your money, wants your soul  
A wolf at your door, you give it all, he wants more  
There's a wolf at your door,  
He says he's playin' for keeps  
Breathin' down your neck, boy  
It's sure hard to sleep  
  
With a wolf at your door  
  
They'll take it away, when you're not lookin'  
Look you in the eyes, tell you how good they're doin'  
Smiles on their faces, are lies to keep you from knowin'  
You're not guilty, you are the victim,  
But you still pay for the crime  
Don't look for trouble, it'll always find you in time  
  
Work so hard to do what is right  
Believed in what you're doin',  
But so many fights  
Trusted too many, relieved too much,  
Workin' your life to the bone  
  
There's a wolf at your door,  
He says he's playin' for keeps  
Breathin' down your neck, boy  
It's sure hard to sleep  
  
With a wolf at your door  
  
It won't be broken, I'll fight 'til I drop,  
Blood burnin' hot in my veins  
  
But they won't be satisfied until they take everything  
  
[Chorus]
