If I had the world to give, I'd give it to you  
Long as you live, would you let it fall, or hold it all in your arms?  
  
If I had a song to sing, I'd sing it to you  
As long as you live, lullaby or maybe a plain serenade  
Wouldn't you laugh, dance, and cry or be afraid at the change you made  
  
I may not have the world to give to you  
But maybe I have a tune or two  
Only if you let me be your world  
Could I ever give this world to you  
  
But I will give what love I have to give,  
I will give what love I have to give,  
I will give what love I have to give, long as I live.  
  
If I had a star to give, I'd give it to you  
Long as you live, would you have the time  
To watch it shine, watch it shine  
Or ask for the moon and heaven too? I'd give it to you.  
  
Well maybe I've got no star to spare, or anything fine or even rare,  
Only if you let me be your world, could I ever give this world to you.  
Could I ever give this world to you.
