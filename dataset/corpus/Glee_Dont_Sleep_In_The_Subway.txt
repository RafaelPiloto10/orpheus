You wander around on your own little cloud  
When you don't see the why, or the where for.  
You walk out on me when we both disagree,  
'Cause to reason is not what you care for.  
  
I've heard it all a million time before.  
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door.  
  
Don't sleep in the subway, darling.  
Don't stand in the pouring rain.  
Don't sleep in the subway, darling.  
The night is lonely. Forget your foolish pride.  
Nothing's wrong. Now you're beside me again.  
  
You try to be smart, then you take it apart,  
'Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated.  
You don't realize that it's all compromise,  
And the problems are so overrated.  
  
Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show.  
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go.  
  
Don't sleep in the subway, darling.  
Don't stand in the pouring rain.  
Don't sleep in the subway, darling.  
The night is lonely. Forget your foolish pride.  
Nothing's wrong. Now you're beside me again.
