The night was black, rain falling down  
Look for my baby, she's nowhere around  
Traced her footsteps down to the shore  
Afraid she's gone for evermore  
  
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say  
I took your baby from you away  
I heard a voice cryin' in deep  
Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep  
  
Why did we quarrel, why did we fight  
Why did I leave her alone tonight  
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea  
That's why my baby has gone from me  
  
I looked at the sea  
  
Ran in the water, heart full of fear  
There in the breakers I saw her near  
Reached for my darling, held her to me  
Stole her away from the angry sea  
  
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say  
You took your baby from me away  
My heart cried out, she's mine to keep  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep  
  
Endless sleep  
Endless sleep  
Endless sleep
