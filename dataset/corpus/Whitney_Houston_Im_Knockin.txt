Oh yeah, alright  
Hah yeah yeah, listen up  
Who's to say it's easy  
Sometimes life's not fair  
I've heard some say  
Just knock the door will open  
And when it does  
You'll find love standing there  
And if it's true I'm knockin'  
Come open up the door  
My heart's been right here waiting  
For someone to adore  
Well if it's true, I'm knockin'  
Come open up the door  
My heart's been right here waiting  
For someone to adore  
Say if it's true  
In sight we have two choices  
And it's told me to do or die  
And every word he speaks makes me certain  
Beyond the door's life's reason why  
And if it's true I'm knockin'  
Come open up the door  
My heart's been right here waiting  
For someone to adore  
Well if it's true, I'm knockin'  
Come open up the door  
My heart's been right here waiting  
For someone to adore  
Knock and the door will open  
The door will open  
Look and you will find it  
Look and you will find it  
For certain it's true  
For me and for you  
When love comes and knocks  
Here's the right thing to do  
And if it's true I'm knockin'  
Come open up the door  
My heart's been right here waiting  
For someone to adore  
Well if it's true, I'm knockin'  
Come open up the door  
My heart's been right here waiting  
For someone to adore  
C'mon, knock on the door  
It will open, I'm knockin'  
Please open up the door yeah  
My heart's been right here waiting  
Someone to adore  
Ask me what I want  
Peace of mind  
Ask me what I don't  
Waste of (my) time  
Tell me that it's true  
And you will find me knockin'
