How the fuck are we supposed to know  
When I'm a monster, the way  
You refuse to die?  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
If we're in love or if in we're pain  
  
I'm a tightrope walker  
Can't find my circus  
And I'm damaged beyond repair  
Now you're just a coffin of a girl I knew  
And I'm buried in you  
  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
Or "so"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No  
  
Sometimes I dream I'm an exterminating angel  
A traveling executioner from heaven  
Sent to give you the prettiest death I know  
Call the grave and make our reservations  
  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No,  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No,  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No  
  
Are we in love or are we in pain? [Repeat: x5]  
  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
When I'm a monster, the way  
You refuse to die?  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
If we're in love or if in we're pain  
Why is my wound a front door to you?  
Am I my own shadow?  
Why is my wound a front door to you?  
Am I my own shadow?
