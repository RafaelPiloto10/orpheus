On!  
Sailing on!  
To our fate!  
To India  
  
Above the seas with the wind we are flying high  
Our wings are sails and our trail means no second try  
Golden and silver the future will be  
When we're at the aim  
  
Forward we sail into the unknown  
We have no fear we're sacred  
We're going to where no one has gone before  
Keep on till we have reached the sunset  
There will be no withdrawal  
We're heading for the the treasures of India  
  
Stars show the way through the night, we don't look behind  
Water supplies getting low but we're strong in mind  
Power and Glory will come to us all  
When we're at the aim  
  
Once there was a vision to find  
A new land behind the horizon  
When we chased the sun  
A whole new world was born  
  
My dearest wishes they will be fulfilled  
When we have reached our destination  
  
Forward we sail into the unknown  
We have no fear we're sacred  
We're going to where no one has gone before  
Keep on till we have reached the sunset  
There will be no withdrawal  
We're heading for the the treasures of India
