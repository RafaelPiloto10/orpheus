As I looked across  
To where she, where she was before  
I didn't have long  
To wait around here anymore  
We went to a place  
That I hadn't seen before  
She worked me over  
Then she went anyway  
  
She looked to me like a good girl  
I played along like a fool  
I paid along just to find out  
She's no exception to the rule  
  
As I carried on  
Looking here and there  
I couldn't believe  
She worked it out  
And it worked on me  
I guessed early on  
But it didn't click inside  
She knew my weakness  
And she knew my name  
  
She looked to me like a good girl  
I played along like a fool  
I paid along just to find out  
She's no exception to the rule  
  
As I carried on
