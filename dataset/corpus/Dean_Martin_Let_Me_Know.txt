Let me know the moment he lets you go  
I'll be here to welcome you to my arms yes  
I know how you feel  
After a love affair is through  
That's how I felt when you left me  
I still love you  
Let me know the moment you're feeling blue  
Come to me and I'll never let you go no  
I'll always love you can't you see dear  
Let me know the moment that you need me  
I'll always love you can't you see dear  
Let me know the moment that you need me
