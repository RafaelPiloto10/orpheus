Let it out, let it out  
Feel the empty Space  
So insecure find the words and let it out  
  
Staring down, staring down  
Nothing comes to mind  
Find the place turn the water into wine  
  
But I feel I'm getting nowhere  
And I'll never see the end  
  
So I wither  
And render myself helpless  
I give in and everything is clear  
I breakdown  
And let the story guide me  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it on  
Let the feelings flow  
Close your eyes  
See the ones you used to know  
  
Open up open up  
Don't struggle to relate  
Lure it out  
Help the memory escape  
Still transparentness consumes me  
And I feel like giving up  
  
So I wither  
And render myself helpless  
I give in  
And everything is clear  
I breakdown  
And let the story guide me  
  
I wither  
And give myself away  
  
Light reflections on the cage  
The worlds want to create  
  
I drown in hesitation  
My words come crashing down  
And all my best creations  
Burning to the ground  
  
The thought of staring over  
Leaves me paralyzed  
Tear it out again  
Another one that got away  
  
I wither  
And render myself helpless  
I give in  
And everything is clear  
  
I wither  
And render myself helpless  
I give in  
And everything is clear  
I breakdown  
And let the story guide me  
I wither  
And give myself away  
  
Light reflections on the cage  
The worlds want to create  
The worlds which you create  
  
Let it out, let it out... !
