Back when I was a child  
Before life removed all the innocence  
My father would lift me high  
And dance with my mother and me  
And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep  
Then up the stairs he would carry me  
And I knew for sure I was loved  
If I could get another chance  
Another walk, another dance with him  
I'd play a song that would never ever end  
How I'd love, love, love  
To dance with my father again  
  
When I and my mother will disagree  
To get my way I would run from her to him  
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah  
Then finally make me do just what my mama says  
Later that night when I was asleep  
He left a dollar under my sheet  
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me  
If I could steal one final glance  
One final step, one final dance with him  
I'd play a song that will never, never end  
'Cause I'd love, I'd love to dance with my father again  
  
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door  
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him  
I pray for her even more than me  
I pray for her even more than me  
  
I know I'm praying for much too much  
But could you send back the only man she loved  
I know you don't do it usually  
But dear Lord, she's dying  
To dance with my father again  
Every night I fall asleep  
And this is all I ever dream
