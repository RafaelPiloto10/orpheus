If you think you're gonna fail  
Well, you're probably gonna fail  
So tell me, what was all the dreaming for?  
And if you think you're gonna lose  
Well, you're probably gonna lose  
So what's the point in trying anymore?  
  
What you're looking for, you'll find  
It happens every time  
  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
When your fragile heart is breaking  
And your confidence is shaken  
I can tell you that we've all been there before  
The first step is hard to take  
But it's a choice you gotta make  
When life is waiting through that open door  
  
I wish that you could see  
The way you look to me  
  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
Oh, not so long ago,  
You pulled me through  
  
So I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Even if the rain comes down  
And your sky is falling  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You know we can work this out  
If we just keep talking  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
'Cause is you think you have a chance  
Then you really have a chance  
I hope you know that I believe in you
