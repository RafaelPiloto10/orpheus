Hey Mister, we want you to know  
We think, you've taken this about as far as it can go  
It's about to blow  
You got nowhere to run  
Why don't you sit back and watch the show?  
You used to drop your little darlin' off at Sunday school  
Family values while you're gettin' some behind the pool  
She's nobody's fool  
So don't be actin' surprised when your daughter  
Wants it bad as you  
You jack up the rent, you call in a loan  
Clear your intent is to screw 'em out of all they own  
Throw the dog a bone  
Well, you'll be cryin' for mercy when  
Your karma calls you on the phone  
Well you know, times are hard  
Ain't it a bitch but  
The Japanese are makin' you twitch  
All your investments are turnin' sour  
It kinda spoils your happy hour  
Look around, we're comin' your way  
It's a wonder to us how you ever thought  
You'd get away, what you say  
Well, the way it looks from here  
You won't have to wait  
The way it looks from here  
No need to hesitate  
Have a party celebrate  
The way it looks from here  
You won't have to wait for hell to pay
