The visions dancing in my mind  
The early dawn, the shades of time  
Twilight crawling through my windowpane  
  
Am I awake or do I dream,  
The strangest pictures I have seen  
Night is day and twilight's gone away  
  
With your head held high and your scarlet lies  
You came down to me from the open skies  
It's either real or it's a dream  
There's nothing that is in between  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind  
Away from me.  
  
Across the night I saw your face  
You disappeared without a trace  
You brought me here, but can you take me back  
  
Inside the image of your light  
That now is day and once was night  
You lead me here and then you go away.  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind  
Away from me.  
  
You brought me here, but can you take me back again?  
  
With your head held high and your scarlet lies  
You came down to me from the open skies  
It's either real or it's a dream  
There's nothing that is in between  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind  
Away from me.  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, Twilight, Twilight, Twilight.
