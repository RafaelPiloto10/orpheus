Don't you wonder  
Is anyone that strong  
It takes me under  
Believing what I'm seeing  
I get so tired of watching friends go down  
The hungry tiger for all who never began  
  
Biting bullets  
Biting the clouds  
Biting bullets  
Biting the clouds  
  
I saw the show  
Shaking all the babies  
Should I believe the parade of clever lies  
Shadow of light in the shadow of death  
There is no difference to all who never began  
  
There was a time  
There was a way to live  
And it's no secret  
That it won't come back again  
  
I lose myself like anybody else  
But I'm not so strong to make it in the end  
I need some answers when the day comes crashing down  
'Cause it's all over when there's no one to be found
