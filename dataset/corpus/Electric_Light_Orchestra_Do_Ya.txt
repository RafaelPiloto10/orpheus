In this life I've seen everything I can see woman  
I've seen lovers flying through the air  
Hand in hand  
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun  
And I've seen kings and queens from the heavenly skies above  
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides  
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching  
Picture slides  
But I never seen nothin' like you.  
  
[Chorus]  
Do ya want my love  
Do ya want my face  
Do ya want my mind  
Do ya want my love  
  
Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune  
As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light  
Of the moon  
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums  
And I heard the police playin' with their guns  
But I never heard nothing like you  
In the country where the sky touches down  
On the field she lay her down to rest  
In the morning sun  
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to  
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't  
Give a damn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I think you know what I'm trying to say  
Woman  
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day  
I've seen enough of the world to know  
That i've got to get it all to get it all to grow  
  
[Chorus]
