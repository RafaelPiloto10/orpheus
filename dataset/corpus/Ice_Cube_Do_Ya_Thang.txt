Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'm in that hot thing, gutter lane  
Dippin' with that wood grain  
So fuckin' hood, man  
They call me The Boogeyman  
In that slow lane, what is your whole name?  
I forgot this ho's name, I'll call her Louise Lane  
Up on that boulevard, 24's rotate  
Ice Cube comin' through, gotta make the hoes wait  
Roll at my own pace, nigga, don't hate!  
Fuck all you fat-fuckers leanin' up against my paint!  
Ice Cube, I steal a little paint (Movie star!)  
Fuck you! Pour a nigga a lil' drink!  
That's how it's goin' down out here in California  
Listen to my people, when a nigga hit the corner!  
  
[Chorus]  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Mirror, mirror, on the wall  
Who is the fliest one of all?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now pull in the parking lot  
Nigga, find a parking spot  
Fired up, everyone want to spark a lot  
Puff-puff-pass, we out on Ave.  
Lookin' for a big fat ass to harass!  
Is it you? Uh-huh, I see you lookin'  
When we roll by, pussy still cookin'  
Freaks get taken when they lookin' for stars  
If you don't like my face, bitch, look at my car!  
Keep it simple, I told you once befo'  
It really don't matter how I get you to the mo'  
It really don't matter how I get you in my low  
Just hop in, let's go  
And let your friends know!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Do ya thang, girl!  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
We the dogs gettin' chased by the pussycat  
West Coast, baby, with so much gravy  
You should call The Navy, ever since the 80's  
I've been doin' good, they been doin' bad  
When I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that  
But never chase it, my game is so basic  
As soon as I lace it - baby, wanna taste it?  
Just face it, put me to the test  
Ice Cube would ace it, I'm built for success  
Fuck a Rock-star! We wanna party like a Rap Star  
In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)  
You make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's  
And we get lap-dance from nuns  
They put away they crucifix  
And they say, "Ice Cube, boy, you the shit!"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mirror, mirror, on the wall  
Who is the flyest one of all?  
  
[Bridge]  
I see you lookin' at me  
We don't give a fuck!  
What you lookin' at?  
We gonna give it up!  
  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Mirror, mirror, on the wall  
Who is the fliest one of all?  
  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!  
Do ya thang, man  
Fuck what they lookin' at!
