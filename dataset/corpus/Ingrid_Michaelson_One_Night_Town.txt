Living up while we're going down  
Everything that we don't know now  
Goodbyes and golden nights sing "woh oh oh"  
You're the one with pioneer heart  
I'm the one in the brand new start  
I feel it coming like oh oh oh  
  
Headlights  
Heartbreak  
We'll go  
Our own way  
We got one life today  
  
So when the lights go out, and the sun burns down  
We're gonna climb this night singing "woh oh oh"  
  
It's the last time now  
In this one night town  
To sing "woh oh oh oh oh oh"  
We're singing "woh oh oh oh oh oh"  
  
Light up our memory  
Never knew what they meant to me  
Hold on like you gotta let me go  
You're the one with the cavalier smile  
I'm the one with the open mile  
Bright lights with no regrets  
Sing "woh oh oh"  
  
Headlights  
Heartbreak  
We'll go  
Our own way  
We got one life today  
  
So when the lights go out, and the sun burns down  
We're gonna climb this night singing "woh oh oh"  
  
It's the last time now  
In this one night town  
To sing "oh oh oh oh oh oh"  
We're singing "oh oh oh oh oh oh"  
  
We've been running since the day we're born  
Day we're born  
We've been running since the day we're born  
  
We keep running till the day we're gone  
Day we're gone  
We keep running till the day we're gone  
  
So when the lights go out, and the sun burns down  
We're gonna climb this night singing "oh oh oh"  
  
It's the last time now  
In this one night town  
To sing "woh oh oh"  
  
So when the lights go out, and the sun burns down  
We're gonna climb this night singing "oh oh oh"  
  
It's the last time now  
In this one night town  
To sing "woh oh oh oh oh oh"  
We're singing "woh oh oh oh oh oh"  
"Woh oh oh oh oh oh"  
We're singing "woh oh oh oh oh oh"  
"Woh oh oh oh oh oh"
