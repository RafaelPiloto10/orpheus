(JESY)  
I could have all the money,  
All the fancy treasures in the world  
Twenty-five acres just to hold my diamonds and my pearls  
  
(JADE)  
But all of that's a fantasy  
Nothing like I wanna be  
Baby you and me, that's real, yeah  
Something like a masterpiece  
We'd be up in galleries  
You and I, that's real  
  
(ALL)  
If I had everything it wouldn't mean a thing  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
No matter what they say, can't take my love away  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
  
Baby even when we're miles apart  
You'll always stay inside my heart  
Let me tell you no one else will do  
'Cause baby nothing feels like you  
  
(LEIGH-ANNE)  
Boys will be boys, I got plenty knocking at my door  
But none of them compare baby you're the one I'm waiting for  
  
(PERRIE)  
'Cause I'm living in a fantasy  
Everytime you're here with me  
Kiss me if it's real  
Baby you and me for keeps  
You bring out the best in me  
Now you know that's real  
  
(ALL)  
If I had everything it wouldn't mean a thing  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
No matter what they say, can't take my love away  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
  
Baby even when we're miles apart  
You'll always stay inside my heart  
Let me tell you no one else will do  
'Cause baby nothing feels like you  
  
No, nothing like ya  
No, nothing like  
No, nothing like ya  
No, nothing like  
  
(LEIGH-ANNE)  
If I had everything it wouldn't mean a thing  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
  
(PERRIE)  
No matter what they, can't take my love away  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you!  
  
(ALL)  
Baby even when we're miles apart  
You'll always stay inside my heart  
Let me tell you no one else will do  
'Cause baby nothing feels like you  
  
And when you're gone, we could be miles apart  
I'll feel the way I did from the start  
I told you nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
Baby when everything's said and done  
I hope you know that you're the only one  
I told you nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
  
No nothing like you  
No nothing like you  
No nothing like
