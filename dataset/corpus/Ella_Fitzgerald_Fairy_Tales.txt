Fairy tales were the tales that you told me  
Fairy tales made me happy as I could be  
For I had been dreaming of some day  
But now somehow it's all faded away  
  
Fairy tales, like a child I believed you  
Fairy tales, none of them came true  
But sometimes in my dreams, I can hear you, it seems  
Telling me the same old fairy tales  
  
Oh, fairy tales were the tales that you told me  
Fairy tales made me happy as I could be  
For I had been dreaming of some day  
But now somehow it's all faded away  
  
Fairy tales, like a child I believed you  
Fairy tales, none of them came true  
But sometimes in my dreams, I can hear you, it seems  
Telling me the same old fairy tales  
  
Fairy tales, like a child I believed you  
Fairy tales, none of them came true  
But sometimes in my dreams, I can hear you, it seems  
Telling me  
(Why must you keep on telling me)  
The same old fairy tales
