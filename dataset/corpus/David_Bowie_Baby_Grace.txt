Test, testing, testing  
This, hmmm, Grace is my name  
And and I was... Hm...  
It was that phot... A fading photograph of  
A patch, a patchwork quilt.  
And they've put me on these  
Ramona put me on these interest drugs  
So I'm thinking bit too fast like a brain hatch  
And ah they won't let me see anybody  
If I want to sometimes and I ask  
I can hear some pop... Popular musics  
And aftershocks. (Sneeze)  
See I've been watching a television of um... In the homelands  
That's the new homelands and um that's all I can remember  
And now they just want me to be quiet  
And I think something is going to be horrid.
