You surely must know magic, girl, 'cause you changed my life.  
It was dull and ordinary  
But you made it sunny and bright.  
I was blessed the day I found you, gonna build my whole world around you,  
You're ev'rything good, girl and you're all that matters to me.  
  
When my way was dark and troubles were near,  
Your love provided the light so I couldn't see, girl  
Just knowing your love was near when times were bad  
Kept the world from closing in on me, girl.  
I was blessed the day I found you, gonna build my whole world around you,  
You're ev'rything good, girl and you're all that matters to me.  
  
You're part of ev'ry thought I think each day,  
Your name is in ev'ry phrase my lips say,  
Ev'ry dream I dream is about you.  
Honey I couldn't live without you,  
Baby! baby! baby, you're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
Yes, you are, you're my ev'rything,  
Girl, you're the girl I sing about in ev'ry love song I sing.  
You're my winter, baby, my summer, my fall, my spring.  
I was blessed the day I found you, gonna build my whole world around you,  
You're ev'rything good, girl and you're all that matters to me.  
  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything.  
  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything.
