Father on father please hear me  
My song is a cry of desperation  
All of the words I hear  
Have lost their meaning  
  
My life is a well of confusion  
Drowned out by the sound of the lost and lonely  
Only the voice inside  
Speaks your name to me  
  
If they only knew the things that I know  
If they only could see the things that I see  
  
My brothers at opposite tables  
Like fire and water against each other  
Only a fool can't see  
The obvious ending  
  
Are we as ashes to wildwood  
Is life just a fire that can only consume us  
Is there no vision of love  
To bind us together  
  
If they only knew the things that I know  
If they only could see the things that I see
