From the moment of our inception  
Yeah we were destined  
To be together (together)  
Two planets on a cosmic collision  
Yeah were on a mission  
To last forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
And so gravity took hold  
And it's never letting me go  
Like a tractor beam  
To infinity lost sense of all control  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Uh, oh, eh, eh  
Eh, uh, oh  
  
I see your name spelled out in the sky  
Lighting the night like a constellation  
Now let's be touch (go for a ride)  
The speed of light a supernova sensation  
  
[Chorus:]  
And so gravity took hold  
And it's never letting me go  
Like a tractor beam  
To infinity lost sense of all control  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Uh, oh, eh, eh, eh, uh, oh  
It's written in the stars, oh  
Eh, eh, yeah, yeah, eh, eh  
  
I need your forcefields  
I gotta keep it real  
To keep me from burning (burning oh)  
Don't want to drift away  
Floating in outer space  
There's no way I'm returning oh  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Oh, oh, eh, eh, eh, It's written in the stars  
Oh, oh, eh, eh, it's written in the stars
