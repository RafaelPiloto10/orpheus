Thank you for coming home  
I'm sorry that the chairs are all worn  
I left them here I could have sworn  
These are my salad days  
Slowly being eaten away  
Just another play for today  
Oh, but I'm proud of you, but I'm proud of you  
Nothing left to make me feel small  
Luck has left me standing so tall  
  
[Chorus:]  
Gold (gold)  
Always believe in your soul  
You've got the power to know  
You're indestructible  
Always believe in, that you are  
Gold (gold)  
Glad that you're bound to return  
There's something I could have learned  
You're indestructible, always believe in...  
  
After the rush has gone  
I hope you find a little more time  
Remember we were partners in crime  
It's only two years ago  
The man with the suit and the face  
You knew that he was there on the case  
Now he's in love with you, he's in love with you  
And love is like a high prison wall  
But you could leave me standing so tall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And love is like a high prison wall  
But you could leave me standing so tall  
  
Gold (gold)  
Always believe in your soul  
You've got the power to know  
You're indestructible  
Always believe in, 'cause you are  
Gold (gold)  
I'm glad that you're bound to return  
Something I could have learned  
You're indestructible, always believe in...  
(Gold)
