Don't worry 'bout me  
I'll get along  
Forget about me  
Just be happy my love  
  
Let's say that our little show is over  
And so the story ends  
Why not call it a day the sensible way  
And still be friends  
  
Look out for yourself  
That should be the rule  
Give your heart and your love  
To whomever you love  
Darlin' don't be a fool  
  
Why do we cling to this old faded thing  
That used to be  
So if you can forget  
Then you don't worry 'bout me
