Riding on the City of New Orleans  
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail  
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders  
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail  
All along a southbound odyssey  
The train pulls out of Kankakee  
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields  
Passin' towns that have no name  
Freight yards full of old black men  
The graveyards of the rusted automobiles  
  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying, don't you know me I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done  
  
Dealing cards with the old men in the club car  
Penny a point, ain't no one keeping score  
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle  
Feel the wheels a rumbling beneath the floor  
  
And the sons of Pullman porters  
And the sons of engineers  
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel  
And mothers with their babes asleep  
Rockin' to the gentle beat  
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying don't you know me, I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done  
  
Night time on the City of New Orleans  
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee  
Halfway home and we'll be there by morning  
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea  
But all the towns and people seem  
To fade into a bad dream  
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news  
The conductor sings his song again  
The passengers will please refrain  
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues  
  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying don't you know me, I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
