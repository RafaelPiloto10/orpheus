Hanging out behind the club on the weekends  
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends  
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour  
I remember that it's the first time that I saw her there  
  
She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing  
I'm kinda nervous, cause I think all her friends hate me  
She's the one, she'll always be there  
She took my hand and I made it I swear  
  
Chorus  
  
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know  
She's so cool, better sneak me through her window  
Everything's better when she's around  
I Can't wait until her parents go out of town  
Cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
  
When we said we were gonna move to Las Vegas  
I remember the look her mother gave us  
17 without a purpose or direction  
We don't owe anyone a fuckin explanation  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Black and white picture of her on my wall  
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting  
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance  
Because she kept me waiting  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
With the girl at the rock show  
With the girl at the rock show  
(I'll never forget tonight)  
With the girl at the punk show......
