It's in every one of us to be wise  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in every one of us by and by  
It's in every one of us  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in every one of us by and by  
It's in every one of us  
I just remembered  
It's like I've been sleeping for years  
I'm not awake as I can be  
But my seeing's better  
I can see through the tears  
I've been realizing that  
I bought this ticket  
And watching only half of the show  
But there's scenery and lights  
And a cast of thousands  
Who all know what I know  
And it's good that it's so  
It's in every one of us to be wise  
Find your heart  
And open up both your eyes  
We can all know every thing  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in every one of us by and by  
It's in every one of us by and by
