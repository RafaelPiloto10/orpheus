[Verse 1]  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
No matter how hard I'm trying to  
I want you all to myself  
You're metaphorical gin and juice  
So come on, give me a taste  
Of what it's like to be next to you  
Won't let one drop go to waste  
You're metaphorical gin and juice  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Cause all of the doubts and the outbursts  
Keep making love to each other  
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying  
All of the doubts and the outbursts  
Keep making love to each other  
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
My hands to myself  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
My hands to myself  
  
[Verse 2]  
My doctor say you're no good  
But people say what they wanna say  
And you should know if I could  
I'd breathe you in every single day  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All of the doubts and the outbursts  
Keep making love to each other  
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying  
All of the doubts and the outbursts  
Keep making love to each other  
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
My hands to myself  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
My hands to myself  
  
[Bridge]  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
I want it all, no, nothing else  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
Give me your all and nothing else  
Oh, I, I want it all  
I want it all, I want it all  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
I mean I could, but why would I want to?  
  
[Chorus]  
My hands to myself  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
My hands to myself  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
I want it all, no, nothing else  
Can't keep my hands to myself  
Give me your all and nothing else  
Can't keep my hands to myself
