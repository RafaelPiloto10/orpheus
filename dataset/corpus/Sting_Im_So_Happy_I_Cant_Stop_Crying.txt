Seven weeks have passed now since she left me  
And she shows her face to ask me how I am.  
She says the kids are fine and that they miss me,  
Maybe I could come and babysit sometime.  
  
She says "Are you ok? I was worried about you,  
Can you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy."  
I said "I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm so happy, I'm laughing through my tears."  
  
I saw a friend of mine. He said "I was worried about you,  
I heard she had another man. I wondered how you felt about it"  
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears.  
  
Saw my lawyer, Mr. Good News  
He got me joint custody and legal separation.  
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears.  
  
I can't stop crying, I'm laughing through my tears,  
I'm laughing through my tears.  
  
I took a walk along last night, I looked up at the stars,  
To try and find an answer in my life.  
I chose a star for me, I chose a star for him,  
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife.  
Something made me smile, something seemed to ease the pain,  
Something 'bout the universe and how it's all connected.  
  
The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream.  
We try to do the best within the given time.  
A kid should be with his mother, everybody knows that,  
What can a father do but babysit sometimes.  
  
I saw that friend of mine, he said "you look different somehow."  
I said "everybody's got to leave the darkness sometimes."  
I said, "I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears."  
  
"I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears."
