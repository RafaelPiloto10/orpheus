I used to visit all the very gay places  
Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails  
  
The girls I knew had sad and sullen grey faces  
With distingue traces  
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away  
By too many through the day twelve o'clock tales  
  
Then you came along with your siren song  
To tempt me to madness  
I thought for a while that your poignant smile  
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me  
Ah yes I was wrong, again I was wrong  
  
Life is lonely again  
And only last year everything seemed so sure  
Now life is awful again  
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore  
A week in Paris could ease the bite of it  
All I care is to smile in spite of it  
  
I'll forget you, I will  
While yet you are still burning inside my brain  
Romance is mush, stifling those who strive  
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive  
And there I'll be  
While I rot  
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely too
