Oh come all you children  
Don't grab that scabby hand  
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and Tell  
It belongs to the candyman  
Don't whore your little bodies  
To the worms of paradise  
Like Everest, it's fatal  
Its peaks are cold as ice  
They're riding on the subways  
They're riding on the streets  
They'll ride you down to the gutters  
They'll ride you off your feet  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Yeah, piss on the icon monsters  
Whose guitars bequeath you pain  
They'll face you down to their level  
With their addictions and their fast lanes  
Corrupt with shaky visions  
And crack and Coke and alcohol  
They're just a bunch of assholes  
With buttholes for their brains  
You can't keep on riding  
The pain you know so well  
They'll ride you down to the gutter  
And they'll ride you down to Hell  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
And you the master dealer  
May death be on your brow  
May razors slash your mainline  
I'm calling you out right now  
May all your vilest nightmares  
Consume your shrunken head  
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia  
Dance upon your stinking bed  
Don't look at me you fuckhead  
This nation's turning blue  
Its stink it fouls the highways  
Its filth, it sticks like glue  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
They'll bury you in velvet  
And place you underground  
The hatred of yourself  
And the sufferings that conspire  
To take your little body  
And throw it to the fools  
Only your mind can take you out of this  
Only your mind or death  
I'm riding on the subway  
The subway down to Hell  
I've finished with this journey  
Now, I seem to know it well  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City
