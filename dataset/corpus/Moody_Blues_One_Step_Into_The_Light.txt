One step into the light  
One step away from night  
It's the hardest step you're gonna take  
The ship to take you there  
Is waiting at the head  
Of the stairs that lead up through your opening mind  
  
Above the dark despair  
Shines a light that we can share  
Close your eyes and look up in between your brows  
Then slowly breathing in  
Feel the life force streaming in  
Hold it there, then send it back to him  
  
All the old things are returning  
Cosmic circles ever turning  
All the truth we've been yearning for  
Life is our saviour, saviour, saviour, save your soul  
  
The river of living breath  
Is flowing through the sun  
He was there before the earth began  
The world will drag on you  
Use his love to pull you through  
Find the mission of your life and start to be  
  
All the old things are returning  
Cosmic circles ever turning  
All the truth we've been yearning for  
Life is our saviour, saviour, saviour, save your soul  
  
There's one thing I can do  
Play my mellotron for you  
Try to blow away your city blues  
Your dreams are not unfound  
Get your feet back on the ground  
The truth will set us free, we cannot lose  
We cannot love, we just have to choose
