You're the kind of friend who always bends when I'm broken  
Like remember when  
You took my heart and put it back together again  
I've been wasting time with clueless guys  
But now it's over  
Let me tell you why, I'm through  
I've meet someone new  
Who's just like you  
But you're it  
You're the ultimate  
It's automatic  
I'm sure of it  
No lie  
So don't even try  
To tell me that you're not the guy  
'Cause I've been waiting all my life  
For someone just like you  
But you're it  
You're the ultimate, you  
You're the kind of guy who's hands and mind  
Send shivers up and down my spine  
You took my heart and put it back together again  
You're the kind of guy that blows my mind  
But now it's my turn  
You've been right in front of me  
Everything I need  
Why didn't I see  
You're it  
You're the ultimate  
It's automatic  
I'm sure of it  
No lie  
So don't even try  
To tell me that you're not the guy  
'Cause I've been waiting all my life  
For someone just like you  
But you're it  
You're the ultimate, you  
You're it  
You're the ultimate  
It's automatic  
I'm sure of it  
No lie  
So don't even try  
To tell me that you're not the guy  
You're it  
You're the ultimate  
It's automatic  
I'm sure of it  
No lie  
So don't even try  
To tell me that you're not the guy  
'Cause I've been waiting all my life  
For someone just like you  
But you're it  
You're the ultimate, you  
You're it  
You're the ultimate, you
