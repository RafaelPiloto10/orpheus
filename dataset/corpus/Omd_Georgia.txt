Well  
Here we are again  
Too  
Too good to be friends  
  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
Well  
Look at what we've done  
Three  
Threee rolled into one  
  
Together, together, together  
  
So!  
How can this be true  
We  
We thought that we knew you  
  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
We will watch the morning star  
Rising home over georgia  
Dancing in the ruins of the western world  
Blindfolds on and we don't care
