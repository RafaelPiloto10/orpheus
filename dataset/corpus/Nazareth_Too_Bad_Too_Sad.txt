Once I had a girl  
She called me on the phone  
Said come on over honey  
You know I'm all alone  
But when I got to her place  
What I saw stopped me dead  
She was standin' with a shotgun  
Pointed at my head  
My My too bad too sad  
My My too good to last  
So I'm cuttin' out fast  
  
Once I had a friend  
We had a lot of laughs  
He was all a friend could be  
Knowin' him was just a gas  
One night I got home  
he gave me one surprise  
He was standin' in a womans dress  
Lashes on his eyes  
My my too bad too sad  
My my too good to last  
So I'm cuttin' out Fast  
My, my, my  
My, My, My  
Had a pretty wife  
She was all I could need  
Gave me what I wanted  
Never had to plead  
One day a man called  
And he put me wise  
she's doin' the same thing  
With ten other guys  
My my too bad too sad  
My my too good to last  
So I'm cuttin' out fast  
My my too bad too sad  
My my too good to last  
So I'm cuttin' out fast  
My, my, my  
My, my, my
