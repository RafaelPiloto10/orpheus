She does not lazy dance  
Her hands on me  
She does not talk, no pretty talk  
She pleasures silently  
But with her, I am summer  
I warm easy to her heart  
She fill me full, she fill me full  
She make me complete  
  
Skin to skin  
Skin to skin  
No cold wind blow on me  
No cold wind blow on me  
  
Skin to skin  
Skin to skin  
The light, it shine on me  
The light it shine on me  
  
He is a secret soldier  
With pieces inside broke  
He hides in his own darkness  
His fire has no smoke  
And, when my body songs begin  
When he holds me tight  
He chases all my shadows  
And I burn so bright  
  
Skin to skin  
Skin to skin  
No cold wind blow on me  
No cold wind blow on me  
  
Skin to skin  
Skin to skin  
The light, it shine on me  
The light, it shine one me  
  
Winter inside of me  
Ice to fight the storm  
She cannot see  
What I hide in me  
I can't be strong  
Beside her warm  
  
Skin to skin (She's too close)  
Skin to skin (much too close)  
No cold wind blow on me (she's got a hold on me)  
No cold wind blow on me (she's got a hold on me)  
  
Skin to skin (She touches soft)  
Skin to skin (ah, much too soft)  
The light, it shines on me (her fire is burning me)  
The light, it shines on me (her fire is burning me)  
  
Skin to skin (she's too close)  
Skin to skin (ah,much too close)  
No cold wind blow on me (she's got a hold on me)  
No cold wind blow on me (she's got a hold on me)  
Skin to skin (she touches soft)  
Skin to skin (ah, much too soft)  
The light, it shines on me (her fire is burning on me)  
The light, it shines on me (her fire is burning on me)
