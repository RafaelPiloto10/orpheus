Billy ran around with the rare old crew  
And he knew an arsenal from Tottenham blue  
We'd be a darn sight better of if we knew  
Where Billy's bones are resting now  
Billy saw a copper and he hit him in the knee  
And he took him down from six foot to five foot three  
Then he hit him fair and square in the do-re-mi  
That copper won't be having any family  
  
Hey Billy son where are you now  
Don't you know that we need you now  
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow  
Where are Billy's bones resting now  
  
Billy went away with the peace-keeping force  
Cause he liked a bloody good fight of course  
Went away in an old khaki van to the banks of the river Jordan  
Billy saw the Arabs and he had 'em on the run  
When he got 'em in the range of his sub-machine gun  
Then he had the Israelis in his sights, went a ra-ta-ta  
And they ran like Shiites  
  
Hey Billy son where are you now  
Don't you know that we need you now  
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow  
Where are Billy's bones resting now  
  
One night Billy had a rare old time,  
Laughing and singing on the Lebanon line  
Came back to camp not looking too pretty  
Never even got to see the holy city  
Now Billy's out there in the desert sun  
And his mother cries when the morning comes  
And there's mothers crying all over this world  
For their poor dead darling boys and girls  
  
Hey Billy son where are you now  
Don't you know that we need you now  
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow  
Where are Billy's bones resting now  
  
Have a Billy holiday  
Born on a Monday  
Married on a Tuesday  
Drunk on a Wednesday  
Got plugged on a Thursday  
Sick on a Friday  
Died on a Saturday  
Buried on a Sunday
