For criminal acts and violence on the stage  
For being a brat, refusing to act your age  
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged  
You can go to Hell  
  
For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly  
For making us doubt our parents authority  
For choosing to be a living obscenity  
You can go to Hell  
  
You're something that never should have happened  
You even make your Grandma sick  
  
You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane  
You'd gift wrap a leper and mail him to your Aunt Jane  
You'd even force feed a diabetic a candy cane  
You can go to Hell  
  
You're something that never should have happened  
You even make your Grandma sick  
  
For criminal acts and violence on the stage  
For being a brat, refusing to act your age  
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged  
You can go to Hell
