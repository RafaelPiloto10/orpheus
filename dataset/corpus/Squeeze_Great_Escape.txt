Sitting there at home, he arrived home late  
With no more blood cells to inebriate  
He lunged at her there, she fell from the couch  
He grabbed her body as he pulled her down  
She was screaming no, kicking out at him  
But he weighed a ton, she could never win  
He fell down on her like a sack of snakes  
Tears fell from her face as she cried and cried  
When there's hope, when there's fear  
What is there to say that he might hear  
You turn him down with no mistake  
Now you're leaving, the great escape  
  
She ran from the room out of their back door  
Leaving him to sleep on the front room floor  
And she walked that night to the town hall square  
She knew it was through and she didn't care  
She stood up to him, he looked down on her  
He shot the message and the messenger  
When he woke he was sick with all the shame  
Tears fell from his face as she cried and cried  
  
She arrived back home, he was on his knees  
Begging with his heart please come back to me
