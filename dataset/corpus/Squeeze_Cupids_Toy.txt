He stalks the club with cupid's toy  
Foremost in his mind  
Jacks his body into shape  
And leaves the rest behind  
He has a pea for a brain  
A spud for a heart  
A scar on his cheek  
And a rubber duck in his bath  
This boy doesn't give love  
This boy doesn't get love  
  
He stalks the club with eagle eyes  
Springing on his heels  
Likes to throw a hand of dice  
Then hang them in his wheels  
He has a crease in his jeans  
A frown on his face  
The scent of a man  
Who thinks he has taste  
  
She smiles as he buys her a drink  
Standing at the end of the bar  
He feels helpless when she looks in his eyes  
Suddenly there's love in his heart  
  
He stalks the club with such a smile  
Forever on the move  
He takes pride in looking smart  
And knowing when to groove  
He has a heart on a chain  
His picture inside  
A ring in one ear  
Dark glasses at night
