Lindy strolls around  
  
Down main streets  
Down side streets  
Makin' his way through town he picks up pennies  
Saves 'em for a rainy day  
With callous feet he makes his way to see the sun sink in the bay  
  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
Around and around and around  
He plays piano at the church when nobody's watchin'  
Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see Him talkin'  
To himself, laughin' to himself  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
  
Lindy's seen it all  
Storms and hurricanes  
Some say he's insane  
No one knows his last name  
But I believe  
He's the salt of the Earth  
Just look past his dirty shirt and you will see just what he's worth  
  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
Around and around and around  
He plays piano at the church when nobody's watchin'  
Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see  
Him talkin' to himself, laughin' to himself  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
Around and around and around  
  
Ooh  
  
He plays piano at the church when nobody's watchin'  
Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see  
Him talkin' to himself, laughin' to himself  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
Around and around and around  
  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
  
Ooh
