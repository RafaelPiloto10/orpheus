[Chorus:]  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
Take a look at your fellow man  
And tell me what can I do today  
'Cause everybody needs a helping out  
If that ain't what it's all about  
  
Tell me what  
What can I do  
What can I do today  
We've all seen trouble from time to time  
There is a mountain ahead  
I've got no strength to climb, hey  
If you're feeling that you're strong  
Reach out to me  
I hope this journey won't take long  
But won't you please  
Have mercy  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
What can I do today  
I'm talking 'bout the soul all alone  
Needing the daily bread  
Someplace to lay his head, yeah, hey  
And I'm talking about the neighbor on your street  
Won't you look him in the eye  
Take time to speak  
That's mercy, yeah, 'cause...  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Love one another  
Sister and brother  
Love is the only way, hey  
  
(Repeat Chorus Twice)  
  
What can I do today  
Everybody needs a helpin', helpin'  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
Everybody needs a helpin', helpin'  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
Everybody needs it, oh, everybody needs it  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
Oh, everybody needs it, oh, yeah, oh, everybody needs it  
Oh, yeah, everybody needs a helping hand  
Everybody needs it, oh, everybody needs it  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
Everybody needs it
