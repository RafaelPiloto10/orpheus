From the dark cafes of Paris  
To the streets of Amsterdam  
From the homes of old Vienna  
To the shores of Uncle Sam  
Wherever freedom's hope is true  
Each heart cries out to you:  
  
Don't give up, Tommy Atkins,  
Be a stout fella,  
Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!  
Keep a stiff upper lip  
When you're in doubt, fella,  
Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!  
  
Oh the sun's sure to smile  
On your tight little isle,  
So hang on to your wits  
And you'll turn the blitz on Fritz,  
There's a whole world behind you  
Shoutin' "stout fella!"  
Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!
