On the water down in New Orleans  
My baby's the pearl of the quarter  
She's a charmer like you never seen  
Singing voulez vous  
Where the sailor spend his hard-earned pay  
Red beans and rice for a quarter  
You can see her almost any day  
singing voulez vous  
  
[Chorus]  
And if you hear from my Louise  
Won't you tell her I love her so  
Please make it clear  
When her day is done  
She got a place to go  
  
I walked alone down the miracle mile  
I met my baby by the shine of the martyr  
She stole my heart with her Cajun smile  
Singing voulez vous  
She loved the million dollar words I say  
She loved the candy and the flowers that I bought her  
She said she loved me and was on her way  
Singing voulez vous  
  
[Chorus]
