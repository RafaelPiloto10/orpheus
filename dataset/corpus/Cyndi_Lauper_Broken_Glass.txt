Ever since I could understand  
My mother said to me  
"don't you ever let a man hit you,  
Don't you grow up like me"  
So I swore I'd never be like her  
Or my grandmother too  
Ever if it meant I'd be alone  
Ever if it meant I'd be alone.  
  
'Cause she looked  
'Cause she looked like broken glass  
When she fell to the ground  
I heard the sound of thunder  
Trailing off  
When she started coming 'round  
But she couldn't make him stop  
And she wouldn't let it go  
So everytime she got back up  
Like broken glass went tumblin' down  
Tumblin' down  
  
First time that I saw your face  
You looked so lost and kind  
Should have recognized that  
Troubled look  
From the road I left behind  
But I thought that I could comfort you  
Or was it you could comfort me,  
Never saw your anger 'till you blew  
Never saw your anger 'till you blew  
  
And I feel  
Oh I'd feel like broken glass  
When I fell to the ground  
I heard the sound of thunder  
Trailing off  
When I started coming 'round  
But I couldn't make you stop  
And you wouldn't let it go  
So everytime I got back up  
Like broken glass went tumbling down...  
  
The slightest thing could spark you  
There was always hell to pay  
I could feel your darkness in me  
And I knew just what to say  
And the rest I can't remember  
But it sounded like a gun  
But it could have been a firecracker  
It could have been a firecracker  
Made me run  
  
And you looked  
Oh you looked like broken glass  
When you fell to the ground  
I heard the sound of thunder  
Trailing off  
When you started coming 'round  
But I couldn't make you stop  
And you wouldn't let it go  
So this time when you got back up  
Like broken glass you went  
Just like broken glass  
Just like broken glass...  
...tumbling down, tumbling down...
