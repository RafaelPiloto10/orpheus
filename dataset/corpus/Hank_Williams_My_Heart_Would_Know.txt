I could say it's over now  
That I was glad to see you go  
I could hate you for the way I'm feelin'  
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know.  
  
It's a sin to make me cry  
When you know I love you so  
I could tell my heart that I don't miss you  
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know.  
  
I could give you all the blame  
But I'm sure the truth would show  
I could tell this world I've found a new love  
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know.  
  
I can't fool my cryin' heart  
'Cause it knows I need you so  
I could tell my heart I'm glad we parted  
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know.
