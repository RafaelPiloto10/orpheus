People say I run too fast  
But they don't understand  
I'm livin' out the best of times  
The way I always planned  
Oh, little girl you got a dirty smile  
Come along, walk with me  
Down the golden mile  
On my tongue the taste of love  
Never felt so good  
Easy come, no more leaving  
By the back door  
One on one  
I could live like this forever  
One on one  
Take me all the way to heaven  
One on one  
Stone by stone, frame by frame  
We got this love together  
No more headache in my heart  
No more under pressure  
Baby with you I can do anything  
Just a touch is not enough  
With you it's everything  
On my tongue the taste of love  
Never felt so good  
Easy come  
No more waitin' at the back door  
One on one  
I could live like this forever  
One on one  
Take me all the way to heaven  
One on one  
Love runs in so easily  
One on one  
All you give is what I need
