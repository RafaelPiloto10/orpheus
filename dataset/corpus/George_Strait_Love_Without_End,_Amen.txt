I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye.  
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why.  
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed.  
And then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waited for the worst.  
  
Chorus:  
And he said, let me tell you a secret about a father's love,  
A secret that my daddy said was just between us.  
He said, daddies don't just love their children every now and then.  
It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen.  
  
When I became a father in the spring of '81  
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son.  
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end,  
I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him.  
  
Repeat chorus:  
  
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates.  
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake.  
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in.  
And then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again.  
  
Repeat chorus
