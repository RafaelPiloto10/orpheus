Here comes Johnny Yen again  
With the liquor and drugs  
And the flesh machine  
He's gonna do another striptease  
Hey man where'd you get  
That lotion? I been hurting  
Since I bought the gimmick  
About something called love  
Yeah something called love  
That's like hypnotizing chickens  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
I'm worth a million in prizes  
With my torture film  
Drive a G.T.O.  
Wear a uniform  
All on a government loan  
I'm worth a million in prizes  
Yeah I'm through with sleeping on the  
Sidewalk - no more beating my brains  
With the liquor and drugs  
With the liquor and drugs  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
Got a lust for life  
Oh a lust for life  
Oh a lust for life  
A lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
Here comes Johnny Yen again  
With the liquor and drugs  
And the flesh machine  
He's gonna do another striptease  
Hey man where'd you get  
That lotion? Your skin starts  
Itching once you buy the gimmick  
About something called love  
Oh love love love  
That's like hypnotizing chickens  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
Got a lust for life  
Yeah a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
Oh a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
Yeah a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
A lust for life  
Lust for life, lust for life
