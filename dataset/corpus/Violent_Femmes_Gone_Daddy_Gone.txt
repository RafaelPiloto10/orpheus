Beautiful girl lovely dress  
High school smiles oh yes  
Beautiful girl lovely dress  
Where she is now I can only guess  
Cause it's gone daddy gone  
Your love is gone  
Gone daddy gone  
The love is gone away  
When I see you  
Eyes will turn blue  
When I see you  
Thousand eyes turnin' blue  
Tell by the way you that you switch and walk  
I can see by the way that you baby talk  
I can know by the way you treat your man  
I can love you baby til it's a cryin'  
Beautiful girl lovely dress  
Fifteen smiles oh yes  
Beautiful girl lovely dress  
Where she is now I can only guess
