Soon I will be here no more  
You'll hear my tale  
Through my blood  
Through my people  
And the eagle's cry  
The bear within will never lay to rest  
  
Wandering on Horizon Road  
Following the trail of tears  
  
White man came  
Saw the blessed land  
We cared, you took  
You fought, we lost  
Not the war but an unfair fight  
Sceneries painted beautiful in blood  
  
Wandering on Horizon Road  
Following the trail of tears  
Once we were here  
Where we have lived since the world began  
Since time itself gave us this land  
  
Our souls will join again the wild  
Our home in peace 'n war 'n death  
  
Wandering on Horizon Road...  
  
" I still dream every night  
Of them wolves, them mustangs, those endless prairies  
The restless winds over mountaintops  
The unspoilt frontier of my kith n'kin  
The hallowed land of the Great Spirit  
I still believe  
In every night  
In every day  
I am like the caribou  
And you like the wolves that make me stronger  
We never owed you anything  
Our only debt is one life for our Mother  
It was a good day to chant this song  
For Her  
  
Our spirit was here long before you  
Long before us  
And long will it be after your pride brings you to your end "
