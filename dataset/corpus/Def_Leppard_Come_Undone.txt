C'mon in, welcome, enter  
We've got you front roll center  
For the freak show parade  
  
Everybody wants to be you  
But I know you see right through it  
Sad mascaraed  
  
Wrap your arms around me like a wire  
You reach into my soul pull out the fire  
  
[Chorus]  
When I come undone I know you're the only one  
Who can touch me when I call out your name  
When I come undone I know you're the only one  
Who can put me back together again  
  
You've got what it takes to make me  
So won't you come and shake me out of this haze  
All to know those dreams you're sellin'  
God knows, man, he's not tellin'  
He's had better days...  
  
Awaitin' here your voice above me callin'  
You dragged me to my knees, but I'm still fallin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't close my ayes  
Can't hide the tear  
I feel the earth beneath my feet disappear  
I'm out of words, I'm out of time  
Give me your hand  
Reach out for mine  
  
Wrap your arms around me like a wire  
You reach into my soul pull out the fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who can put me back together again
