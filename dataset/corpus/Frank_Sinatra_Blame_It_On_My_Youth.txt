You were my adored one,  
Then you became the bored one,  
And I was like a toy that brought you joy one day,  
A broken toy that you preferred to throw away.  
If I expected love when first we kissed,  
Blame it on my youth.  
If only just for you I did exist,  
Blame it on my youth.  
I believed in everything,  
Like a child of three.  
You meant more than anything,  
All the world to me.  
If you were on my mind both night and day,  
Blame it on my youth.  
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray,  
Blame it on my youth.  
And if I cried a little bit when first I learned the truth,  
Don't blame it on my heart,  
Blame it on my youth.
