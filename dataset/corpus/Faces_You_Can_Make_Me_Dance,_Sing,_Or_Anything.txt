Hey baby, I want to say somethin' to ya', listen  
  
Sometimes when I get out of my head  
And I say all the wrong things  
Sometimes I know I stay out late at night  
And I get back fighting, hey babe  
Somehow all my plans  
Keep slippin' through my hands  
And I end up crying, but listen  
I can be a millionaire  
Honey when you're standing there  
You're so exciting  
  
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,  
You can make me do just any old thing, and I love it  
  
Sometimes I want to get up so early  
And get away from here girl  
Summer's gone, and before long  
North winds blow, that bring the snow  
I'll keep us warm girl  
My schemes it seems, are merely dreams  
Fading with each morning, hey babe  
But this old heart of mine  
Is far too proud not to keep on tryin'  
  
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,  
You can make me do just any old thing, yeah baby  
  
Ah yeah  
  
So little bird don't fly away  
Want you here every day  
Don't ever leave me  
I'd rather lose both my eyes  
Than never see your smiling face again girl  
  
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,  
You can make me do just any old thing  
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,  
You can make me do just any old thing  
  
Hey babe  
Keep on loving me babe, yeah  
Keep on loving me babe  
Just keep on loving me babe  
Just keep on loving me babe  
Just keep on loving, ooh babe  
  
Just keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling, darling, darling, darling  
Ha ha  
  
Wow, alright  
Hey baby  
Oh darling  
Keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling
