When your life gets too lonely  
It might help to feel me in your heart  
I remember you happy, but thought it  
Unfair that we are apart  
And it's gonna be all right  
'cause everlasting love  
Will get us through the night  
There's a new day that's dawning  
It brings with it skies so blue and clear  
I can't offer you blue skies  
I've only got love, eternal love  
Soon it's gonna be all right  
And the day will come  
When we live as one  
Drifting through time on an ocean of eternal love  
Sailing through space on an ocean of eternal love  
Doesn't love have a meaning  
To put that in words would be so hard  
Just remember the feeling of love in a song  
That's a love for real  
And it's gonna be all right  
'cause everlasting love  
Will get us through the night
