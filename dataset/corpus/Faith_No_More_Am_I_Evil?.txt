(Originally recorded by Diamond Head)  
  
My mother was a witch, she was burned alive  
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried  
Take her down now, don't want to see her face  
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace  
  
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice  
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price  
See their bodies out on the ice  
Take my time  
  
Am I evil? Yes, I am  
Am I evil? I am man, yes, I am  
  
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head  
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread  
Taking no chances, you come with me  
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free  
  
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice  
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price  
See their bodies out on the ice  
Take my time  
  
Am I evil? Yes, I am  
Am I evil? I am man, yes, I am, ooh  
  
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride  
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride  
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat  
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet  
  
Am I evil? Yes, I am  
Am I evil? I am man  
  
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire  
You can come with me, sweet desire  
My face is long forgot, my face not my own  
Sweet and timely whore, take me home  
  
Am I evil? Yes, I am  
Am I evil? I am man  
  
Solo!  
  
My soul is longing for, await my heir  
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself  
My face is long forgot, my face not my own  
Sweet and timely whore, take me home  
  
Am I evil? Yes, I am  
Am I evil? I am man  
  
Am I evil? Yes, I fucking am  
Am I evil? I am man
