I have waited  
For your love  
For so long  
How do i go on?  
I have told you  
So many times  
It's no good  
You're treating me so wrong.  
  
Out there so far away  
Above the sky will say  
For you...  
Here it comes again  
It's all around me  
It must be magic  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
I can see you  
In my mind  
The lost time  
That you're saving  
I could reach out  
And touch you  
What can i do?  
The sun ain't shining.  
  
Out there so far away  
Above the sky will say  
For you...
