had a talk with my woman late last night  
And she reassured me everything was alright  
And time hung still like a falling rain  
Now i know at last that my love is safe  
Ah but when i go away my love i leave  
Lord i'm but half a man without her by my side  
She's this memory that i hold all around  
She's this dream that i always hold to believe  
  
I wanna go upon a mountain  
And sing my love and sing my love  
I wanna sing it high, sing it down low  
Then i'm gonna know how long it's gonna last  
Then i'm gonna know how long it's gonna last  
  
Well you know your moses, oh lord he lost his way  
Ah, and your jesus don't remember the words  
Well then i guess it's just you and me brother  
All alone in this cold world  
All alone in this cold world  
  
Ah, you gotta go upon a mountain  
And learn to sing your love, learn to sing your love  
You know i can sing it high, sing it down low  
Then we gonna know how long it's gonna last  
Then we gonna know how long it's gonna last  
  
Hard rain, sweet rain, fall a little while longer  
Wash down the city skies  
Lord bring the streets alive  
Make it like it was long before i was born
