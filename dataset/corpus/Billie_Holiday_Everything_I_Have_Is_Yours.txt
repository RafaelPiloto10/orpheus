Everything I have is yours  
You are part of me  
Everything I have is yours  
My destiny  
  
I would gladly give the sun to you  
If the sun were only mine  
I would gladly give the earth to you  
And the stars that shine  
Everything that I posses  
I offer you  
  
Let my dream of happiness  
Come through  
I'll be happy just to spent my life  
Waiting at your backend call  
Everything I have is yours  
My life  
My all  
  
Everything I have is yours  
You are part of me  
Everything I have is yours  
My destiny  
  
I would gladly give the sun to you  
If the sun were only mine  
I would gladly give the earth to you  
And the stars that shine  
Everything that I posses  
I offer to you  
  
Let my dream of happiness  
Come through  
I'll be happy just to spent my life  
Waiting at your backend call  
Everything I have is yours  
My life  
My all
