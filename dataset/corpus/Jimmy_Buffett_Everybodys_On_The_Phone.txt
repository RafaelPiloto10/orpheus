Message in a bottle  
Rhythm of a drum  
Smoke signals and telegraphs  
Make the airwaves hum  
  
But that's all ancient history  
Like bongs and Lincoln Logs  
Now we livin' like the Jet sons  
In a wacky wireless fog  
  
Talkin', squawkin', hawkin'  
Who knows if anybody's gettin' through  
  
Toasters talk to crack berries  
Boston to Bombay  
Teenage schemes and mobile dreams  
As minutes tick away  
  
We act like crazy people  
Talking to ourselves  
Crashing cars in conversation  
Still that shit flies off the shelf  
  
The information superhighways  
Crawled up like a L.A. traffic jam  
  
Everybody's on the phone  
So connected and all alone  
From the pizza boy to the socialite  
We all salute the satellites  
  
Won't you text me with your master plan?  
You're loud and clear but I don't understand  
I'm a digital explorer in analog roam  
And everybody's on the phone  
  
Do you remember dialing up?  
Yes, I remember well  
Now I just can't go anywhere  
Without my sacred cell  
  
I think that I might die  
If I miss anything at all  
Text me, send me an e-mail  
Ring me up, give me a call  
  
I'm ADD on AOL and tryin' to read  
The writing on the wall  
  
Everybody's on the phone  
So connected and all alone  
From the pizza boy to the socialite  
We all salute the satellites  
  
Won't you text me with your master plan?  
You're loud and clear but I don't understand  
I'm a digital explorer in analog roam  
And everybody's on the phone  
  
Now I'm a real jungle jump up, I'm a megahertz man  
I swing from tree to tree on the very latest plan  
On the download and the dropouts  
On every major city across the land  
  
I got my Marley on my ring tone  
Get up, stand up, reach out  
Touch somebody band  
  
Everybody's on the phone  
So connected and all alone  
From the pizza boy to the socialite  
We all salute the satellites  
  
Won't you text me with your master plan?  
You're loud and clear but I don't understand  
And I'm a digital explorer in analog roam  
And everybody's on the phone  
  
And I'm a digital explorer in an analog roam  
And everybody's on the phone
