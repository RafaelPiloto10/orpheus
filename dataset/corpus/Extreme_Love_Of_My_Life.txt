Love of my life you've hurt me  
You've broken my heart and now you leave me  
Love of my life can't you see  
Bring it back bring it back  
Don't take it away from me  
Because you don't know  
What it means to me  
  
Love of my life don't leave me  
You've taken my love you now desert me  
Love of my life can't you see  
Bring it back bring it back  
Don't take it away from me  
Because you don't know  
What it means to me  
  
You will remember  
When this is blown over  
And everything's all by the way  
When I grow older  
I will be there at your side to remind you  
How I still love you I still love you  
  
Back hurry back  
Please bring it back home to me  
Because you don't know  
What it means to me  
Love of my life  
Love of my life  
Yeah
