Who am I?  
I am I.  
Who are you?  
You are me!  
Why can't I get it straight?  
No!  
Why can't I see it straight?  
Shaft!  
  
We can't let you,  
we can't let you go.  
Shaft! Shaft! Shaft! Shaft!  
I'll get a new one, then!  
I take a look, a look around, gas limited.  
I take a look around,  
I tell myself I live again!  
I take a look, a look around, gas limited.  
I take a look around, I tell myself I live again!  
  
Why can't I get it straight?  
No!  
Why can't I see it straight?  
Shaft!  
We can't let you,  
we can't let you go.  
  
Up until this day,  
I take a look, a look around, gas limited.  
Up untile this day,  
I look around, I tell myself I live again!  
Shaft  
  
where's Lorena when we need her?
