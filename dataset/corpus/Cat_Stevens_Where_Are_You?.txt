I know I think a lot  
But somehow it just doesn't help  
It only makes it worse  
  
The more I think  
The more I know  
The more it hurts  
  
With only solitude to meet me like a friend  
Oh, where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
  
Maybe she sits alone  
Beyond the storm  
Across the raging torrent of the sea  
She knows I want her  
And she knows I'll always be  
How can I live without the love I cannot see  
Oh where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
  
Oh  
I know there's someone there  
I hear her breathe  
Behind the silence of the dark  
But I know that I won't see  
'Til we open up our eyes together  
She'll look at me  
What a moment that moment will be!  
  
And she looks so light  
I could fly her through the night  
  
Oh  
I know I think a lot  
But somehow it just doesn't help  
It only goes to show  
That what you never miss  
You never know  
But I have loved you from the moment that we knew  
Oh, I love you  
I love you  
But where are you?
