All my life is on me now, hail the pages turning  
And the future's on the bound,  
Hell don't know my fury  
You're all I need, you're all I need  
You're all I need-and maybe some faith would  
Do me good  
  
I don't know what I'm doing, don't know should I  
Change my mind, I can't decide, there's too many  
Variations to consider  
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me  
More to do,  
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself,  
I make it bitter  
Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time  
Tell me you belong to me  
Baby say that it's all gonna be alright  
I believe that it isn't
