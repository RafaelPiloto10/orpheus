If you do not hunt, you do not eat  
If you do not hunt, you do not eat  
When will the sun come, when will the sun come,  
when will the sun come  
If you do not hunt, you do not eat  
If you do not hunt, you do not eat  
Who is the best boy, who is the best boy,  
who is the best boy  
Bring me my longbow, sing me the holy song  
Bring me my longbow, sing me the holy song  
Fill the cup, fill the cup, pass out the water  
Fill the cup, fill the cup, bless our provider  
If you do not hunt, you do not eat  
If you do not hunt, you do not eat  
Burn out the tall grass, burn out the tall grass,  
burn out the tall grass  
Women cry, children cry, throats are dry  
But the family must survive
