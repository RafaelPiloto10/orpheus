There's a light  
A certain kind of light  
That never shone on me  
I want my life to be lived with you  
Lived with you  
  
There's a way,(there's a way) everybody say  
To do each and every little thing  
But what does it bring  
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)  
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)  
  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
To love somebody  
To love somebody  
The way I love you  
  
In my brain  
I see your face again  
I know my frame of mind  
You ain't got to be so blind  
And I'm blind, yeah I'm blind  
  
I'm a man  
Can't you see what I am?  
I live and breathe for you  
But what good does it do  
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)  
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)  
  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
To love somebody  
To love somebody  
The way I love you  
  
Oh baby, you don't know what it's like  
You don't know what it's like  
You don't know what it's like  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
To love somebody  
To love somebody  
The way I love you  
  
To love somebody  
To love somebody  
The way I love you
