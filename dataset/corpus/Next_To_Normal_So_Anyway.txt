Diana:  
So anyway I'm leaving  
I thought you'd like to know  
You faithful come-what-may  
But clearly I can't stay  
We'd both go mad that way  
So here I go  
And anyway I'm leaving  
I guess that you can see  
I'll try this on my own  
A life I've never known  
I'll face the dread alone  
But I'll be free  
  
With you always beside me  
To catch me when I fall  
I'd never get to know the feel  
Of solid ground at all  
With you always believing  
That we can still come through  
It makes me feel the fool  
To know that it's not true  
  
What doctors call dysfunction  
We tried to call romance  
And true it's quite a trick  
To tell the dancers from the dance  
But rather than let chance take me  
I'll take a chance  
I'll take a chance on leaving  
It's that or stay and die  
I loved you once and though  
You love me still I know  
It's time for me to fly  
I loved you once and though  
I love you still I know  
It's time for me to go  
And so, goodbye
