Left you on your own.  
Your own blood.  
Your lesson for living.  
Pointed yourself in the wrong direction.  
Abandoned for your actions.  
Crucified for wrong decisions made.  
Full circle of friends lost.  
Due to ignorance and fear.  
  
Now left only stranded family to lead you  
Through your darkest day.  
  
This can't wait anymore for your love.  
This can't wait anymore for your love.  
Answer why your blood has been betrayed.  
Answer why he was left for dead.  
Now sticken' by deaths grip.  
Only few supporters stay.  
  
A lesson for the black sheep  
Makes his days forever gray.  
No boundaries for the love lost.  
When your gone they all will brag how much  
They guided you right up until the very end.  
Your torturing him when you walk away.  
  
Blood has been betrayed.  
Don't you close your eyes.  
You just let him die.  
You let him die.  
  
Tomorrow comes much faster  
Than anyone can believe.  
Your soul is crying anguish.  
There is still time to change
