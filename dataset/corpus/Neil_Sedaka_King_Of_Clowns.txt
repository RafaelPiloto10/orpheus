Here I come, the king of clowns,  
As I hide behind a smile and paint the town.  
Though I cry since you're gone,  
You'll never know because the show must go on.  
  
I've been sad, I've been blue  
Ever since the day that you found someone new.  
I pretend but you can't tell,  
With my broken heart I play my part so well.  
  
Step aside, here I come, the king of clowns,  
As I hide the lonely teardrops that come down.  
I make believe, with a smile,  
But the king of clowns is cryin' all the while.  
Tra la la la la la lilo, tra la la la la la lilo,  
Here comes the king of clowns.  
Tra la la la la la lilo, tra la la la la la lilo,  
Here comes the king of clowns.  
  
There are tears you'll never see,  
No you'll never see my tears and pity me.  
Though I'm hurt, still I'm proud,  
Always laughin' as I walk among the crowd.  
  
Step aside, here I come, the king of clowns,  
As I hide the lonely teardrops that come down.  
I make believe, with a smile,  
But the king of clowns is cryin' all the while.  
Tra la la la la la lilo, tra la la la la la lilo,  
Here comes the king of clowns.  
Tra la la la la la lilo, tra la la la la la lilo,  
Here comes the king of clowns.  
  
Tra la la la la la lilo, tra la la la la la lilo,  
Here comes the king of clowns...
