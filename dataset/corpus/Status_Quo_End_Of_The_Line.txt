Call me if you need me, woman  
Don't feel you're all alone  
You've been away for much too long  
It's time that you came home  
  
Out on the town, you've been fooling around  
I've been talking to myself  
I fantasise about the look in your eyes  
It's magic in itself  
  
But my heart's stopped healing  
And I can't help feeling it's the end of the line  
Staying away, don't let them say  
That it's the end of the line  
  
Please don't hurt me  
Don't desert me, it's the end of the line  
Think it over, come on over  
It's the end of the line  
  
When you say that you want me woman  
Is it just a lie?  
Saying things that you don't believe  
Can only mean goodbye  
  
Dreaming of all the times we had  
It seems all over now  
Can't you see that I want you back  
But I just can't see how  
  
But my heart's stopped healing  
And I can't help feeling it's the end of the line  
Staying away, don't let them say  
That it's the end of the line  
  
Please don't hurt me  
Don't desert me, it's the end of the line  
Think it over, come on over  
It's the end of the line  
  
But my heart's stopped healing  
And I can't help feeling it's the end of the line  
Staying away, but don't let them say  
That it's the end of the line  
  
Please don't hurt me  
Don't desert me, it's the end of the line  
Think it over, come on over  
It's the end of the line
