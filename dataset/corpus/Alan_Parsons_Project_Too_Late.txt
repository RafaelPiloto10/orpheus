When you were standing in the rain I gave you shelter  
When I was knocking on your door you gave me none  
Well I don't make that kind of deal with anybody  
And I won't be that kind of fool for anyone  
  
How do you feel when the tables have been turned?  
What will you do now the bridges have been burned?  
  
Cause it's  
Too late now the magic's lost  
Too late now the spell is broken  
Too late now to count the cost  
Of words that should remain unspoken  
  
When I need you by my side you stand above me  
And when I look into your eyes you turn away  
Well if that's the best there is then I won't buy it  
Well if that's the only game then I won't play  
  
How many danger signs did you ignore?  
How many times have you heard it all before?  
  
Cause it's  
Too late now the magic's lost  
Too late now the spell is broken  
Too late now to count the cost  
Of words that should remain unspoken
