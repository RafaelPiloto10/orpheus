Every time I hear that march from ?...Lowingrin...?  
I am always on the outside lookin' in  
Maybe that is why I see the funny side  
When I see somebody's brother take a bride  
Weddings make a lot of people sa-ad  
But if it isn't you they're not so bad  
Another bride, another June  
Another sunny honeymoon  
Another season, another reason  
For makin' whoopee  
A lot o' shoes, a lot o' rice  
The groom is nervous, he answers twice  
It's really killing, that he's so willing  
To make whoopee  
Picture a little love nest  
Down where the roses cling  
Picture the same sweet love nest  
Think what a year can bring  
He's washin' dishes and baby clothes  
He's so ambitious he even sews  
But don't forget folks  
That's what you get folks  
For makin' whoopee  
Down through the countless ages  
You'll find it everywhere  
Somebody makes good wages  
Somebody wants her share  
She calls him Toodles and rolls her eyes  
She makes him strudles and bakes him pies  
What is it all for  
Just so he'll fall for  
Makin' whoopee
