I'm a lucky man, yes, I am  
Living in Heaven down here on earth  
Her Tennessee smile drives me wild  
Don't you know, I know what its worth  
Shes every little thing in life that makes me feel good  
  
[Chorus]  
Shes my radio turned up to 11  
Shes my country song that I just gotta sing along to  
So fine, so fine, like the finest wine  
Shes my blue-eyed dream, my summer queen  
I cant believe shes mine, all mine  
Mine, all mine, all mine  
Mine, all mine, all mine  
  
That cool breeze kiss from her lips  
Is what I'm missing when I'm gone  
To tell the truth my heart's shot through  
When it comes to love, she can do no wrong  
Shes every little thing in life that makes me feel so good  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh  
She got my heart skippin a beat  
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh  
She got me dancin in the street  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mine, all mine, all mine
