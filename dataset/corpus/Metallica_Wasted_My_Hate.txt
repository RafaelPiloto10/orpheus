Good day, how do  
And I send a smile to you  
Don't waste, waste your breath  
And I won't waste my hate on you  
Hate, yeah  
  
Ain't gonna waste my hate  
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you  
I think I'll keep it for myself  
  
Ain't gonna give no more  
Ain't got the time to help you score  
I think it's time you pleased yourself, yourself  
  
Good day, how do  
And I send a smile to you  
Don't waste, waste your breath  
And I won't waste my hate on you  
Waste my hate on you, hate  
  
Think you're worthy now?  
Think enough to even raise the brow  
And to laugh and tip that two pronged crown  
  
Well, I see my hands I see my feet  
I feel that blood that pumps in me  
But where the hell's my mind goin' now? Get goin' now  
  
Good day, how do  
And I send a smile to you  
Don't waste, waste your breath  
And I won't waste my hate on you  
Waste my hate on you  
Think I'll keep it for myself, hate  
  
Ain't gonna waste my hate  
But I'm so greedy when they say  
Better to give than to receive  
  
Ain't gonna waste my hate, oh no  
Ain't got time to waste my hate on you  
I think I'll keep it all for myself  
For myself  
  
Good day, how do  
And I send a smile to you  
Don't waste, waste your breath  
And I won't waste my hate on you  
Waste my hate on you  
Think I'll keep it for myself, hate
