On certain Sundays in November  
When the weather bothers me  
I empty drawers of other summers  
Where my shadows used to be  
And she is standing by the water  
As her smile begins to curl  
In this or any other summer  
She is something altogether different  
Never just an ordinary girl  
  
And in the evenings on Long Island  
When the colors start to fade  
She wears a silly yellow hat  
That someone gave her when she stayed  
I didn't think that she returned it  
We left New York in a whirl  
Time expands and then contracts  
When you are spinning in the grip of someone  
Who is not an ordinary girl  
  
And when you sleep you find your mother in the night  
But she stays just out of sight  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming  
And when you wake the morning covers you with light  
And it makes you feel alright  
But it's just the same hard candy you're  
remembering again  
  
You send your lover off to China  
And you wait for her to call  
You put your girl up on a pedestal  
Then you wait for her to fall  
I put my summers back in a letter  
And I hide it from the world  
All the regrets you can't forget  
Are somehow pressed upon a picture  
In the face of such an ordinary girl  
  
And when you sleep you find your mother in the night  
But she fades just out of sight  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming  
And when you wake  
The morning showers you with light  
And it makes you feel alright  
But it's just the same hard candy you're  
remembering again
