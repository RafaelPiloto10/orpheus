Again  
I lay awake  
And I cried because of waste  
  
I'd love to  
(But only with you  
Only with you)  
  
Oh, time is gonna wipe us out  
There, I've said it loud and clear  
So that you will hear  
There's no one in view  
Just you  
Just you  
And time will never wipe you out  
  
Now I've had enough  
I've had more than could be  
My rightful share  
Of nights I can't bear  
How can it be fair ?  
Time must wipe them out  
  
So, again, I lay awake  
In a trance  
Oh, I just want my chance  
But only with you  
Only with you  
That's all  
That's all  
Aah...
