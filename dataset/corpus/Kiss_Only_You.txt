Only you have the answers  
But the questions you have to find  
Only you know the secrets  
But the truth lies deep in your mind  
Only you are the answer  
You turn the night into day, yeah  
Only you are the man-child  
You are the light and you are the way  
  
Tell me the secrets  
I want to know  
Tell me the secrets  
I want to know  
Only you  
  
Only you are the man-child  
You are the light and you are the way  
  
I can't believe this is is true  
Why do I listen to you  
If I am all that you say  
Why am I still so afraid  
  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you  
  
In every age  
In every time  
A hero is born  
As if by a grand design
