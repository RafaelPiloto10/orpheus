It's been a one man show that I've been runnin'  
On a two way street for love  
And I see no end to this dead end 'til you come back home  
And I've tried everything to keep remembering  
One good woman, one good man  
Two shots of happiness in one life span  
It takes a woman and one good man  
To make a one love stand  
The only thing that hurts is the memory  
Of having once lived by myself  
And I tried every kind of hustlin' man, put my love out on a shelf  
Well, he took everything and left my ears ringing  
One good woman, one good man  
Two shots of happiness in one life span  
It takes a woman and one good man  
I feel at home in a foreign land  
You know what's next when there's nothing planned  
I'm talking 'bout love, you know it takes two  
Well, he took everything and left my ears ringing  
One good woman, one good man  
Two shots of happiness in one life span  
It takes a woman and one good man  
It takes a woman and one good man  
To make a one love stand
