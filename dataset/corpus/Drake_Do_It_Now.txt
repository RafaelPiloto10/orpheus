Uh yea alright

Yea well alright  
Uh huh... Yea  
Gasps  
Feel good  
  
[Verse 1:]  
It's a celebration clap clap bravo lobster and shrimp  
And a glass of miskato for the girl whose  
A student and her friends whose a model  
Finished the whole bottle... And we gonna do it big like this  
Yea and he was just practice he ain't  
In your world you can take him off ya atlas  
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with  
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this outtt  
Show me where ya tax is show me where ya hands at  
Maybe I can grasp it they say if ya get her  
You can understand her better  
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her  
Yea... And I got it together so when they  
Talk they try to turn me it's like whatever  
... Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself  
  
Yea uh

[Verse 2:]  
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage her  
Especially when you think nobody is understanding ya  
These girls groups with they overprotected managers  
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a  
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space  
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface  
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate  
? Girl it's graces on top is such a hard place?  
Yea... But if you never even been there  
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin  
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures of ya swimwear  
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air  
I know that shit is exhausting girl  
And your mistakes are costing girl  
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself
