You can take the moon  
Gather up the stars  
And the robins that sing merrily  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
  
You can take the flowers  
Down in lovers lane  
And that sentimental poetry  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
  
Not for me, all that stuff  
The dreams that ruin your sleep  
Not for me, had enough  
Love is one thing you can keep  
  
You can take the plans  
And the wedding bells  
And whoever sings "Oh Promise Me"  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
'Cause love and I we don't agree  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
Hansoms through the park  
Kisses in the dark  
All the promises made faithfully  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
  
And you won't go wrong  
If you take a song  
Sung by Frankie Boy or Mr. C  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
  
Not for me, all that stuff  
Not for me, had enough  
  
You know what to do  
With good old "Tea for Two"  
And the girl for you, the boy for me  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
'Cause love and I we don't agree
