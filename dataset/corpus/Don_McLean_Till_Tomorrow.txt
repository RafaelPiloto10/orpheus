What can this be?  
Can you tell me?  
  
Would you like to discover why we're not free, to be lovers?  
I've been wanting to ask you  
  
Where has all the love gone and what have we become?  
Storm clouds full of thunder move silent as they drum.  
And when they're gone, we'll be fine, till tomorrow.  
Though I hope it won't rain.  
  
You will be mine and my sorrow will take wings in the morning.  
High above the heavens a rainbow paints the sky.  
White doves sing their songs of love.  
I watch them as they fly and wonder.  
What can this be? Can you tell me?  
Would you like to discover why we're not free, to be lovers?
