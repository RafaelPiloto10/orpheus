I got a gal who's always late  
Any time we have a date  
But I love her  
Yes I love her  
  
I'm gonna walk right up to her gate  
And see if I can get it straight  
'Cause I want her  
I'm gonna ask her  
  
Is you is or is you ain't my baby  
Way you're acting lately makes me doubt  
Youse is still my baby, baby  
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out  
  
A woman is a creature that has always been strange  
Just when you're sure of what you'll find  
She's gone and made a change  
  
Is you is or is you ain't my baby  
Maybe baby's found somebody new  
Or is my baby still my baby true  
  
Is you is or is you ain't my baby  
Maybe baby's found somebody new  
Or is my baby still my baby true
