A fortress in the sky  
What's left of life it holds  
We live on borrowed time  
  
Along a glowing moonlit pier  
Their armies still advance  
From the murky depths they rise  
  
From their rotting bones  
Their souls they scream  
For the flesh they need  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Tonight, tonight  
Zombies walk  
(Walk the earth)  
Land of the dead  
  
Massive flames arise  
They burn out of control  
In the slums it's genocide  
  
Evolved they find a way inside  
Those who could escape  
Had no chance to survive  
  
From their rotting bones  
Their souls they scream  
For the flesh they need  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Tonight, tonight  
Zombies walk  
(Walk the earth)  
Land of the dead  
  
Tonight, tonight  
Zombies walk  
Land of the dead  
The dead
