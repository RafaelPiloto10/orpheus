When I lost you honey sometimes I think I lost my guts too  
And I wish God would send me a word  
Send me something I'm afraid to lose  
Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives  
I get shivers down my spine and all I want to do is hold you tight  
  
[Chorus]  
I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes  
And to taste your tender charms  
And I just want to sleep tonight again in your arms  
  
Tonight there's fallen angels and they're waiting for us down in the street  
Tonight there's calling strangers,  
Hear them crying in defeat.  
Let them go, let them go, let them go,  
Do their dances of the dead (let'em go right ahead)  
You just dry your eyes girl, and c'mon c'mon  
C'mon let's go to bed, baby, baby, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's machines and there's fire waiting on the edge of town  
They're out there for hire but baby they can't hurt us now  
'Cause you've got, you've got, you've got,  
You've got my love, you've got my love  
Through the wind, through the rain, the snow, the wind, the rain  
You've got, you've got my, my love  
Heart and soul
