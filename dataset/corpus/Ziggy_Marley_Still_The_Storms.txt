With the world so loud, who's gonna hear, when I cry  
In this fog of war for black gold, one diamond sold, one life got stole  
Society built on slavery, for me it was not so long ago  
You may forget, but I still know  
  
[Chorus]  
Still the storms come, from the coast of West Africa [Repeat: x2]  
Anger and rage, thunder and lightning, spirits unrest hey they looking for
justice  
Still the storms come, from the coast of West Africa [Repeat: x2]  
Flood of tears rise, for stories untold, a debt to be paid, hey don't you know  
  
There heroes, are my enemies for one man's profit is another man's loss  
And I see their faces in stone and steel with eyes so proud, oh I wish they
could feel  
For I am come, with the chain and ball to shatter your images, and break down
these walls  
So this day may be bright free from the shadows of giants in the light  
I'm out of my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Eternity is not enough for me to forget, and my children's children, you will
regret  
For I warn you of a time when empires fall, and the lowly will be lifted hey
rule them all  
But vengeance is no glory, hate is no pay, truth is my call and peace is my
way  
So I will endure, through these hard times, while I am neglected and paid no
mind  
  
[Chorus]
