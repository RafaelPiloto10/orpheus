Good girls go to heaven  
Good girls go to heaven  
Maybe when the night will fall  
Baby, loneliness will call  
Oh, call me, please call me  
Oh your dreams will never lie  
Just behind a painted smile  
Just call me, please call me  
I try  
With you will the rainbow dry  
My heart is still alive  
I have a rainbow in my eyes  
Good girls go to heaven  
Bad girls go everywhere  
Good girls go to heaven  
Bad girls are here and there  
Just come feel my love inside  
Call me when you're sad  
There's no love to hide  
What you see is what you get  
Tonight  
Oh I make your dreams come true  
For a tango it takes two  
Oh call me, please call me  
I'm a prisoner of your heart  
007 in the dark  
Just call me, please call me  
A man, a child, oh in my eyes  
I'm hating all these lies  
A rainbow is still alive
