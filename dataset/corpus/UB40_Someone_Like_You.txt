There must be some place we can go  
There must be someone that you know  
Where can I go, and who you know worries me,  
Oh Lord  
  
Where can I find someone like you, to love  
Where can I find someone like you, my love  
There must be something we can try  
There must be some things we can find  
  
What can I try, and how to get by worries me,  
Oh Lord  
Where can I find someone like you, to love  
Where can I find someone like you, oh my love
