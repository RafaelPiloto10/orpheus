Hey girl do you think I'm a fool  
Or just another of your city boy  
Tryin play it cool  
Hey hey girl would you give me a chance  
To tryin show you who I really am  
And how I know it could be together  
I remember clearly the first time I saw you around  
You were hoping someone and I was just a face in the ground  
But you were more than my heart could handle  
You've been wish me girl  
  
Chorus:  
And I don't know why I am so damn drunk to you  
Maybe it's your smile all those eyes of blue  
But since I am I really hope you feel it too  
Cause if you do  
It surely means that dreams come true  
Tell em darling, tell em that you feel it too yeah  
Show me girl the dreams do come true  
  
Mhhm yeha  
  
Hey girl, do you think we could be friends  
Or maybe just a little more  
Why could pretend  
'Cause I don't know what it is about you  
But you're driving me insane  
And I do believe I'm crazy now about you  
Oh, I guess you could say I always had atrck of mine  
And you've been on that straight for a very very long time  
But don't stops just a one way ticket girl to my heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I don't know why I am so damn drunk to you  
Maybe it's your smile all those eyes of blue  
But since I am I really hope you feel it too  
Cause if you do  
It surely means that dreams come true  
Tell em darling, tell em that you feel it too yeah  
Show me girl the dreams do come true
