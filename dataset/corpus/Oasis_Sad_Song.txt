Sing a sad song  
In a lonely place  
Try to put a word in from me  
It's been so long  
  
Since I found this place  
You better put in two or three  
We as people are just walking 'round  
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground  
  
What we don't see  
Well it can't be real  
What we don't touch we cannot feel  
  
Where we're living in this town  
The sun is coming up and it's going down  
But it's all just the same at the end of the day  
And we cheat and we lie  
  
Nobody says it's wrong  
So we don't ask why  
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day  
  
We're throwing it all away  
We're throwing it all away  
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day  
  
If you're needing  
Something I can give  
I know I'd help you if I can  
If your honest and you say that you did  
  
You know that I would give you my hand  
Or a sad song  
In a lonely place  
I'll try to put a word in for you  
  
Need a shoulder? Well if that's the case  
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do  
  
Where we're living in this town  
The sun is coming up and it's going down  
But it's all just the same at the end of the day  
When we cheat and we lie  
  
Nobody says it's wrong  
So we don't ask why  
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day  
  
Don't throw it all away  
Don't throw it all away  
Don't throw it all away  
Don't throw it all away  
  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day
