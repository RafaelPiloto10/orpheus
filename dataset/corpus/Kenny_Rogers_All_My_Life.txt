Are you sure I haven't loved you somewhere before?  
In another time, another place, on some distant shore  
You know me so well, better than I know myself  
  
And you'll love me tonight  
Like you've loved me all my life, all my life  
And with the touch of your hand  
You took me farther than I've never been  
You'll love me like, you've loved me all my life  
  
Love like we made could have taken a lifetime to find  
But you found the way to my heart in a moment of time  
You know how to care just like you've always been there  
  
And you'll love me tonight?
