It's been a long day at the bottom of the hill,  
She died of a broken heart.  
She told me I was living in the past,  
Drinking from a broken glass.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to face the cold.  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to travel home.  
  
I walked down to the other end of the day,  
Just to catch those last few waves.  
I held out my hand and slowly waved goodbye,  
I turned now my eyes up to the sky.  
  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to face the cold.  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to travel home.  
  
She'll come back to me (She'll come back to me).  
She'll come back to me (She'll come back to me).  
All alone in this misery.  
She'll come back to me.  
  
I held out my hands into the light and I watched it die,  
I know that I was part to play.  
My god, my time to die.  
Never want to spend my life alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to face the cold.  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to travel home.
