Is this a riot or are you just pleased to see me?  
Why aren't we holding hands and talking sweets?  
I love you really, though I know no-one believes me  
There's chaos every time we meet  
  
Oh no, look what you've gone and done  
You're creating pandemonium  
That song you sing means everything  
To me, I'm living in ecstasy  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now it's pandemonium!  
  
You're crashing everywhere, it's like you're smashing china  
Skidding on an icy road  
You're major trouble since you were almost a minor  
I sometimes think we'll both explode  
  
Oh no, look what you've gone and done  
You're creating pandemonium  
That song you sing means everything  
To me, I'm living in ecstasy  
My world's gone mad, what did you do?  
Telling perfect strangers that I love you  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now it's pandemonium!  
  
I can't make sense of anything  
All I know is the party's in full swing  
If we both just stopped for a minute  
I declare war and then you'd win it  
  
To tell you the truth, I thought I was shockproof  
Until I saw what you get up to  
When you think about it, it's quite an achievement  
That after all I still love you  
  
Oh no, look what you've gone and done  
You're creating pandemonium  
That song you sing means everything  
To me, I'm living in ecstasy  
My world's gone mad, what did you do?  
Telling perfect strangers that I love you  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now it's pandemonium!
