I've had these jeans since i was born  
And now they're ripped and now they're torn  
And all my friends have skateboards  
  
I want the toys of other boys  
I want a knife and a gun and things  
But mom and dad will not give in  
  
And i can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
I can't put the needle in  
No I can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
  
And now I know just what it is  
It's called disease and it's got my head  
It always runs where I hide  
  
Too scared too talk, too scared to try  
Too scared to know the reasons why  
And all my friends say bye bye  
  
And i can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
No I can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
  
And i can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
No I can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in  
Can't put the needle in
