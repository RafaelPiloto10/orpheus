Our bed we live, our bed we sleep  
Making love and I become you  
Flesh is warm with naked feet  
Stabbing thorns and you become me  
  
Oh, I'd beg for you, you know I'll beg for you  
  
Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine  
Take a bath I'll drink the water that you leave  
If you should die before me ask if you can bring a friend  
Pick a flower hold your breath and drift away  
  
She holds my hand, we share a laugh  
Sipping orange blossom breezes  
Love is still and sweat remains  
A cherished gift unselfish feeling  
  
Oh, I'd beg for you, you know I'll beg for you  
  
Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine  
Take a bath I'll drink the water that you leave  
If you should die before me ask if you could bring a friend  
Pick a flower hold your breath and drift away  
  
She tells me things, I listen well  
Drink the wine save the water  
Skin is smooth I steal a glance  
Dragon flies 'er' gliding over  
  
Oh I'd beg for you, you know I'll beg for you  
  
Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine  
Take a bath I'll drink the water that you leave  
If you should die before me ask if you could bring a friend  
Pick a flower hold your breath and drift away
