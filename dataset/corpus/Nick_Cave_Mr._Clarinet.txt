I have a friend in you, oh Mr Clarinet  
You make me laugh, and then cry like the song of the clarinet.  
Marry me, marry me alive O  
I put on my coat of trumpets  
Will she be there? Is my piccolo on straight?  
  
  
Her white stockings and red dress that goes  
Swish, swish, swish around her legs of lace  
Marry me, marry me alive O  
  
  
Could you tell her  
Would you tell her for me,  
Oh Mr Clarinet confidant  
That I love her, love her, oh love her  
I love her but I can't [wait]  
  
  
Marry me, marry me alive O  
Oh maybe, oh maybe lie down  
  
  
I love her, love her, love her  
Love her love her love her love her
