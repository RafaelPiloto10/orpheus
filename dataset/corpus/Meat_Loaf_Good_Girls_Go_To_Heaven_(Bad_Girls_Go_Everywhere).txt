When the wind is howling through your window pane  
It's not the only pain of the night  
Your burning up in your bed, you gotta fever of love  
And there's not an antibody insight  
Hey jenny, jenny why are you crying  
There's a beauty of a moon in the sky  
But I guess when you've been leading such a sheltered life  
You never lift your head and look so high  
  
You don't have a lot  
But it's all that you've got  
And you can turn it into more than it seems  
Just give it a shot  
Fantasize every movement  
And imagine every inch of your dreams  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But it's gotta be something you can reach out and feel now  
It ain't right  
It ain't fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Ooh now good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Sombody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
  
When the sweat is sizzling  
On you skin in the dark  
And your desperate now for somewhere to turn  
  
Every muscle's in rebellion  
Every nerve is on edge  
And every limb is being erotically burned  
  
Hey johnny, johnny why are you shaking?  
When a boy should do whatever he can  
You've been nothing but an angel  
Every day of your life and now you wonder what it's like to be bad  
  
You don't have a lot  
But it's all that you've got  
And you can turn it into more than it seems  
Just give it a shot  
Fantasize every movement  
And imagine every inch of your dreams  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But it's gotta be something you've been wanting to feel now  
It ain't right  
It ain't fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good boys go to heaven, but the bad boys go everywhere  
Good boys go to heaven, but the bad boys go everywhere  
Somebody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good boys go to heaven, but the bad boys go everywhere  
  
Every time I try and dream you  
I can't believe how hard it's been to  
Conjure up your face and trace your body in the air  
All the seconds go on forever  
But the thirds and the forth ones are even better  
And every time I do it just a little bit longer  
Every time I dream, it's just a little bit stronger than  
Real life  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But it's gotta be something you can reach out and feel now  
It ain't right  
It ain't fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Ooh now good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere  
Somebody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
I'll be praying  
That the good girls go to heaven, but the bad girls go everywhere
