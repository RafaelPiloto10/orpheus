Bamboozled by love,  
Oh lord, the shit done hit the fan  
Bamboozled by love  
Oh lord, the shit done hit the fan  
The way that girl been carryin' on  
I swear I just don't understand  
Don't you know I treat her nice and kind  
The way no other lover can  
Now don't you know I treat her nice and kind  
The way no other lover can  
I came home the other day and she was  
Suckin' off some other man  
I ain't the type for beggin'  
I ain't the type to plead  
If she don't change those evil ways  
I'm gonna make her bleed  
She can scream and she can holler  
Bang her head all along the wall  
If she don't give me what I want  
She ain't gonna have no head at all  
Bamboozled by love  
I said she fooled around too long  
Bamboozled by love  
I said she fooled around too long  
Now I am mad and getting meaner  
I am here and she is gone  
And the reason you have not seen her  
She is underneath the lawn  
I know she's underneath the lawn, lawn, lawn  
Now look I ain't the type for beggin'  
Now I ain't the type to plead  
If she don't change those evil ways  
I'm gonna make her bleed  
She can scream and she can holler  
Bang her head all along the wall  
If she don't give me what I want  
She ain't gonna have no head at all  
Bamboozled by love  
I said she fooled around too long  
Bamboozled by love, oh lord  
I said she fooled around too long  
Now I am mad and getting meaner, meaner  
I am here and she is gone  
And the reason you have not seen her, seen her  
Is she is underneath the lawn
