Doctor Livingston, I presume  
Stepping out of the jungle gloom  
Into the midday sun  
What did you find there?  
Did you stand a while and stare?  
Did you meet anyone?  
I've seen butterflies galore  
I've seen people big and small  
I've still not found what I'm looking for  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
Captain Scott, you were so bold  
Now you're looking rather cold  
Out there in the snow  
What did you find there?  
Did you stand a while and stare?  
Did you meet anyone?  
I've seen polar bears and seals  
I've seen giant Antarctic eels  
I've still not found what I'm looking for  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
Columbus where are you bound?  
So you think the world is round  
Sailed off in the blue  
What did you find there?  
Did you stand a while and stare?  
Did you meet anyone?  
There are Indians by the score  
In many places that I saw  
I've still not found what I'm looking for  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all, we're all, we're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone
