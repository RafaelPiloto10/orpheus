(feat. Sergio Mendez)  
  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
You know my history  
See honey I (honey I)  
I'm just trying to warn you (let me warn you)  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
  
I've been cruisin down this road for a while now,  
I should tell the truth...  
Girl you've been so good to me but I know  
I'm no good for you  
You should run while you can  
Find yourself a better man  
'Cause I'm known for brief romance  
And breakin hearts across the land  
  
Yes I've been known to have a few temptations  
Out there on the road  
And let's say hypothetically I've slipped and  
Took a couple home  
Girl I know that's not fair  
You need someone who'll be there  
So just get away before it's too late  
And you're pain is too much to bear  
  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
You know my history  
See honey I (honey I'm)  
I'm just trying to warn you (let me warn you)  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
  
(rhodes piano solo)  
  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
You know my history  
See honey I'm (honey I'm)  
I'm just trying to warn you (let me warn you)  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
  
Now on second thought maybe we'll give  
This love another try  
'Cause I can't see you with no one else  
I'm selfish I can't lie  
So let's go, let's go slow  
You know all you need to know  
It could end one day but  
Let's just say we'll see how far it goes  
  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
You know my history  
See honey I'm (honey I'm)  
I'm just trying to warn you (let me warn you)  
Please baby don't (baby don't)  
Don't fall in love with me
