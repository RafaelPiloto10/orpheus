I've got a good feeling  
Like I know how I'm feeling  
Scraping me off the ceiling  
Back to that good feeling  
Now I find it hard living  
Wasting our time giving  
When will we all give in  
Into that good feeling  
Now I got a good feelin'  
Like I know how I'm feelin'  
Scrappin' me off the ceiling  
Back to that good feeling  
  
You picked a time a very fine time  
To look at me you'd see that I was fine  
You're happy too just towing on your line  
But you're afraid of what you'll find behind  
  
In twenty years from now I'll be the same  
And you'll be changing all the letters  
In your maiden name  
Ah you're thikin' that we're one  
But we'll never be the same  
  
'cause I got a good feeling  
That I know I'm not missing  
Anything you're giving  
Isn't worth this good feeling
