Now every once in a while  
There's a crack in my smile  
Dark voices are talking to me  
Dark voices tell me the way  
  
It's supposed to be  
They said "Breakin' up"  
They said "It's hard to do"  
But what they say  
  
About breakin' up  
Y'know it's just not true  
Breakin' up, it's easy to do  
Breakin' up, it's easy to do  
  
Why if you know  
Why did you have to go  
And leave me on t he floor  
About as sick as a dog  
  
I'm feeding my face  
Like a bleary-eyed hog  
Why'd it have to stop  
With so much good undone  
  
Breakin' up, it's easy to do  
Breakin' up, it's easy to do  
Breakin' up, it's easy to do  
Y'know I break up every time  
  
I break up with you
