When I woke up this mornin'  
Had a smile run across my face.  
My baby from town just had to get down,  
Come and drag me all over the place.  
  
Gonta drive on a flatbed trailer truck  
Down on highway fifty-nine.  
I had the blues and my baby, she knew  
She's holdin' little piece of mind.  
  
Down brownie,  
My brownie downtown,  
Down brownie.  
  
Got my share and I'm a black hand cottonfield  
Just to try and keep myself alive.  
Eatin' red beans and rice with the right sauce, it's nice  
Or anything you want to try.  
  
Now I'm hitchin' a ride back from Brownie's,  
I'm kind of sad but I feel alright.  
The cold night it stings but I got me some wings,  
I'll be flyin' into Houston tonight.
