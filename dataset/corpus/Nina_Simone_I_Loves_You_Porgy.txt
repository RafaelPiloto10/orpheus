I loves you Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
If you can keep me, I wants to stay here  
With you forever and I'd be glad  
I loves you Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
With his hot hand  
If you can keep me, I wants to stay here  
With you forever  
I got my man  
  
Someday, I know he's comin' back  
To call me  
He's gonna handle me and hold me so  
It's gonna be like dyin', Porgy,  
Deep inside me,  
But when he calls I know I have to go  
  
Porgy, I's your woman now  
I is, I is  
And I ain't never goin' nowhere  
'Less you shares the fun  
Want no wrinkle on your brow,  
No how  
Because the sorrow of the past is all  
Done, done  
My Porgy,  
Now the real happiness is just begun  
There's no wrinkle on my brow  
No how  
And I ain't goin'  
You hear me saying, if you ain't goin',  
With you I'm stayin'  
  
Porgy, I's yo' woman now,  
I's yours forever  
Mornin' time and evenin' time  
And summer time and winter time  
Mmm  
Oh my Porgy  
My man Porgy  
From this minute I'm tellin' you,  
I keep this vow  
Porgy, I's yo' woman now!
