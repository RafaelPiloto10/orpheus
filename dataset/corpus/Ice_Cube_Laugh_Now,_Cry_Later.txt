[Ice Cube]  
Uh-huh, understand this  
I don't give a fuck about what y'all talkin' about  
I ain't tryin' to hear none of that shit  
Nigga I'ma do what I wanna do  
When I wanna do it, how I wanna do it  
And you better hope I don't do it to you  
Now, I don't care what momma got to say  
I don't care what grandmomma got to say  
Nigga I'm grown  
Let me tell you a lil' somethin' about me  
  
I was born not to give a fuck, wanna drink, get your cup  
Turn it up, throw it up, take the world, blow it up  
Somebody slow it up, roll it up, smoke it up  
My own momma can't keep me from loc'n up  
One ear out the other, one man out to smother  
The neighborhood, that left me here without my brother  
Fuck you under covers and you dirty motherfuckers  
In the hood, that still fuck without rubbers  
Club hop, bar hop, car shop, nail shop  
To the mall, spend it all, why the hell not  
What bills, what rent, don't know what's spent  
Why you care, do you work for the government?  
  
[Chorus]  
Fuck it homey, I'ma laugh now and cry later  
Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later  
All you players you can laugh now and cry later  
Investigators let you laugh now and cry later  
  
[Ice Cube]  
See I'm a product of this urban decay  
A nigga dyin' for tomorrow, but live for today  
A nigga lie steal and borrow, and cheatings OK  
Don't you tell these motherfuckers that my name is O'Shea  
Cause I'ma fuck up my baby's credit, let him regret it  
7 months old he's already got a jail record  
I'm the one to blame, put it in my momma name  
She's a drama queen, but I got the bling bling  
I need the watch and the bracelet and the earrings  
I need you all to show up at my hearings  
Tell the judge I'm a nice nigga, good nigga  
And I'ma play the sad face when he look nigga  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
"The number you are calling was lost, and cannot be called back"  
"Your last call return service"  
  
[Ice Cube]  
It's fucked up, that y'all won't accept my calls  
Tell momma, at least she can send some drawers  
These walls, make y'all forget about me  
I'm comin' home, in 2033  
But that's irrelevant, did you get the mail I sent  
What I tell a bitch, you better stay celibate  
She start lyin to me, tell me who she ain't fuckin'  
Never tell me that my homeboys ain't nothin'  
Bun in the oven, it belong to my cousin  
Got the nerve, to tell me that you really love me  
(What?) I'ma kill her ass when a nigga make parole  
Hit her with my cane, cause a nigga gray and old  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Man, it ain't right man  
You know y'all ain't doin' me right man  
A nigga tryin' to do right man  
You know I'm tryin' to change my life man, you know?  
I done found the Lord while I'm in here, you know?  
I I'm tryin' to do right now, I mean  
You know I'm sorry for everything  
That I, I I mean you know  
That's fucked up how y'all doin' me man  
Y'all niggas could at least send me somethin'  
  
"Alright, first four guys, let's go, lock it up"
