My oh me, my  
Feet don't fail me now  
Take me to your finish line  
Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take  
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine  
Walking through the city streets  
Is it by mistake or design  
I feel so alone on a Friday night  
Can you make me feel like home if I tell you you're mine  
  
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry  
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why  
Keep making me laugh,  
Lets go get high  
The road is long, we carry on  
Try to have fun in the meantime  
  
Come take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane,  
So choose your last words, this is the last time  
Cause you and I, we were born to die  
  
Lost but now I am found  
I can see but once I was blind  
I was so confused as a little child  
Tried to take what I could get  
Scared that I couldn't find  
All the answers honey  
  
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry  
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why  
Keep making me laugh,  
Lets go get high  
The road is long, we carry on  
Try to have fun in the meantime  
  
Come take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane,  
Choose your last words, this is the last time  
Cause you and I, we were born to die  
We were born to die  
We were born to die  
  
Come and take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane  
  
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry  
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why  
Keep making me laugh  
Lets go get high  
The road is long, we carry on  
Try to have fun in the meantime  
  
Come take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane  
Choose your last words, this is the last time  
Cause you and I, we were born to die (We were born to die)
