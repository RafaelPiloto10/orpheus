I was flicking through the channels on the TV  
On a Sunday in Milwaukee in the rain  
Trying to piece together conversations  
Trying to find out where to lay the blame  
But when it comes right down to it there's no use trying to pretend  
For when it gets right down to it there's no one here that's left to blame  
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me  
We're just sugar mice in the rain  
  
I heard Sinatra calling me down through the floorboards  
Where you pay a quarter for a partnership in rhyme  
To the jukebox crying in the corner  
While the waitress is counting out the time  
  
For when it gets right down to it there's no use trying to pretend  
For when it gets right down to it there's no one really left to blame  
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me  
We're just sugar mice in the rain  
  
'Cause I know what I feel, know what I want I know what I am  
Daddy took a raincheck  
'Cause I know what I want, know what I feel I know what I need  
Daddy took a raincheck, your daddy took a raincheck  
Ain't no one in here that's left to blame but me  
Blame it on me, blame it on me  
  
Well the toughest thing that I ever did was talk to the kids on the phone  
When I heard them asking questions I knew that you were all alone  
Can't you understand that the government left me out of work  
I just couldn't stand the looks on their faces saying, "What a jerk"  
  
So if you want my address it's number one at the end of the bar  
Where I sit with the broken angels clutching at straws and nursing our scars  
Blame it on me, blame it on me,  
Sugar mice in the rain, your daddy took a raincheck
