Captain I am sorry that this ship should go a stray  
Letting the ocean have it's own way  
Lay me down to pass ?to send?, I'll pay for all my sins  
Pleading for mercy, my cancel begins  
  
Times have changed, and my vision ain't so strong  
For the battle was too long, for me to bear  
I don't feel the pain, for my soul is sinking fast  
And I know this is the last, the chance for me  
  
In and out of tumor, and in and out of mind  
Deeper the ocean, stronger the tide  
Stormy seas surround me, no sails to keep me dry  
I pray to you captain, but you heard not my cry  
  
Times have changed, and my vision ain't so strong  
For the battle was too long, for me to bear  
I don't feel the pain, for my soul is sinking fast  
And I know this is the last, the chance for me  
  
For me, for my story  
Let me lie in peace  
I want to say I'm sorry now  
  
Then I'll be on my way  
Then I'll be on my way  
Then I'll be on my way  
  
Times have changed, and my vision ain't so strong  
For the battle was too long, for me to bear  
I don't feel the pain, for my soul is sinking fast  
And I know this is the last, the chance for me
