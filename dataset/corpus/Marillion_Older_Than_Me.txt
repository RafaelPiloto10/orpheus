She's older than me  
I don't care about them talkin'  
Why can't they see  
I've got all that I need?  
  
All the pretty young things  
Seem suddenly boring  
When I look in her eyes  
All the world is behind  
  
Every line on her face  
Is a place and a memory  
When our fingers touch  
All the years fall away  
  
Mistakes that she made  
Are lessons she carries  
And still she's prepared  
To tell me she'll stay  
  
She's older than me  
She's shown me the heaven  
And we're gonna be over the hill  
And far away...
