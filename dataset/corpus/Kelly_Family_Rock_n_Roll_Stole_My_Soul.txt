Tom had a job in a town outside the city  
Was working very hard  
Life was lookinvery pretty  
Nothing going wrong  
With the rockabilly Song  
That the radio was playing  
But then came around  
The Rockn Roll beggining  
Tom left the Town and got  
Into the singin  
Nothing was the same since  
He read a book  
Saying "Wheels are freedom"  
Nowadays  
Chorus:  
Rockn Roll stole my soul  
Rochindown the River like a rolling stone  
Rockn Roll stole my soul  
Rockindown the river like a rolling stone  
Tom had a band and made  
A good a livin  
Toured all the land  
His dreams had been fulfilling  
Was bringing in some cash  
But spend it all on hash  
That's when his life began to bend  
Times were looking bad  
He was lying in a clinic  
He lost all he had  
The world was looking cynic  
His innocence was gone  
But it didn't take him long  
Now hes singin  
On the street  
The song of his defeat  
Oh, yeah  
Chorus:  
Beans, Beans  
The Musical fruit  
The more you eat  
The more you toot  
The more you toot  
The better you feel  
So lets have beans for every meal  
Chorus(4x)
