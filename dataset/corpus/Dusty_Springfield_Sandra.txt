She's a great little housewife  
Though sometimes she talks like a fool  
But she helps at the store in the holiday rush  
And she picks up the kids after school  
And she puts down the 'phone  
When her husband comes home  
And she changes from mother to wife  
'Til she feels the words hanging between them  
And she hangs by her words to her life  
  
She says  
I swear I love my husband  
I love my kids  
I wanted to be like my mother  
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did  
Oh, there might have been time to be me for myself, for myself  
So many things that she wishes  
She don't even know what she's missing  
And that's how she knows that she missed  
  
She's a sweetheart except when she's moody  
It's hard to get through to her then  
Depressed for a while when the youngest was born  
Ah, but that happens now and again  
Ah, she might take a drink with the housework  
Or when Michael's kept late at the shop  
A martini or two before dinner  
But she always knows when to stop  
  
She says  
I swear I love my husband  
And I love my kids  
And, though I wanted to be like my mother  
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did  
Oh, there might have been time to be me for myself, for myself  
So many things that she wishes  
She don't even know what she's missing  
And that's how she knows that she missed  
  
Oh, they used to hold hands at the movies  
Now it's seldom, if ever, they go  
Once you pay for the sitter, and parking the car  
There's no money left for the show  
She was doing the dishes  
When a glass fell and broke on the tile  
And she cut her wrist, quite by mistake  
It was real touch and go for a while  
  
She says  
Oh God, I love my husband  
And I love my kids  
Well, I wanted to be like my mother  
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did  
Oh, there might have been time to be me for myself, for myself  
So many things that she wishes  
She don't even know what she's missing  
And that's how she knows that she missed
