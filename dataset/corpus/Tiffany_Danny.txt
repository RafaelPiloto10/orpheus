Here in the dark  
Silence is much too hard to bear  
Don't know where to start  
I'm hurtin' everywhere  
If we don't stop now  
We're gonna lose  
We should try somehow  
Cause it's too easy to bruise  
  
When you take your mark  
Danny with your aim  
Danny for my heart  
It's only pain  
What does it prove  
Again and again  
Danny nobody wins  
  
If it's your pride  
Promise you won't let it keep us apart  
Deep down inside  
We can make a new start  
If we don't look back  
On the price we pay  
Well that's all I ask  
Cause we'll never make it this way  
  
When you take your mark  
Danny with your aim  
Danny for my heart  
It's only pain  
What does it prove  
Again and again  
Danny nobody wins
