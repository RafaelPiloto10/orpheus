I got a funny feelin' that all of you girls  
Had better hold on to your man.  
'Cause I feel, I says I feel,  
I feeeeel like breaking up somebody's home.  
  
See, lying here all alone  
On a rainy night like this.  
Starvin' for some lovin'.  
Oh-oh, what I would give,  
What I would give for just one kiss.  
Every rain drop I hear  
Against my window pane.  
And it's beatin' through  
So loud and clear.  
Words, words that speak your name.  
  
See I, I got no where to turn  
Now that you have gone,  
And I feel like  
Breaking up somebody's home.  
  
I know it's useless  
Hangin' on when you belong to someone else.  
But I can't shake the feelin'.  
Oh, after all, I didn't make this bed.  
I got nowhere to turn  
Na, na, na, now, na, now, now that you have gone.  
  
I saw the boy last night  
And I believe I caught a chill.  
Well, I could, I could not control the vibration,  
And my heart, my heart,  
My heart justa would not stand still.  
I got nowhere to turn  
A now, now, now, now that you have gone,  
And I feel like  
Breaking up somebody's home.  
Got nowhere, a nowhere to run  
And I'm so damn tired of being all alone,  
And I feel like  
Breaking up somebody's home.  
  
I know it's useless  
Hangin' on when you, you, you, ya,  
You belong to someone else.  
But I, la, la, la, can't shake the feeling,  
Oh, after all, I didn't want it this way.  
I swear I did not want it this way.  
But I got nowhere, a no where to run,  
And I'm so g-ddamned tired of being alone,  
And I feel like breaking up somebody's home.  
Got nowhere, a nowhere to run,  
And I'm so g-ddamned tired of being alone,  
And I, I feel like, feel like,  
Breaking up some mutha's home.  
One more time.  
I, I got nowhere to turn,  
A nowhere to, nowhere to, nowhere to turn,  
And I feel like, I feel like,  
Breaking, breaking up somebosy's home.  
I gotta break up somebody's home.
