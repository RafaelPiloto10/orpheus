I am dejected. I am depressed.  
Yet resurrected and sailing the crest.  
Why this elation, mixed with deflation?  
What explanation? I am in love.  
  
Such conflicting questions rise  
Around in my brain: Should I order cynanide  
Or order champagne?  
  
Oh, what is this sudden jolt?  
I feel like a frightened colt,  
Just hit by a thunderbolt. I am in love.  
  
I knew the odds were against me before,  
I had no flair for flaming desire,  
But since the gods gave me you to adore,  
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire,  
  
So come and enlighten my days and never depart.  
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart,  
For I am wildly in love with you,  
And so in need of a stampede of love.
