Just because I ask a friend about him  
Just because I spoke his name somewhere  
Just because I rang his number by mistake today  
He thinks I still care  
  
Just because I haunt the same old places  
Where the mem'ry of him lingers everywhere  
Just because I'm not the happy girl I used to be  
He thinks I still care  
  
And if he's happy thinking I still need him  
Then let that silly notion bring him cheer  
But how could he ever be so foolish?  
Oh, where would he get such an idea?  
  
Just because I ask a friend about him  
Just because I spoke his name somewhere  
Just because I saw him, then went all to pieces  
He thinks I still care  
He thinks I still care  
He thinks I still care  
He thinks I still care
