Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Anytime she goes away  
Wonder this time where she's gone  
Wonder if she's going to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away  
Well I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know  
I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know........  
Hey I outta leave the young thang alone  
But there ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Only darkness and rain  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away
