Finally found a place they could never reach  
Sipping Singha Beer on Pattaya Beach  
Singha Beer, don't ask no questions  
Singha Beer, don't tell no lies  
Singha Beer, don't ask no questions  
Singha Beer, don't tell no lies  
There's a guy next to me, won't tell me his name  
Buy's me Mekong Whiskey just the same  
Singha Beer, don't ask no questions  
Singha Beer, don't tell no lies  
Singha Beer, don't ask no questions  
Singha Beer, don't tell no lies  
I'm just a wally  
Hanging out on Pattaya Beach  
I'm just a wally  
Hanging out on Pattaya Beach  
Met a girl, said she's really going to blow my mind  
She says she don't mean sex and I say alright  
Turns out, she's a bloke, tries to give me head  
I have to run out screaming to the street instead  
She's just a wally  
Hanging out on Pattaya Beach  
I'm just a wally  
Hanging out on Pattaya Beach  
Singha Beer, don't ask no questions  
Singha Beer, don't tell no lies  
In the house of the Gods  
Where no mongrels preach  
I watched the sun going down  
On Pattaya Beach  
I'm just a wally  
Hanging out on Pattaya Beach  
I'm just a wall  
Hanging out on Pattaya Beach
