[Chorus:]  
I'm just a bad boy,  
Long long ways from home.  
I'm just a bad boy,  
Long long ways from home.  
But I ain't got nobody  
To bury me when I'm dead and gone.  
  
Well I'm the cat that scratches  
And I'm like a dog that bites.  
I'll be your box of matches, baby,  
When you need a light.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to have a little girl,  
Only 16 years old,  
But her mom and dad put me way out,  
Way out in the cold.  
  
I can't stay here no longer,  
My luck is running slow.  
Gotta keep on moving  
But I ain't got no place to go.  
  
[Chorus]
