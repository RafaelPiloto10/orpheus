It's getting better all the time  
I used to get mad at my school  
The teacher's that taught me weren't cool  
You're holding me down  
Filling me up with your rules  
  
I've got to admit it's getting better  
A little better all the time  
I have to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better since you've been mine  
  
Me used to be angry young man  
Me hiding me head in the sand  
You gave me the word  
I finally heard  
I'm doing the best that I can  
I've got to admit it's getting better  
  
I used to be cruel to my woman  
I beat her and kept apart from the things that she loved  
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene  
And I'm doing the best that I can  
  
I admit it's getting better  
A little better all the time  
Yes I admit it's getting better  
It's getting better since you've been mine...
