Don't want to be an actor pretending on a stage,  
Don't want to be a writer with my thoughts out on a page,  
Don't want to be a painter cause everyone comes to look,  
Don't want to be anything when my lifes an open book,  
I dream it's true, but I see it through  
If I could be, wasting my time, with you  
Don't want to be a farmer working in the sun  
Don't want to be an outlaw always on the run  
Don't want to be a climber reaching for the top  
Don't want to be anything were I don't know when to stop  
I dream It's true, but I see it through  
If I could be wasting my time, with you, so if I'm inside your head  
Don't believe what you might have read, you'll see what I might have said  
To hear it, come waste your time with me, come waste your time with me  
Wasting my time with you, if I could be wasting my time with you  
So if I'm inside your head don't believe what you might have read  
Don't believe what you might have read, you'll see what I might have said  
To hear it, come waste your time with, come waste your time with me  
Come waste your time with me, wasting my time with you, if I could be wasting  
My time with you.
