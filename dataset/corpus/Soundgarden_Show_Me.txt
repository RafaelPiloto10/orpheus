I woke up in a burning house  
I was nailed down to the floor  
I looked outside my window  
And there is going to be a July snow  
  
Show me  
Show me  
Show me the go  
  
This guy once said  
That the tires only flat on the bottom  
But that guy wound up dead  
When his girlfriends daddy shot him  
  
Show me  
Show me  
Show me the go  
  
The leaf that fell the tree  
The straw that broke the camels back  
My daddy spilled his cup in the river  
And that was enough to break the dam  
  
Show me  
Show me  
Show me the go
