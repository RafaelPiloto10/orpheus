Why don't you just give in?  
Just like a Siamese twin  
I mean to stick to you  
Until you do  
I won't take it on the chin  
You'll never leave me flat  
I'm not a "last year's hat"  
That you can cast aside  
I've got my pride  
And I won't stand for that  
You can't brush me off  
As you would a speck of powder, you may try  
But you can't brush me off  
You can't shout me down  
You can yell but I'll yell louder, you can try  
But you can't brush me off  
You can say you're out but I'll keep phoning  
You can tell me goodbye  
You can tell me but I  
Won't go  
No  
You can't leave me cold  
As you would a plate of chowder, you may try  
But you can't brush me off  
  
[2]  
What is this all about?  
You've got me wrong, no doubt  
I give you all my time  
Believe me, I'm  
Not looking for some way out  
I want you for my wife  
Sharing my care and strife  
And that may not be fun  
For when it's done  
You're stuck with me for life  
You can't brush me off  
As you would a fresh mosquito, you may try  
But you can't brush me off  
You can't rub me out  
Like a spot on my tuxedo, you may try  
But you can't brush me off  
You can cut me dead but I won't mind it  
You may injure my pride  
Still I'll never decide  
To go  
No  
You can't drop me fast  
As you would a live torpedo, you may try  
But you can't brush me off  
[3]  
You can't brush me off  
Like a colored pullman porter, you may try  
But you can't brush me off  
You can't lock me out  
Like a frightened farmer's daughter, you may try  
But you can't brush me off  
You can drop a hint but I won't take it  
You can tell me bad news  
I intend to refuse  
To go  
No  
You can't give me back  
As you would a leaded quarter, you may try  
But you can't brush me off
