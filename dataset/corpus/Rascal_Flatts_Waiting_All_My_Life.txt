Everybody needs it  
Everybody wants it  
Everybody's searching for someone  
Been down a thousand highways  
I never though would end  
Baby, I've been  
  
Waiting all my life to find you  
Always been one step behind you  
Your love babe  
I've been waiting all my life  
  
I was tired of waiting  
Every night was praying  
Everyday would be the day I'd find you  
I grew so impatient, how long would it take  
To know you were out there somewhere  
Somewhere waiting, wondering just like me  
  
I've been waiting all my life to love you  
All that time I was dreaming of you  
Your love babe  
I've been waiting all my life  
  
And did I lose faith, did I lose heart  
Maybe I did, but I never lost my way  
To where you are - I've been  
  
Waiting all my life to find you  
Always been one step behind you  
Your love babe  
I've been waiting all my life  
  
I've been waiting all my life to love you  
All that time I was dreaming of you  
Your love babe  
I've been waiting all my life  
  
Your love I've been waiting  
Your love I've been waiting all my life  
  
All my life, all my life
