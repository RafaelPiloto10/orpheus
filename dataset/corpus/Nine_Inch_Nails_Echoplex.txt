Nice and high and far apart  
Just like they said  
I built this place with broken parts  
Just like they said  
You chip away the old version of you  
You'd be surprised at what you can do  
I'm safe in here  
Irrelevant  
Just like they said  
  
My voice just echoes off these walls  
You feel me breathe  
I am watching you  
I see it all  
The many ways you can't get to me  
I see it all  
I see the hell you put yourself through  
Oh the things I could do (if I wanted to)  
  
My voice just echoes off these walls  
My voice just echoes off these walls  
I don't need anything at all  
My voice just echoes off these walls  
  
And I just slowly fade away  
  
You will never ever get to me in here
