If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I don't want to go  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I'd just a soon stay home  
If they ain't got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me  
  
it would be about the same to me  
Detroit city from Aretha to Aaliyah  
to Bob Segar to  
Joe Louis n' his arena an now on me  
Paradime the mic of overachievers  
Smokin' sewer cops bottom feeders  
and parking meters  
  
A bunch of bad dude in the mad brew and tattoos  
So think twice before you pass through  
Or get clapped through wack crews get hurt  
We can take you for a ride or take you for your shirt  
I did it in the Bronx, I did it in Queens  
And you can see me do it, down in New Orleans  
Fat backs n greens I'm a scene of amazement  
You'll be picking all your teeth up off the fucking pavement  
Is that Kracker with a see?  
Naw Kracker with a K!  
  
Kracker mother fucker all god damn day  
You could take Gratiot south but that's a real rough route  
You'll get found face down with your pockets hangin' out  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I don't want to go  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I'd just a soon stay home  
If they ain't got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me...  
it would be about the same to me  
My name is Cowboy  
My Name is Cowboy  
  
I'm I'm I'm goin' Platinum  
Back in the mother fuckin' saddle  
want to battle Kid Rock bitch your up shit's creek  
without a paddle  
I'm no tattle cause I do not snitch  
I lick clits n' drop cock n' twats that spit  
I spit like hick's n' mix hits for Flom  
And that's what you call droppin' bombs  
Got a bullet head a dick with a 30 odd 6  
And from a thousand yards I'll hit ya right in the lips....shit  
  
Motherfuckers wamma talk about shinin'  
Here's four fingers, kiss my fuckin' diamonds  
I keep climbin' but these charts ain't shit  
I'm a whinin, linin', rhymin' son of a bitch  
I'm the song of a shotguns unsung cry  
And I'm the only MC that'll never die  
  
'Cause if it's real you'll feel it, so check for the name  
Or look for the dog with the fade in the chain, yeah!  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I don't want to go  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I'd just a soon stay home  
If they ain't got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me  
it would be about the same to me  
  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker's the name, double X in size  
An' I reside on the side where the sun rise  
See I'll never be touched, cause I'm outta reach  
Call me Kracker just be fuckin' up spots like bleach  
Worst in my division, I got bitches on file  
From the Mississippi river on back to Belle Isle  
  
I got style but it doesn't show  
I got more love for Detroit than you'll ever know  
I I I I know cats that sling  
Crack n' cats that scrap  
Cats that bust beer bottles over baseball caps  
  
Cats that get drunk and like to spark up skull  
Cats that keep sawed off's chillin' up in the trunk trunk trunk  
Whores an' 4 4's n' scoops n' blow  
  
And fuck Faygo bitch we pound cans of Stroh's  
We run the mitten from the river way up to the farms  
That's why we got these fuckin D's tattooed on our arms  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I don't want to go  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I'd just a soon stay home  
If they ain't got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me  
it would be about the same to me
