Sittin' in front of your house,  
Like rain in early dawn  
Workin' on a love letter  
Got my radio on.  
  
Got my eye on your window pane  
And I smoked a pile of cigarettes.  
Mercy, mercy but love is strange  
And you haven't even kissed me yet.  
  
Look comes to push,  
Push comes to shove,  
Shove comes to touch,  
Touch will come to love.  
  
Workin' on a love letter,  
Listenin' to a love song,  
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter,  
Got my radio on, radio, radio  
  
Hope you get the message baby.  
I know that you're gonna let me in.  
It's wierd in your neighborhood  
If this is war, then I'm gonna win!  
  
Look comes to push,  
Push comes to shove,  
Shove comes to touch,  
Touch will come to love.  
  
Why don't sit waitin'  
Why don't behavin'  
Love's waiting in the car,  
In the car and rain now.  
  
Workin' on a love letter,  
Listenin' to a love song,  
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter,  
Got my radio on, radio, radio  
  
Guitar solo  
  
Look comes to push,  
Push comes to shove,  
Shove comes to touch,  
Touch will come to love.  
  
(3 times with adlibs)  
Workin' on a love letter,  
Listenin' to a love song,  
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter,  
Got my radio on, radio, radio
