I've been here a while  
Staring at this screen wondering what I'll write  
Things I can't explain  
But should've tried to say when I had the time  
  
You were inspiration  
When no one else believed  
You showed me strength in my skin  
That no one else could see  
  
Let's just keep driving on  
All the stars jumping in through the windows  
Let's go where we belong  
Headed fast as we can for the unknown  
  
I remember how  
Like a telescope you could always find  
(You could always find)  
Something worth a wish  
You said every day's a gift and we'll be alright  
(We'll be alright)  
  
And something took you from me  
I can't understand why  
But wherever you're resting (I'm carrying)  
I'm carrying your line  
  
Let's just keep driving on  
All the stars jumping in through the windows  
Let's go where we belong  
Headed fast as we can for the unknown  
  
You can stay there  
And it's not fair  
Those were the days when we laughed all the while  
When the fireflies  
Lit up our skies  
Those were the nights when the world made us smile  
  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
  
(Let's just keep driving on)  
(Let's go where we belong)  
  
Let's just keep driving on  
All the stars jumping in through the windows  
Let's go where we belong  
Headed fast as we can for the unknown  
  
You can stay there  
And it's not fair  
Those were the days when we laughed all the while  
When the fireflies  
Lit up our skies  
Those were the nights when the world made us smile  
  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
(My only hope)  
(You're my telescope)  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
(My only hope)  
  
My only hope  
You're my telescope
