You make-believe celebrities  
Taking bows in front of me  
In your dickey-bow ties  
In your dickey-bow ties  
  
Pick your nose beside the stage  
Jesus Christ has come of age  
So you've had a good cry  
So you've had a good cry  
  
Reach out there's people in the stalls  
A Blackpool season isn't very small  
Reading commercials on TV  
Is just as good as a bad Page 3 review  
  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you  
  
In the dressing room you find  
Telegrams with good luck lines  
So nice to be known  
So nice to be known  
  
The curtain falls so that's the end  
You hit the bottle once again  
So you've had a good crowd  
So you're one of the crowd  
  
Reach out there's people in the stalls  
A Blackpool season isn't very small  
Reading commercials on TV  
Is just as good as a bad Page 3 review  
  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you
