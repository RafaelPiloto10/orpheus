Has to be a loose fit  
Has to be a loose fit  
  
Go on move in it, go on do your bit  
Small, big take your pick  
Doesn't have to be legit  
  
It' s gotta be a loose fit  
It' s gotta be a loose fit  
  
Don't need no skin tights in my wardrobe today  
Fold them all up and put them all away  
Won't be no misfit in my household today  
Pick them all out and send them on their way  
Do what you're doing, say what you're saying  
Go where you're going, think what you're thinking  
Sounds good to me  
  
Don't know what you saw, but you know it's against the law  
And you know that you want some more  
I've heard it all before  
Gonna buy an airforce base  
Gonna wipe out your race  
Get stoned in a different place  
Don't you know I got better taste  
Do what you're doing, say what you're saying  
Go where you're going, think what you're thinking  
It sound good to me  
  
Do what you're doing, spend what you're owing  
Pay what you're paying, look where you're going  
Say what you're thinking, kill who you're killing  
Sing if you're singing, speak if you're speaking  
Sounds good to me
