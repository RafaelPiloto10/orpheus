I know you told me  
Such a long time ago  
That you didn't want me  
You didn't love me no more  
  
I want to know  
Oh, what makes me be  
do you believe me child  
A fool for you  
Ohoh, no, I'm a fool for you  
  
I know you told me  
You didn't want me 'round  
And I know  
You got a man way 'cross town  
  
So I know it's something  
Oh, what makes me be  
do you believe me child  
I'm a fool for you  
Ohoh, no, I'm a fool for you  
  
Did ya ever wake up in the morning  
Just about the break of day  
Reach over and feel the pillow  
Where your baby used to lay  
Then you put on your crying  
Like you never cried before  
Oh lord  
Yeah you even cry so loud,  
You give the blues to your neighbour next door  
Ever since you were five years old  
I been a fool for you, little girl  
Way down in my soul  
I'm a little fool for ya  
  
So I know it's something  
Oh, oh, Lord  
I'm a fool for you
