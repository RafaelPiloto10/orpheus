Of all the money that er'e I spent  
I spent it ingood company  
And all the harm that ere I've done  
Alas it was to none but me  
And all I have done  
For want of wit  
To memory now I can't recall  
So fill ne the parting glass  
Goodnight and joy be with you all  
Of all the comrades that er'e I had  
Are sorry for my going away  
And all the sweetheart that er'e I had  
Would wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls, unto my lot  
That I should rise and you should not  
I will gently rise  
And I'll softly call  
Goodnight and joy be with you all  
If I had enough money to spend  
And leisure time to sit a while  
There is a fair maid in this town  
That sorely has my heart beguiled  
Her rosey cheeks and ruby lips  
I own, she has my heart enthralled  
So fill to me the parting glass  
Goodnight and joy be with you all
