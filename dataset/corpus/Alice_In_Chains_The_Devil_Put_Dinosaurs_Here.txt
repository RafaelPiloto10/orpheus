Come to me, I'll fill the hole  
Why would I be lying  
End fan, all planned out  
  
Offering a wonderful  
Peace of mind worth buying  
Bow down last round up  
  
I am wise and you don't know  
A cloud is my home  
Only some get in  
Got a 'maginary friend  
  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
Jesus don't like a queer  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
No problem with faith just fear  
  
Promise those who've gone before  
Waitin' on you flyin'  
Leading, receiving us  
  
I'm as flawed as any man  
Look at me I'm smiling  
Drink me, eat me up  
  
I am wise and you don't know  
A cloud is my home  
Only some get in  
Got a 'maginary friend  
  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
Jesus don't like a queer  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
No problem with faith just fear  
  
I am wise and you don't know  
A cloud is my home  
Only some get in  
Got a 'maginary friend  
  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
Jesus don't like a queer  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
The problem with faith  
  
Fear  
  
Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar
