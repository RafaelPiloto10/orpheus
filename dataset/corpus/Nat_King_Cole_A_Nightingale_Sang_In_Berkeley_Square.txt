That certain night, the night we met,  
There was magic abroad in the air.  
There were angels dining at the ritz,  
And a nightingale sang in berkeley square.  
  
I may be right, i may be wrong,  
But i'm perfectly willing to swear  
That when you turned and smiled at me,  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.  
  
The moon that lingered over londontown  
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown.  
How could he know that we two were so in love?  
The whole darn world seemed upside down.  
  
The streets of town were paved with stars,  
It was such a romantic affair.  
And as we kissed and said goodnight,  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.  
  
When dawn came stealing up, all gold and blue  
To interrupt our rendez-vous,  
I still remember how you smiled and said,  
"was that a dream? or was it true?"  
  
Our homeward step was just as light  
As the dancing of fred astaire,  
And like an echo far away  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.
