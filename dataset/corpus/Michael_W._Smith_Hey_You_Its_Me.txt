Hey you  
Things to do  
Live the life for faith and family  
It's tough  
With all that stuff  
Filling your head  
We know  
The undertow  
Could get us so we don't remember, but  
Lest we ever  
Lest we ever forget  
  
Hey you, it's me  
True lovers are we  
Children under the sun  
Two spirits in the name of One  
  
Hey me  
Got to be  
Places to go and people there to see  
No space  
For back to base  
And no time at all  
We talk  
Walk the walk  
Run the race  
And climb the ladder, but  
If we ever  
If we ever should fall  
  
Sometimes the smoke clears  
And I see things how they are  
I see how we have come so far
