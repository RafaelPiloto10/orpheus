Pasolini is me,  
Accattone, you'll be,  
I entered nothing and nothing entered me,  
Till you came with the key,  
And you did your best but?  
  
As I live and breathe,  
You have killed me,  
You have killed me,  
Yes I walk around somehow,  
But you have killed me,  
You have killed me  
  
Piazza Cavour,  
What's my life for?  
  
Visconti is me,  
Magnani,  
You'll never be.  
  
I entered nothing and nothing entered me,  
Till you came with the key,  
And you did your best but?  
  
As I live and breathe,  
You have killed me,  
You have killed me,  
Yes I walk around somehow,  
But you have killed me,  
You have killed me  
  
Who am I, that I, come to be here?  
  
As I live and breathe,  
You have killed me,  
You have killed me,  
Yes I walk around somehow,  
But you have killed me,  
You have killed me  
  
And there is no point saying this again,  
There is no point saying this again,  
But I forgive you,  
I forgive you,  
Always, I do forgive you.
