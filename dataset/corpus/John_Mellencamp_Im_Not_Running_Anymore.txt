Holly told me, "You better give me a child"  
I said, "Holly, there's no way  
We don't even like each other all that much  
We couldn't make it one more day"  
She said, "You better look out, buster  
The next time you see me you're gonna pay"  
I said, "Holly, I'm not running anymore  
But I'm on my way"  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
But I'm not running anymore  
  
Well I got two circus clowns here who like to fight  
They got one black eye and a bloody nose  
They are the hoodlums of my third wife  
Whatever I say they will oppose  
I try to teach those clowns something  
Like how to make it day to day  
I say, "Hey, you kids, I'm not running anymore  
But I'm on my way"  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
And I'm not running anymore  
  
Well I look in the mirror - what the hell happened to me?  
Whatever I had has gone away  
I'm not the young kid that I used to be  
So I push the hair back out of my face  
That's O.K., I knew this would happen  
But I was hopin' not today  
Hey Baby, I'm not running anymore  
But I'm on my way  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
And I'm not running anymore  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
And I'm not running anymore  
  
For sure!
