I was once some mother's darlin'  
Some daddy's little girl  
More precious than the ruby  
More cherished than the pearl  
My heart was full of mercy  
And my forehead full of curl  
Now I am nothing and am lost unto this world  
I am lost unto this world...  
  
They herded me like cattle  
Cut me down like corn  
Took me from my babies  
Before they could be born  
You can blame it on the famine  
You can blame it on the war  
You can blame it on the devil  
It don't matter anymore  
I am lost unto this world...  
  
I was tortured in the desert  
I was raped out on the piain  
I was murdered by the high way  
And my cries went up in vain  
My blood is on the mountain  
My blood is on the sand  
My blood runs in the river  
That now washes through their hands  
I am lost unto this world...  
Can I get no witness this unholy tale to teil  
Was God the only one there watching  
And weeping as l feil  
O you among the living  
Will you remember me at all  
Will you write my name out  
With a single finger scrawl  
Across a broken window  
In some long forgotten wall  
That goes stretching out forever  
Where the tears of heaven fall  
I am lost unto this world...
