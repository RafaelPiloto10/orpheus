There you may stand in your splendor and jewels  
Swaying me in both directions  
One is the right one, the other for fools  
How do I make my selection?  
The city lies silent in the warm morning light  
The sand is as golden as saffron  
Oasis of love, sweet water of life  
God bless the poor ones who have none though they have tried  
  
Someone is drowning down there in the flood  
But this river will dry by tomorrow  
Is it ocean or stream, this love in my blood?  
Bringer of joy or of sorrow?  
The end of the journey must soon be in sight  
Birth is the start of the swansong  
Oasis of love, sweet water of life  
God bless the poor ones who want some, but are denied  
  
No one is given the map to their dreams  
All we can do is to trace it  
See where we go to, know where we've been  
Build up the courage to face it  
While we fumble in the darkness where once there was light  
Roaming the land of the ancients  
Oasis of love, sweet water of life  
God bless the poor ones whose patience never died  
  
While we stumble in blindness where once there was sight  
Searching for trees in the forest  
Oasis of love, sweet water of life  
God bless the poor ones who have none though they have tried  
  
God bless the poor ones who want some, but are denied  
God bless the poor ones whose patience never died  
God bless the poor ones on that one-way donkey ride
