I heard you for so long  
And the promises you made  
Keep me hanging on  
Don't know why  
I've got to know  
Is this love enough to show it  
Let it go  
Will I ever get to heaven with you?  
Will I ever breath the air that you do?  
Will I ever touch the angels?  
Will we fly?  
Will I ever?  
Will I ever get to heaven with you?  
Another night starts to fall  
And the wind carries me  
When I wanna crawl  
?Coz when I look inside  
There's a fire in me  
That I can't hide, who  
Wishin? for an angel  
Searchin' in my mind  
Getting tired of waiting in me  
Praying
