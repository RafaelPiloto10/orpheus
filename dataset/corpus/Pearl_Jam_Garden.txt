The direction of the eye  
So misleading  
The defection of the soul  
Nauseously quick  
I don't question  
Our existence  
I just question  
Our modern needs  
  
I will walk, with my hands bound  
I will walk, with my face blood  
I will walk, with my shadow flag  
  
Into your garden  
Garden of stone  
After all is done  
We're still alone  
I won't be taken  
Yet I'll go  
  
I will walk, with my hands bound  
I will walk, with my face blood  
I will walk, with my shadow flag  
  
Into your garden  
Garden of stone  
I don't show  
I don't share  
I don't need  
What you have to give
