But over in a land that's in my back yard  
There's a people who succeed, they don't try hard  
  
Well, they found a way to live with ease  
By eating from the bush instead of the trees  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Path to eternity  
Find you a path and you follow the call  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Well, over in a corner, standing there  
Telling my house that they haven't a single care  
  
But my house does not listen (worry) it's got a path of it's own  
Yet the bush, and a tree, never leave it alone  
  
Apple Bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Find you a path and you buy with a call  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Someday like my house you're going to chose too  
If you cut this new path well the old one will do  
and you live with the people who live with ease  
The red apple bush, the blue apple tree
