I believe there's magic here in these sails  
In the wake of these old pirate trails  
That cut through the water and the atmosphere  
I believe there is magic here  
  
It's in buried treasure under the sea  
In the music that drifts out on the street  
It's in the barflies drinking their beer  
I believe there's magic here  
  
This crazy rock has got a lot  
Of romance and sex appeal  
It's lazy days with Hemingway  
And I gotta say that it captures me still  
  
'Cause I believe there's magic in those beach side dives  
Under the moon as it's changing the tides  
Friends they go away, then they reappear  
I believe there is magic here

Friends they go away, then they reappear  
I believe there is magic  
A whole lotta magic  
I believe there is magic here  
I believe there is magic  
A whole lotta magic  
I believe there is magic here
