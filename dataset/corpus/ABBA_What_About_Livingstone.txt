Went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand  
And then I heard them laugh and say  
Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now  
Hey, what's it good for anyway?  
So I said  
Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
  
And all of those fellas at the local news-stand  
Didn't know what to answer or what to say  
So I told them about him, that he was just like  
One of those spacemen in his way  
And if you laugh at them  
Then there's only a thing I can say  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
  
What about Livingstone?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
What about all those men?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
Traveling up the Nile  
(Didn't he do it?)  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
(Didn't that help them? Well, didn't it?)  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
What about all those men?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
