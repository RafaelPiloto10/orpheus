Well I was born an original sinner.  
I was borne from original sin.  
And if I had a dollar bill  
For all the things I've done  
There'd be a mountain of money  
Piled up to my chin  
  
My mother told me good  
My mother told me strong.  
She said "Be true to yourself  
And you can't go wrong."  
"But there's just one thing  
That you must understand."  
"You can fool with your brother  
But don't mess with a missionary man."  
  
Don't mess with a missionary man.  
Don't mess with a missionary man.  
  
Well the missionary man  
He's got god on his side.  
He's got the saints and apostles  
Backin' up from behind.  
Black eyed looks from those bible books.  
He's a man with a mission  
Got a serious mind.  
There was a woman in the jungle  
And a monkey on a tree.  
The missionary man he was followin' me.  
He said "Stop what you're doing."  
"Get down upon your knees."  
"I've a message for you that you better believe."
