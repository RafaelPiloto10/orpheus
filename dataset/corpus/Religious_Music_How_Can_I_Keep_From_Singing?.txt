My life goes on in endless song  
Above earth's lamentations,  
I hear the real, though far-off hymn  
That hails a new creation.  
  
Through all the tumult and the strife  
I hear it's music ringing,  
It sounds an echo in my soul.  
How can I keep from singing?  
  
While though the tempest loudly roars,  
I hear the truth, it liveth.  
And though the darkness 'round me close,  
Songs in the night it giveth.  
  
No storm can shake my inmost calm,  
While to that rock I'm clinging.  
Since love is lord of heaven and earth  
How can I keep from singing?  
  
When tyrants tremble in their fear  
And hear their death knell ringing,  
When friends rejoice both far and near  
How can I keep from singing?  
  
In prison cell and dungeon vile  
Our thoughts to them are winging,  
When friends by shame are undefiled  
How can I keep from singing?
