Sometimes true love has to choose to do what it don't want to do  
And sometimes patience has to give up a hanging on  
Darling I'll be far away and you'll be wishing I had stayed  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
After Ruby settled down and Madge moved back to her hometown  
After Mable says you're fool leave me alone  
You'll find out how much it hurts and just how much a dream is worth  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
[ piano ]  
You'll find out what lonely mean but you won't find the broken chain  
That once bound our love together proud and strong  
You start talking to the walls and count every tear that falls  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
After Ruby settled down...
