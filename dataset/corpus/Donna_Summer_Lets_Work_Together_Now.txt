Different faces other races  
New conditions old traditions  
All are one  
  
From the humble to the mighty  
Those in need and those with plenty  
All are one  
Yes we all are one  
  
Let's work together now  
Towards a better kind of world  
One for our children's child  
Let's work together now  
Respect our neighbor's way of life  
We've got to harmonize  
  
Learn to give without return  
And you will find yourself  
With all the friends you need  
  
All these problems on this earth  
Are only due to selfish acts of men's on greed  
Let's stop all this creed  
  
Let's work together now  
Let's make a better kind of world  
Think of our children's child  
Please work together now  
Respect each person's way of life  
Let's start to harmonize
