You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love drives a man insane  
You broke my will, oh what a thrill  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
You came on over and took over my heart  
You came along and moved me honey  
I cannot lie you are so fine  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
Kiss me baby, Who, feels good  
Come on over baby, Love me like a lover should  
Your fine, so kind, told this world that your mine, mine, mine  
  
You pull my fingers and you twiddle my thumbs  
want to love you but a true love huh  
Come on baby, your drive me crazy  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
Kiss me baby, who, feels good  
Ahh call me baby, love me like a lover should  
Your fine, so kind, want to tell this world that your mine, mine, mine  
  
You pull my fingers and you twiddle my thumbs  
want to love you but it sure is hard  
Come one baby, you drive me crazy  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love drives a man insane  
You broke my will, oh what a thrill  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
You get me lonely and you get all my money  
You came alone and your with me honey  
Come on baby you drive ah me crazy  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire
