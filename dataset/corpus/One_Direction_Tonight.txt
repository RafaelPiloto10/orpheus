Tonight is gonna be perfect  
If you're with me  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because I love you baby  
  
Flying in the wind  
With the sun to our backs  
We can't see the shadows  
And we can't go back  
  
Cause  
  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
If you're with me  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because I love you baby  
  
They can say what they want  
They can say what they feel  
But they can't change the way that the I want  
And the way this love is real  
  
Oh tonight is gonna be perfect  
If you're with me  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because I adore you  
I love you oh  
Tonight is gonna be perfect if you're by my side  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because you're making me smile.
