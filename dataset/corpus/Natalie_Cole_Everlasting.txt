Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh  
Everlasting, what a feeling  
Just to know the love we'e got is  
Everlasting, and never ending  
Is all I need to keep on givin'  
I was just an average gir  
Playing the field, hoping  
For someone to come into my world  
Someone not afraid to look into my eyes  
  
And make a connection  
Then you walked in my direction  
And from the moment that we touched  
I knew what we found was  
Everlasting, what a feeling  
Just to know the love we've got is  
Everlasting, and never ending  
Is all I need to keep on giving  
Walking down a one way street  
  
I had to be careful  
'cause it seemed that every guy that I'd meet  
Was looking just to have another one night stand  
But through your devotion  
I surrendered my emotion  
  
I'm giving you the best of me  
'cause I'm sure that we'll be  
(everlasting) everlasting (what a feeling)  
Just to know the love we've got is  
Everlasting and never ending  
Is all I need to keep on giving  
Everlasting love, oh, yeah  
  
(whoa, oh, oh)  
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a  
(everlasting love) uh, ha  
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Even though the cold wind's blowin'  
Nothing keeps our love from growin'  
Through the fire we will survive together  
Until the end of time  
  
(everlasting) whoa, oh (what a feeling)  
What a feeling, just to know the love we've got is  
(everlasting) everlasting (and never ending)  
And never ending  
Is all I need to keep on givin'  
(everlasting) scat (what a feeling)  
Our love's gonna grow  
Even through the fire, baby  
(everlasting) everlasting  
(and never ending) never ending  
  
Even though the cold wind's blowin'  
Nothing keeps our love from growing  
Through the fire we will survive together  
Until the end of time  
(everlasting, what a feeling) woo, woo, woo  
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a  
(everlasting) yes, it is (and never ending)  
Until the end of time  
And even through the fire, baby  
(everlasting) oh, yeah  
(what a feeling)  
  
Just to know that the love we've got is  
(everlasting) everlasting (never ending)  
What a feeling, oh, oh, oh  
You and me, (everlasting love)  
Babe, you and me, babe  
We got a connection (whoa, oh, oh)  
In the right direction, baby  
Just me and you, (everlasting love)  
Just you and m
