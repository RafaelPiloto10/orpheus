It all came so easy  
All the lovin' you gave me  
The feelings we shared  
And I still can remember  
How you touched me so tender  
You told me you cared  
We had a once in a lifetime  
But I just didn't see until it was gone  
A second once in a lifetime  
Maybe too much to ask but I swear from now on  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll love you much better  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll hold you forever  
This time we'll never end, oohooh  
Now I'm seein' clearly  
How I still need you near me  
I still love you so  
There's something between us  
That won't ever leave us  
There's no letting go  
We had a once in a lifetime  
But I just didn't know it till my life fell apart  
A second once in a lifetime  
Isn't too much to ask 'cause I swear from the heart  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll love you much better  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll hold you forever  
This time we'll never end  
Never end  
The best of romances  
Deserves second chances  
I'll get to you somehow  
'Cause I promise now  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll love you much better  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll hold you forever  
This time we'll never end  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll love you much better  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll hold you forever  
This time we'll never end  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll love you much better  
If ever you're in my arms again  
This time I'll hold you forever  
This time we'll never end  
(till fade)
