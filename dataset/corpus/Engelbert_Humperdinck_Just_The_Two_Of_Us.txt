I see the crystal raindrops fall  
And the beauty of it all when the sun comes shining through  
To make those rainbows in my mind  
When I think of you some time  
And I want to spend some time with you  
  
Just the two of us  
We can make it if we try  
Just the two of us  
Just the two of us  
Building castles in the sky  
Just the two of us  
You and I  
  
We look for love, no time for tears  
Wasted waters's all that is  
And it don't make no flowers grow  
Good things might come to those who wait  
Not to those who wait to late  
We got to go for all we know  
  
I hear the crystal raindrops fall  
On the window down the hall  
And it becomes the morning dew  
Darling, when the morning comes  
And I see the morning sun I want to be the one with you  
Just the two of us  
We can make it if we try  
Just the two of us  
Just the two of us  
Building big castles way on high  
Just the two of us  
You and I  
Just the two of us  
Let's get together, baby  
Just the two of us  
We can make it  
Just the two of us  
We can make it  
Just the two of us  
Just the two of us we can make it
