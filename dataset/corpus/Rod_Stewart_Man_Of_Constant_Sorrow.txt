I am a man of constant sorrow  
I've seen trouble all my days  
I'll say goodbye to Colorado  
Where I was born and prob'ly raised  
  
Your mother says I am a stranger  
My face you'll never see no more  
But there's one promise darling  
I'll see you on God's golden shore  
  
Through this open world I'm about to ramble  
Through ice, snow, sleet and rain  
I am about to rob the mornin' railroad  
Perhaps I'll die on that train  
  
I'm goin' back to Colorado  
Place that I started from  
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me  
Honey I never would have come
