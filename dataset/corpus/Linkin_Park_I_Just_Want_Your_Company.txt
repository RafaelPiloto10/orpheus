Ain't nothing working, ain't nothing right  
There's a whole in me, that I can't fill, no matter how hard I try  
Hey, hey, hey bartender, hit me with a double  
And introduce me to that girl with the bobble  
I'm looking for trouble tonight  
No momma don't trust me tonight  
You be the center baby, I'll be the quarter back  
High get the tail back, watchin all the play back  
Jaw smash, now heating now rambo  
Up in the hands all, biting on the cannibal  
I just want your company  
I want you to comfort me, just come with me  
Hey bartender, hit me with another  
I'm just about how to kill this brother  
I'm lookin for trouble tonight  
No momma don't trust me tonight  
You be the beauty baby, I'll be the beast  
Who give a fucker, take it to the bedroom  
Take it to the streets, take it like a man  
Mother fucker, yo bitch chose me, mother fucker  
I just want your company  
I want you to comfort me, just come with me  
I just want your company  
I want you to comfort me, just come with me  
Take me there, take me with you  
I can't be alone tonight  
I can't trust myself tonight  
I can't trust myself tonight  
Ladies don't trust me tonight  
Take me there, take me with you  
I can't be alone tonight  
I can't trust myself tonight  
I can't trust myself tonight  
No you can't trust me tonight  
Ain't nothing working, ain't nothing right  
There's a whole in me, that I can't fill, no matter how hard I try  
There ain't nothing sweeter, there ain't nothing wrong  
All the pain that I've received keeps me strong,  
It keeps me moving on  
I just want your company,  
I want you to comfort me,  
Just come with
