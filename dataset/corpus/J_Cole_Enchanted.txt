[J. Cole]  
Yea, this is where the  
Yea, this is where the fathers aint living  
At least not with us  
Might see em round the city and won't even say wassup  
When n-ggas play tough, wont even smile in mirrors  
And we learn to f-ck hoes off trial and error  
Just a small time n-gga, big city hustle  
Glued to the tv, Jigga, Diddy, Russell  
These were our heroes, strictly for them zero's  
For that Robert Deniro, n-ggas reload on them kilo's  
Dodgin them people,  
Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I'd rather not tell  
Shawty smole crack and her boyfriend too  
Sometimes he touch her daughter like them boyfriends do  
Pull up to the club where the boys went too  
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue  
A n-gga on a strecther and though I never met ya  
I'm thinking God Bless ya, they city try and get ya  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes, know the ropes lke a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue  
Your face on the front of our shirts saying we miss ya  
(We miss ya)  
  
Come with me,  
Run quick see, what do we have here  
Now, do you wanna ride or die  
La dadada, la la la la  
  
Come with me,  
Run quick see, what do we have here  
Now, do you wanna ride or die  
La dadada, la la la la  
  
[Omen]  
Yea, lets see God  
I know you only do what's best for me  
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny  
They always tellin' me it's temporary  
Than why it's feelling like a cemetary  
My dreams aint got no obituaries  
My city hurting and none of us were equiped here  
You heard me say I was ballin'  
I probably make tears  
I'm trying to get clear  
I'm tryna quit fear  
Who wrote the scripts here  
These kids live there whole life just killing time  
Running the race with no finish line  
They tryna noose us with they ropes  
But I'm tryna climb  
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide  
But I aint tryna go, no baby  
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope  
Cause I aint dying  
My words gon' last forever,  
You can hold the treasure  
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind  
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends, wiping they nose clean  
Is my neighbourhood just a smoke screen  
I think I'm in the [?] I see lo green  
Sons raised by bo queens but there's no kings  
(No kings, no kings)  
  
[J. Cole Hook]  
Come with me,  
Run quick see, what do we have here  
Now, do you wanna ride or die  
La dadada, la la la la  
  
Come with me,  
Run quick see, what do we have here  
Now, do you wanna ride or die  
La dadada, la la la la  
  
[J. Cole Verse 3]  
It seems like n-ggas either feel ya or they try and kill ya  
I face the sky and hope to God aint acting unfamiliar  
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar  
They tell me that it's God's will, I'm asking God will ya  
Iller a n-gga from artist pain, momma smoking cocaine as it rains out  
Am I to blame, try to stay sane so I came out-side  
Where they rock with them thangs out  
To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boys brains out  
But will it change, it's like n-ggas is free but our minds still in the chains  
Brothers killing eachother, the blood spill it's a shame  
Will it ever slow up  
A lot of n-ggas getting older but they never grow up  
And do they son's like they fathers did and never show up  
Don't even cry about it, just another episode of life  
Watch the season n-gga no re-runs  
The devil buying soul's n-gga no refunds  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue  
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya  
Another day, another song, a mother prays  
Another gone  
But still we play like aint nothing wrong  
Like aint nothing wrong  
Cause aint nothing wrong  
I'm not as fast, I'm not as tall  
But before I pass  
I gotta ball  
I gotta ball  
I gotta ball  
N-gga I gotta ball
