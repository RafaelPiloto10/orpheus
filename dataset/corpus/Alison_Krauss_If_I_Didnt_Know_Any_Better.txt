I turned around  
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind  
I know this is just a customary feelin'  
The moon is our deceiver that will leave you running blind  
  
Your heart is pullin'  
If I didn't know any better  
I'd be fallin'  
Deeper and deeper it's true  
I'd hear it callin'  
If I didn't know any better  
And I'd be in love with you  
  
Didn't want to  
Look in the eyes of the one that I would be drawn to  
I'm a moth lost in a fire  
And I know this is just a beautiful illusion, a case of the confusion, between
love and desire  
  
Your heart is pullin'  
If I didn't know any better  
I'd be fallin'  
Deeper and deeper it's true  
I'd hear it callin'  
If I didn't know any better  
And I'd be in love  
  
When the flame burns out  
And fine'ly settles down  
And you'd forget I ever came around  
  
Your heart is pullin'  
If I didn't know any better  
I'd be fallin'  
Deeper and deeper it's true  
I'd hear it callin'  
If didn't know any better  
And I'd be in love with you  
  
I turned around  
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind
