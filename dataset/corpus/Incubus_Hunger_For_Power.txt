Lyrics for Hunger For Power  
Performed by Incubus  
Rational human beings irrational in other ways  
Betraying each other in an unfriendly race  
All they do is think for themselves  
Ask them for some help and they'll tell you to go to Hell  
Welcome to the brutal world  
Vehemence, the way it goes  
Rejoicing for the disgrace of the successful one  
The jealousy is the weapon of the incompetent bum  
So if you think you've got your best frined  
You better look back, you never know what he might do next  
The anger is built in silence  
It's gonna cause some ignorant violence  
That's a goal rule number one  
To achieve in command  
What they've done in the past  
You're gonna let'em pay back  
I wonder why you do to others  
What you don't want them doing to you  
If prejudice has a value in life  
Evil would rule you too  
Remember for all the bad things you commit  
You're gonna pay with the same coin, you damn fool  
Breaking the barrier between patience and rage  
That are controlling you  
Now you're feeling what your best friend was going through  
That's the way the circle of life  
Has been for many years ago people are so greedy  
When they're in trouble, they look for you  
You can't lose this society battle  
Evil plans are coming to your mind  
To fight back, a sabotage  
That has happened many times  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you  
Hunger for power  
Stupid fight  
You better stand straight  
Or you might fall  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
You'll never know  
What might happen  
To us all  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you
