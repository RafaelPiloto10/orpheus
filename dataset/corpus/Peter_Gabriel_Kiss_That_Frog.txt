Jump in the water  
  
Sweet little princess, let me introduce his frogness  
You alone can get him singing,  
He's all puffed up, want to be your king  
  
Oh you can do it, c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon  
Lady kiss that frog  
  
Splash, dash, heard your call,  
Bring you back your golden ball  
He's gonna dive down in the deep end  
He's gonna be just like your best friend  
  
So what's one little kiss, one tiny little touch?  
Aah, he's wanting it so much  
  
I swear that this is royal blood, running through my skin  
Oh, can you see the state I'm in  
  
Kiss it better, kiss it better  
  
Get it into your head  
He's living with you he sleeps in your bed  
Can't you hear beyond the croaking  
Don't you know that I'm not joking  
  
Aah, you think you won't, I think you will  
Don't you know that this tongue can kill  
  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Lady kiss that frog  
  
Let him sit beside you, eat right off your plate  
You don't have to be afraid, there's nothing here to hate  
Princess, you might like it, if you lowered your defence  
Kiss that frog, and you will get your prince...  
  
Jump in the water, c'mon baby jump in with me  
Jump in the water, c'mon baby get wet, get wet, get wet  
Kiss that frog, lady kiss that frog  
Get wet, get wet
