There are many many crazy things  
That will keep me loving you  
And with your permission  
May I list a few  
  
The way you wear your hat  
The way you sip your tea  
The memory of all that  
No they can't take that away from me  
  
The way your smile just beams  
The way you sing off key  
The way you haunt my dreams  
No they can't take that away from me  
  
We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love  
But I'll always, always keep the memory of  
  
The way you hold your knife  
The way we danced till three  
The way you changed my life  
No they can't take that away from me
