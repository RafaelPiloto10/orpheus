This is the night of love  
The shining hour of Kalua  
Her song is in the air  
Her lips are waiting there  
Who will be Kalua's only love?  
  
Who will her lover be?  
Who will her lover be?  
  
Before the night is old  
My arms will hold Kalua  
And where the trandewinds blow  
Soft and low  
  
Our love will blossom bright  
In the night  
And stars will sing above  
The love song of Kalua
