How do you speak to an angel  
I'm completely in the dark  
When you know that you've just met an angel  
Is there a proper remark  
We were alone for a moment  
Why was I lost in a cloud  
Do you speak to an angel in a whisper  
Or do you just say I love you out loud  
We were alone for a moment  
Why was I lost in a cloud  
Do you speak to an angel in a whisper  
Or do you just say I love you out loud
