As I was motivating back towards town  
I seen a Cadillac sign, it said no money down  
So I eased on the brake, and I pulled up there in the drive  
I gunned up the motor and then I walked on inside  
The dealer came down and said man trade that Ford

Now you just tell me what you want  
And then sign on this line

In about an hour's time

And I'm gonna head on down the road  
Ain't gonna have to worry no more
