I seen these big shots all come and go  
Been there myself and there's one thing I know  
You got to choose your heroes, choose them well  
They could be leading you straight into hell  
Let me be your protection  
Keep the vampires off your neck  
Sample your wine and  
Stay so near that you'll never have a thing to fear  
Get thee behind me Satan  
Big as a mountain, strong as a diamond  
Rock love  
Bright as a nova burning forever  
Rock love  
Close as a heart beat, free as the water  
Rock love  
Get thee behind me Satan  
I see the same damn faces in the news  
Taking up sides when there ain't nothing to choose  
I think their game is just designed to confuse  
They cut the pie up and the rest of us lose  
Let me be your adviser  
Keep the monkeys off your back  
Figure your taxes  
Stay up all night making sure that everything is right  
Get thee behind me Satan  
It seems like only yesterday  
Remember when I used to say  
I knew we'd be in vogue someday  
Rock love is love and not fade away  
Lord you got to rock on  
Got to rock steady  
Spinning on the rock of love  
Can you feel it  
Hard as a rock, strong as a rock  
Put your hands on the rock  
You've got the rockin' steady now  
I looking for a life like the rock
