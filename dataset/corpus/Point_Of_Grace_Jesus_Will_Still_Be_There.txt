Things change, plans fail  
You look for love on a grander scale  
Storms rise, hopes fade  
And you place your bets on another day  
When the going gets tough  
When the ride's too rough  
When you're just not sure enough  
  
[Chorus]  
Jesus will still be there  
His love will never change  
Sure as the steady rain  
Jesus will still be there  
When no one else is true  
He'll still be loving you  
When it looks like you've lost it all  
And you haven't got a prayer  
Jesus will still be there  
  
Time flies, hearts turn  
A little bit wiser from lessons learned  
But sometimes, weakness wins  
And you lose your foothold once again  
When the going gets tough  
When the ride's too rough  
When you're just not sure enough  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
When it looks like you've lost it all  
And you haven't got a prayer  
Jesus will still be there
