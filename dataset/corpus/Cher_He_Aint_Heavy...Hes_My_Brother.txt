The road is long,  
With many a winding turn  
That leads us to  
Who knows where, who knows where  
But I'm strong, strong enough to carry him  
He ain't heavy, he's my brother  
  
So on we go,  
His welfare is my concern  
No burden is he to bare,  
We'll get there  
For I know he would not encumber me  
He ain't heavy, he's my brother  
  
If I'm laden at all,  
I'm laden with sadness  
That everyone's heart isn't filled  
With gladness of love for one another  
It's a long long road  
From which there is no return  
While we're on our way to there, why not share  
And the load,  
It doesn't weigh me down at all  
He ain't heavy, he's my brother  
He ain't heavy, he's my brother,  
He's my brother, he's my brother
