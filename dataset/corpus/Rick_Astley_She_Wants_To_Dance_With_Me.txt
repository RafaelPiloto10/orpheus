She wants to dance  
She wants to dance  
Hoo!  
She wants to dance with me  
Mmm, mmm, mmm  
  
There's a girl I've been waiting to see  
And I really get the feeling that she likes me  
'Cause she said so, but not in so many words  
I've got to tell you what I heard  
  
She don't want no wild romance  
When she's with me she only wants to dance  
  
[Chorus:]  
She wants to dance with me  
'Cause I hold her so tight next to me  
She wants to dance with me  
'Cause I let her be what she wants to be  
  
Now I know I've been out of touch  
But I never meant to hurt my baby oh so much  
'Cause I love her and i think she loves me  
And that's the way it's got to be  
  
When we're together we never fight  
We've got better things to do tonight  
  
She wants to dance with me  
'Cause I hold her so tight next to me  
She wants to dance with me  
'Cause I let her be what she wants to be  
  
She wants to dance  
She wants to dance  
  
[Chorus To Fade]
