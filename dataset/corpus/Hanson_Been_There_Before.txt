There?s a down town corner  
People down town know  
And a beat rhythm on the radio  
And the girl who listens to a young mans song  
On the block I live on  
In the place I?m from  
Well the young man sitting  
On the dock of the bay  
He took a long-term trip on a first class plane  
Now the whole world listens  
To that one mans song  
On the block I live on  
In the place I?m from  
Tell me does it move you  
Does it soothe you  
Does it fill your heart and soul with the  
Roots of rock and roll  
Does it move you  
Does it soothe you  
Does it fill your heart  
And soul with the roots of rock and roll  
Well the man in black sits  
On a screened in porch  
Making birthday wishes, 71 almost  
You can hear him singing chariot  
Swing low  
On the block I live on  
In the place I know  
Tell me does it move you  
Does it soothe you  
Does it fill your heart and soul with the  
Roots of rock and roll  
Does it move you  
Does it soothe you  
Does it fill your heart and soul with the  
Roots of rock and roll  
Tell me does it move you  
Does it soothe you  
Does it fill your heart and soul with the  
Roots of rock and roll  
Does it move you  
Does it soothe you  
Does it fill your heart and soul with the  
Roots of rock and roll  
Na na na na na na, I?ve been there before  
Na na na na na na, I?ve been there before  
Na na na na na na, I?ve been there before  
Na na na na na na, I?ve been there before  
When you can't get through it  
You can listen to it  
With a na na na na  
Well I?ve been there before  
When you can't get through it  
You can listen to it  
With a na na na na  
Well I?ve been there before
