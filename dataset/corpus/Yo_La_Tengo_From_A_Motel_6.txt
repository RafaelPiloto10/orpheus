You shouldn't hide but you always do  
Cause even when you're gone, I can see right through  
You want disconnection  
You want me there enough for two  
pull a woollen blanket across my eyes  
Dream a quiet place for us to fight  
Oh no, your heart is broken  
Don't you think that's a little trite?  
I climb where I can see  
You're close but I won't reach  
Blank stare at the tv  
CNN's on channel 3  
in the passing lane on 1 and 9  
Stuck in sad, car stuck in drive  
Oh no, your heart is broken  
Well, you can have what's left of mine  
I climb where I can see  
You're close but I won't reach  
Blank stare at the TV  
The howling II's on channel 3  
Oh, I drift off to sleep  
While the snow falls on the screen
