(Sexual, sexual, irresistible)  
(Sexual, sexual, irresistible)  
I thought about it  
Me and you  
It's time to make my move  
Somethin' good  
Is goin' on  
A phenomenon  
I'm not that kind of girl to be so sexual  
Maybe it's physical but I don't care  
This time I'm letting go  
So turn the lights down low  
I'm gonna move it slow  
And I won't let go  
We're gonna ride it, ride it  
Keep it goin' on  
Til the break of dawn  
Baby all night long  
We're gonna ride it, ride it  
No doubt about it  
I can't deny  
The way you make me feel  
Let's not imagine  
It's no dream  
It's somethin' real  
I never thought that love could be so sexual  
But now I'm here with you and I'm not scared  
To let my feelings show  
Repeat chorus  
I thought about it  
Me and you  
It's time to make my move  
Somethin' good  
Is goin' on  
A phenomenon  
I'm not that kind of girl to be so sexual  
Maybe it's physical but I don't care  
I'm not letting go  
Repeat chorus
