Fly me - my hands are free  
Won't you fly me  
  
Look towards what you're dreaming of  
Write it down and look above  
For something that will tell you I watch you  
I'm looking for to do  
  
Won't you fly me - my hands are  
Won't you fly me  
  
Picture floating in a silent row  
Crying out for those who've never learnt  
That life is just a story you pass through  
While dreaming what to do  
  
Won't you fly me  
Won't you please fly me  
Won't you please fly me  
  
Won't you fly me...
