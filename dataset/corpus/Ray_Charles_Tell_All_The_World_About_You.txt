When I need company  
I call on you to see about me  
I wanna walk about it, talk about it  
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you  
  
When you're with me there's so much fun  
You're all the good things all wrapped in one  
I wanna walk about it, talk about it  
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you  
  
Woah, I wanna walk, walk about  
I wanna talk, talk about  
I wanna tell, wanna tell the world all about you  
  
Oh, I wanna live, just for you  
I'm gonna give, love so true  
We'll have a love, we'll have a love that's fine and new  
  
Oh, you're so fine and you're so sweet  
You're better at love than a K.B.B  
I wanna walk about it, talk about it  
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you  
  
Woah, I wanna walk, walk about  
I wanna talk, talk about  
I wanna tell, wanna tell the world all about you  
  
Oh, I gonna live, just for you  
I'm gonna give, love so true  
We'll have a love, we'll have a love that's fine and new  
  
Oh, you're so fine and you're so sweet  
You're better at love than a K.B.B  
I wanna walk about it, talk about it  
Tell all the world about, tell all the world about, oh  
Tell the world about you, tell the world about you
