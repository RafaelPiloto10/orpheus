Beautiful Star of Bethlehem  
Shining afar through shadows dim  
Giving the light to those who long have gone  
Guiding the Wise Men on their way  
Unto the place where Jesus lay  
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on  
  
Oh Beautiful Star (Beautiful, Beautiful Star)  
Of Bethlehem (Star of Bethlehem)  
Shine upon us until the glory dawns  
Give us the light to light the way  
Unto the land of perfect day  
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on  
  
Beautiful Star the hope of light  
Guiding the pilgrims through the night  
Over the mountains 'til the break of dawn  
Into the light of perfect day  
It will give out a lovely ray  
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on  
  
Oh Beautiful Star (Beautiful, Beautiful Star)  
Of Bethlehem (Star of Bethlehem)  
Shine upon us until the glory dawns  
Give us the light to light the way  
Unto the land of perfect day  
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on  
  
Beautiful Star the hope of rest  
For the redeemed, the good and the blessed  
Yonder in glory when the crown is won  
Jesus is now that star divine  
Brighter and brighter He will shine  
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on  
  
Oh Beautiful Star (Beautiful, Beautiful Star)  
Of Bethlehem (Star of Bethlehem)  
Shine upon us until the glory dawns  
Give us the light to light the way  
Unto the land of perfect day  
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on
