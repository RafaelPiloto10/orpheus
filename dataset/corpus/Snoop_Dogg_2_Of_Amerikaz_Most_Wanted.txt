Up out of there  
  
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party  
  
Pump that up G  
  
Ah shit, you done fucked up now  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
You done put two of America's  
Most wanted in the same  
Motherfucking place at the same  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Motherfucking time,  
Y'all niggas about to feel this  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Break out the champagne glasses  
And the motherfucking condoms  
Have one on us alright??  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
  
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture  
Bomb the hoochies with precision my intention's to get richer  
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fucking homey  
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs  
  
Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun, cause they got me on the run  
Now I'm back in the courtroom waiting on the outcome  
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggas mind  
But at the same time it seem they trying to take mine  
So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit  
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit  
  
So now they got us laced  
Two multimillionaire motherfuckers catching cases  
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down  
Me and Snoop about to clown  
I'm "Losing My Religion", I'm vicious on these stool pigeons  
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missing  
Niggas be acting like they savage, they out to get the cabbage  
I got, nothing but love, for my niggas living lavish  
  
I got a pit named P, she niggarino  
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino  
And I, think I got a black Beamer  
But my dream is to own a fly casino  
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal  
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal  
It feel good to you baby bubba  
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker  
  
Now follow as we ride  
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side  
And I can make you famous  
Niggas been dying for years, so how could they blame us  
I live in fear of a felony  
I never stop bailing these, motherfucking G's  
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant  
2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Nothing but a gangsta party...  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Nothing but a gangsta party  
It ain't nothing but a  
Motherfucking gangsta party  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
Nuthing but a gangsta party  
It ain't nothing but a  
Motherfucking gangsta party  
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party  
  
Now give me fifty feet  
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets  
And keep whatever's left of me  
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief  
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me  
I bust and flea, these niggas must be crazy what??  
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the thugs  
(right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear  
Bow down in the presence of a boss player  
  
It's like cause, blood, gang banging  
Everybody in the party doing dope slanging  
You got to have papers in this world  
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swirl  
Ya doing ya job, every day  
And then you work so hard til ya hair turn gray  
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is  
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids  
  
They tell me not to roll with my glock  
So now I gotta throw away  
Floating in the black Benz, trying to do a show a day  
They wonder how I live, with five shots  
Niggas is hard to kill, on my block  
Schemes for currency and doe related  
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it  
No answers to questions, I'm trying to get up on it  
My nigga dogg with me, eternally the most wanted  
  
[Chorus]
