Early in the mornin' when the sun come up  
You'll find me sittin' at the table, drinkin' from a wooden cup  
The mortgage is a comin' tryin' to take my home away  
I'm not gonna let it turn my head away  
It won't be right  
No matter what they say  
Won't be right  
Tryin' to take my home away  
Won't be right  
If they do this thing to me  
I don't have to take it  
And I really don't want to see  
  
Early in the evenin' long about supper time  
There's nothin' left here for me but a bottle of wine  
I'm gonna be evicted along about the hour of five  
Well, it's enough to make me wonder why I'm alive  
  
It won't be right  
No matter what they say  
Won't be right  
Tryin' to take my home away  
Won't be right  
If they do this thing to me  
I don't have to take it  
And I really don't want to see
