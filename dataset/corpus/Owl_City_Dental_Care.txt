I brush my teeth and look in the mirror,  
And laugh out loud,  
As I'm beaming from ear to ear,  
I'd rather pick flowers instead of fights,  
And rather than flaunt my style I'd flash you a smile  
Of clean pearly whites.  
  
I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill,  
I smooth my hair,  
Sit back in the chair  
But somehow I still get the chills  
  
Have a seat he says pleasantly,  
As he shakes my hand and practically laughs at me,  
"Open up nice and wide" he says peering in,  
And with a smirk he says "don't have a fit,  
This will just pinch a bit"  
As he tries not to grin.  
  
When hygienists  
Leave on long vacations  
That's when dentists scream and  
Lose their patience  
  
Talking only brings the toothaches on because  
I say the stupidest things  
So if my results go south, I swallow my pride with an aspirin and shut my
mouth  
  
Golf and alcohol don't mix  
And that's why I don't drink and drive  
Because good grief  
I'd knock out my teeth  
And have to kiss my smile goodbye  
  
I've been to the dentist a thousand times  
So I know the drill,  
I smooth my hair,  
Sit back in the chair  
But some how I still get the chills
