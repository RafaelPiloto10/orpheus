You keepin on a holdin',  
A holdin' on a keepin,  
No giving into taking more but still still feedin',  
You keepin on a holdin',  
A-holdin' on a-keepin,  
No giving into taking more but still still feedin',  
You're clearly disturbed,  
All you want is allegiance  
Hear them what you saw  
You hear them what you saw  
You hear them what you saw  
You hear them with believin'  
Oh holy holy water washing over the soul  
  
Collecting all the people you love to sing you a song  
Even if they stick to humming  
Holding on a song to see them  
When you're really sick-a sick-a sick of love  
Leaving with their heart  
To shape them within  
Even if they stay to running  
Hold 'em on the soul, believing  
Till you wanna stick-a stick-a stick to love  
  
When you went down, the men came callin'  
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin  
When you went down, the men came callin'  
Speaking in tongues we've all been summoned.  
Ride, you wait to hug the shoal, you hate the thought, you're so-so.  
You seem so dark to cry.  
  
Oh, we're ready, honey  
I got all the skills  
You've given all our love for you  
Everything you taught me honey  
It never even mattered, really  
It's all about my love for you  
  
With you in my head  
With you in my head  
With you in my head  
  
When you went down, the men came callin'  
Faded in stone as you wept from fallin  
When you went down, the men came callin'  
Singing in tongues, it makes things summoned.  
  
Oh, we're ready, honey  
I got all the skills  
You've given all our love for you  
Everything you taught me honey  
It never even mattered, really  
It's all about my love for you  
  
I hope that I'm ready, honey  
I got all the skills  
You've given all our love for you  
Everything you taught me honey  
It never even mattered, really  
It's all about my love for you
