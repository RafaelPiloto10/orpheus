What at you looking at?  
  
Strike a pose  
Strike a pose  
Vogue, vogue, vogue  
Vogue, vogue, vogue  
  
Look around  
Everywhere  
You turn  
Is heartache  
It's everywhere  
That you go  
(Look around)  
You try everything  
You can to escape  
The pain of life  
That you know  
(Life that you know)  
  
When all else fails  
And you long to be  
Something better  
Than you are today  
I know a place  
Where you  
Can get away  
It's called  
A dance floor  
And here's  
What it's for  
So  
  
Chorus:  
Come on, vogue  
Let your body  
Move to the music  
(Move to the music)  
Hey, hey, hey  
Come on, vogue  
Let your body go  
With the flow  
(Go with the flow)  
You know you can do it  
  
All you need  
Is your own imagination  
So use it  
That's what it's for  
(That's what it's for)  
Go inside  
For your  
Finest inspiration  
Your dreams  
Will open the door  
(Open up the door)  
  
It makes no difference  
If you're black or white  
If you're a boy or a girl  
If the music's pumping it  
Will give you new life  
You're a superstar  
Yes  
That's what you are  
You know it  
  
Come on, vogue  
Let your body  
Groove to the music  
(Groove to the music)  
Hey, hey, hey  
Come on, vogue  
Let your body go  
With the flow  
(Go with the flow)  
You know you can do it  
  
Beauty's  
Where you find it  
Not just where you bump  
And grind it  
Soul is in the musical  
That's where  
I feel so beautiful  
Magical, life's a ball  
So get up  
On the dance floor  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Vogue  
(Vogue)  
Beauty's  
Where you find it  
(Move to the music)  
Vogue  
(Vogue)  
Beauty's  
Where you find it  
(Go with the flow)

There's nothing to it

Let your body  
Move to the music  
Oooh  
You've got to just

With the flow  
Oooh  
You've got to
