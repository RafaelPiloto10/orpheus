Nothin' is shakin'  
Nothin' but me and the rent  
Jesus is breaking  
Why'm I back here again?  
Can't find my soul, oh no  
Not since I don't know when  
Lost in a hurricane  
Still I go on  
  
Nothin' is shakin'  
Nothin' but me and the rent  
My heart is aching  
I'm 'bout as bad as it gets  
I love you because I need to  
Not 'cause I needed you  
Lost in a hurricane  
Strugglin' on  
  
Mama! Salvami l'anima  
Mama! Salvami l'anima  
Mama! Salvami l'anima  
Mama! Saving my soul for me  
Saving my soul for me  
  
Nothin' is shakin'  
Nothin' but me and the rent  
Not 'cause I'm breaking  
I'm on my knees here again  
Madre dolcissima  
Caress my aching head  
Lost in a hurricane  
But I go on  
  
Mama! Salvami l'anima?  
Jesus is breaking  
Jesus is breaking  
Jesus is breaking  
Jesus is breaking  
Mama! Salvami l'anima?
