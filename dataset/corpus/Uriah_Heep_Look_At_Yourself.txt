I see you running  
Don't know what  
You're running from  
Nobody's coming  
What'd you do that was so wrong  
  
Look back and turn back  
Look at yourself  
Don't be afraid, just  
Look at yourself  
  
If you need assistance  
Or if all you need is love  
There's no point in hiding  
Tell me what you're frightened of  
  
You've got a friend, just  
Look at yourself  
Don't be afraid, just  
Look at yourself
