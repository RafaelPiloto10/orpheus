Don't be sad 'cause your sun is down, you can rise above it.  
Don't be sad 'cause you're on your own, you have to learn to love it.  
Don't be sad 'cause your sun is down, you're gonna find your way.  
Don't be sad 'cause your day is done, there's another day, everyday,  
Everyday I wake up just the same, waiting for something new.  
Every night I have myself to blame for the dreams that haven't come true.  
But especially today I'm feeling blue.  
  
Don't be sad 'cause your son is down, little mama he's bound to feel it.  
Don't be sad 'cause your boy is blue, it wouldn't do to conceal it from you.  
Don't be sad 'cause your sun is down, the night doesn't need your sorrow.  
Don't be sad 'cause the light is gone, just keep your mind on tomorrow and
carry on.  
Everyday I wake up just the same, waiting for something new.  
Every night I have myself to blame for the dreams that haven't come true.  
But especially today I'm feeling blue.
