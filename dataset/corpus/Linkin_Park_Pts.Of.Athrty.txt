Yo, yo  
Forfeit the game, before somebody takes you out of the frame  
Put your name to shame, cover up your face  
You can't run the race, the pace is too fast, you just won't last  
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last,  
Won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last, won't last, won't
last,  
Won't last, won't last  
  
You love the way, I look at you  
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through  
You take away if I give in  
My life, my pride, is broken  
  
You like to think you're never wrong  
(You like to think you're never wrong)  
You have to act like you're someone  
(You have to act like you're someone)  
You want someone to hurt like you  
(You want someone to hurt like you)  
You want to share what you've been through  
(You live what you've learned)  
Learned, learned, learned, learned, learned  
  
You love the things, I say I'll do  
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you  
You take away, when I give in  
My life, my pride, is broken  
  
You like to think you're never wrong  
(You like to think you're never wrong)  
You have to act like you're someone  
(You have to act like you're someone)  
You want someone to hurt like you  
(You want someone to hurt like you)  
You wanna' share what you've been through  
(You live what you've learned)
