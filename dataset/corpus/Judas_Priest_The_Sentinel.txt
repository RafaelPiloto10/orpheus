Along deserted avenues  
Steam begins to rise  
The figures primed and ready  
Prepared for quick surprise  
He's watchin' for a sign  
His life is on the line  
Dogs whine in the alleys  
Smoke is on the wind  
From deep inside its empty shell  
A cathedral bell begins to toll  
A storm begins to grow  
  
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars  
The challengers await  
And in their fists clutch iron bars  
With which to seal his fate  
Across his chest is scabbards rest  
The rows of throwing knives  
Whose razor points in challenged tests  
Have finished many lives  
  
Now facing one another  
The stand-off eats at time  
Then all at once a silence falls  
As the bell ceases its chime  
Upon this sign the challengers  
With shrieks and cries rush forth  
The knives fly out like bullets  
Upon their deadly course  
Screams of pain and agony  
Rent the silent air  
Amidst the dying bodies  
Blood runs everywhere  
The figure stands expressionless  
Impassive and alone  
Unmoved by this victory  
And the seeds of death he's sown  
  
Sworn to avenge  
Condemn to Hell  
Tempt not the blade  
All fear the Sentinel
