(Ferry)  
  
If there is something  
That I might find  
Look around corners  
Try to find peace of mind,  
I say  
"Where would you go  
If you were me?  
Trying to keep a straight course  
Is not easy"  
  
Somebody special  
Looking at me  
Same kind of reaction  
Wanted to cry with me  
If there are many  
Too easy to say  
When it's love  
It's just a game-ame-ame-ame  
  
I would do anything for you  
I would come all day  
I would swim all the oceans blue  
I would walk a thousand miles  
Reveal my secrets  
More than enough for me to share  
I will put roses around your door  
Sit in the garden  
Growing potatoes by the score  
  
Shake your head girl,  
With your ponytail  
Takes me right back  
[when you were young]  
Throw your precious gifts into the air  
Watch them fall down  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
It used to fall apart  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The hills were higher  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The trees were taller then  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The grass was greener  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
It used to fall apart  
[when you were young]
