Marijuana, Marijuana, fuck  
Twenty pounds in the trunk  
Momma been growin' that skunk  
Green room looks like a warzone  
Dirty water drips from the hydro pumps  
Daddy got me sweepin' leaves  
Pickin' up shake,  
Makin' tea, brownies, cookies,  
Serving all the hippies  
Nickel sacks  
Bet, hit me Dixie boy  
Smoker's toy  
Paraphonilia, you enjoy  
Grow it pack it then deploy  
Summertime job, come get employed  
Evidence destroyed  
Family biz evidently boy  
Duckin' in the police boy  
All for the love of  
  
Marijuana  
Growin' it up  
Cut it down  
Pack it up  
Pass it around  
Everybody loves some  
Marijuana  
Makes you happy  
Feelin' stupid  
Girls get horny  
When they use it  
Everybody smokes some  
Marijuana  
  
Can't get caught by the Rosco  
So we stuffin' this green like a taco  
Feelin' like we hit a brick lotto  
Putting dents in the street like a pot hole  
We pot hold, in the backwoods  
Two tone box Chevy with the black hood  
Seats come out all packed up  
P's for the 18 like a Mac truck  
You a dope boy? So what  
If I gave you my connect  
You'd blow up  
Sawed off layin' flat on the sofa  
They'll twist that lid like a soda  
Uncle Critter putting plugs on the motor  
We gotta get to Tennessee no holdups  
We ain't getting rich bitch  
  
We getting over  
All for the love of  
  
Marijuana  
Growin' it up  
Cut it down  
Pack it up  
Pass it around  
Everybody loves some  
Marijuana  
Makes you happy  
Feeling stupid  
Girls get horny  
When they use it  
Everybody smokes some  
Marijuana  
  
Crowbar sits in the carjack  
Fill the gas tank up with a fun pack  
Son I don't wanna see you til' you come back  
If you get caught, you know where the money's at  
Throwing loose rocks on a dirt road  
Police on your throat like a chokehold  
Rollin' through town with a boatload  
I'm feelin' like a trailer park mogul  
Sweat can't roll down the windows  
'Cause the doors jammed up with the elbows  
I think I see cops, I can't tell though  
If I ride too close, they'll smell dope  
My phone blowin' up, I promise  
They waitin' on the package from the runner  
I made enough just for the summer  
All for the love of  
  
Marijuana  
Growin' it up  
Cut it down  
Pack if up  
Pass it around  
Everybody loves some  
Marijuana  
Makes you happy  
Feelin' stupid  
Girls get horny  
When they use it  
Everybody smokes some  
Marijuana
