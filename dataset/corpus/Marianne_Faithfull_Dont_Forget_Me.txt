In the wintertime  
Keep your feet warm,  
Keep your clothes on  
And don't forget me.  
Keep the memory,  
But keep your powder dry, too.  
  
In the summer  
By the pool side  
While the fireflies  
Are all around me,  
I'll miss you when I'm lonely,  
I'll miss the alimony, too.  
  
Don't forget me, please don't forget me,  
Make it easy on me just for a little while.  
You know I'll think about you,  
Let me know you think about me, too.  
  
When we're older  
And full of cancer  
It doesn't matter now,  
Come on, get happy,  
'Cause nothing lasts forever,  
And I will always love you.  
  
Don't forget me, please don't forget me,  
Make it easy on me just for a little while.  
You know I'll think about you,  
Let me know you think about me, too.  
  
You know I'll think about you,  
Let me know you think about me, too.
