Lookout boy your bound to change  
You can't ever stay the same  
Cause if ya keep on sayin the same ol'lies  
Your gonna look around boy and find  
Yourself outta time  
Watchout girl the words you say  
Don't really fit the play  
Somebody else you might talk to now  
And knows what ya say and what ya mean  
But don't help this time  
CHORUS  
You might say that you ain't  
Got a, hold on yourself  
You might say that you only try your best  
You might say that you only need a rest  
You might say you can only fool yourself  
Fool yourself, fool yourself  
Don't believe the words you read  
Their written on the street  
Evry time you try to lay their game  
Their gonna knock you down  
And take your pride away  
See how bad you need to cry  
But no matter how hard you try  
Its the same old story once again  
You always hide from the one  
Who calls you friend  
I call you friend  
Repeat Chorus  
Fool yourself 3-5x and fades out
