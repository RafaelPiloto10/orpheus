In the hills above Freno  
By a shiny mountain stream  
A young man laid where he fell  
In the ruins of his dreams  
He looked into the sky  
Happy to see that the dawn was slowly breaking  
And the women knelt beside him  
Consuela Biaz  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Consuela Biaz she knelt there and gently  
She bathed his wounds  
And he kissed her trembling fingers  
Consuela Biaz  
  
In the town San Domingo  
As we laughed and danced all night  
To the thrub of flamingo guitars  
Seemed a long long way from tomorrow's fight  
He came from over the sea  
Full of the passion of when  
You were born to be free  
From the Valley of Ronda  
Consuela Biaz  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Consuela Biaz from the Valley of Ronda  
To the hills above Freno  
Just to die against her shoulder  
Consuela Biaz  
  
I'm sorry if I have failed you
