The walls of this hotel are paper-thin  
Last night I heard you making love to him  
The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb  
The grunt of unity when he came in  
I stood there with my ear against the wall  
I was not seized by jealousy at all  
In fact a burden lifted from my soul  
I heard that love was out of my control  
A heavy burden lifted from my soul  
I heard that love was out of my control  
  
I listened to your kisses at the door  
I never heard the world so clear before  
You ran your bath and you began to sing  
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing  
  
I stood there with my ear against the wall  
  
And I can't wait to tell you to your face  
And I can't wait for you to take my place  
You are The Naked Angel In My Heart  
You are The Woman With Her Legs Apart  
It's written on the walls of this hotel  
You go to heaven once you've been to hell  
  
A heavy burden lifted from my soul  
I heard that love was out of my control
