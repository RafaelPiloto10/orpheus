If this person that you see  
Seems a little blurred,  
It's cause I'm not all here,  
But not quite there.  
And if it's like forever  
That you're talkin' to yourself  
It's not that I feel different  
I'm just somewhere else  
  
If I lack a certain etiquette  
Break all the social laws  
This door is off it's hinges now  
But the choice is yours.  
  
If I don't seem focused  
Maybe not quite right.  
If I seem a little distant  
Maybe I'm outta sight  
If everytime we speak  
You seem to draw a blank  
It's the ghost of my ex-friends  
That you have to thank  
  
If I lack a certain etiquette  
Break all the social laws  
This door is off it's hinges now  
But the choice is yours.  
  
Free for the free ride  
That was always given to you  
Fought for forgiveness  
Cause Marx forgave you too  
  
And all for almighty god  
Cause god, my aim was true  
And full stop for the candle now  
And the friendship that you blew  
That you blew  
  
Whenever you dig deeper  
You just run against the wall  
It's cause they ripped my soul apart  
That's all  
If I can't quite place your name  
Your face I don't recall  
No doubt you know mine is:  
Mr. Free For All.  
  
If I lack a certain etiquette  
Break all the social laws  
This door is off it's hinges now  
But the choice is yours.  
  
Free for the free ride  
That was always given to you  
Fought for forgiveness  
Cause Marx forgave you too  
  
And all for almighty god  
Cause god, my aim was true  
And full stop for the candle now  
And the friendship that you blew  
That you blew
