I could hold my head up high  
And say that I left first  
Or I can hang my head and cry  
Tell me which is worse  
  
If you go and ask her why  
She might say she's not sure  
Trust me when I tell you why,  
I'm not good enough for her  
  
I want her to be happy  
I want her to be free  
I want her to be everything,  
She couldn't be with me  
  
I'd wait here for a thousand years,  
If she'd come back to me  
I have everything she wants,  
And nothing that she needs  
  
I want her to be happy  
I want her to be free  
I want her to be everything,  
She couldn't be with me  
  
I could hold me head up high  
And say that I left first  
Or I can hang my head and cry  
Tell me which is worse  
  
If you go and ask her why  
She might say she's not sure  
Trust me when I tell you why,  
I'm not good enough for her
