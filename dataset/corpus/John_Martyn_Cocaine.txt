Did you hear a story about Cocaine Lil?  
She had a cocaine house on cocaine hill  
She had a cocaine dog and a cocaine cat  
She even had a cocaine rat  
And it's all round my brain  
Been walking round 10th Street and Main  
I've been looking for a girlie to give me cocaine  
Cocaine's sure running round my brain  
Been strolling round 10th Street and Main  
Been looking for someone to give me cocaine  
Cocaine's sure running round my brain  
Well, Cocaine Lil and Morphine Sue  
They've been strolling down the avenue two by two  
Says Lil to Sue, ''It's gonna do no harm  
If we both have a little old shot in the arm''  
And it's all round my veins, oh cocaine  
Doctor tell me again and again  
He say, ''Cocaine's forces ain't for men''  
Cocaine's sure running round my brain  
You know the doctor tell me, tell me again and again  
He say, ''Cocaine'll kill you son, it won't say when''  
Cocaine's sure running round my brain  
Yonder's baby, she's dressed in white  
I said, ''Hey now mama, gonna stay all night''  
Cocaine's sure running round my brain  
Now there runs my baby, she's all dressed in black  
You said you know I didn't mean it, won't you please come back  
Cocaine's sure running round my brain  
Hey baby, please come quick  
This old cocaine's making me sick  
Cocaine's sure running round my brain
