Well I wear my clothes like this because I can  
And I wear my hair like this because I can  
And I walk around like this because I can  
And I do my thing like this because it's who I am  
  
Pre chorus:  
And if you're respecting me to give you an apology  
Be nothing that you used to, used to  
Go round on the head away  
Hold your breath and concentrate  
Keep hold your face until you turn to, turn to  
  
Chorus:  
My road it ain't your road I trust I know  
And I know just where I'm going, hey  
And my flow it ain't your flow  
But trust I know  
I know just how I'm flowing  
And I'ma do my thing  
I'ma do my, I'ma do my thing  
Please feel to ehar it from... Complaining  
But I'ma do my thing  
I'ma do my thing  
Say whatever you want  
But this will ain't gonna change  
I'ma do my thing  
Keep doing what you do and I'ma do my thing  
  
Hey I came with my clothes are you because I'm not  
I can't do my hair like because I'm not  
I can't walk around like you because I'm not  
I can't do my hair like you because I'm high  
  
Pre chorus:  
And if you're respecting me to give you an apology  
Be nothing that you used to, used to  
Go round on the head away  
Hold your breath and concentrate  
Keep hold your face until you turn to, turn to  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You don't know where I'm going  
And so you think I'm lost  
I ain't on your page okay  
So that means I'm off  
When I'm... To the beat of the drum  
... And the problem must be you and me  
And regular but not... Element  
... Wherever not cool  
You're not from my... Well give me what I don't get you  
Either... So if I'm gonna do fast and you up  
And mine is...  
  
[Chorus:]
