Please forget the words that I just blurted out  
It wasn't me, it was a strange and creeping doubt  
It keeps rattling my cage  
There's nothing in this world will keep it down  
  
Even though I might,  
Even though I try,  
I can't  
  
So many things that keep, keep me underground  
So many words that I, that I can never find  
  
If you give up on me now,  
I'll be gutted like I've never been before  
  
Even though I might,  
Even though I try,  
I can't
