I feel uptight on a Saturday night  
Nine o' clock, the radio's the only light  
I hear my song and it pulls me through  
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do  
I got to  
  
Get up  
Everybody's gonna move their feet  
Get down  
Everybody's gonna leave their seat  
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City  
  
Get up  
Everybody's gonna move their feet  
Get down  
Everybody's gonna leave their seat  
  
Getting late  
I just can't wait  
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road  
First I drink, then I smoke  
Start the car, and I try to make the midnight show  
  
Get up  
Everybody's gonna move their feet  
Get down  
Everybody's gonna leave their seat  
  
Movin' fast, doin' ninety five  
Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow  
I feel so good, I'm so alive  
I hear my song playin' on the radio  
It goes  
  
Get up  
Everybody's gonna move their feet  
Get down  
Everybody's gonna leave their seat  
  
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock  
There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes  
Oh my God, no time to turn  
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die  
Why  
  
Get up  
Everybody's gonna move their feet  
Get up  
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
