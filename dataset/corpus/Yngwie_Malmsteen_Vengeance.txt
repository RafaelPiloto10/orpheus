Take what you want, the you'll get what you need  
Isn't that all that we're teaching  
Slowly but surely we're planting the seed  
Hey listen, there's no use in preaching  
  
All these years you've turned away  
Nothing left to say  
  
Vengeance  
You haven't a clue  
Vengeance  
It's inside of you  
  
All of the sinners, they're playing their game  
Only the good people listen  
Over and over it's always the same  
Committing the crime, and yet no one's to blame  
  
All these years you've turned away  
Nothing left to say  
  
Vengeance  
You haven't a clue  
Vengeance  
It's inside of you  
  
Is there a reason we're losing the fight  
Stuck in this hell that we're living  
Over and over it's always the same  
Passing the sentence, yet no one's to blame  
  
All these years you've turned away  
Nothing left to say  
  
Vengeance  
You haven't a clue  
Vengeance  
It's inside of you
