Wind is in the east  
Stare at us eyes in wonder  
Like beggars at a feast  
We can't even, count the number  
What you gonna do?  
Send them table scraps we're leaving  
One who care are few  
Most spend there time, with useless meaning  
Dear father,  
Do you think that it will be alright?  
Tell me mother,  
Will we make it through?  
We make it through the hungry night.  
Somewhere in the west  
Gold teeth, but sometime is gleaming  
We know we are the best  
Even know, the beasts lie screaming  
We've got power to spare  
A new clear day  
Is dawning they say  
But tell us, don't you dare  
The piper has a price that we pay  
Dear preacher,  
Do you think that we'll see the light?  
Tell me teacher,  
Well we make it through?  
We make it through the darkest night.  
Two faces in the south  
The first one has a look of  
With fine words in his mouth  
His heart is black,  
As ghetto chimneys  
What you gonna do?  
To hide the shame,  
Contain their anger.  
What you gonna say?  
You walk the line, of constant danger  
Dear brother,  
You think we'll have to stand and fight?  
Tell me sister, Will we make it through?  
We make it through the longest night.  
Dear father,  
Do you think it's gonna be alright?  
Tell me teacher,  
Do you think that we'll see the light?  
Tell me brother,  
You think we'll have to stand and fight?  
Tell me sister,  
Will we make it through?  
Make it through the longest night.
