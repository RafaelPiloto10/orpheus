This is where we are today  
People going separate ways  
This is the way things are now  
In disarray  
I read it in the papers  
There's death on every page  
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above  
My life has been saved, eaah eah  
  
Here we go  
Tellin' lies  
Here we go - here we go  
  
We're right back where we started from  
People going separate ways  
This is the way things are now  
In disarray - hey  
I read it in the papers  
There's death on every page  
Aah - oh Lord, I thank you from above  
My life has been saved  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh my life  
My life has been saved  
Ooh my life  
My life has been saved
