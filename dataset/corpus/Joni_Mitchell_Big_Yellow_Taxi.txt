They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
With a pink hotel, a boutique  
And a swinging hot spot  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Till it's gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
  
They took all the trees  
And put them in a tree museum  
And they charged all the people  
A dollar and a half to see 'em  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Till it's gone  
They paved paradise  
And they put up a parking lot  
  
Hey farmer farmer  
Put away that D.D.T. now  
Give me spots on my apples  
But leave me the birds and the bees  
Please  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Till it's gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
  
Late last night  
I heard the screen door slam  
And a big yellow taxi  
Took away my old man  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Till it's gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot
