I don't care what you do  
I'm not gonna do it I don't like you  
Well you can't be what you love  
I know that you won't get far  
  
You're gonna die  
You're gonna die  
You're gonna die  
One day  
  
I see your faces you say  
I know that you are just play  
One day I'll see  
The real you  
That'll be the day you're through  
  
You're gonna die  
You're gonna die  
You're gonna die  
One day  
  
One, two, fuck you  
Me at you it's war  
Not gonna take your shit no more  
One day I'll get revenge  
That'll be your end  
  
You're gonna die  
You're gonna die  
You're gonna die  
One day  
  
Well I don't care  
Well I don't care  
Well I don't care
