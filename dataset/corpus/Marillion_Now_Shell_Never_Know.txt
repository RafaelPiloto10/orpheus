In the after silence fighting leaves behind  
I try to think it over  
But my mind's gone blind  
I lost the right to argue somewhere down the line  
  
I had to tell  
She told me to  
Go to Hell  
And here I am  
  
In the gaping hole  
Home truths tear in a home  
Married to this hurting  
I know it's all my fault  
  
Who can tell  
Looks like we have  
A house to sell  
  
Now she'll never know  
What anyone could tell her  
Now she'll never know  
What anyone can see  
Now she won't believe me  
Ever again, completely  
  
Now I hang around  
Feet back on the ground  
I just can't stand  
I just can't stand  
  
Now she'll Never know  
What anyone could tell her  
Now she'll never know  
What anyone can see  
Now she won't believe me  
Ever again, completely  
Now she'll never know  
Or ever dream  
How much she means to me
