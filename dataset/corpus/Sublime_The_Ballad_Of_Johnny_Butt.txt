Johnny Butt was a man with a real strong will to survive  
He just keep pushin' on even though he was barely alive  
So shoot it up shoot it up it just don't matter

There'll come a day when all that shit won't matter  
So shoot it up, shoot it up, it just don't matter  
When you're resisting anyway

It's called we've got to overcome  
We've got a brand new dance  
It's called we've got to overcome  
  
So Johnny just keep on pushin' cause the streets are yours  
There'll come a day when all of that shit won't matter  
So shoot it up, shoot it up, it just don't matter resisting anyway

It's called we've got to overcome
