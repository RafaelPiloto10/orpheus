I am a lonely visitor.  
I came to late to cause a stir,  
Though I campaigned all my life  
Towards that goal.  
I hardly slept the night you wept  
Our secret's safe and still well kept  
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.  
Even Richard Nixon has got  
Soul.  
  
Traffic cops are all color blind.  
People steal from their own kind.  
Evening comes to early for a stroll.  
Down neon streets the streaker streaks.  
The speaker speaks,  
But the truth still leaks,  
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.  
Even Richard Nixon has got it,  
Soul.  
  
The podium rocks in the crowded waves.  
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves  
That went down long before  
He played this role  
For the hotel queens and the magazines,  
Test tube genes and slot machines  
Where even Richard Nixon got soul.  
Even Richard Nixon has got it,  
Soul.  
  
Hospitals have made him cry,  
But there's always a free way in his eye,  
Though his beach just got  
Too crowded for his stroll.  
Roads stretch out like healthy veins,  
And wild gift horses strain the reins,  
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.  
Even Richard Nixon has got  
Soul.  
  
I am a lonely visitor.  
I came to late to cause a stir,  
Though I campaigned all my life  
Towards that goal.
