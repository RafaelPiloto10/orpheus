Boys and girls take warning  
If you go near the lake  
Keep your eyes wide open  
And look for sneaky snake  
  
Now, maybe you won't see him  
And maybe you won't hear  
But he'll sneak up behind you  
And drink all your root beer  
  
And then sneak snake goes dancing  
Wiggling and a-hissing  
Sneaky snake goes dancing  
A-giggling and a-kissing  
I don't like old sneaky snake  
He laughs too much you see  
When he goes wiggling through the grass  
It tickles his underneath  
  
Well sneaky snake drinks root beer  
And he just makes me sick  
When he is not dancing  
He looks just like stick  
  
Now he doesn't have any arms or legs  
You cannot see his ears  
And while we are not looking  
He's stealing all of our beer  
  
And then sneak snake goes dancing  
Wiggling and a-hissing  
Sneaky snake goes dancing  
A-giggling and a-kissing  
I don't like old sneaky snake  
He laughs too much you see  
When he goes wiggling through the grass  
It tickles his underneath
