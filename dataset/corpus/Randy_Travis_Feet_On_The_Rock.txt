Well I wanna talk to you for a minute,  
About an old man I met,  
He said,Boy, you look in trouble,  
And I bet your life's a mess,  
He said, I used to have the same problem too,  
I was way out of control,  
You know the only thing that set it right for me,  
Was a little good old rock and roll,  
(Chorus 1)  
I put my feet on the rock,  
And my name on the roll,  
When it's called up yonder,  
I won't worry 'bout my soul,  
I know my home is waiting,  
And it's something to behold,  
I put my feet on the rock,  
And my name on the roll,  
(Verse 2)  
I'd never heard the gosple,  
Spread like that before,  
I guess the message comes in many ways,  
Those simple words of wisdom,  
Can open heaven's door,  
So every time I get the chance I say,  
(Chorus 2)  
Come on, put your feet on the rock,  
And your name on the roll,  
When it's called up yonder,  
You won't worry 'bout your soul,  
You know your home is waiting,  
And it's something to behold,  
So put your feet on the rock,  
And your name on the roll,  
Repeat
