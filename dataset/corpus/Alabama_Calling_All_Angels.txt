Calling, calling all angels, oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
  
The night was still, the moon was bright when he saw a distant light  
So he started walkin' till he found a church outside of town  
And he stumbled in and closed the door, said why I'm here, I'm not sure  
It's my baby that I'm lookin' for, can't she see I'm down on my knees  
  
I've been calling, calling all angels, bring my baby back  
Oh you must know where she's at, tell me what to do, I know she's one of you  
I'm down on my knees, tell her please, that I love her so  
  
Tell me preacher, man to man, will you do all that you can  
I've done wrong, this I know, and I really hurt her so  
It's a lonely world I'm livin' in, an ocean of tears I been cryin'  
In this greatest hour of need, what can be done for a fool like me  
  
Oh, I'm calling, calling all angels, bring my baby back  
Oh you must know where she's at, yes I've been a fool  
And I know that she's one of you, now do this for me, tell her please  
  
And if she's lonely I'll make her understand  
That these arms can carry both of us back to heaven again  
  
Yes I've been a fool and I know that she's one of you  
Do this for me, tell her please  
  
Calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels
