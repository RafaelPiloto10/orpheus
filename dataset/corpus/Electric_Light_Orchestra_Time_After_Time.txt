Time after time, time after time  
The skies are darkening they grow so dim  
Strangers are meeting but it never ends  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
(Time after time)  
From far away there comes a warning sound  
And no one listens but it's all around  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
[Chorus:]  
Time after time, no hiding anywhere  
Time after time, the visions in the air  
Time after time, they come from everywhere  
  
(Time after time)  
Time after time  
Just listen to the sirens of the world  
They breathe a whisper waiting for the word  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
(Time after time)  
Time after time it is the same old story  
Another footstep on the trail of glory  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
(Chorus)  
  
The beauty of the earth from way up high  
Shines like a jewel upon the velvet sky  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
The skies are darkening they grow so dim  
Strangers are meeting but it never ends  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Emit retfa emit, no hiding anywhere  
Emit retfa emit, no visions in the air  
They come from everywhere
