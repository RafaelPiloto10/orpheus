He was crazy of course  
From the first she must have known it  
  
But still she went on with him  
And she never once had shown it  
And she took him off the streets  
And she dried his tears of grievin'g  
  
She listened to his visions  
She believed in his believin'  
Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle  
And she was the moon shining back his light a little  
  
He was a shooting star  
She was softer and more slowly  
He could not make things possible  
But, she could make them holy, holy...  
  
He was dancin' to some music  
No one else had ever heard  
He'd speak in unknown languages  
She'd translate every word  
  
And when the world was laughing  
At his castles in the sky  
She'd hold him in her body  
And he once again would fly  
  
Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle  
And she was the moon shining back his light a little  
He was a shooting star  
She was softer and more slowly  
  
He could not make things possible  
But, she could make them holy, holy...  
But she gave him a daughter  
And she gave him a son  
  
She was a mother, and a wife,  
And a lover when the day was done  
Well, he was too far gone for giving love  
What he'd offer in its stead  
  
Was the knowledge she was the only thing  
That was not in his head  
He took off East one morning  
In the rising sun's red glow  
  
She knew he was going nowhere  
But of course she let him go  
As she stood and watched him dwindle  
Much too empty to be sad  
  
He reappeared beside her and said,  
"You're all I've ever had"  
Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle  
And she was the moon shining back his light a little  
  
He was a shooting star  
She was softer and more slowly  
He could not make things possible  
But, she could make them holy  
  
Ah, he was the sun burning bright and brittle  
And she was the moon shining back his light a little  
He was a shooting star  
She was softer and more slowly  
  
He could not make things possible  
But, she could make them holy  
Holy
