Never say that nothing ever came from a mouse anyway  
Crawled into my house, took my cat away  
Don't let your brain tell your mind that it must say  
That nothing ever came from a mouse anyway  
Anyway  
  
Never say that nothing ever came from a gnat anyway  
Flew into my ear and then he done flown away  
Always causing aggravation so can't you ever say  
That nothing ever came from a gnat anyway  
Anyway, anyway, anyway  
  
Something always comes from the music anyway  
Came into my life and it stole me blues away  
Oh, my stereo is my best friend every day  
And this music is my blood, it's my blood  
It always comes and goes, but it never floods  
Something always comes, something always goes  
Something always comes from the music  
Something always comes from the music anyway  
Anyway, anyway, anyway  
  
Don't ya feel that this music flows  
Don't ya feel like it's life  
Well I do, well I certainly do  
I can't live without this music in my blood  
Well it gets me up when I'm feeling down  
And I cannot sleep when this music is around  
I live to move  
And I know that there's something there  
Filling me up, this music  
A wise man once said  
A wise man once said when he told me  
One good thing about music  
When it hits you, you feel no pain  
  
Something always comes and it always goes  
It will be there to the end after everything is gone  
The music  
Ah, it will, to the end  
Something always comes, something always goes  
Something always comes and it goes  
Something always comes from the music anyway  
Anyway, anyway, anyway
