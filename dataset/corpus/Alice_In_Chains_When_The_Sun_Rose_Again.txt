Run, run 'til you drop  
Hide, everyone knows  
We all trade in never-befores  
Selling out for the score  
  
Prey, squeal when you're caught  
Cry, it's not my fault  
Time to trade in never-befores  
Selling out for the score  
  
It seems you prophesized  
All of this would end  
Were you burned away  
When the sun rose again?  
  
Hate, long wearing thin  
Negative, all you've been  
Time to trade in never-befores  
Selling out for the score  
  
It seems you prophesized  
All of this would end  
Were you burned away  
When the sun rose again?
