Let's change the subject to someone else  
You know lately I've been subject to change  
Normally I reel in the strange  
Hangover, I'm older  
  
You're one to talk, the heart is a clock  
Just like a bomb it keeps on ticking away  
Counting down to detonate  
You will need an army to summon me  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh, ooh  
It doesn't matter much to me  
If it doesn't matter much to you  
  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
And though I hate to rewind before, before  
It's just a matter of time  
  
My past is getting us nowhere fast  
I was never one for taking things slow  
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go  
Come over, and over  
  
Doing my time for line after line  
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself?  
Prisoners to share a cell with  
I'm holding, still holding  
Holding you in  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh, ooh  
It doesn't matter much to me  
If it doesn't matter much to you  
  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
And though I hate to rewind before, before  
It's just a matter of time  
  
Where the hell are you? Ooh, ooh  
Where the hell are you? Ooh, ooh  
Where the hell are you?  
  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
And though I hate to rewind before, before  
It's just a matter of time  
  
What does it matter now?  
What does it matter now?  
What does it matter now?  
What does it matter now?  
It's just a matter of time  
Time
