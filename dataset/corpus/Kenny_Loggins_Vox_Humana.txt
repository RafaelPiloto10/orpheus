Early mornin' lookin' tired and worn  
And lookin' out for the enemy  
You made all the way to Hudson Bay  
But you're right back here with me  
Tryin' to run away  
Your lips are sealed  
  
A runaway  
So tell me baby  
What you're wantin' me to do  
Givin' my love to you  
Mama don't you know  
Now you're livin' like a runaway  
Sunday dawn you met a Gypsy woman  
On a road to Tennessee  
She told you a lot about the world to come  
But did she tell you  
Why you couldn't tell me  
Like a runaway  
How one by one you run away  
Now tell me baby  
What you want me to do  
Givin' all my love to you  
Mama don't you know  
  
It's gonna be a hard leavin'  
You're gonna need a strong reason  
'Cause I ain't gonna start believin'  
That you're out of my life  
You bet you better do your fast talkin'  
Before you do your last walkin'  
It's gonna be a hard hard leavin' (talk to me)  
Vox humana  
I wanta feel the power of speech  
Vox humana  
Sounds so right so real to me  
Vox humana  
You gotta say  
What you oughtta say  
Don't try to run away  
Darlin' I'm lettin' you know
