Look around. Do you see?  
Everything is fading  
Everything just fades away  
Look around. Do you see?  
Everyone looks lonely  
But there's only you and me  
  
Do you wonder how we came to be here?  
Do you wonder if we could find us from here?  
Look inside. Do you feel anything but bitter?  
Anything but sad and lost?  
Look inside. Do you dream of a time that's better?  
Do you ever dream of me?  
And my heart breaks when you cry in your sleep.  
So I can't wait here hoping I'm something you'll keep.  
  
I will love you. Miss you. All of my life.  
I will need you. Want you. All of my life.  
But I've lost you. Lost you. For the rest of my life.
