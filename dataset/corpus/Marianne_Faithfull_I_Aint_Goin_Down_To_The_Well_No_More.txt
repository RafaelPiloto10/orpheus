Oh  
I ain't going down  
I ain't going down  
Oh, honey to the well no more  
Oh.  
And I ain't got nothing  
Oh, and I can't stand nothing  
Oh.  
I ain't going down  
I ain't going down  
Oh, sweet mama to the well no more  
Oh.  
You said you was a true believer  
I'm the true believer  
I'm a true believer  
Oh.  
I ain't going down  
I ain't going down  
Oh, mama to the well no more  
Oh.
