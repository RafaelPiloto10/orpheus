So empty, can't feel no more,  
As I'm left with my tears on the floor  
I wait for my heart to mend,  
But you keep tearing a hole  
  
Inside, I'm so lost,  
In the middle of my heart  
It's a battlefield of love,  
I've been fighting for too long  
  
And now I'm shattered,  
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)  
Oh how it hurts  
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)  
I'm so shattered  
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)  
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh  
  
What am I still here for,  
Could it be that I'm just waiting  
Hoping you'd rescue me,  
And put the pieces together again  
  
Inside, I'm so lost,  
In the middle of my heart  
It's a battlefield of love,  
I've been fighting for too long  
  
And now I'm shattered  
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)  
Oh how it hurts  
(But it slipped from you hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)  
I'm so shattered  
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)  
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh  
  
Tell me what you're really here for,  
If you never really loved me  
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough  
  
Cause all you had to say was that you ain't  
Looking for commitment  
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, hey  
  
You took my emotions  
And scattered them on the ground  
So hard to just pick up,  
And move on with life, again  
  
And now I'm shattered  
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)  
Oh how it hurts  
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)  
I'm so shattered  
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)  
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh  
  
Can't believe, you and me, ahh
