I had it all  
But I let it slip away  
Couldn't see that I treated you wrong  
Now I wander around  
Feeling down and cold  
Trying to believe that you're gone  
  
Love takes time  
To heal when you're hurting so much  
Couldn't see that I was blind  
To let you go  
I can't escape the pain  
Inside  
Love takes time  
I don't want to be here alone  
Losing my mind  
  
From this hollow in my heart  
Suddenly I'm so incomplete  
Lord I'm needing you now  
Tell me how to stop the rain  
Tears are falling down endlessly  
  
Love takes time  
To heal when you're hurting so much  
Couldn't see that I was blind  
To let you go  
I can't escape the pain  
Inside  
Love takes time  
  
I don't want to be here alone  
You might say that it's over  
You might say that you don't care  
You might say you don't miss me  
You don't need me  
But I know that you do and I feel that you do  
  
Inside  
Love takes time  
To heal when you're hurting so much  
Couldn't see that I was blind  
To let you go  
I can't escape the pain  
Inside  
Love takes time  
I don't want to be here alone
