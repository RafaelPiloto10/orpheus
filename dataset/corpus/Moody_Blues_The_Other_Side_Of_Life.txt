The atmosphere  
On the streets tonight  
Is the driving beat  
Of the world.  
  
The word down here  
On the streets tonight  
Is the truest music  
You've heard.  
  
So take your share  
Of the gifts that are there,  
They all belong to you  
And, come what may,  
At the break of each day,  
We all begin anew once more.  
  
We all begin anew  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, baby, baby  
Let's investigate  
The other side of life tonight.  
The lovers and the fighters  
And the risks they take  
Are on the other side of life tonight.  
Let's lose our way,  
Go completely astray  
And find ourselves again.  
You know the only way to get there  
Is to take that step  
To the other side of life tonight.  
  
The atmosphere  
On the streets tonight  
Is the driving beat  
Of the world.  
The word down here  
On the streets tonight  
Is the truest music  
You've heard.  
  
So take your share  
Of the gifts that are there,  
They all belong to you  
And, come what may,  
At the break of each day,  
We all begin anew once more.  
We all begin anew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's lose our way,  
Go completely astray  
And find ourselves again.  
You know the only way to get there  
Is to take that step  
To the other side of life tonight.
