Life isn't easy  
Love never lasts  
You just carry on  
And keep moving fast  
I turned off the highway  
Pulled into town  
I'm fancy free darlin'  
And I've travelled round  
Sometimes I'm up  
Sometimes I'm down  
Tell me where can I run to  
Tell me how have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And howl like the wind  
So who shall I start with  
Tell me how to begin  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And howl like the wind  
My thoughts are lost in memories  
That keep me free  
Know if all the stars were shining  
They would not help me see  
Don't you know that  
Sometimes I'm up  
Most times down  
Where can I run to  
Tell me how have I sinned  
You cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
Well my life isn't easy  
And my love never seems to last  
So I'll keep on carrying on darlin'  
I'll just keep moving fast  
I turned off the highway  
Pulled into town  
And I'm still fancy free  
And I keep travellin' round  
Sometimes I'm up  
Most times I'm down  
Where can I run to  
Tell me how have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
So who shall I start with  
Tell me how to begin  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
Cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind
