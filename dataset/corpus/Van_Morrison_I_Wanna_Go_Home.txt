Intro:  
("Here's a very good old good one, see if you remember this one, see if we
do!)  
("This is gonna be nice, this is gonna be very nice")  
  
Sailed on the Sloop John be  
My granddaddy and me  
'Round Nassau town we did roam  
We'd been drinkin' all night  
Well I got into a fight  
Yeah and I feel so broke up  
I want to go home  
  
Hoist up the John be sail's  
See how the mainsail sets  
Send for the Captain ashore  
And let me go home  
I want to go home, I want to go home, yeah  
'Cause I feel so broke up, I want to go home  
Yes I do  
(He's so broke up, Lord, I want to go home)  
  
Well Captain's a wicked man  
He gets drunk any time he can  
And he don't give a damn for grandpappy  
No, nor me  
He kicks us around  
And he knocks us about  
Well I feel so broke up, I  
I want to go home  
  
Well pull up the John be 's sails  
See how the mainsail sets  
Send for the Captain ashore  
And let me go home  
I want to go home  
Well, I want to go home  
'Cause I feel so broke up (he's so broke up)  
I want to go home  
(Yes I do)  
I feel so broke up  
(He so broke up)  
Lord, that I want to go home  
Home
