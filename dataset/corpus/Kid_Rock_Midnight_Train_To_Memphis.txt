I was hiding from the sun once again  
I was running from time my friend  
I've lost another war  
So I poured one more, and went home drunk again  
  
She was up when the key hit the lock  
And the clock looked at me just like the devil in disguise  
I saw it in her eyes  
She'd be gone before the evening  
  
So I poured another strong one  
And chopped a line from here to Texas  
'Cause I've lost another good one  
She's on the midnight train to Memphis  
  
With a brand new start  
I swore I'd love from the heart  
I meant to change my ways  
But I've seen better days  
  
Than the one that's here this morning, mmhm  
With a wife and kids at home  
With a job somewhere on some assembly line  
I wish I had that life  
I bet you wish you had mine  
  
So I poured another tall one  
And chopped a line from here to Texas  
'Cause I've lost another good one  
She's on the midnight train to Memphis  
  
Dude, what station is this, K snooze  
Kid Rock, I thought he was the American bad ass  
He's putting me to sleep  
Nudge me if he gets over five decibels  
I knew his first album was the good one  
  
But that's the way I am, and this is how I jam  
All across the land from Alabam' to bandstand  
Doped up rebel with an attitude, shit  
So fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch  
  
I won't switch, won't quit no vices  
Flip the script cause I'm a slice the righteous  
Haven't you heard I don't refrain  
Free as a bird, and so I won't change  
  
Livin' it up, givin' it up, fuckin' shit up, what  
I'm a run the track from the D to Nantucket  
So fuck it, if you don't dig that you can suck it  
Yeah, and it don't, and it don't  
  
With an old suitcase, I swear I'll leave this place  
I'll get you back in time, can't drink you off my mind  
So I'll see you when I'm sober  
I been looking for some reasons  
But I ain't found one down in Texas  
I been changing with the seasons  
Walked in a new line back to Memphis
