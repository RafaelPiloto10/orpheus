Just take those old records off the shelf  
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Don't try to take me to a disco  
You'll never even get me out on the floor  
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Ooh  
  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul ooh  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
Won't go to hear them play a tango  
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul  
There's only one sure way to get me to go  
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll  
Call me a relic, call me what you will  
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock and roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll.
