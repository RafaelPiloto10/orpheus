Do you remember Cactus Texas  
Nothing but a wide place in the road  
Eighteen wheelers never go there  
Main Street's just too narrow for the load.  
  
A little town of honest people  
Some we haven't seen for quite awhile  
I was young and restless  
And we both were full of dreams and running wild.  
  
We left our old hometown and family  
Barely had a nickel to our name  
We were out to win the world  
Not once looking back or losing aim.  
  
We hit the big town and the big time  
Not a lot of effort in the deal  
But in the bargain we lost touch with one another  
And old feelings that were real.  
  
In a big house up on easy street  
Where too much never seems to be enough  
We're not the same two people far away  
From all the days when the times were rough.  
  
Including you and I  
Is separated by a wall  
It's not something we can talk about  
In fact we seldom even talk at all.  
  
I don't think we realize  
How or why we ever came this far  
Let's go back to Cactus Texas  
Maybe once we're there we'll find out where we are
