Be honest with me  
Did you ever think  
That these things that you did  
Would come back to haunt you  
And fail you again  
Don't ever question  
My will to admit  
That when we're alone  
It's too hard to resist  
Making believe  
That we're bigger than this  
For choosing a road  
That is different but similar  
To the same one I took before  
  
Why don't we breathe  
Why can't you see  
That things aren't always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think I've found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
The simpleness describes  
The iron that is you  
And your rusty old life  
Get on with the mattress  
And tell-tale lies  
Watch everything  
That you touch turns to ice  
Following the sheep  
And they're at it again  
Making believe  
That there're free as it seems  
But only finding out that  
They're on a sinking ship  
That doesn't care  
How many it saves today  
  
Why don't we breathe  
Why can't you see  
That things aren't always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think I've found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
Watch out now  
I see the light  
At the end of the tunnel  
It seems realistic  
That getting there will make us fine  
But watch out now  
It's full of glass  
Don't take the chance  
You'll surely pass  
At least some day  
We'll know the reason  
Why  
  
Why don't we breathe  
Why can't you see  
That things aren't always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think I've found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
The perfect way  
The perfect way
