Hm, hm  
  
Hm, hm, hm, hm  
  
Just like a welcome fire  
  
That comes in the cold  
  
You make my heart warm  
  
And a little more love is born  
  
And I'm caught up once again on you  
  
Soft as a rose, your tenderness glows  
  
But you're so strong  
  
And I know I'm gonna love you long  
  
Well, crazy maybe  
  
But I've seen paradise  
  
Here in your eyes  
  
I'm in seventh heaven  
  
Ooh, there's nothing quite  
  
Like spending your life  
  
With a special someone  
  
It feels so right  
  
When the lights are out  
  
And I'm in the dark  
  
I'm not afraid, no  
  
Long as I can get a piece of your heart  
  
And the wind sighs  
  
I love you  
  
Specially when we touch  
  
I need it so much  
  
And I'm glad that we found love  
  
Let the record show that I know that I've  
  
Seen paradise here in your eyes  
  
I'm in seventh heaven  
  
Ooh, there's nothing quite  
  
Like spending your life  
  
With a special someone  
  
It feels so right  
  
Hmm, ooh (paradise)

You know that I like, you know that I like  
  
You know that I like to be in paradise

And for those who think that there's no such thing  
  
As eternity, they should take a look at you and me  
  
We have got the perfect harmony  
  
Specially when we touch  
  
You know I need it, oh, so much  
  
I'm in heaven specially when I'm with you, hey
