I've got the village I love - dig everything  
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything - dig everything  
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back  
They don't dig anything - dig everything  
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing - dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Dig  
I feed the lions in trafalgar square and I dig everything - dig everything  
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug  
Everything -dig everything  
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything - dig
everything  
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going  
They don't dig anything - dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Everything's spent and I dig everything  
Dig  
I've got more friends than I had out for dinners  
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners  
Rick, john, sally, a connection named paul  
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall  
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything  
Dig  
I've made myself at home -dig everything  
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone  
All the movie shows - dig everything  
I sunbathe for love - dig everything  
Even when it's not too hot - dig everything  
'cause I dig everything -dig everything  
Oh yeah
