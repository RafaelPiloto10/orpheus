Restless soul enjoy your youth  
Like Muhammad it's the truth  
Can't escape from the common rule  
If you hate something don't you do it too... it too...  
Small my table, it sits just two  
Got so crowded I can't make room  
Oh where did they come from? Stormed my room!  
And you dare say it belongs to you... to you...  
This is not for you (3x)  
Oh not for you... ah you...  
... scream... my friends... don't call me...  
... friends, no they don't scream...  
... my friends don't call... my friends don't...  
All that's sacred comes from youth  
Dedication, naive and true  
With no power, nothing to do  
I still remember, why don't you... don't you...  
This is not for you (3x)  
Oh, never was for you... fuck you...  
This is not for you...  
Oh, this is not for you... yeah, you...  
This is not for you...  
Oh, not for you...  
Oh, you...
