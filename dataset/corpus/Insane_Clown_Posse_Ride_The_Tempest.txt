Step forth and face the beast that is the mighty Tempest! Dare to go for a
spin on the  
World's most horrifically fabulous ride! Behold the Tempest! The fastest,
highest,  
Steepest, and tallest coaster-ride ever to exist on this or any other planet!  
We fuckin rollin with no controllin, them bolts ain't holdin.  
Take you higher, rollin on wires, till time expires.  
Swingin corners, so kids are goners, you hangin on-ers.  
Duck them tunnels, they shrink like funnels. Get your forehead pummeled  
We upside down you, then round and round you, your evil found you.  
Let's go faster, its sheer disaster, while spinnin backwards.  
Jagged edges, no kind of ledges, with broken wedges.  
Its the largest, fastest, steepest, deepest, tallest, all this and more,
roller coaster.  
[Chorus]  
It's something thrilling for you, so get on, get on it (come ride The Tempest)  
You got that feelin in you, so jump up, jump on it (Jump on it)  
It's somthing wicked for you so get on, get on it (Let's ride The Tempest)  
We got that ticket for you, so jump up, jump on it.  
Electrifyin and now you climbin, feels like you flyin.  
The cars are shakin, slowly elevatin, sound like they breakin.  
Rickety, rackety, clickity, clack, up we go, you no look back.  
Some french guy had to look, froze up and fell out, he got so shook. So fuck
him, them  
Polls keep duckin, this cart you stuck in upward spiral, the rings of fire,
still climbin  
Higher  
Rackety, rickety, clackity, click, now you on the tip-top tipity tip  
Tip of the largest, fastest, steepest, deepest,tallest, all this and more,
roller coaster.  
[Chorus]  
It's something thrilling for you, so get on, get on it (come ride The Tempest)  
You got that feelin in you, so jump up, jump on it (Jump on it)  
It's somthing wicked for you so get on, get on it (Let's ride The Tempest)  
We got that ticket for you, so jump up, jump on it.  
Straight down, you fallin you fallin straight down so fast your skin in
crawling  
Straight down, you fallin you fallin straight down so fast your skin is
crawlin  
You fallin so fast, you see your whole life flash, your balls jump up your ass
in a quick  
Dash, you get whiplash, the shit's so fast on your bitch ass, and it don't
stop till the  
Shit crash  
[Chorus (2x)]  
It's something thrilling for you, so get on, get on it (come ride The Tempest)  
You got that feelin in you, so jump up, jump on it (Jump on it)  
It's somthing wicked for you so get on, get on it (Let's ride The Tempest)  
We got that ticket for you, so jump up, jump on it.
