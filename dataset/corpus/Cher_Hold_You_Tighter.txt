Two more days and we'll be home  
Two more days and we won't be alone  
We'll see things that we recognize  
We'll get to look in our baby's eyes  
And I know that you're lonesome baby  
It's hard hanging on  
I know that you're tired baby  
But I'll help you be strong  
Chorus:  
Cause I'm gonna hold you tighter (tighter)  
Tighter (tighter), tighter (tighter)  
(Baby)  
I'm gonna hold you tighter (tighter)  
Tighter (tighter), tighter (tighter)  
(Baby yeah, yeah)  
We've been out on a thirty-day gig  
Paid our dues cause that's how we live  
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry  
Sometimes we're weary and sometimes we're high  
Hey I know that you're lonesome baby  
It's hard hanging on  
I know that you're tired baby  
But I'll help you be strong  
Chorus  
How'd you tell a baby that's just eight months old  
Her daddy and momma gotta work on the road  
Every night she won't get kissed  
Cause we're out here trying  
To get her all the things that we missed  
And I know that you're lonesome baby  
It's hard hanging on  
I know that you're tired baby  
But I'll help you be strong  
Chorus  
It's seems kinda funny that it ain't just you and me  
The number was two and now we changed to three  
We added one more color and the color made us brighter  
But to keep our rainbow blowing now we gotta be a fighter  
And I know that you're lonesome baby  
It's hard hanging on  
I know that you're tired baby  
But I'll help you be strong  
Chorus
