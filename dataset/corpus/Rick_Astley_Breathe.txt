Paper Towers Of Vogue And Vanity Fair  
They Are Still Standing  
And The Spaces In The Bathroom Are Incredibly Bare  
And It's Better This Way  
  
And I Don't Miss The Sunrise On The Colours Of Your Hair  
And I Don't Mind The Mornings No Not Much Any More No Not  
Much Any More  
  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When Your Perfume's Everywhere  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When The Memories Are Hanging In The Air  
  
There Will Be Dust On The Spice Rack In No Time At All  
Tell Me, Who's Around To Notice  
And I Won't Run From The Shower Whenever You Call  
And It's Better This Way  
  
And I Won't Miss The Starlight And The Clothes You Used To Wear  
And I Don't Mind The Moonlight No Not Much Anymore No Not  
Much Anymore  
  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When Your Perfume's Everywhere  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When The Memories Are Hanging In The Air  
  
And You Know I Can Handle It, I Can Handle It, I'm Getting Out More  
And You Know I'm Over It, I'm So Over It, Until I Close The Door  
  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When Your Perfume's Everywhere  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When The Memories Are Hanging In The Air
