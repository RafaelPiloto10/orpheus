There's a howlin' at my window, baby  
I hear him closin' in  
That green-eyed jackal's got the scent  
Knows I'll let him in  
He slinks in by me at the fire  
More bitter than the cold  
And it's a rage as old as Hades  
That'll sputter on these coals  
I'm callin' on the Furies, to let the toast begin  
I'm roasting on the spit of love again  
I never have believed you  
But I stick around for more  
Somethin' bout that hollow in your eyes  
There's a darkness at the core  
Well, it's got me slowly turnin'  
I'm basting on the bone  
I'm skewered like some drunken fool  
In juices all my own  
Callin' the Furies' carrion choir  
Singin' me back upon the pyre  
I'm roasting on that spit of love again  
You can call it what you want  
But it's lyin just the same  
There's no mercy in these ashes, baby  
When your love's a cryin' shame  
And they're howlin' in moonlight, baby  
They're here to call my bluff  
they're wonderin' if there'll ever come a day  
When I'll have finally had enough  
I'm callin' on the Furies, to let the toast begin  
I'm roasting on that spit of love again
