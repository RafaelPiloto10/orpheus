Can't remember anything at all  
Flame trees line the streets  
Can't remember anything at all  
But I'm driving my car down to Geneva  
  
I've been sitting in my basement patio  
Aye, it was hot  
Up above, girls walk past, the roses all in bloom  
Have you ever heard about the Higgs Boson blues  
I'm goin' down to Geneva baby, gonna teach it to you  
  
Who cares, who cares what the future brings?  
Black road long and I drove and drove  
I came upon a crossroad  
The night was hot and black  
I see Robert Johnson,  
With a ten dollar guitar strapped to his back,  
Lookin' for a tune  
  
Well here comes Lucifer,  
With his canon law,  
And a hundred black babies runnin' from his genocidal jaw  
He got the real killer groove  
Robert Johnson and the devil man  
Don't know who's gonna rip off who  
  
Driving my car, flame trees on fire  
Sitting and singin' the Higgs Boson blues,  
I'm tired, I'm lookin' for a spot to drop  
All the clocks have stopped in Memphis now  
In the Lorraine Motel, it's hot, it's hot  
That's why they call it the Hot Spot  
I take a room with a view  
Hear a man preaching in a language that's completely new, yea  
Making the hot cocks in the flophouse bleed  
While the cleaning ladies sob into their mops  
And a bellhop hops and bops  
A shot rings out to a spiritual groove  
Everybody bleeding to that Higgs Boson Blues  
  
If I die tonight, bury me  
In my favorite yellow patent leather shoes  
With a mummified cat and a cone-like hat  
That the caliphate forced on the Jews  
Can you feel my heartbeat?  
Can you feel my heartbeat?  
  
Hannah Montana does the African Savannah  
As the simulated rainy season begins  
She curses the queue at the Zulus  
And moves on to Amazonia  
And cries with the dolphins  
Mama ate the pygmy  
The pygmy ate the monkey  
The monkey has a gift that he is sending back to you  
Look here comes the missionary  
With his smallpox and flu  
He's saving them savages  
With his Higgs Boson Blues  
I'm driving my car down to Geneva  
I'm driving my car down to Geneva  
  
Oh let the damn day break  
The rainy days always make me sad  
Miley Cyrus floats in a swimming pool in Toluca Lake  
And you're the best girl I've ever had  
Can't remember anything at all
