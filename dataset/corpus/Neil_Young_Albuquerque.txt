Well, they say that Santa Fe is less than ninety miles away,  
And I got time to roll a number and rent a car.  
Oh, Albuquerque.  
  
I've been flyin' down the road, and I've been starvin' to be alone,  
And independent from the scene that I've known.  
Albuquerque.  
  
So I'll stop when I can, find some fried eggs and country ham.  
I'll find somewhere where they don't care who I am.  
Oh, Albuquerque,  
Albuquerque.
