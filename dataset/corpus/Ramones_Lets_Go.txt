Don't want to study on the G.I. bill  
Want more action, haven't had my fill  
Mercenary, fight for anyone  
Fight for money  
Fight for fun  
  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go  
  
Got a country you want to protect  
But your army is more likely to defect  
Hire my SMG with a full clip  
On automatic it's guaranteed hit  
  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go  
  
Gee it's kinda scary out here  
Mosquitoes are happy tonight  
Mommy, Daddy, can I please come home  
Even if just for one night  
  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go  
  
Shocked how deadly we fight back  
Troublemakers who attack  
Mercenary, fight for anyone  
Fight for money, fight for fun  
  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go
