Oh why in this world must we work life like a deal, sometimes I feel,  
Its all make believe.  
Put glory in your heart and never say die,  
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi,  
so Happy hi, yeah!  
  
And why in this world is life like a train, never stopping at stations.  
If I could freeze time under the starry sky, never questioning why.  
And what in this world is achieving perfection,  
We may not get there but boy do we care,  
Don't be scared.  
  
Put glory in your heart and never say die,  
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi,  
so Happy hi yeah!  
  
Put glory in your heart and never say die,  
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi,  
so Happy hi yeah!  
  
Put glory in your heart and never say die,  
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi,  
so Happy hi yeah!
