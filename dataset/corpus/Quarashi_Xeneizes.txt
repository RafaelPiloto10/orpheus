Welcome to the Quarashi game here I am the noname yeah the same boy  
Who doesn't need a frame. I'm surrounded by foes and anything goes so I gotta
be  
Like Tony Montana on his toes. Up up and down your spinning round and round.  
You don't know why your spinning maybe it's the syntha sound, but this is me  
you hear the rocking sonic youth there's an eye for an eye and a tooth for a  
tooth. Another dimension on a frequency in ecstacy. Biting bastards but in a
way  
licking sinners ashtray. Trying to get through the Zoo and get no penalty. I  
know how to beat because that's for the winners. I'm on the clouds ready to  
jump off. in the free fall I see you all looking so small. Stepping on  
stepping off. I want to feel my skin, blowing through the wind. You gotta take  
it all back we allready got a stack. what a get away deal if you don't know
what  
you lack and you gotta fix that if you want to get that up. suck it out of a
tube  
and don't ever ever stop rocking that type o mad beat we lead the pack from a  
rack to a seat. And so was I when I was trying to get by on planet 9 well,  
nice try. Tequila flats while I'm flipping my hats I do the new jaywalking  
while I feed the stray cats on the one two three a dididumdidi you know you'll  
get back when I say open Sesame.
