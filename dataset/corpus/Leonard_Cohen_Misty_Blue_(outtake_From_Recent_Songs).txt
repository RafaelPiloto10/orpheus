Oh but it's been such a long, long time.  
Thought I'd got you off my mind.  
Looks like I can't, just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue.  
Just the mention of your name  
Fans the flicker to a flame.  
I can't forget the things we used to do.  
My whole world turns misty blue.  
You know I should forget you  
I really should,  
And heaven knows that I tried.  
But when I told you,  
When I said that we were through  
Deep in my heart I lied  
Baby, oh what a long, long time.  
Thought I'd get you off my mind.  
Oh but I can't, just the thought of you  
Turns my world misty blue  
And the very mention of your name  
Fans the flicker to a flame.  
I think of things we used to do,  
My whole world turns misty blue.
