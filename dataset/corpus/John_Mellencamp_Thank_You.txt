Let me say thank-you to those who love many  
Let me say thank-you to those who still play fair  
Hallelujah, the meek shall inherit  
Let me say thank-you to all you people out there, out there  
Let me say grace for those who don't feel they matter  
May God look down on all the soldiers of this Earth  
Trying to find peace in this world that house so many  
Let me say grace for those who feel lost from birth, lost from birth  
Let's give a smile for those who feel that they have nothing  
Let me shake the hand of Johnny Doe out on the street  
Let's give a wink for those girls who don't feel pretty  
Let's find some water for those who need a drink, need a drink  
And when I see so many broken and lonely  
Soon to be entering Heaven's door  
Let me count the ways  
Let me count the blessings  
That no man should feel lonely anymore  
Let me say good luck to the people raising families  
Let me say thank-you to the men who grow the bread  
And here's to dreams of a bigger, brighter future  
And that we all got someone to keep the stones from our bed  
Let me say thank-you to those who love many  
Let me say thank-you for those who still play fair  
Hallelujah, the meek shall inherit  
Let me say thank-you to all you folks out there  
All you people out there
