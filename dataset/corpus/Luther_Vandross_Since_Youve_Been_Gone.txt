Baby, baby, sweet baby  
There's something that I've just got to say  
Baby, baby, sweet baby  
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way  
  
Speak your name and I feel a thrill  
You said I do, sure thing, and I said I will  
  
I told you to just be true  
And give me just a little time  
Wait on me, baby  
I want you to be all o' mine  
I've just been so blue  
Since you've been gone  
(why'd ya do it, why'd ya have to do it)  
  
Since you've been gone  
I've been missin' you  
Miss your good love  
Miss your kissin' too  
What a shame, why'd you do that  
Why'd you tip on me?  
Come home, bring your love back now  
To rescue me, Uh Huh  
  
Baby, baby, sweet baby  
(sweet, sweet baby)  
I didn't mean to run you away  
It was pride on my lips  
But not in my heart  
To say the things that made you stray  
  
And I mean  
Hear me now (hear me)  
I don't know what I'm gonna do (hear me)  
Gotta get you back somehow (hear me now)  
  
And all I know is if ya  
Take me back  
Consider me, please  
If you walk in that door  
I can get you off my knees  
And I've just been so blue  
Since you've been gone  
(why'd ya do it, why'd ya have to do it)  
Since you've been gone  
(why'd ya do it, why'd ya have to do it)
