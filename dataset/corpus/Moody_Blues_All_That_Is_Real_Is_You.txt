All the world over I've searched for a dream  
I've found out that life is not what it seems  
I've seen all the wonders the world has to give  
But all that is real is you  
All of the silver and all of the gold  
Are worthless to me, lifeless and cold  
I've known all the treasure a man can possess  
But all that is real is you  
So bring me back home, my love my love  
Oh how I need you  
Take me back home, my love, my love  
Oh how I love you  
Even the place where my heart used to fly  
The warm summer breeze, the wild seabirds cry  
And all are illusions and all just a dream  
'Cause all that is real is you  
So bring me back home my love, my love  
Oh how I need you  
Take me back home my love, my love  
Oh how I love you  
All the world over I've searched for a dream  
I've found out that life is not what it seems  
I've seen all the wonders the world has to give  
But all that is real is you, 'cause all that is real is you
