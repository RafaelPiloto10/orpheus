If you only knew how in love with you  
I have always been hopin' you'd give in  
If you only knew  
  
One would never guess what I must confess  
But it's really so, though you may not know  
You're my happiness  
  
Fate has started a story so blind  
You can make it the perfect rhyme  
  
If you only knew what your love could do  
You would say, "Okay, darling, lead the way"  
If you only knew  
  
Ah, fate has started a story so blind  
You can make it the perfect rhyme  
  
If you only knew what your love could do  
You would say, "Okay, darling, lead the way"  
If you only knew, if you only knew
