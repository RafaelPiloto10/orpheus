Where do you go buttoned in your favorite coat  
Stepping out to a different world  
And you might be home late  
And where are you now  
Staring at your favorite box  
The one with the traveler's cross  
On the road past the gate  
  
But if you find yourself standing on the corner  
While you're thinking of a different world  
Then you might see me waiting on the corner  
Staring through you in your different world  
  
And if I could swim  
Then I'd get out and find my boat  
Sail away to my favorite coast  
And let you all in  
And if I could do all the things you're asking for  
Then maybe I'd find your door  
And bring it home to you  
  
But if you find yourself standing on the corner  
While you're thinking of a different world  
Then you might see me waiting on the corner  
Staring through you in your different world  
  
So where do we go  
Like two Christophers in the snow  
Yeah we're blind but we want to know  
Just to say I love you  
And all of our lives  
We'll sail through the suns and moons  
To sing our travelers tune  
Just to say I love you
