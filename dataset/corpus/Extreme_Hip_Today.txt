you'll be gone tomorrow  
you'll be gone tomorrow  
gone tomorrow  
  
you're preoccupied  
with the latest fashion  
hip today, hip today  
with wide open eyes  
on the next big thing  
you can cash in  
hip today, hip today  
  
no never contrived  
it's an overnight sensation  
a clever disguise  
that hides all of your  
pretension  
sally's selling out  
her seashells for souls  
hope i don't die  
before i get old  
  
hip today  
you'll be gone tomorrow  
you'll be gone tomorrow  
gone tomorrow  
  
dancing in your head  
visions of rave reviews  
hip today, hip today  
believing all that's read  
conceiving another guru  
hip today, hip today  
  
having made your bed  
falling short of filling shoes  
you've been left for dead  
'cause there's always  
someone new  
sally's selling out  
her seashells for souls  
hope i don't die  
before i get old
