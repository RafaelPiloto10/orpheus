Save our lives...  
Can't revive...  
Your magic place is nearing Hell...  
  
Set it straight  
Can't relate  
I hope your friends treat you well.  
  
All the waiting  
Caring fading  
And I'm fallin'  
I'm fallin'  
  
All the waiting  
Caring fading  
And I'm fallin'  
I'm fallin'  
  
You saved our lives  
And took our knives  
You waited for the time to sell.  
  
All the waiting  
Caring fading  
And I'm fallin'  
I'm fallin'  
(x2)  
  
Save our lives...  
Can't revive...  
Your magic place is nearing Hell...  
  
Set it straight  
Can't relate  
I hope your friends treat you well.  
  
All the waiting  
Caring fading  
And I'm fallin'  
I'm fallin'  
(x2)  
  
(yeahhh.... yeahh....)  
  
Save our lives...  
Save our lives...  
Save our lives...
