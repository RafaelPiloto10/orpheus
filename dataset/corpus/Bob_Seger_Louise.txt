Louise Lyrics  
Now Louise she is an outlaw, in the year of seventy one  
She's got Levi bells and long straight hair  
She's got a gun  
Her folks they didn't under-stand why she could'nt  
Get her homework done, mmm  
Her father is a preacher, her mother's an ex-nun  
  
Now Louise she likes to boogie, down at the old ballroom  
She's got a crazy hophead boyfriend, digs freon balloons  
They ride on his Harley from the morning till the late afternoon  
They get stoned in the evening, and make love beneath the moon  
  
Now the old folks who are listenin'  
Prob'ly think think this song's obscene  
Say your children aren't like that  
Say my words are way off theme  
Well Louise she's just an  
Average product of the American dream  
I concede she's kind of naive but  
After all she's only thirteen  
  
Ride on Louise, ride on, ride on
