If you listen, to the night  
You can hear the darkness call  
I can barely stand to wait  
I can barely stand at all  
C'mon closer to me now  
It's like we're sharing the same skin  
We gotta get out of this jail  
We gotta let the future in  
So many things in your life  
That your bound to regret  
Why didn't I do that?  
Why didn't I do this?  
So many chances you lost  
That you'll never forget  
Why didn't I make it?  
Why didn't I take it right there?  
The loneliest words you'll ever know  
If only-if only it was so  
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:  
It could have been me. it could have been me  
The loneliest words you'll ever know  
If only-if only it was so  
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:  
It could have been me. it could have been me  
You'll have to pay for it later  
If you don't get it when it's going for free  
Believe me -! believe me -!  
  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
It's something that's always been so  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
  
And one of these nights  
You're gonna show me that you already know  
There's a feast waiting for you  
And you've never even gotten a taste  
It's later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste!  
You shouldn't tremble when we touch  
There's no reason for these fears  
It's a promise that was made  
We've been promised this for years  
I wanna show you it all  
What to do and where and how!  
Cause we'll never be as young as we are right now  
We'll never be as young as we are right now!  
  
So many cries in the night  
That you try to ignore  
Why didn't I do this?  
Why didn't I do that?  
So many unanswered prayers  
So many unopened doors  
Why didn't I take it?  
Why didn't I make it come true?  
The loneliest words you'll ever know:  
If only - if only it was so  
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:  
It could have been me  
It could have been me  
The loneliest words you'll ever- know:  
If only - if only it was so  
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:  
It could have been me  
It could have been me  
You'll have to pay for it later:  
If you don't get it when it's going for free!  
Believe me! believe me, believe me!  
  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
It's something that has always been so  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
  
And one of these nights  
I'm gonna show you that you already know...  
There's a feast waiting for you  
And you've never even gotten a taste  
It's later than, you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste!  
There's a feast waiting for you  
And you've never even gotten a taste  
It's later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste!  
  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
That's all we're leaving behind!  
It doesn't matter what we're losing  
It only matters what we're going to find!  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
That's all we're leaving behind!  
It doesn't matter what we're losing  
It only matters what we're going to find!  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
That's all we're leaving behind!  
It doesn't matter what we're losing  
It only matters what we're going to find!  
Tyre tracks and broken hearts  
That's all we're leaving behind!  
It doesn't matter what we're losing  
It only matters what we're going to find!  
There's a feast waiting for you  
And you've never even gotten a taste  
It's later than you think and  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste  
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
