I heard you on my wireless back in '52  
Lying awake intent on tuning in on you  
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through  
Oh-a-oh  
They took the credit for your second symphony  
Rewritten by machine on new technology  
And now I understand the supernova scene  
Oh-a-oh  
I met your children  
Oh-a-oh  
What did you tell them?  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
In my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone too far  
Wow  
And now we meet in an abandoned studio  
You hear the playback and it seems so long ago  
And you remember, the jingles used to go,  
Oh-a-oh  
You were the first one  
Oh-a-oh  
You were the last one  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Cause in my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone too far  
To far!  
Alright  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Cause in my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone too far  
Pictures came and broke your heart  
So put all the blame on vcr  
You are the radio star  
You are the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed that radio star yes it did
