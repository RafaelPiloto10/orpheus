Strands of light on our bedroom floor  
Change the night through an open door  
I'm awake but this is not my home  
For the first time I'm not alone  
Reaching out I touch another's skin  
Breathing out as he's breathing in  
Deep inside I feel my soul aflame  
Can my life ever be the same  
I should have told him  
That I'd do anything if I could hold him  
For just another day, for just another day  
His love is something I will not forget  
When I am far away, when I am far away  
I feel the rainfall of another planet  
Another planet  
Close together in the afterglow  
I remember how his loving flowed  
Turned the key into another world  
Made a woman of a simple girl  
Daylight comes as we both know it must  
Soon my fantasy will turn to dust  
But I would give him anything he asked  
If my first love could be my last  
I should have told him  
That I'd do anything if I could hold him  
For just another day, for just another day  
His love is something I will not regret  
When I am far away, when I am far away  
I feel the rainfall of another planet  
Another planet
