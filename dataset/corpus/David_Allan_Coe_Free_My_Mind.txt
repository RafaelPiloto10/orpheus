I'm a cosmic cowboy  
A big time player  
I like Pantera, Kid Rock, and Slayer  
I like Ice-T the rapper I mean  
When it comes to drinkin' I like Jim Beam  
I play well strung guitars with a rebel flag  
But I don't wear make-up or dress in drag  
I smoke a lot, I'm a whiskey drinker  
I ain't no hick songwriter  
I'm a pretty neat thinker  
I'm glad you came to see me put on a show  
My name is David Allan Coe I came to let you know that..  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been tryin' to have a real good time  
Forget about thinkin' tryin' to free my mind  
I've been tryin' to have a real good time  
Forget about thinkin' tryin' to free my mind  
  
I own my own limosuine and a Cadillac  
I got a million dollar tour bus and that's a fact  
I ain't broke but I ain't rich  
I call women honey not hoe or bitch  
I'm into Tanya Tucker, Twisted Brown Truck  
The Allman Brothers Band and Marshall Tucker  
I'm not in this for money I do it for fun  
And I don't shoot dope but I will shoot my gun  
  
I ain't no phony dude  
I'm the real thing baby  
Just like Rob Zombie just like Slim Shady  
  
[Chorus]  
And I've been tryin' to have a real good time  
Forget about thinkin' tryin' to free my mind  
I've been tryin' to have a real good time  
Forget about thinkin' tryin' to free my mind  
  
You know I love Uncle Kracker he's a cool DJ  
I like Prince Purple Rain, Henry's Purple Haze  
I like Hank Williams Sr., Hank the third and his dad  
Hank Williams Jr. I mean he's bad  
Willie Nelson, Waylon too  
I like newgrass, bluegrass, and Emmylou  
I like Pete Seeger, Bob Seeger, Motorhead  
Natalie Cole, Neal Monroe, and the Grateful Dead  
You know I tri
