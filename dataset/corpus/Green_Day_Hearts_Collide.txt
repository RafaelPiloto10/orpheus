Love conquers every time  
When two hearts come to collide  
You're the card in my valentine  
And the candy hearts in my mind  
  
And true love is the rule  
And you're nobody's fool  
  
The ship's coming to the light  
And it was love at first sight  
Baby, babe, you're the light  
And the flame burns in my mind's eye  
  
When triumph bleeds into bliss  
And I knew it from the first kiss  
  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
  
When triumph bleeds into bliss  
And I knew it from the first kiss  
  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide.  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide.  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide.
