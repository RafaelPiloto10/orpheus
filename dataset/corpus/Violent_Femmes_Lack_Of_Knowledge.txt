I'm not doing something I'm supposed to do  
I'm doing something I'm not supposed to  
I don't know about that  
I don't know about that  
  
I don't know nothing bout nothing like that  
Destroyed my people are  
Destroyed my people are  
Destroyed for lack of knowledge  
  
I wonder if I'm happy  
Wonder if I'm mad  
I wonder why the whole wide world is so wonderfully sad  
I don't know bout that but I can tell you this  
  
That when I drink a lot of beer why'know I gotta piss off  
People should be pissed off  
People should be pissed off  
For lack of knowledge  
  
Read read read read read read read everything you can read and  
Learn learn learn learn learn learn learn everything you can learn  
'Cause there is no tomorrow like today  
And there is no today like tomorrow  
  
And they will stick you and they will stick you in the end
