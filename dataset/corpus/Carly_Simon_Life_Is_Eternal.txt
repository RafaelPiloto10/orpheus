I've been doing a lot of thinking  
About growing older and moving on  
Nobody wants to be told that they're getting on  
For a long, long stay  
But just how long and who knows  
And how and where my spirit will go  
Will it soar like Jazz on a saxophone  
Or evaporate on a breeze  
Won't you tell me please  
That life is eternal  
And love is immortal  
And death is only a horizon  
Life is eternal  
As we move into the light  
And a horizon is nothing  
Save the limit of our sight  
Save the limit of our sight  
  
Here on earth I'm a lost soul  
Ever trying to find my way back home  
Maybe that's why each new star is born  
Expanding heaven's room  
Eternity in bloom  
And will I see you up in that heaven  
In all it's light will I know you're there  
Will we say the things that we never dared  
If wishing makes it so  
Won't you let me know  
That life is eternal  
And love is immortal  
And death is only a horizon  
Life is eternal  
As we move into the light  
And a horizon is nothing  
Save the limit of our sight  
Save the limit of our sight
