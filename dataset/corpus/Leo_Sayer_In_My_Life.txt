Seen a lot of good times in my life  
Times when everything went so right  
Seen a lot of things go wrong and I just don't know why  
I've seen a lot of good times in my life  
Had a bit of sadness in my life  
Friend of mine went down the other night  
Tried to sort it out but now I just don't know why  
I've had a bit of sadness in my life  
You see I am a lonely, lonely, man  
And what I got, I got together with my own two hands  
And I wonder what am I gonna do to put things right  
I've seen a lot of good times in my life  
I've taken lots of chances in my life  
Now one of them has changed me overnight  
I've seen a glimpse of the other side  
The lights are much too bright  
I've taken lots of chances in my life  
You see I am a lonely, lonely, man  
And what I got, I got together with my own two hands  
And I wonder what am I gonna do to put these things right  
I've seen a lot of good times in my life  
I gotta do something with my life  
Gotta make a change and put up a fight  
Stand on my own two feet and do it right  
I gotta do something with my life  
You see I am a lonely, lonely, man  
And what I got, I got together with my own two hands  
And I wonder what am I gonna do to put things right  
I've seen a lot of good times in my life
