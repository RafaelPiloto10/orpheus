Well, I like you, I couldn't think of anything but you  
For a week I was in love with your hairdo  
I couldn't chew those muffins I used to  
I knew I was way over the moon  
When I met you, when I met you, I didn't know what to do.  
When I saw you, when I saw you you said:  
  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
I'm living in a box but I'm out when opportunity nox  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
I'm living in a box but I'm out when opportunity nox  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
I'm dying in a box but I'm out when opportunity rox on  
  
I'm sleeping and I'm dreaming so solo  
I saw you in the crowd in the front row  
You couldn't get it right in the disco  
You're dancing so much better in slo-mo  
When I met you, when I met you, I didn't know what to do.  
When I saw you, yeah, when I saw you, I said:  
  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
I'm living in a box but I'm out when opportunity nox  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
I'm living in a box but I'm out when opportunity nox  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
I'm dying in a box but I'm out when opportunity rox on
