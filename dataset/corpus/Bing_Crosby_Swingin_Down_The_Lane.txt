Everybody hand in hand  
Swingin' down the lane  
Everybody's feelin' grand  
Swingin' down the lane  
  
That's the time I miss that bliss  
That we might have known  
Nights like this when I'm all alone  
  
When the moon is on the rise  
Honey, I am so blue  
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes  
Like we used to do  
  
When the moon is on the way  
Still I'm waitin' all in vain  
Should be swingin' down that lane with you  
  
When the moon is on the rise  
Honey, I am so blue  
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes  
Like we used to do  
  
When the moon is on the way  
Still I'm waitin' all in vain  
Should be swingin' down that lane with you
