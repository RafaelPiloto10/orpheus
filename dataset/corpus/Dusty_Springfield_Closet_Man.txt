Your secret's safe inside me  
Closet man  
Safe under lock and key  
Understand  
What you're thinkin' is important  
Isn't really so, you'll see  
But your secret's absolutely safe with me  
Your lover's songs and nights  
Turn into tears  
Your tattoos and your muscles  
Disappear  
And the ring that I once gave you  
Now, you're wearin' in your ear  
But your secret's absolutely safe my dear  
Oh, your secret's safe with me  
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me  
Oh, your secret's safe with me  
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me  
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life  
So, come out into the light  
Closet man  
There's nothing new at all under the sun  
You've got company  
You're not the only one  
Why, it's older than religion  
And, quite honestly, more fun  
But your secret's absolutely safe my dear, don't worry  
Oh, your secret's safe with me  
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me  
Oh, your secret's safe with me  
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me  
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life  
So, come out into the light  
Closet man, yeah  
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life  
So, come out into the light  
Closet man  
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life  
So, come out into the light  
Closet man
