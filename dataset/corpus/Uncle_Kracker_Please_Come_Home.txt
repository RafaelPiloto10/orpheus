[Spoken:] it must have been about 100 years... at least 100 years... I wish
you could come back- just come back home.  
The day we met feels like 100 years ago  
And I'm still waiting with my hand right by the telephone.  
Yeah maybe where you are you cannot make that call  
Or you can't find a pen, I know its not your fault.  
My friends think I'm insane cause I've turned old and gray  
And I'm still waiting and I cannot be alone.  
Please come home  
Please come home.  
I watch the clock hands tick, my hours turn to days.  
And I can't fall asleep cause I don't want to miss that ring.  
I know that this year that your car will park outside,  
But I can't put my arms around the girl who took my life.  
My friends think I'm insane cause I've turned old and gray  
And I'm still waiting and I cannot be alone.  
Please come home  
Oooh baby,please come home.  
[Spoken:] its been so long, its been about 100 years and a million dreams
since the last time I saw your pretty face.  
I would do whatever it takes.  
I would wait another hundred years, and if that didn't work, maybe i would try
and see what forever feels like. but until then, and I Know you hear me, and
whatever your doin, wherever you are, please come home.  
The day we met feels like 100 years ago,  
And I'm still waiting for you  
Baby Baby, won't you please come home.  
Please come home.  
Won't you please come home.  
Please come home
