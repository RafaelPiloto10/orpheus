Look what you have done,  
Ruined every single one.  
See what fools they are,  
Jealous of a simple star.  
  
Feel the 4 winds blow,  
Let the sword hang low (baby)  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
To tell the sucking truth,  
Everybody's dreams get used.  
  
Twist me till I drip,  
Liquid of emotions ripped.  
  
Every hungry soul,  
Hides a hungry fool (baby)  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
Feel the 4 winds blow,  
Let the sword hang low (baby)  
  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
Should be happy  
Should be happy
