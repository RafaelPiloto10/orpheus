I visit Mr. Frump in the hospital  
I see him most every day  
And when I see Mr. Frump in his iron lung  
This is what I hear him say  
  
why'know, Mr. Frump is my very best friend  
He's never a chump or a tease  
He never tells me lies, and best of all  
He never disagrees  
  
I bring him candy and flowers every afternoon  
Sit down by his side and say "Hi"  
And then I ask him his opinion of the world situation  
And I wait for Mr. Frump's reply, and Mr. Frump would say  
  
Well, unfortunately, soon it came to be  
Mr. Frump's dying day  
And now I bring to you the very last thing  
That Mr. Frump had to say....  
  
(deep breathing, that fades and dies off)  
  
Amen
