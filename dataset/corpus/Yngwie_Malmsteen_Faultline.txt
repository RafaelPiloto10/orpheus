Something deep inside, far from reality  
We pretend it never crossed our mind  
we feel but never sense  
Building up a strong defense  
Some say it's our destiny, Lord...  
We're living on the faultline  
Get out of here  
Cry the prophets of our time  
Fear the signs  
Save those you love and all your children  
You life depends on castles in the sand  
Don't look back there is no promised land  
We don't want to hear that this could be the day  
So much for science fiction  
as you always say  
But soon the day will come  
It's only just begun  
For the people on the faultline  
it's no use to pray  
Why living in danger  
We're living on the faultline  
Get out of here  
Cry the prophets of our time  
Fear the signs  
Save those you love and all your children  
You life depends on castles in the sand  
Don't look back there is no promised land  
We don't want to hear that this could be the day  
So much for science fiction  
as you always say  
But soon the day will come  
It's only just begun  
For the people on the faultline  
it's no use to pray  
Why living in danger  
Why living in danger, danger
