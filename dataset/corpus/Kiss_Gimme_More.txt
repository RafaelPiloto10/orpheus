Live wire on the loose, white fire gotta move  
Hot blood, need your love, hard as rock, can't get enough  
Wanna feel you deep inside, pumpin' through my veins, fill you to the core  
Let me take you through the night, heaven knows no pain, open up the door  
Gimme more, ooh gimme more, baby gimme more, ooh  
  
Like a dog to a bone, make you sweat, make you moan  
Love is sweet, so insane, come on lick my candy cane  
Passion in the third degree, burning in my brain, slave to love's desire  
Livin', lovin', feel the heat, never to be tamed, born to play with fire  
  
Gimme more, ooh gimme more, baby gimme more, ooh, yeah yeah  
  
Ah, listen - touch my body, take it slow, c'mon make my juices flow  
Feelin' good, any price, ooh nothin' I won't sacrifice  
Got a thirst for playin' rough, I can't get my fill, never keepin' score  
C'mon baby, let me in, gonna break your will, open up the door  
  
Gimme more, ooh gimme more, baby gimme more, ooh, I want you  
  
C'mon and gimme, gimme more, gimme, gimme more, gimme, gimme, ooh
