Every year when summer comes round, off to the sea I go.  
I don't care if I do spend a pound, I'm rather rash I know.  
See me dressed like all the sports, in my blazer and a pair of shorts.  
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock, along the promenade I stroll.  
It may be sticky but I never complain, it's nice to have a nibble at it now
and again  
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock.  
  
One afternoon the band conductor up on his stand  
Somehow lost his baton - it flew out of his hand  
So I jumped in his place and then conducted the band  
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock  
  
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock,  
Along the promenade I stroll,  
In my pocket it got stuck I could tell  
Cause when I pulled it out I pulled my shirt off as well  
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock.  
  
A girl while bathing clung to me, my wits had to use  
She cried, "I'm drowning, and to save me, you won't refuse"  
I said, "Well if you're drowning then I don't want to lose  
My little stick of Blackpool Rock. "  
  
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock,  
Along the promenade I stroll  
In the ballroom I went dancing each night  
No wonder every girl that danced with me, stuck to me tight  
  
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock.  
A fellow took my photograph it cost one and three.  
I said when it was done, "Is that supposed to be me?"  
"You've properly mucked it up the only thing I can see is  
My little stick of Blackpool Rock. "
