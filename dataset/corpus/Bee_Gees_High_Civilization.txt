Cryin' in the streets  
They run for their lives  
How can you lead them to heaven  
They don't realize  
Children of the night  
How far can we fall  
That which we say is forever  
Ain't no time at all  
  
Father and the son  
Not too young to be old  
Reach out for each other when  
The world goes cold  
Feel so good to be home  
Are you ready for  
  
[Chorus:]  
My high civilization  
Are you ready for  
My high civilization  
Are you ready for  
My high civilization  
Civilization  
  
Everything for us to see  
The ultimate society  
  
Keeper of the sword  
You fight for your rights  
How can you live for the hour  
When there's no yesterday  
Dyin' in the streets  
Your number your name  
All that which keeps us together  
Is bringing us the pain  
  
Thunder of the guns  
Comes the criminal mind  
Working for the power of  
The evil eye  
We are never alone  
Uncivilized  
  
[Chorus]  
  
New York, Paris, Tokyo  
Vienna to Berlin  
Baby don't know you  
L.A., Rome, Afghanistan  
Cairo to Iran  
No city can hold you  
There's no one in Avalon to show you  
Minutes into seconds are you ready  
For the end  
  
[Chorus]
