One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret  
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget  
One little heartache left as a token  
One little plaything carelessly broken  
Remember the night  
The night you said, "I love you"  
Remember?  
Remember you vowed  
By all the stars above you  
Remember?  
Remember we found a lonely spot  
And after I learned to care a lot  
You promised that you'd forget me not  
But you forgot  
To remember  
[2]  
Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day  
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was  
May  
But soon the Maytime turned to December  
You had forgotten, do you remember?
