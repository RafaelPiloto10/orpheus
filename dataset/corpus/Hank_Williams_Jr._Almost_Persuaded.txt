Now this ain't no cheating song, cause I didn't do nothing  
Last night all alone in a honky tonk barroom  
I met a girl with a drink of beam in her hand  
She had ruby red lips and coal black, black hair  
And eyes that would tempt any honky tonk man  
Then she came and sat down at my table  
And as she placed her soft hands in mine  
I found myself wanting to kiss her  
For temptation was flowing like cheap honky tonk wine  
  
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride  
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside  
  
Then we danced and she whispered I need you  
Take me away from here and be my big ol' southern man  
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw that look and  
I saw something else the reflection of my wedding band  
  
And I was almost persuaded to stip myself of my pride  
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home  
  
That was really hard to do
