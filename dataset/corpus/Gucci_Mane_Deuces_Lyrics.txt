(Dj drama)  
You know when you drive fast cars?  
You feeling easy and throw the peace sign up  
Shawty full of drama like gansta grizz-iles (x3)  
  
(Gucci)  
She on my pimp c, I'm pouring dueces  
We had a boy b but shawty screwed this.  
Don't try to fix this because it's usless  
I surely aint broke, I need a new bitch  
I got a main chick and a mistress  
They think they fancy, very expensive  
I'm like some new money, told my extra trade me  
Perferably in my A flexing south beach  
I'm corriside front row waitin chris bosch  
Bron and gucci mane diamonds match her lip gloss  
I know my ex can see me and she pissed off.  
I told her keep the memories bitch get lost  
Bitch kick rocks, I got them sick rocks  
Throw them dueces up just to show my show wrist watch  
(Bling blow)just to show my wrist watch  
Throw them dueces up just to show my six watch  
  
(Chirs brown)  
I'm on some new shit  
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her  
I'm moving on to something better, better, better  
No more tryin to make it work  
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her [x2]
