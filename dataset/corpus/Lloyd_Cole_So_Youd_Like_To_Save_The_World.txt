So you'd like to save the world  
I suggest you take one person at a time  
And start with me  
Not an ordinary girl  
Not someone that I should rear upon  
And ask hey what you sign baby  
Have you been reading my mind  
Nothing more or less to rest will  
Could I keep you in mind  
Did you really cry  
Then you saw the hole in the sky  
Did you really hold your head  
And hide your eyes  
That's alright  
You might call it ultraviolet radiation  
It's only sunlight  
So you'd like to save my world  
If you could free my inner child  
And I could free your inambition baby  
Or would you like to mother me  
I love the way you wear that motorola generation cheek mama  
So you'd like to save the world  
I'd really like to help you  
I'd really like to be you for a while  
Is that alright  
And I could call it ultraviolet radiation  
It's only sunlight  
Don't you know  
It's only sunlight  
It's only sunlight  
But you might call it ultraviolet radiation
