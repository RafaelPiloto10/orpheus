I may run and hide  
When you're screamin' my name, alright  
But let me tell you now  
There are prices to fame, alright  
All of our time spent in flashes of light  
  
[Chorus]  
All you people can't you see, can't you see  
How your love's affecting our reality  
Every time we're down  
You can make it right  
And that makes you larger than life  
  
Looking at the crowd  
And I see your body sway, c'mon  
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon  
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All of your time spent keeps us alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, every time we're down  
Yeah, you can make it right  
Yeah, and that's what makes you larger than life  
  
[Chorus]
