Now you been holding me down mm  
For such a long time now  
From back then to now in my story  
Straight from the hood  
You've always been there for me  
  
And you had my back when they  
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything  
It was you that kept me holding on  
No matter what was going on  
So whatever you need I got you yaa  
  
Reminiscing that 6 train from way back  
Now it's sky blue Phantoms and stretch Maybachs  
For sweepin' them floors in them Bronx apartments  
Mira esta que ta on the red carpet  
When Pun died you was the first to call me  
I never told you  
But you was there for me  
Whatever you need, I be there for you  
Crack, I got ya back, for real, true story  
  
Now my loyalty will always be  
With you if you just promise me  
That you'll stay real just like you are  
'cause baby you don't have to change no  
  
You don't know how much you mean to me  
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me  
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down

The realest frechest from BX to South beach

You can count on me  
  
So remember this whenever I call  
We go back too far, we been through it all  
Even though, we haven't spoken so long  
Ain't nothing change, not a damn thing baby

Get between me and J-Lo

You better off sweepin' leaves on a windy day  
  
So I don't care about the situation

If there's a complication  
'cause every time you had my back and all  
When we were young  
And now you're Joey Crack and all
