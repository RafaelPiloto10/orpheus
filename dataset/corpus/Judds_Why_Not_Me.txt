You've been lookin' for love all around the world  
Baby, don't you know this country girl's still free?  
Why not me?  
Well, you've finally come down to your old hometown  
Your Kentucky girl's been waiting patiently  
Why not me?  
  
[Chorus]  
Why not me on a rainy day?  
Why not me to love your cares away?  
Why not me?  
Why not me when the nights get cold?  
Why not me when you're growin' old?  
Why not me?  
  
You've been searchin' from here to Singapore  
Ain't it time that you notice the girl next door, baby  
Why not me?  
You had to see if the world was round  
It's time that you learned how good settlin' down could be  
Why not me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You've been lookin' for love all around the world  
Baby, don't you know this country girl's still free?  
  
You've been lookin' for love all around the world  
Baby, don't you know this country girl's still free?  
  
Baby, why not me?
