Who draws the crowd?  
Who plays so loud?  
Baby it's the guitar man  
Who's gonna steal the show  
You know baby it's the guitar man  
He can make you love he can make you cry  
He will bring you down he will get you high  
Something keeps him going  
Miles and miles away  
To find another place to play  
And night after night who treats you right  
Baby it's the guitar man  
Who's on the radio?  
You know baby it's the guitar man  
When he comes to town and you see his face  
And you think you might like to take his place  
Something keeps him drifting miles and miles away  
Searching for the songs to play  
Then you listen to the music and you'd like to sing along  
And you want to get the meaning out of each and every song  
And you find yourself a message and some words to call your own and take 'em
home  
  
He can make you love he can get you high  
He will bring you down he will make you cry  
Something keeps him moving  
But no one seems to know  
What it is that makes him go  
Then the lights begin to flicker and the sound is getting dim  
The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin  
But he never seems to notice he's just got to find another place to play  
(Fade away)  
(Got to play)  
(Fade away)
