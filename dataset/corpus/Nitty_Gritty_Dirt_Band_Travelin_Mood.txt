Feelin' kinda sad and lonely  
I lost my sweet one and only  
Gonna find my baby I don't mean no maybe  
Gonna find her  
Gonna find my baby gonna her home to me  
She said that she would never leave me  
Now she's gone away and it grieves me  
I was fast a-sleepin' when she come a-midnight creepin'  
Gonna find her  
Gonna find my baby gonna bring her home with me  
My bags are packed for to travel  
Gonna cover many miles of gravel  
Gonna find my baby 'cause she's the finest lady  
Gonna find her  
Gonna find my baby gonna bring her home with me  
Going down Texas going to Georgia  
Oklahoma, Mississippi border  
Going to Alabammy going to Louisiana, Tennessee  
I'm a-gonna find my baby gonna bring her home with me  
Gonna find my baby gonna bring home with me  
(she heard the sky was fallin')  
I'm a-gonna find my baby gonna bring her with me
