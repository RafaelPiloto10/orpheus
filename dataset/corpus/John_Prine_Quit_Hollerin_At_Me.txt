I don't want your big French Fry  
I don't want your car  
I don't want to buy no soap  
From no washed-up movie star  
You are so much louder  
Than the show I want to hear  
With your sugarless gum  
Gee, but I'm dumb  
Non-alcoholic beer  
It's enough to make a grown man  
Blow up his own TV  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Quit hollerin' at me  
I heard you the first time  
I heard myself say  
Seems like the little woman  
Is getting bigger every day  
You don't have to tell the neighbors  
A little silence ain't no sin  
They already think my name is  
Where in the hell you been?  
Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder  
Constantly  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Sweet Serenity  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Ain't it great at the end of the day  
When there ain't no sound around  
Just me and the fence post  
Staring each other down  
Nothing but a big bunch of nothing  
Driving me insane  
Cause there ain't no voice that's louder  
Than the one inside my brain  
Hey you go on  
Go on and let me be  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Sweet Serenity  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Quit hollerin' at me  
Quit hollerin' at me
