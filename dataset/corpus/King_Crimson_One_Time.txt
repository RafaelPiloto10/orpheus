One eye goes laughing,  
One eye goes crying  
Through the trials and trying of one life  
One hand is tied,  
One step gets behind  
In one breath we're dying  
  
I've been waiting for the sun to come up  
Waiting for the showers to stop  
Waiting for the penny to drop  
One time  
  
And I've been standing in a cloud of plans  
Standing on the shifting sands  
Hoping for an open hand  
One time
