When I' m feelin' down  
I do a little dance  
Beyond the wall of tears  
There is a second chance.  
  
In the city, in the meadow  
In the village, in the park  
On the highway, in the jungle  
I wanna take your hand in mine.  
  
When I am feelin' sad  
I sing a little song  
Beyond the wall of tears  
Nobody' s right or wrong  
  
In the city, in the meadow  
In the village, in the park  
On the highway, in the jungle  
I wanna take your hand in mine.  
  
If our hands are tied  
We're gonna cut the rope  
Together you and me  
Dance the dance of hope!  
  
In the city, in the meadow  
In the village, in the park  
On the highway, in the jungle  
I wanna take your hand in mine  
I wanna take your hand in mine.
