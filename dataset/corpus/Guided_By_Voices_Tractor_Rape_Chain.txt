Why is it every time I think about you  
Something that you have said or implied makes me doubt you  
Then I look into your cynical eyes and I know it  
As if it never meant anything to me  
  
Parallel lines on a slow decline  
Tractor rape chain  
Better yet, let's all get wet on the tractor rape chain  
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end  
  
In the first place it's probably just paranoia  
But there's a ghost in my room and he says I better run  
It's a thing I know  
It's a thing I believe in  
Won't you tell it to go away?
