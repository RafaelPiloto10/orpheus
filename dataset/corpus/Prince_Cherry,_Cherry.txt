Cherry, Cherry  
Rozanda was her real name  
But Cherry was her chosen one  
Everybody said that she'd soon be dead  
But Cherry replied "At least I had some fun" (Oh yes)  
  
Her eyes were like a pool of 24 karat diamonds  
I was the last in a long line of foolish men who dived in  
  
Chorus:  
Cherry, Cherry  
I think about you every rising sun  
Whoa Cherry, Cherry  
Wherever you are, I hope U're havin' fun (Oh yes)  
  
Tuesday was my big game  
North vs. Central in basketball  
Underneath their long coats  
Cherry and the girls wore camisoles  
Every time North would run the hoop  
Cherry would flash 'em and they would fall  
But not as hard as I fell  
When Cherry gave me her number and told me 2 call (you should call me)  
  
Using all the money her boyfriend Wilbur gave her, she'd buy  
Anything I wanted, that's why my baby's so fly  
  
Chorus  
  
(Do do do do do)  
Me and Cherry got married  
And tried our best 2 keep it on the down low, the down low  
  
I was combing her hair  
The day that Wilbur called and cussed her on the phone  
He beat her up real bad and figured I was gonna leave her  
Instead I bought a 45 and set out 2 relieve her (Take him out)  
If he was taken out then he could never harm another  
No sooner than I got there, I was met by Cherry's mother cryin'  
  
Cherry, Cherry  
Every night I ask the Lord why? Oh why?  
Cherry, Cherry  
Another victim of a suicide (Why oh why?)  
Why?  
  
Cherry, Cherry  
I think about you every rising sun  
Whoa Cherry, Cherry  
Wherever you are, I hope U're havin' fun  
I hope U're having fun, baby  
  
Cherry, Cherry  
I'd give anything 2 kiss you  
Cherry, Cherry  
I guess I just miss you  
Cherry
