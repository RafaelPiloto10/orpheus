Yeah, yeaaayh, yeah heh, yeah heh, yeah heh...  
See the road to hell, is paved with good intentions  
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention  
Have they helped you out, you're such a hopeless victim  
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional  
All their talk, seasoned to perfection  
The road they walk, commanding your affection  
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation  
An opportunity, to further situation  
Why they so important, is without explanation  
Please don't patrionize me, Mr. Intentional  
Oh, ohhh, ohh ohhh  
We give rise to ego, by being insecure  
The advice that we go, desperatly searching for  
The subconscious effort, to support our paramour  
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature  
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional  
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional  
Stuck in a system, that seeks to suck your blood  
Held emotionally hostage, by what everybody does  
Counting all the money, that you give them just because  
Exploiting ignorance, in the name of love  
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was  
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional  
Oh undementional, Mr. Intentional  
Ohhh, oh don't you do me any favors  
Ohhh, ohhhh, ohh ohhhh  
Wake up you've been sleeping  
Take up your bed and walk  
Stop blaming other people  
Oh it's nobody else's fault  
Except the truth about you  
You know that life goes on without you  
And your expensive misinventions  
Disguising your intentions  
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional  
Oh, oh oh oh  
See I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional  
The only help I need to live, is unprofessional  
The only wealth I have to give, is not material  
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available  
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional  
Oh I don't need your sympthy, Mr. Intentional  
Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional  
So undementional, Mr. Promotional, Mr. Emotional, Mr. Intentional  
Ohhh ohhhh, ohhhh
