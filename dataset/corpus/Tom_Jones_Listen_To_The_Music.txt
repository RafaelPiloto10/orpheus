Don't you feel it growin', day by day  
People gettin' ready for the news  
Some are happy, some are sad  
Got to let the music play  
  
What the people need  
Is a way to make 'em smile  
Ain't so hard to do if you know how  
  
Gotta get a message  
Get it on through  
Got to let the music play  
Let the music play  
Let the music play  
  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
All the time  
Let the music play  
  
Well I know, you know better, everything I say  
Meet me in the country for a day  
We'll be happy and we'll dance  
We're gonna dance the blues away  
  
If I'm feelin' good to you and you're feelin' good to me  
There ain't nothin' we can't do or say  
Feelin' good, feelin' fine  
Gonna let the music play  
Let the music play  
Let the music play  
  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
(Oh, yeah)  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
(Don't it make you feel good)  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
All the time  
  
Like a lazy flowing river  
Surrounding castles in the sky  
The crowd is getting bigger  
Listenin' for the happy sounds  
I've got to let them fly  
  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
All the time  
(Listen to the music, now)  
  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
All the time  
  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
All the time  
  
Music is my sanctuary  
Music is my life  
Music is my sanctuary  
Music is my life  
  
Music is my sanctuary  
Music is my life  
Music is my sanctuary  
Music is my life
