Well I'm up here in this womb  
I'm lookin' all around  
Hmm mm mm  
Well I'm lookin' out my belly button window  
And I see a whole lot of frowns  
And I'm wonderin' if they don't want me, around  
  
What seems to be the fuss out there  
Just what seems to be the hang  
Cause you know if you don't want me this time around  
Yeah, I'll be glad to go back to spirit land  
And even take a longer rest  
Before a comin' down the shoot again  
Man I sure remember the last time, baby  
They were still talkin' about me then  
So if you don't want me now  
Make up your mind  
Where or when  
Make up your mind  
If you don't want me now  
Give or take  
You only got two-hundred days  
Cause I ain't comin' down this way too much more, again  
  
You know they got pills for ills, and thrills, and even spills  
But I think your just a little too late  
So I'm comin' down into this world daddy  
Regardless of love and hate  
I'm gonna sit up in your bed mamma  
And just a grin right in your face  
And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates  
Ha, and say I hope I'm not too late  
  
If there's any questions make up your mind  
Give or take  
If there's any questions make up your mind  
Give or take  
You got only two-hundred days  
  
And I'm lookin' out my belly button window  
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns  
And I won't live if they don't want me, around
