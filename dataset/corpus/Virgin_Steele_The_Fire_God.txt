ELEKTRA:  
Cursed by the Priests, torn, twisted and beat  
Sentenced to die, by the Sorceress-her Evil Eye  
God of the Furnace, I call thy Name  
Please deliver me from the Serpent, the Serpent of Pain  
  
THE FIRE GOD, THE FIRE GOD  
Burn all the Sinners in my way  
  
Rise up devour-Inferno of Ultimate Power  
God of Destruction-consume them with your Eruption  
Inflame the Sorceress and the Priests of Evil who bind me  
Singe them, Burn them, Destroy them  
Please, please deliver me  
With Holy Fire, the Golden Pyre... Death  
THE FIRE GOD, THE FIRE GOD  
Burn all the Sinners in my way  
  
Kill, eradicate with Fire and Sword!  
Flames of Vindication!  
I impale thee on the Great Spike of Hatred  
By the FLAMES OF THE BLACK STAR!!!  
  
THE FIRE GOD, THE FIRE GOD  
I call thy Name, consume my pain!  
Burn all the Sinners Beyond Death... Beyond Death!!!
