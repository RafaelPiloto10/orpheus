I had to make you mine  
I've wasted all this time  
You know that I'm so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I'm telling all the world  
That you're my little girl  
You know I must be mad  
Just to have your love  
  
When I dream of you  
All my dreams come true  
You are my night, my day  
I'm lost when you're away  
Can you hear my heart  
It's calling you (it's calling you)  
Oh girl, oh little girl  
  
I had to make you mine  
I've wasted all this time  
You know that I'm so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I'm telling all the world  
That you're my little girl  
You know I must be mad  
Just to have your love  
  
I thought you'd like to know  
You've heard this all before  
So even if I'm wrong  
I'm right where I belong  
Can't you hear my heart  
It's calling you (it's calling you)  
Oh girl, oh little girl  
  
I had to make you mine  
I've wasted all this time  
You know that I'm so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I had to tell the world  
That you're my little girl  
You know I must be mad  
Just to have your love  
  
I had to make you mine  
I've wasted all this time  
You know that I'm so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I had to make you mine  
I had to make you mine
