You, bastard fan  
You always speak badly about me  
Hoping in a new Pele  
Receiving just new Ireland  
You want the worst for me 'cause I know you say  
She makes good songs just when she's in pain  
Shame on you baby!  
You hope in my misfortunes  
And you think of what pain can makes me turn back to write good songs  
Sorry for the disappointment but in the family we are all good  
  
My father's well  
He's not dying today  
My mother's well  
She's not dying today  
My face is OK, so they say to me  
But don't worry 'cause it will not die today  
Maybe tomorrow somewhere  
  
Hi ears with feet  
Or I could say ears with six feet under  
You hope the beekeeper comes to take someone  
Shame on you  
I can do good songs if I'm happy too.such as goodbye pieces  
OK it's not a good example  
  
Mary Magdalene's alive and  
Not dying today  
Matt and john are OK  
They're not dying today  
Mac Aladdin is good too, I know you're sad about  
But he's not dying today  
Beenie lost her sunset but not dying today  
My career is on a thread but not dying today  
My face is OK, so they say to me  
But don't worry 'cause it will not die today
