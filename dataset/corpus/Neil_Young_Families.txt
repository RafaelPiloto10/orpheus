When you try to bring our spirit home  
Won't you celebrate our lives  
In a way that's right for our children  
And families  
  
When you write your songs about us  
Won't you try to do us justice  
Because we want to be just like you  
And your families  
  
I see a light ahead  
There's a chill wind blowin' in my head  
I wish that I was home instead  
With my family  
  
There's a universe between us now  
But I want to reach out and tell you  
How much you mean to me  
And my family  
  
I'm goin' back to the USA  
I just got my ticket today  
I can't wait to see you again  
In the USA.
