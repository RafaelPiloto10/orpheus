There's been some hard feelings here  
About some words that were said  
There's been some hard feelings here  
And what is more  
There's been a bloody purple nose  
And some bloody purple clothes  
That were messing up the lobby floor  
It's just apartment house rules  
So all you 'partment fools  
Remember: one man's ceiling  
Is another man's floor  
Remember: one man's ceiling  
Is another man's floor  
  
There's been some strange goin's on  
And some folks have come and gone  
And the elevator man don't work no more  
I heard a racket in the hall  
And I thought I heard a fall  
But I never opened up my door  
It's just apartment house sense  
It's like apartment rents  
Remember: one man's ceiling  
Is another man's floor  
Remember: one man's ceiling  
Is another man's floor  
  
And there's an alley  
In the back of my building  
Where some people congregate in shame  
I was walking with my dog  
And the night was black with smog  
When I thought I heard somebody  
Call my name
