Time has come  
Start your search for tomorrow  
No escape  
From that long trail of sorrow  
You don't know how it keeps goin' on, oh no  
  
Wake up out of misty dreams  
Evil drug is starting to grab you, to grab you  
  
Step out of hell, demons dancing 'round your brain  
Step out of hell, streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell, go on like this you're gonna be dead  
Step out of hell, take my heand I want to help (but can I?)  
  
You did your best  
To keep yourself down  
Give it a rest  
And just turn around!  
It's only a one way street of lies, yes it is!  
  
Living in a twilight zone  
Get away out of that drug jungle, that drug jungle  
  
Step out of hell, demons dancing 'round your brain  
Step out of hell, streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell, go on like this you're gonna be dead  
Step out of hell, take my heand I want to help you  
  
Another line, have a good time, you don't mind  
To turn your brain inside out  
To serve the final right  
  
Step out of hell, demons dancing 'round your brain  
Step out of hell, streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell, go on like this you're gonna be dead  
Step out of hell, take my hand I want to help you!
