I'm just a mutt  
And nowhere is my home  
Where dignity's a land mine  
In the school of lost hope  
I've panhandled for a life because  
I'm not afraid to beg  
Hand me down your lost and founds  
Of second hand regret  
You better swallow your pride  
Or you're gonna choke on it  
You better digest your values  
Because they turn to shit  
Honor's gonna knock you down  
Before your chance to stand up and fight  
I know I'm not the one  
I got no pride  
Sects of disconnection  
And traditions of lost faith  
No culture's worth a stream of piss  
Or a bullet in my face  
To hell with unity  
Separation's gonna kill us all  
Torn to shreds and disjointed  
Before the final fall
