Ya oh  
I was juz told  
You get your freedom  
By telling you're enemy  
That  
You'll do anything to get you're freedom  
Then you'll get it  
Its the only way you'll get it  
When you get that kinda attitude  
Then they label you as a crazy negro  
Or they'll just call you a crazy nigga  
They dun say negro  
Or they'll call you an extremest or a subversive  
Or a sedetiast  
Or a red or a radical  
But when you stay radical long enough  
And get enough people to like you  
You'll get your freedom  
So dun run around here trying  
To to make friends with someone who will deprive you of you're rights  
There not you're friends  
No, there you're enemy's  
And treat them like that  
And fight them  
And you'll get you're freedom  
And after you get you're freedom you're enemy will respect you  
And well respect you  
And I say that with no hate  
Cause I dun have no hate in me  
I have no hate at all  
So I say to you  
Big man I'm the man you think you are  
If you want to no what ill do  
Figure out what you'll do and ill do the same only more of it  
Nigga
