Hold on girl, now don't be blue,  
Dry those tears for me and you,  
Can't you see our love is true, when you remember,  
To do just what you say you'll do, can't you see I live for you?  
And I need you to trust me too, open your eyes.  
So the sun can shine lights in you, will light on your windows,  
And change all your baby blues to golden sparks that light your eyes,  
When you finally realize that your fears were all just lies,  
So open those eyes and let the sun shine lights in you,  
Light on your windows and take all your baby blues.
