Well, it's cold here in the quiet  
Drowning in the silence  
Of everythign I wish we used to be  
So many chances wasted  
And kisses left untasted  
So much that still burns inside of me  
  
I kept reaching out, only to be shut down  
But now the truth is giving me away  
  
I've been running, yeah, I've been running  
But now I'm coming to my senses  
  
I am humble by your splendor  
Awash in sweet surrender  
A thousand miles beyond the road to gone  
Well, I'm tired of being lonely  
And you're longing to show me  
All that I've been missing much too long  
  
And like a warm and tender wind,  
I'm spellbound as I breathe you in  
And I know that you can see  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You and I could spend forever  
Making up for time together  
  
Pull me in and don't you fight it  
You and I, yeah, we're both inside it  
  
Make my broken heart reborn  
Take me over like a raging storm  
  
Say goodbye, time to surrender  
Follow me to the edge of forever
