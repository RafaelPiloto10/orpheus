One day a mother  
Come to a prison  
To see an 'erring  
But precious son  
She told the warden  
How much she loved him  
It did not matter  
What he had done  
  
[Chorus]  
She did not bring to him  
(Bring to him)  
Parole or pardon  
(Pardon free)  
She brought no silver  
(Brought no gold)  
No pomp nor style  
(Him to see)  
It was a halo  
(Halo bright)  
Sent down from heaven  
(Heaven's light)  
The sweetest gift  
(A mother's smile)  
  
Her boy had wandered  
Far from the far side  
Though she had pleaded  
With him each night  
But not a word did  
She ever utter  
That told her heartaches  
Her smile was bright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She left a smile  
You can remember  
She's gone to heaven  
From heartache's free  
Them bars around you  
Will never change her  
He was her baby  
An error will be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was a halo bright  
Sent down from heaven's light  
The sweetest gift  
A mother's smile
