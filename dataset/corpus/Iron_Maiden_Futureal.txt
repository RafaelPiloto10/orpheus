I'm running out of my time  
I'm running out of breath  
And now it's getting so  
I can't sleep at night  
In the day, feel like death  
  
I'm getting in far too deep  
I feel them closing in  
I've got to say that I'm scared  
I know they'll win  
Even so, I'm prepared  
  
Do you believe, what you hear  
Can you believe, what you see  
Do you believe, what you feel  
Can you believe  
  
What is real?  
Futureal  
What is real?  
Futureal  
  
Whenever anyone seems  
To treat me like a freak  
It makes me see I'm the  
Only one who feels  
That I know what is real  
  
Sometimes it feels like a game  
Of deadly hide and seek  
And when you're reading this  
Then I'll be gone  
Maybe then, you will see
