I never fail to count my blessing when each day is done  
But I always wait and count you last 'cause you're my greatest one  
And I ask God to let me be with you till my life ends  
'Cause I wanna stay here in your arms as long as I can.  
  
We're gonna stay here, we wanna stay here  
We're gonna stay in each others arms as long as we can  
We're gonna live with no regrets, loving each other like the day we met  
And we're gonna stay in each other arms as long as we can.  
  
I could never ask for love no greater than you share  
To me I'd find no better love if I search every place  
You'll alway be my only love just like it's always been  
'Cause I wanna stay here in your arms as long as I can.  
  
We're gonna stay here, we wanna stay here  
We're gonna stay in each others arms as long as we can  
We're gonna live with no regrets, loving each other like the day we met  
And we're gonna stay in each other arms as long as we can.  
  
We're gonna stay in each other arms as long as we can...
