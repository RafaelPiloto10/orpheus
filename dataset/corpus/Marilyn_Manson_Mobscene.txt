"Ladies and Gentlemen"  
We are the thing of shapes to come  
Your freedom's not free and dumb  
This Depression is Great  
The Deformation Age, they know my name  
Waltzing to scum and base and  
Married to the pain  
  
Bang we want it  
Bang we want it  
Bang bang bang bang bang  
You came to see the mobscene  
I know it isn't your scene  
It's better than a sex scene and it's  
So fucking obscene, obscene yeah.  
  
Girls (in the spirit of Oscar Wilde)  
Be obscene, be be obscene  
Be obscene, baby, and not heard.  
The day that love opened our eyes  
We watched the world end  
  
We have "high" places but we have no friends  
They told us sin's not good but we know it's great  
War-time full-frontal drugs, sex-tank armor plate  
  
Bang we want it  
Bang we want it  
Bang bang bang bang bang  
You came to see the mobscene  
I know it isn't your scene  
It's better than a sex scene and it's  
So fucking obscene, obscene yeah.  
  
You want commitment?  
Put on your best suit, get your arms around me  
Now we're going down down down  
You want commitment?  
Put on your best suit, get your arms around me  
Now we're going down down down  
  
Girls(in the spirit of Oscar Wilde):  
Be obscene, be be obscene  
Be obscene, baby, and not heard.  
You came to see the mobscene  
I know it isn't your scene  
It's better than a sex scene and it's  
So fucking obscene, obscene yeah.  
  
You want commitment?  
Put on your best suit, get your arms around me  
Now we're going down down down  
You want commitment?  
Put on your best suit, get your arms around me  
Now we're going down down down  
"Ladies and gentlemen, be obscene! Be be obscene!"  
Girls(in the spirit of Oscar Wilde)  
Be obscene, be be obscene  
Be obscene, baby, and not heard.  
Bang bang bang bang bang.
