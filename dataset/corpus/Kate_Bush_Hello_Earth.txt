"Hello Earth"  
  
"Columbia now nine times the speed of sound."  
"Roger that, Dan, I've got a solid TACAN  
locked on, uh, TACAN twenty-three."  
"The, uh, tracking data, map data and pre-planned  
trajectory are all one line on the block"  
"Roger your block decoded recorded"  
  
Hello, Earth.  
Hello, Earth.  
With just one hand held up high  
I can blot you out,  
Out of sight.  
  
Peek-a-boo,  
Peek-a-boo, little Earth.  
With just my heart and my mind  
I can be driving,  
Driving home,  
And you asleep  
On the seat.  
  
I get out of my car,  
Step into the night  
And look up at the sky.  
And there's something bright,  
Traveling fast.  
Look at it go!  
Look at it go!  
  
("Listen!")  
  
Watching storms  
Start to form  
Over America.  
Can't do anything.  
Just watch them swing  
With the wind  
Out to sea.  
  
All you sailors,  
("Get out of the waves! Get out of the water!")  
All life-savers,  
("Get out of the waves! Get out of the water!")  
All you cruisers,  
("Get out of the waves! Get out of the water!")  
All you fishermen,  
Head for home.  
  
Go to sleep, little Earth.  
I was there at the birth,  
Out of the cloudburst,  
The head of the tempest.  
Murderer!  
Murder of calm.  
Why did I go?  
Why did I go?  
  
"Tiefer, tiefer.  
Irgendwo in der Tiefe  
Gibt es ein licht."  
  
Go to sleep little Earth.
