At last I've awakened to see what you've done.  
All I can do is pack up and run.  
Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.  
You said that you loved me. I was yours to command.  
Your kind of loving, my heart couldn't stand.  
You played me for a fool. Find yourself another fool.  
And now, now that we're through, you say you wished you'd be true.  
Oh, but deep down in my heart, I know our love could never grow.  
And now, now that we're through, you say you wished you'd be true.  
Oh, but deep down in my heart, I know our love will never grow.  
At last I've awakened to see what you've done.  
All I can do is pack up and run.  
Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.  
Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.
