Alright now that we got that out of the way, lets double up  
It's your boyfriend  
Look here, we're in the club  
You're trying to decide whether you're gonna leave with me  
But you don't know, 'cause you got your girl with you  
Bring her wit' you  
Bring her wit' you  
I got a place she can stay at my crib  
Let's go  
  
Step up out the club with a dizzy head  
I got two chicks both got dizzy legs  
I'm bout to double up  
You know I'm 'bout to double up  
Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide  
I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back  
I'm 'bout to double up  
And you know I'm 'bout to double up  
Double up  
  
I fall though the spot  
Kellz on the prowl  
I see these honies and they dancing all wild  
All up on each other windin' real freaky  
I'm plottin' how I'm gonna take 'em home with me  
Maybe her cousin maybe her girlfriend  
I just wanna get em both up out of here  
Fast as I can on them dubs to the crib  
Start off in my game room  
Pop a little bub  
Then have em dance for me like they danced in the club  
Ooh, they so freaky and both of 'em horny  
Shots of tequila puff some dro and now they ready  
Her girl holla out we're best friends  
And then I holla out y'all look like twins  
Ain't no competition y'all a couple of tens  
And then they say Kellz tell us what 'cha wanna do  
Well I'm about to double up with you and you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Step up out the club with a dizzy head  
I got two chicks both got dizzy legs  
I'm 'bout to double up (One on each arm)  
You know I'm bout to double up (I keep one on each arm)  
Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide  
I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back  
I'm bout to double up (One on each arm)  
And you know I?m bout to double up (I keep one on each arm)  
Double up  
  
Pimpin' don't stop when I walk up in the club  
See a girl with a girl and try and get a group hug  
Get 'em to the hotel  
Get some group love  
Her (Her) me man I just can't get enough  
All up in my tub  
Steady poppin' bub  
Who is she to you and she replied "First cuz"  
Man I could tell they so naughty, naughty  
The way they took me down like a forty, forty  
One in the bed and one in the chair  
One massage my toes while one braid my hair  
  
In the private spot like two of these playas  
In the car lot like two of these playas  
Hatas saying damn how he doin' this playa  
Doublin' up for me is like routine playa  
I'm a go getta  
Mix 'em up like I'm a deala  
Man three's company bitch call me Jack Tripper  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
I'm back up in the VIP  
In a cloud of smoke  
Be poundin' surrounded by all my folks  
Give me another shot  
Damn the music loud  
I'm 'bout to mix it up and blend in in the crowd  
Grip slip slide by the dance floor  
Baby grab me by my hand say she wanna dance, oh! (Oh!)  
Is that ya girlfriend peepin' me out?  
Sho' 'nuff it must be cuz now she freakin' me out  
She get behind a nigga  
Grindin' on a nigga  
Touchin' on me  
Whisperin' in my ears  
Damn it sound lovely  
I'm infatuated  
We evacuated  
Now we at the crib it's  
Two for the money that's the life I live  
Kiss me, kiss her, now kiss each other  
It's a trip the way y'all make these chicks twist each other  
Take your shirt off  
Now I'm a take hers off too  
It's double or nottin' baby that's how the boss do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How about that?  
Snoop Dogg and Kellz  
We lead the league in this here man  
Come on, that's quality toes man  
Hand it up  
40 toes  
That's like 20 points and 20 rebounds  
That's a double-double  
We double up like that man  
Mid-west connect  
You know what it is  
Holla baby
