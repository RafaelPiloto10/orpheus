They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom  
For trying to change the system from within  
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
  
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens  
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin  
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
  
I'd really like to live beside you, baby  
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes  
But you see that line there moving through the station?  
I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those  
  
Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win  
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline  
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
  
I don't like your fashion business mister  
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin  
I don't like what happened to my sister  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
  
I'd really like to live beside you, baby  
  
And I thank you for those items that you sent me  
The monkey and the plywood violin  
I practiced every night, now I'm ready  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
  
I am guided  
  
Ah remember me, I used to live for music  
Remember me, I brought your groceries in  
Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
