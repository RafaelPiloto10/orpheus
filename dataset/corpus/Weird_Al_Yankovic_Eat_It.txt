How come you're always such a fussy young man  
Don't want no Cap'n Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran  
Well don't you know that other kids are starvin' in Japan  
So eat it, just eat it  
  
Don't want to argue, I don't want to debate  
Don't want to hear about what kinds of foods you hate  
You won't get no dessert 'till you clean off you're plate  
So eat it  
  
Don't you tell me you're full  
Just eat it, eat it  
Get yourself an egg and beat it  
  
Have some more chicken  
Have some more pie  
It doesn't matter  
If it's boiled or fried  
  
Just eat it, just eat it  
Just eat it, just eat it, Woo!  
  
Your table manners are a crying shame  
You're playing with your food, this ain't some kind of game  
Now, if you starve to death  
You'll just have yourself to blame  
So eat it. Just eat it.  
  
You better listen, better do as you're told  
You haven't even touched your tuna casserole  
You better chow down, or it's gonna get cold  
So eat it.  
  
I don't care if you're full  
Just eat it, eat it  
Open up your mouth and feed it  
  
Have some more yogurt  
Have some more Spam  
It doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned  
Just eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!  
Don't you make me repeat it!  
  
Have a banana, have a whole bunch  
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch  
  
Just eat it! Eat it!  
Eat it! Eat it!  
Eat it! Eat it!  
If it's getting cold, reheat it  
  
Have a big dinner.  
Have a light snack  
If you don't like it, you can't send it back  
  
Just eat it! Eat it!  
Get yourself an egg and beat it!  
  
Have some more chicken. Have some more pie  
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried  
  
Just eat it! Eat it!  
Don't you make me repeat it!
