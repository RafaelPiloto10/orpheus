You get the burn  
We're on the train  
I feel no pain  
I feel no pain  
  
You set the sights  
But I'm already there  
Do you care?  
Do you care?  
  
I can't get it out of my head  
When you said  
I'm gonna leave  
  
I felt surprised  
That you wanted to know  
Where the geese go to  
Late at night  
I'm feeling fine  
What is it inside  
It's inside  
  
And I can't get it out of my head  
When he said  
I'm leaving
