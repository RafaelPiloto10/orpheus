Night and stars above that shine so bright  
The mystery of their fading light  
That shines upon our caravan  
  
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep  
Across the sand so I may keep  
This memory of our caravan  
  
This is so exciting, you are so inviting  
Resting in my arms  
As I thrill to the magic charms  
  
Of you beside me here beneath the blue  
My dream of love is coming true  
Within our desert caravan  
  
This is so exciting, you are so inviting  
Resting in my arms  
As I thrill to the magic charms  
  
Of you beside me here beneath the blue  
My dream of love is coming true  
Within our desert caravan
