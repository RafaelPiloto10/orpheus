I said how could I write so great beautiful songs  
Someone now thinks Caton wrote them all  
Now I like to speak just about silly things I said  
So today, the smurfs again  
How can they be so blue, so short, so sweet  
Smurf, you're like me we're three apples tall at least  
But if you ask me why  
I don't know I don't know I don't know  
  
But maybe that's the new concept  
Where the smurfs are like the bees in the garden now  
They live in mushrooms, the new sin symbols  
And where the smurfette's forced to sell her  
But how  
Said how  
  
They forced you to submit your soul  
Poor lady in blue she sings  
  
Small shy, oh my oh my  
Won't even try  
To make something out of himself  
And if you look, please smile  
He'll run a mile  
The poor little, silly shy smurf  
  
The smurfette is the Mary Magdalene  
Gargamel is the Bush America  
And if you ask me why  
I don't know I don't know I don't know  
  
And so in my new concept  
The smurfette is risen as feminine  
The smurfs are the archetype  
Of what societies could be  
And I'd like to live in mushrooms  
I'll come with you little silly smurfs  
Smurfette don't be worried  
Of being the only woman now  
  
I'll be with you in these dark nights  
When they'll try to submit you  
Poor lady in blue  
We'll be together
