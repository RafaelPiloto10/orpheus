Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense in fighting  
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense at all  
Sitting on a fence is a man who strokes his twenty beards  
Sitting on a fence is a man who drink real ale  
  
But the real problem with this man  
Is he says he can't when he can  
He'd rather not get his hands dirty  
He'll still be there when he's thirty  
  
I told myself to keep my mouth shut  
But I still end up saying if and but  
I lied to myself right from the start  
And I've just worked out that I'm falling apart  
Sitting on a fence  
  
Sitting on a fence is a man who looks up to his guardian  
Sitting on a fence is a man who swings from poll to poll  
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees both sides of both sides  
Sitting on a fence is a man who looks down on opinion  
  
But the real problem with this man  
Is he says he can't when he can  
He's rather not get his hands dirty  
He'll still be there when he is thirty  
  
I told myself to keep my mouth shut  
But I still end up saying if and but  
I lied to myself right from the start  
And I've just worked out that I'm falling apart  
Sitting on a fence
