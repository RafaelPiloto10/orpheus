I was walking stuck inside my head  
I couldn't get out  
Turn the lights down  
The voices inside are so loud.  
  
Need a jump start  
Catatonia  
I couldn't feel, I wish that I could disappear  
The voices inside are so real.  
  
But you stood by my side.  
Night after night, night after night.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight.  
Back to life, back to life,  
Back to life, back to life, yeah  
  
You woke me up, one touch and I felt alive  
You loved me back to life,  
Back to life, thought I died.  
The voices inside were so quiet.  
  
But you stood by my side  
Night after night, night after night  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight.  
  
Strong hands, thick skin, and an open heart  
You saw through the pain, saw through the mask  
You never gave up on me, yeah  
  
Life, life  
From the coma, the wait is over.  
You loved me back to life, life  
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight  
  
Back to life, back to life,  
back to life, back to life  
Back to life, back to life,  
back to life, back to life, yeah
