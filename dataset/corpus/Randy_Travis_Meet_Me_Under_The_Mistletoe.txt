Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
Your sweet kiss is the first gift  
I'd like to receive  
The presents that we bought  
Will have to wait beneath the tree  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
  
There's frost on all the windows  
Candles burning bright  
Stockings on the mantle  
Everything's just right  
Soon the house will come alive  
With family and friends  
I'd love some time alone with you  
Before it all begins  
  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
Your sweet kiss is the first gift  
I'd like to receive  
The presents that we bought  
Will have to wait beneath the tree  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
  
It seems I've hardly seen you  
We've had so much to do  
With the holiday approaching  
I've sure been missing you  
I can't wait till Christmas morn  
To hold you in my arms  
I'm feeling like a kid again  
Waiting on Santa Clause!  
  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve  
Your sweet kiss is the first gift  
I'd like to receive  
The presents that we bought  
Will have to wait beneath the tree  
Meet me under the mistletoe  
Midnight Christmas Eve
