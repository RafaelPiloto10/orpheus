This is the place where dreams are unmade,  
Cut into pieces and left in the rain.  
They're left in the rain.  
  
This is the place where hearts come undone,  
Spill onto the sidewalk and crack in the sun.  
  
I'm boarding up my windows  
And locking all my doors,  
That's what they're for.  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
  
This is the day when promises break,  
curl up at the edges turn into mistakes.  
  
So I am smashing up my suitcase  
And sleeping on my floor,  
I'd rather be bored.  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
  
Go on, go on  
Go on, go on  
Without me  
  
Go on, go on  
Go on, go on  
Without me  
  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
It's better if it's worse than before.
