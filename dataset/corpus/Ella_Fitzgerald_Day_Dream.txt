Daydream, why do you haunt me so  
Deep in a rosy glow  
The face of my love you show  
  
Daydream, I walk along on air  
Building a castle there  
For me and my love to share  
  
Don't know the time, lordy  
I'm in a daze  
Sun in the sky, while I moon around, feeling, hazy  
  
Daydream, don't break my reverie  
Until I find that he,  
Is daydreaming just like me  
  
Daydreams, why do you haunt me so  
While I'm in this rosy glow  
Bring back my love  
Bring back my love  
Bring back my love  
To me
