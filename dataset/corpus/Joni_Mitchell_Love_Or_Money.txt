The firmament of Tinsel Town  
Is strung with tungsten stars  
Lot's of forty watt successes  
He says, "Where's my own shining hour?"  
He's the well kept secret of the underground  
He's in debt to the company store  
Because his only channeled aspiration  
Was getting back that girl he had before  
He's got stacks and stacks of words that rhyme  
Describing what it is to lose  
He's got some just for laughs, he's got some for love  
That mainline to his blues  
Some to shed a little light  
On you and on me  
Some to shed a little light  
On a human story  
The wars of pride and property  
The rebel Irish and the promised land Jew  
Fighting behind his eyes and over seas  
Wounded in action and no ceasefire in view  
Brave reporters bring the battles home  
But tonight inside that box  
Just more bang-bang ketchup color to him  
Just more Twentieth Century Fox  
All because that ghostly girl comes haunting  
Just out of reach outside his bed  
She kicks the covers off of his sleep  
For the clumsy things he said  
She commands his head  
She tries his sanity  
She demands his head  
Tonight unknowingly  
Vaguely she floats and lacelike  
Blown in like a curtain on the night wind  
She's nebulous and naked  
He wonders where she's been  
He grabs at the air because there's nothing there  
Her evasiveness stings him now  
With long legs, long lonely legs  
Bruised from banging into things  
One day he was standing just outside her door  
He was carrying an armload of bright balloons  
She just laughed  
She said she heard him knocking  
And she teased him for the moon  
"Is one the moon, dear clown  
Tied to a string for me?"  
He tried but he could not get it down  
For truth or mystery  
He tried but he could not get it down  
For love or money
