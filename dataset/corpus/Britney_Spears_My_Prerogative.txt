People can take everything away from you  
But they can never take away your truth  
But the question is, can you handle mine?  
  
They say I'm crazy  
I really don't care  
That's my prerogative  
They say I'm nasty  
But I don't give a damn  
Getting boys is how I live  
Some ask me questions  
Why am I so real?  
But they don't understand me  
I really don't know the deal  
About my sister  
Trying hard to make it right  
Not long ago  
Before I won this fight  
  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?  
(Tell me why)  
I don't need permission, make my own decisions  
(Oh)  
That's my prerogative  
(That's my prerogative)  
It's my prerogative  
  
It's the way that I wanna live  
(It's my prerogative)  
But you can't tell me what to do  
  
Don't get me wrong  
I'm really not souped  
Ego trips is not my thing  
All these strange relationships  
Really gets me down  
I see nothing wrong  
Spreadin' myself around  
  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?  
(Tell me why)  
I don't need permission, make my own decisions  
(Oh)  
That's my prerogative  
(That's my prerogative)  
  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?  
(Tell me why)  
I don't need permission, make my own decisions  
(Oh)  
That's my prerogative  
(That's my prerogative)  
  
It's the way that I wanna live  
(It's my prerogative)  
But you can't tell me what to do  
  
Why can't I live my life  
Without all of the things  
That people say?  
Oh  
  
(Oh)  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?  
(Tell me why)  
I don't need permission, make my own decisions  
(Oh)  
That's my prerogative  
(They said I'm crazy)  
  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?  
(Tell me why)  
(They say I'm nasty)  
I don't need permission, make my own decisions  
(Oh)  
That's my prerogative  
(That's my prerogative)
