[Chorus]  
This is how we roll  
We stay in the street  
And get it all week cause  
This is how we roll  
We gotta get out  
Can't stay in the house cause  
The party don't end  
Every weekend  
Turn up, baby, burn up  
Again and again  
This is how we roll  
We rollin', we rollin', we rollin'  
  
[Verse 1]  
Everybody in the party  
If you came here to party  
Better move your body  
Damn look at that body  
Everybody in here  
Put your hands in the air  
Wave 'em like you don't care  
Let me hear you say 'yeah'  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
This place is jumpin'  
We keep it bumpin'  
The boys keep watchin'  
Wanna leave with something  
We makin' it clap  
Clap, clap, clap, clap  
We don't need hands for that  
That, that, that, that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
Get wild and crazy  
If you wanna get crazy  
So free, so young  
So you can't blame me, yup  
Let's get this clear  
All the boys over there  
Keep lookin' over here  
But we don't care  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Pull your camera out  
Cause someone's gonna wanna see this  
Take a picture, snap it  
Aye, post it for the world  
Cause when we goin' out  
We run the town  
Better believe it  
We gon' be sexy, sexy  
Me and my girls, girls, girls  
This is how we roll  
  
[Chorus]
