Wondrous mystery, in the pages of history,  
Of a man who bled and died for me,  
Its more than a story, He' s the one who hung up on a tree,  
His crimson flow poured out for me,  
Gave His life to set my free  
  
[Chorus:]  
I fall down, I fall down,  
And I fall down on my knees,  
And cry holy is the Lord  
Worship him, worship him and adore  
  
Wondrous mystery, in the pages of history,  
Of a man who bled and died for me  
Its more than a story, he' s the one who hung up on a tree  
His crimson flow poured out for me  
Gave his life to set me free  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
I cry holy, I cry holy is the Lord X5
