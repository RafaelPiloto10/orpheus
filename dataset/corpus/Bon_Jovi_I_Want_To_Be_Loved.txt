I had a roof overhead  
Had shoes on my feet  
Yeah, sure I was fed  
But no one was there when I was in need, yeah  
  
So who am I now?  
Who do you want me to be?  
I can forgive you but I won't re-live you  
I ain't the same scared kid I used to be  
  
I'm gonna live  
I'm gonna survive  
I don't want the world to pass me by  
I'm gonna dream  
I ain't gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to be loved  
I want to be loved  
  
I found a picture  
Our so-called family tree, yeah  
I broke all the branches lookin' for answers  
Don't you know that ain't how it's supposed to be?  
  
I'm gonna live  
I'm gonna survive  
I don't want the world to pass me by  
I'm gonna dream  
I ain't gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to give  
I'm ready to try  
Willing to lay it on the line  
I want to be loved  
I want to be  
  
I ain't gonna cry, I don't want to scream  
But I got so much left unsaid inside of me  
  
I'm gonna live  
I'm gonna survive  
Don't want the world to pass me by  
I'm gonna dream  
I ain't gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to give  
I'm ready to try  
Willing to lay it on the line  
I want to beloved  
I want to be loved  
I just want to be love  
I want to be loved [Repeat: x3]
