Slow four...one two three four...  
  
Bless the father bless the son  
Cross your heart 'cause you're the one  
Collectin' moon-beams in the mornin'  
Curvy sticks and wooden poles  
Assistin' you in pluggin' holes  
Plug them holes till you see straight through to the mind's eye  
  
Think about it turn around  
And go back to the quiet sound  
Of Jim and Dan prancin' round the pool  
You were the fool, and I feel sorry for you  
You were the fool, but there's something you can do  
  
You can wash your arm in a pool of mud  
You can chop a tree prevent a flood  
You can speak with a turtle just by flippin' him around  
You can build a boat sail the sea  
You can buy a moat forge a key  
Initiate the sequence create catastrophe  
  
Think about it turn around  
And go back to the quiet sound  
Of Jim and Dan prancin' round the pool  
You were the fool, and I feel sorry for you  
You were the fool, but there's something you can do
