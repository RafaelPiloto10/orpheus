Come on baby light the fire  
I got somethin' you should see  
Well ya know it didn't cost me nothin'  
But I wrapped it for ya 'specially  
So forget the little angel on the tree  
And just love me  
Well, if I told ya don't buy me presents  
Now you know that would be a lie  
Baby, I don't have to have all the money in the world  
Just give me some quality time  
Yeah, Christmas ain't about expensive things  
So just love me  
Woah oh yeah..  
  
(Spoken)  
Come here boy!  
Oh no no no no no now, yeah ha..  
Oh yeah it's Christmas eve' the slowest mornin'  
I've been waitin for our time alone  
I'll be standin' beneath the mistletoe  
Now that everybodies finally gone  
So some over here and kiss me tenderly  
And just love me  
Well let me be your little angel on the tree  
And just love me  
Yeah come over here and kiss me tenderly  
And just love me  
Just love me oh yeah baby  
Ohh yeah yeah ha  
  
(spoken) Merry Christmas baby
