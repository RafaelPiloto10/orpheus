When all the faces are filled with joy  
Life's a holiday  
Oh yeah  
Now I'm feelin' more and more this way  
Cause morning is the day I say oh boy  
Now the darkest night has gone to hide in shadows  
Sunbeams come beams come a dancin' in the eyes  
Here comes a majesty in rays of sunshine  
A risin' in the wind like heavens child  
  
Good morning to you  
Good morning to you  
Good morning to you  
Good morning to you  
  
Here we are in our places  
In bright shining faces  
And in our eyes is the new day  
  
Good morning  
Good, good, good, good morning  
Good, good, good, good morning  
Good, good, good, good morning  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
