Holy Mother of God  
You've got to go faster than that to get to the top.  
Dirty old mountain  
All covered in smoke, she can turn you to stone  
So you better start doing it right  
Better start doing it right.  
  
You're halfway up and you're halfway down  
And the pack on your back is turning you around.  
Throw it away, you won't need it up there, and remember  
You don't look back whatever you do.  
Better start doing it right.  
  
On your left and on your right  
Crosses are green and crosses are blue  
Your friends didn't make it through.  
Out of the night and out of the dark  
Into the fire and into the fight  
Well that's the way the heroes go, Ho! Ho! Ho!  
  
Through a crack in Mother Earth,  
Blazing hot, the molten rock  
Spills out over the land.  
And the lava's the lover who licks your boots away. Hey! Hey! Hey!  
If you don't want to boil as well.  
Be-be-better start the dance  
D-D-Do you want to dance with me.  
  
The music's playing, the notes are right  
Put your left foot first and move into the light.  
The edge of this hill is the edge of the world  
And if you're going to cross you better start doing it right  
Better start doing it right.  
  
Let the dance begin.
