You know my soul  
You know everything about me there's to know  
You know my heart  
How to make me stop and how to make me go  
You should know  
I love everything about you  
Don't you know  
  
[Chorus]  
That I'm thankful  
For the blessings and the lessons  
That I've learned with you by my side  
That I'm thankful  
For the love that you  
Keep bringing in my life  
In my life  
  
You know my thoughts  
Before I open up my mouth and try to speak  
You know my dreams  
Must be listening when I'm talking in my sleep  
I hope you know  
I love having you around me  
Don't you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For the lessons that, that I've learned  
From the troubles I've known  
For the heartache and pain  
Thrown in my way  
When I didn't think that I could go on but you made me feel strong  
With you I am never alone  
  
[Chorus]
