Why I love you though you treat me bad.  
Cause when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.  
Oh the mirror of love and you look alright,  
Cause when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.  
You're such a cool lover,  
But you're such a cruel lover,  
Treat me like I'm a fool,  
I hate you but you know I would kill for you.  
You're a mean and obscene lover,  
But I would have no other,  
Even though you treat me bad,  
You were the best man I ever had,  
Cause through the mirror of love, mirror of love,  
When I see you through the mirror of love,  
You're alright and I forget that you're bad,  
Cause when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.  
Why I love you though you treat me bad,  
Cause when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.  
The mirror of love you sure look alright.  
I see your reflection when I'm looking through the mirror of love.  
You're a crude and a rude lover,  
But I would have no other,  
You slap me down, treat me bad,  
You're a two-timing swine and you drive me mad.  
You're a mean and obscene lover,  
But you are my dream lover,  
Cause even though you treat me bad,  
You were the best man I ever had,  
Cause through the mirror of love, mirror of love,  
I see your reflection in the mirror of love.  
And you're alright though you treat me bad.  
When I see you I'm looking through the mirror of love.  
Oh the mirror of love, sure look alright  
Cause when I see you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
