Jody girl, Jody girl, spend your time today  
Watching clocks, spin the hours away  
Jody girl, you know the world is  
Going 'round all day  
Thinking back to the things you used to say  
  
Didn't they put you on a pedestal  
When first you met?  
Sure was some honeymoon  
Ain't it hard to forget?  
Whatever happened to that crazy boy  
With the love light in his eye?  
Used to bring you flowers every day  
  
Now you sit here, on a cloudy afternoon  
Watching the soap opera on the TV  
Your old man's working  
And your kids are out playing  
And you ain't feeling too free  
You keep thinking back,  
Thinking back to high school  
Those high school days  
All the wild, wild, wild good times you had  
All the boyfriends, boyfriends knocking at your door  
  
Jody girl, Jody girl, spend your time today  
Watching clocks spin the hours away  
Jody girl, you know the world is  
Goin' by all day  
Thinking back  
To before you promised to stay  
Didn't they put you on a pedestal  
When first you met?  
Sure was some honeymoon  
  
Ain't it hard to forget
