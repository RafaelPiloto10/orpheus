You tell me that you're leavin',  
I can't believe it's true!  
Girl, there's just no livin' without you.  
Don't take your love away from me.  
Don't you leave my heart in misery.  
'Cause if you go, then I'll be blue,  
Breakin' up is hard to do.  
  
Remember when you held me tight,  
And you kissed me all through the night.  
Think of all that we been through,  
And breakin' up is hard to do.  
  
They say that breakin' up is hard to do,  
Now I know, I know that it's true.  
Don't say that this is the end.  
Instead of breakin' up I wish that  
We were makin' up again.  
  
I beg of you don't say goodbye,  
Can't we give our love just one more try?  
Come on baby, let's start anew,  
Breakin' up is hard to do.
