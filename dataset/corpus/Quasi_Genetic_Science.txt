You've got a diamond ring  
It's just another hollow thing  
You've got your career  
You chose boredom over fear  
You've got a righteous cause  
All I see are fatal flaws  
All I see are fatal flaws  
  
you've got the newest style  
It won't be new in a little while  
You've got the future too  
I don't mind leaving that to you  
You've got plans and goals  
All I see is full of holes  
All I see is full of holes  
  
you've got the human race  
You've got Jesus just in case  
You've got your eternity  
A few short years is enough for me  
I've got my defiance  
You've got your genetic science  
You've got your genetic science
