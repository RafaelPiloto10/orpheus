A tall drink of water in a cotton dress  
That preacher's daughter, she sure is blessed  
As sunlight passes through the fabric so soft  
You can imagine what goes through my thoughts  
She says they'll be a time for all of that  
When my dress is white and your suit is black  
  
[Chorus]  
There's so many fish in the sea  
And I know it's a great big world  
But I couldn't help but fall in love so hard  
For my dry county girl  
For my dry county girl, yeah  
  
It's widely known that I have my flaws  
While she's the Joan of Arkansas  
Her lips won't touch the demon wine  
But her eyes are full of pure moonshine  
And I get drunk just holding her hand  
I get high thinking I could be her man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For my dry county girl  
Lord, I fell so hard  
For my dry county girl  
For my dry county girl, yeah  
Yeah, talking about my... [Fade]
