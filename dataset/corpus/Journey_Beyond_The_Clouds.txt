So long ago, has it been that long  
Since we felt the sun  
Where has it gone to  
Has it hid from the world  
Have we lost our way  
  
I can remember it filling the sky  
And it'd warm my face  
The summers were endless  
But they're over now  
That was yesterday  
  
I know we'll find love again  
If we all pray a little  
The heart will break free  
  
Beyond the clouds  
That's where my soul waits  
She's waiting now  
Beyond the clouds  
  
Sorrow seems endless  
Now there's only so much  
That a man can bear  
Hold on so tender  
To a glimmer of faith  
Gets me half way there  
I know it will shine again  
With some prayer and some patience  
We'll find our way home  
  
Beyond the clouds  
That's where my soul waits  
She's waiting now  
Just beyond  
  
Beyond anything you've ever known  
Oh, so beautiful  
Like a summer sky  
Oh, you know it won't be long  
If we find the strength I know  
There beyond the clouds  
We'll find the sun  
  
Beyond the clouds  
That's where my soul waits, oh yeah  
She's waiting now  
Beyond  
  
Beyond the clouds  
That's where my love waits  
She's waiting now  
Beyond the clouds  
  
Yeah, that's it now, oh  
Oh, that's it now, baby, oh  
Beyond everything you've ever known  
Oh, if I could find the strength, I know  
We'll find the sun
