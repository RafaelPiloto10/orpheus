One little white lie  
One white lie surrounds us  
One white lie won't stop the love  
That I feel around us  
  
Darlin', do you think about me  
What I feel for you, don't you ever doubt me  
You see the lock on the door  
Of this heart, but you hold the key  
I need the trust you can give  
Is there something that you need from me?  
  
One little white lie  
One white lie surrounds us  
One white lie won't stop the love  
That I feel around us  
  
Secrets, and the way we keep them  
Between you and me  
Promise we'll never need them  
I can see something so true  
No one else could ever see  
And I'll never chance losing you  
I believe my heart, I hear what it's telling me  
  
One little white lie  
One white lie surronds us  
One white lie won't stop the love  
That I feel around us  
  
One little white lie  
One white lie tears us apart  
One white lie won't stop the love  
That's waiting in this heart  
That's waiting in this heart  
  
Temptation leave us alone  
'Cause I know you're always there  
But white lies can weigh like stone  
And in this world I hear them everywhere  
  
One little white lie, ooh yeah  
One white lie surrounds us  
One white lie won't stop the love  
That I feel around us  
  
One little white lie, one lie  
One white lie tears us apart  
One white lie won't stop the love  
That's waiting in this heart  
That's waiting in this heart  
  
One lie, one lie  
One little white lie, one white lie  
One white lie, one little white lie
