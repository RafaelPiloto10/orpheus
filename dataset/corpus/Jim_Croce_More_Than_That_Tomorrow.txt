Hey love don't be afraid to stay until tomorrow  
Lover's dawn is waiting just this side of day  
If you thought I loved you yesterday  
I'll love you more than that tomorrow  
  
Hey love don't be afraid to hear the songs of morning  
Birds will sing them as they're calling up the day  
If I sang to you yesterday  
I'll sing more than that tomorrow  
  
If it should happen that you come to me  
In the night we share our hearts  
Whatever it is that you done to me  
Between you and me, can't be undone...  
  
If I should understand just why I need you by me  
Then I would know the reasons for the songs of morning  
'Cause if I wanted you yesterday  
And if in the night we shared our hearts  
Whatever it is that you done to me  
Between you and me, can't be undone...  
  
Hey love don't be afraid to stay until tomorrow  
Lover's dawn is waiting just this side of day  
If you thought I loved you yesterday  
I'll love you more than that tomorrow  
  
If you thought I loved you yesterday  
I'll love you more than that tomorrow
