I'm the only man who ever really thought that I had qualified  
From the corners of your mind you would care for another guy,  
  
Now I'm lookin at you straight in the eye,  
I know it feels good and I know you should try me  
  
But every chance you get you just hesitate,  
Is there something in my look that you really hate,  
  
Open me up I feel real glad,  
You can take all I have,  
Maybe maybe dont you think its time  
  
This could be my moment, somethin' more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it (maybe, maybe)  
This could be my moment, somethin more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it  
  
I'll open up my mind I swear I'd let you in  
There's nothin that you couldent beg steal or have  
I'm lookin at you straight in the eye  
I know it feels good and I know ya'll high  
Maybe, maybe dont you think its time  
  
This could be my moment, somethin' more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it (maybe, maybe)  
This could be my moment somethin more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it  
  
There's only one  
There's only one  
There's one life one chance, come on lets hit the floor  
  
This could be my moment (come on now!), somethin more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it  
Somethin' more than everyday, a chance to walk and break away  
Don't you wanna try it  
  
Come on and wipe those tears away from your eyes  
This could be my last chance  
There'll be no better night (gotta go sacrafice)  
This could be my my last chance  
This could be my my last chance  
There'll be no better time, yeah!  
There'll be no better day, yeah!
