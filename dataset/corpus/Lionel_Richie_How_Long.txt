Every time I see you and I look into your eyes  
There's a feeling that I get  
And it's way down deep inside, girl  
I've been trying to hold on, but you say that you're not sure  
I just hope you realize what my heart is going through  
  
How long, must this feeling go on  
How long, must I stand the pain and  
How long, must this feeling go on  
Waiting for the night  
Waiting for the right time to come  
  
I know all about the hurt and the problems in the past  
I know why your scared of love,  
'Cause you think it just wont last long  
Well, I'm here to tell you what I'm saying is all true  
There ain't nobody else in life  
That can take the place of you  
  
How long, must this feeling go on  
How long, must I stand the pain and  
How long, must this feeling go on  
waiting for the night  
Waiting for the right time to run  
  
Why can't we just run away, and oh run  
A place were we can be alone and nobody finds us, run  
Can we both just run away, and oh run  
Girl I can't wait to have you  
  
How long, must this feeling go on  
How long, must I stand the pain and  
How long, must this feeling go on  
Waiting for the night  
Waiting for the right time to come, to come
