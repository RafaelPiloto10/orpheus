Every night, and I can't help but cry  
And I wonder why you have to leave me  
Why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me  
Ohhh tell me  
Where did I go wrong  
What did I do to make you change your mind completely  
When I thought this love would never end  
If this love was not ours to have  
I'll let it go with your good bye  
Ohhh why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me  
Ohhh tell me  
Where did I go wrong  
What did I do to make you change your mind completely  
When I thought this love would never end  
If this love was not ours to have  
I'll let it go with your good bye
