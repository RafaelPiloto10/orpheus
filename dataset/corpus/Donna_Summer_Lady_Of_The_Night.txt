They call her the lady of the night  
She's a woman of the world  
And easy-living girl with love for sale  
  
That's what they call her the lady of the night  
No one seems to know her name  
And even less about the place  
From where she came  
  
Every evening when the night is close at hand  
You'll find the lady on the rue d'avignon  
In a half lit hotel doorway the lady advertises warmly  
It's just a job but she'll do the best she can  
  
Don't try to change this lady of the night  
She's a lot like you and me  
And less than what she seems to be  
  
(she is the lady of the night)  
And easy-living girl  
(she is the lady of the night)  
She's a woman of the world  
(she is the lady of the night)  
With lots of loving for sale  
(she is the lady of the night)  
Lady lady of the night  
  
Round here they call her the lady of the night  
In a perfume hotel room  
Shadows dance upon the wall and fate at dawn  
She's no beginner this lady of the night  
Never try that funny stuff  
'cause lady can be tough  
Be warned!  
  
(she is the lady of the night)  
She's a lot like you and me  
(she is the lady of the night)  
And never just what she seems  
(she is the lady of the night)  
No one seems to know her name  
(she is the lady of the night)  
Or the place from where she came
