I made my head touch my hands  
And it's right on me, yeah  
I touched the night now it's gone  
Felt it right on me, yeah  
  
I'm runnin' hard, and the dust  
Now it's right on me, yeah  
I'm riding blind  
And these words are all over me  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, lost them in the forest  
Oh, dawn is almost on us  
Oh, spell is gettin' stronger  
Oh,  
  
Cause my mama's and my daddy's  
The wishin' that I'm wishing too  
Down the well there's nothing that wet  
And it's all in my head  
Hear what I heard  
If I didn't dream, I don't care  
  
I'm thinkin' of your style  
I know that spell even the way that  
You  
You gimme what I want  
That kinda thing and that feeling  
So right, so right  
Feels good, feels good  
Still feel it, still feel it  
On me, on me  
I feel, I feel  
It's on me, it's on me  
Sorry  
  
I've worked these hands  
And prepared now it's right on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The wishin' that I'm wishing too  
Down the well there's nothing that wet  
And it's all in my head  
Hear what I heard  
If I didn't dream, I don't care  
  
So right, so right  
Feels good, feels good  
Still feel it, still feel it  
On me, on me  
I feel, that's right  
It's on me, it's on me  
Sorry  
  
So fine, I got to run  
So excited, so excited  
See the sun, see the sun  
I feel, its alright  
Someday  
  
So right, so right  
Feels good, feels good  
Still feel it, still feel it  
On me, on me  
I feel, I feel  
It's on me, it's on me  
Sorry  
So fine, I got to run  
So excited, so excited  
See the sun, see the sun  
I feel, its alright  
Someday
