To the morgue  
Take him to the morgue  
To the morgue  
Take him to the morgue  
  
At Devil Lake Sanitarium  
Many a patient had died in vain  
Never a question to be asked, no no  
Never a thing to explain  
So they took his bones and skin  
To the morgue in the West Wing  
It was clear to Dr. Eastmann  
Harry had died of fright  
If he had cared he would have found the spider  
Laying eggs in Harry's neck  
  
The smoldering eyes in Harry's head  
Had become the home of spiders instead  
  
To the morgue,  
Take him to the morgue  
To the morgue,  
Take him to the morgue  
To the morgue,  
We must all go to the morgue  
To the morgue,  
We must all go to the morgue  
  
Deep down below the ground  
Where it was kind of cold and damp  
Too many stiffs to be fit in the cooler  
Gathering dust in the hallways of Death  
  
The smoldering eyes in Harry's head  
Had become the home of spiders instead  
  
Spiders here  
Spider's everywhere  
Spiders feeding the dead to their young  
Spiders here  
Spider's everywhere  
Spiders using the dead for their home  
  
Spiders  
They're growing like rats from the plague  
Spiders  
There's so many more everyday  
  
Summer is coming to an end  
And the cellar in the morgue is a nest now  
One thousand poisonous creatures  
Eight thousand poisonous legs!  
  
The smoldering eyes in Harry's head  
Had become the home of spiders instead  
  
To the morgue  
We must all go to the morgue  
To the morgue  
We must all go to the morgue
