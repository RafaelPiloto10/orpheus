Red light, green light  
I'm coming home tonight  
Burning the freeway  
Out of control  
  
Red light, dead lines  
We streak from town to town  
I's too much, I need your touch  
I've been away too long  
  
Out again upon the thunder road  
Driving back to you where I belong  
I've had enough  
Dreams can wait  
I'm coming home  
  
Spotlights, wild nights  
I know it wrong from right  
Places, the faces  
All look the same  
  
Hot wired, so tired  
Living from song to song  
The madness, the badness  
It's just a game  
  
Watch the sunrise  
From coast to coast  
That's when I need your loving  
Oh! That's when I need it most  
Can't explain, it's something in the blood  
Wouldn't change it even if I could
