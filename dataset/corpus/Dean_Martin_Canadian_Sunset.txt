Once I was alone  
So lonely and then  
You came out of nowhere  
Like the sun up from the hill  
  
Cold cold as the wind  
Warm warm were your lips  
Out there on the ski trail  
Where your kiss filled me with thrill  
  
Weekend in Canada a change of scenery  
Was the most I bargained for  
And then I discovered you and in your eyes  
I've found a love that I couldn't ignore  
  
Down down came the sun  
Fast fast beat my heart  
I knew as the sun set from that day  
We'd never part  
  
Down down down down came the sun  
Fast fast fast fast beat my heart  
I knew as the sun set from that day  
We'd never part  
Down down down down came-a the sun  
Fast fast fast fast beat-a my heart  
I knew as the sun set from that day  
We'd never part  
We'd never part  
We'd never part
