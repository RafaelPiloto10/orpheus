Something about you makes me feel this way  
Boy I want to know what you're startin'  
Baby you can relax as a matter of fact  
There's a time for love and that time's now  
  
Since the mood's right  
I only want to see you by the moonlight  
While we make sweet love  
By the starlight  
Baby let me take control  
Oh baby  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night  
  
Can you stay right here and you hold me tight  
All through the night  
Doesn't that sound real nice  
If control could be taken, would you take control of me  
And lead me to ecstasy  
  
Since the mood's right  
I only want to see you by the moonlight  
While we make sweet love  
By the starlight  
Baby let me take control  
Oh baby  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it there baby  
All night, baby all night  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night  
Baby, keep it right there  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night  
  
I've been waiting  
Can't ignore what I feel inside my heart  
I won't hold back I'll it go tonight  
Gonna take control  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night
