One day, as I was walking through my garden, I saw a little frog lying on the
ground. And I thought he was sick. So I picked him up and he wasn't sick at
all. He was very sad, and he was crying. And I said: What's a matter with you,
little frog? And he looked up at me with a lump in his throat, and he said:
wribbit!  
  
It ain't easy being green  
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves  
When I think, I think it would be nicer being red  
Or yellow or gold  
  
You see, it ain't easy being green  
It seems to blend in with so many other ordinary things  
And then, sometimes, sometimes people pass over you  
Because you're not standing out like sparkles on the water  
Or like the stars in the sky  
  
But did you know that green is the color of Spring  
And green can be big like an ocean  
And important like a mountain  
And cool and friendly-like  
Or tall and skinny like a tree  
And me  
  
But when green is all there is to be  
It kind of makes you wonder why  
Why wonder, wonder why?  
Hey, I'm green and I think it'll do fine  
'Cause green is just what I wanna be  
'Cause green is beautiful, baby  
Right on green  
And anyway, money's green  
  
Wribbit
