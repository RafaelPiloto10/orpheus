So I close my eyes and drift into sleep  
But something is here  
In the dark, in the dream  
Like a cruel wind clutching my heart  
I feel more than I see  
Like a clue to a nightmare that I can't believe  
Then it touches me and I try to scream  
And a thought tears me inside  
And I will do anything  
Anything, you understand?  
Just to wake up  
  
Sometimes it almost makes me cry  
Sometimes it seems to call my name out loud  
Sometimes it feels like I'm alone  
And then it comes for me again  
  
I'm told it's called 'The unreality dream'  
I'm told it's called 'The great American lie'  
I'm told that this is like the vengeance of God  
I can't believe that God would do this to me  
  
I've known fear many times but nothing like this  
I'm so scared I can't breathe  
I know I'm asleep but I know this is real  
And nothing can help me here  
I'm deep inside something and I may never come back  
And then it was gone  
And then I realized that 'The Rush' brought it in  
And I will never sleep alone again  
  
Sometimes it almost breaks my heart  
Sometimes I swear I hear it laugh at me  
Sometimes it feels like I could die  
And then it leaves my dreams again  
  
Feels like I'm fighting the possession of my soul  
I'm told that this is called 'The sickness of need'  
I've got to cut the sex connection and slide  
A word of warning to the weary and wise
