You kissed my lips and now my life has just begun  
As far as I'm concerned you'll always be number one  
Your kiss convinced me that my roving days are done  
I belong to you  
  
You came into my life just like a melody  
And lingered in the very heart and soul of me  
If you could open up my heart then you would see  
I belong to you  
  
I found my heaven when I found you  
Please tell me that you found your heaven too  
Wo oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh, can't you see I offer you a love sincere  
I tingle every single time you hold me near  
One look into my eyes will make it very clear  
I belong to you  
  
I found my heaven when I found you  
Please tell me that you found your heaven too  
Wo oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh, can't you see I offer you a love sincere  
I tingle every single time you hold me near  
One look into my eyes will make it very clear  
I belong to you
