Have you ever stood outside a picket fence  
You could see through but you can't get to the inside  
You sit there and wait  
I look at you and anticipate  
  
What we could be and what we could do  
Fly the wings of an eagle  
Glide along with the wind  
No matter how high  
  
I'll be thinking of you the whole time  
Fly with wings of an eagle  
Glide along with the wind  
No matter how high  
  
I'll be thinking of you the whole time  
I'm carrying this heavy load  
I don't know what to do  
The only thing I know is that  
  
I'm in love with you Oh  
Fly the wings of an eagle  
No matter how high  
I'll be thinkin' of you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
No matter how high  
No matter how low  
I'll be thinking of you  
No matter what I do  
No matter where I go  
I'll be thinking of you
