Go  
It's a missile girl  
In a missile world  
  
Human tongue feels aluminum-plate  
It's a missile boy  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Death machine and man in love  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Tracking system checks out pulse, all systems go  
Go go go go go  
Rocket-blast fury with a manual sex-drive  
Go go go go go  
  
It's a missile girl  
With a long white face  
A missile girl, well  
  
Nike is her name  
You remember it  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Deadlier than any girl on any world  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Nike be good  
Nike be everything woman's not  
A go go go go go  
Nike take my life along with yours  
A go go go go go  
  
It's a missile girl  
With a long white face  
It's a missile girl, well  
  
Nike is the name remember it  
Go go  
  
Nike take my life along with yours  
Go go  
Go go  
  
Go  
There I go and it's over  
There I go and then it's over  
There I go and then it's over  
There I go and then it's over  
There I go and then it's over  
There I go and then it's over  
There I go and then it's over  
  
There I go and then it's a go go, a go go  
There I go and then it's a go go, a go go  
There I go and then it's a go go, a go go  
There I go and then it's a go go, a go go  
There I go and then it's over
