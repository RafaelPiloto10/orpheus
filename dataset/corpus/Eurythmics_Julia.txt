(Julia)  
When the leaves turn from green to brown  
And autumn shades come tumbling down  
(Julia)  
To leave a carpet on the ground  
Where we have laid  
(Julia)  
When winter leaves her branches bare  
And icy breezes chill the air  
(Oh Julia)  
The freezing snow lies everywhere  
My darling, will we still be there?  
(Oh Julia)  
(Julia)  
When spring rejoices down the lane  
And everything is new again  
Will everything be just the same  
Will we be there?  
(Oh Julia)  
And the leaves turn from green to brown  
And autumn shades come tumbling down  
(Julia)  
To leave a carpet on the ground  
Where we have laid  
(Oh Julia)  
(Julia)  
When winter leaves her branches bare  
And icy breezes chill the air  
(Oh Julia)  
The freezing snow lies everywhere  
My darling, will we still be there?  
(Julia)  
Will we still be there?  
Will we still be there?  
(Oh Julia)  
Will we still be there?  
Will we, will we, will we?  
Will we, will we?  
(Julia)  
Will we, will we?  
(Julia)  
Will we, will we  
Will we still be there?  
Will we, will we  
Will we still be there?  
(Julia)  
Will we  
Will we be there?  
Will we, will we  
Will we still be there?  
Will we  
Will we still be there?
