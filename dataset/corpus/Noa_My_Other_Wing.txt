All night long  
Rumble, tumble, deep down under, under my skin  
  
All night long  
Burning, turning, growing to be my other wing  
  
All night long  
Maybe, baby, you' ll be crazy, crazy for me  
  
All night long,  
Sinking, thinking, wanting to grow, learning to see..  
  
Together we' ll fly, all night long  
Together we' ll fly, all night long..  
  
All night long  
Break out, break in, now we' re making life out of love  
  
All night long,  
Maybe, baby, you will be all i' m dreaming of  
  
All night long  
Touch me, shake me, gently wake me, teach me to sing  
  
All night long  
Slowly, slowly, learning to be my other wing  
  
Together we' ll fly, all night long  
Together we' ll fly, all night long..  
  
Learning to be my other wing..
