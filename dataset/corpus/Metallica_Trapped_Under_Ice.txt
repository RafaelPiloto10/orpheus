I don't know how to live trough this hell  
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell  
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core  
Break the ice, I can't take anymore  
  
Freezing  
Can't move at all  
Screaming  
Can't hear my call  
I am dying to live  
Cry out  
I'm trapped under the ice  
  
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest  
Eyes of glass stare directly at death  
From deep sleep I have broken away  
No one knows, no one hears what I say  
  
Freezing  
Can't move at all  
Screaming  
Can't hear my call  
I am dying to live  
Cry out  
I'm trapped under the ice  
  
Scream from my soul  
Fate, mystified  
Hell, forever more  
  
No release from my cryonic state  
What is this? I've been stricken by fate  
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free  
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me  
  
Freezing  
Can't move at all  
Screaming  
Can't hear my call  
I am dying to live  
Cry out  
I'm trapped under the ice
