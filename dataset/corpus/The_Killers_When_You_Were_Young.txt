You sit there in your heartache  
Waiting on some beautiful boy to  
To save your from your old ways  
You play forgiveness  
Watch it now, here he comes  
  
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus  
But he talks like a gentlemen  
Like you imagined when you were young  
  
Can we climb this mountain  
I don't know  
Higher now than ever before  
I know we can make it if we take it slow  
Let's take it easy  
Easy now, watch it go  
  
We're burning down the highway skyline  
On the back of a hurricane that started turning  
When you were young  
When you were young  
  
And sometimes you close your eyes  
And see the place where you Used to live  
When you were young  
  
They say the devil's water - it ain't so sweet  
You don't have to drink right now  
But you can dip your feet  
Every once in a little while  
  
You sit there in your heartache  
Waiting on some beautiful boy to  
To save you from your old ways  
You play forgiveness  
Watch it now, here he comes  
  
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus  
But he talks like a gentlemen  
Like you imagined when you were young  
When you were young  
  
I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus  
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus  
But more than you'll ever know
