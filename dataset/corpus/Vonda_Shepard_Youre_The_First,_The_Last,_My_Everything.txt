You're my Sun, my Moon, my guiding star  
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
I know there's only, only one like you  
There's no way they could have made two  
You're all I'm living for  
Your love I'll keep for evermore  
You're the first my last my everything  
  
In you I've found so many things  
A love so new only you could bring  
Can't you see if you  
You'll make me feel this way  
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day  
  
I see so many ways that I can love you  
Till the day I die  
  
You're my reality yet i'm lost in a dream  
You're the first my last my everything  
  
[Chorus]
