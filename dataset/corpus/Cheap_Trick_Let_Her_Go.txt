Heads down, buried in the sand  
She's back now, I better wash my hands  
She talks like a man gettin' higher than I can  
Lovin' me when I'm in a rock band  
Let her go  
  
She's living in shadows  
Waits there in the shadows tonight  
And sleeps on a bed of nails  
Let her go  
  
Close the window, it's time to shut the door  
Say a prayer now, and get down on the floor  
There's a howling wind blowing through my brain  
Moving in slow, just like the hurricane  
Let her go  
  
She's living in shadows  
Waits there in the shadows tonight  
And sleeps on a bed of nails  
Let her go  
Oh let her go  
Yeah, let her go  
Let her go  
  
She can't fall in love  
Her heart's cold as ice now  
Let her go  
  
She can't cry for love  
There's no tears left inside for one to show  
Let her go  
  
She waits in the shadows tonight  
And sleeps on a bed of nails  
Let her go  
  
She's living in shadows  
Waits there in the shadows tonight  
And sleeps on a bed of nails  
Let her go  
Yeah let her go  
Yeah let her go  
Let her go
