Near to you, near to you  
Even though you're far away  
So near to you, always near to you  
As near as April is to may  
Can't you feel me there, in my favourite chair  
Staring at the fireplace?  
Oh so near to you, always near to you  
Even now it seems we're face to face  
But it is just if though I was standing before you  
Telling you how much I adore you  
If I'm really dear to you, near to you  
We may be far apart and yet  
If I'm in your heart, really in your heart  
How near to you can I get  
(2x)  
Oh so near to you, always near to you  
As near as April is to may  
Can't you feel me there, in my favourite chair  
Staring at the fireplace?  
Oh so near to you, always near to you  
Even now it seems we're face to face  
But it is just if though I was standing before you  
Telling you how much I adore you  
If I'm really dear to you, near to you  
We may be far apart and yet  
If I'm in your heart, really in your heart  
How near to you can I get?  
How near to you can I get?  
How near to you, can I get?
