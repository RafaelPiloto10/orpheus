In this supermarket city  
Among the native smiles  
You have to pay for attention  
And do the best you can  
There's a raging silence  
And it's charged with action  
Got no time for weakness  
'cause I'm a bad bad man  
  
Down the streets of darkness  
Where they know my name  
Lies a force of evil  
And a destructive plan  
There's no time for questions  
When you run into danger  
Don't get too close to me  
'cause I'm a bad bad man  
  
I'm working for the l.a. division  
To stop the inner city collision  
I'm bringing law and order  
To the twenty-first century  
  
I don't care for politics  
You can keep your point of view  
You'd be better off without it  
I got my own bad plan  
  
A tough cop has a lonely existence  
A reputation of  
The highest resistance  
A mean runner bringing order  
To the twenty-first century  
  
I don't believe in passion  
Don't believe in feelings  
I take peace from the wicked  
Run and hide while you can  
I got no time for small talk  
Got no time for off-the-wall talk  
Don't care who I tread on  
'cause I'm a bad bad man  
  
Bad bad man, I'm a bad bad man
