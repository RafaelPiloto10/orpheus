They say you're stupid  
That you're too young to vote  
They say you'll swallow anything  
That they shove down your throat  
They say you can't think  
That you haven't got a brain  
That you're just there to listen  
That you're just being trained  
CHORUS  
There's something inside your head  
There's something inside your head  
There's something inside your head  
There's something inside your head  
They say you lost the ability to even think  
That your tiny little brain  
Slipped down the kitchen sink  
They say that you'll buy anything  
That they turn your way  
That you'll listen to everything  
That they decide to play  
CHORUS  
Grey matter grey matter ooh . . .  
Grey matter grey matter ooh . . .  
Grey matter grey matter ooh . . .  
Grey matter grey matter ooh . . .  
BRIDGE  
I think you like it--like it  
To be told what to do--isn't that true  
I think you're better--better--better off  
Stone cold dead--without your head  
They say you're stupid  
That you're too young to vote  
They say you'll swallow anything  
That they shove down your throat  
If they say lie down, you'll do it  
If they say--buy it now--you'll do it  
If they say--turn around--you'll do it  
If they say--hit the ground--you'll do it  
If they say--bite the big weenie--you'll do it  
If they say--wasn't that good--you'll do it  
If they say--bend over baby--you'll do it  
If they say--take it and like it--you'll do it  
CHORUS
