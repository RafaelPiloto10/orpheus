Sorrow's child sits by the river  
Sorrow's child hears not the water  
Sorrow's child sits by the river  
Sorrow's child hears not the water  
And just when it seems as though  
You've got strength enough to stand  
Sorrow's child all weak and strange  
Stands waiting at your hand  
  
Sorrow's child steps in the water  
Sorrow's child you follow after  
Sorrow's child wades in deeper  
Sorrow's child invites you under  
And just when you thought as though  
All your tears were wept and done  
Sorrow's child grieves not what has passed  
But all the past still yet to come  
Sorrow's child sits by the water  
Sorrow's child your arms enfold her  
Sorrow's child you're loathe to befriend her  
Sorrow's child but in sorrow surrender  
And just when is seems as though  
All your tears were at an end  
Sorrow's child lifts up her hand  
And she brings it down again
