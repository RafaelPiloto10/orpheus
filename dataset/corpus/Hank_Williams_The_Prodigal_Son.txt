[g] a prodigal son once [c] strayed from his [g] father  
To travel a land of [a] hunger and [d] pain  
And [g] now I can see the [c] end of my [g] journey  
I'm going to [d] heaven a-[g] gain.  
I leave you the day, to help all your neighbors  
I leave you the night, to solemnly pray  
So try to repent and ask for forgiveness  
We'll meet up in heaven, someday.  
Goodbye to this world, with all it's sorrows  
Goodbye to the fields, that I used to roam  
I'm going away where, life is eternal  
My shepherd is callin me home.  
From out of the sky, he's coming to meet me  
To wash all my sins and call me his own  
His servants will bring, a ring for my finger  
And never no more will I roam.
