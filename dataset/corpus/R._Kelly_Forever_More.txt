Baby, I've just been sitting here thinking, how blessed I am to have someone  
Like you in my life and I'm so excited so so excited about being with you for  
The rest of my life Listen  
  
Looking at all theses hand, damn I use to be a lonely man, could never  
Understand, why I had no one to take my hand but then the weather changed  
Mother-nature brought the sun my way, now girl your who I am and I have you
for  
The rest of my days  
  
[Chorus]  
How the sun comes up in the early morning time, girl I vowel to be forever  
Loving you rain or shine, How the moon takes us on this romantic globe I'll be  
Loving you forever more, oh oh yeah  
  
Now I used to think that I would never, have a serious relationship, always  
Praying for that one to come along and give me what I miss, but now those  
Thoughts are no more, every since you came into my life, it's like heaven  
Opened up its doors, showered down on me the perfect wife, oh oh  
  
How the sun comes up in the early morning time girl, I vowel to be forever  
Loving you rain or shine, How the moon takes us on this romantic globe I'll be  
Loving you forever more, oh oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Baby, now our house, our house, is a home, the car, we own, what's mine is  
Yours, the keys to the doors, my family, my family, my friend, my friends, the  
Church, we belong together, Heaven drum say, our house is a home the car, we  
Own, what's mine is yours the keys to the doors, my family, my family, my  
Friend, my friends the church we belong together and it's on...  
  
[Chorus: x5]
