Well, here you are  
The final attraction  
Awaiting direction  
From somewhere above  
  
Your finest performance  
Approaching perfection  
I know what you're making  
Is some kind of love  
  
Somewhere in your lifetime  
You were dared into feeling  
So many emotions  
That tear you apart  
  
But they love you so badly  
For sharing their sorrows  
So pick up that guitar  
Go break a heart  
  
Come on, boy, get back up there  
You can do it one more time  
For Hank Williams, go break a heart  
And Janis Joplin, go break a heart  
And Waylon Jennings, go break a heart  
And John Lennon, go break a heart  
And Roger Miller, go break a heart  
And Jimi Hendrix, go break a heart  
And Mickey Newbury, go break a heart  
And maybe one time for me  
Go break a heart
