Just a simple suggestion  
That you don't need to follow  
We could make it out of here  
  
We could be there tomorrow  
'Cos there's always tomorrow  
You're so silly, oh so silly  
Especially just ordinary  
We've got nothing to hurt now  
We're green behind the ears  
  
Just a pocket of people  
With their ordinary faces  
As the crow flies  
They got further to fly  
Without a word or a lie
