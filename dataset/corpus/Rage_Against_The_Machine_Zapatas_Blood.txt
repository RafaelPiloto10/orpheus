Like they deserve  
Wasn't spilt in vein  
So now you're pullin' the moves pullin'  
the moves pullin' the moves  
We'll wage, we'll wage we'll wage war  
To replace our name  
Some guys got blurred  
So now you're pullin' the moves, pullin'  
the moves, pullin' the moves  
We'll wage, we'll wage, we'll wage war  
To reclaim our terrain  
  
On January 1st, 1994  
The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico  
Declared war on an unjust  
and illigitimate government  
  
Of of the debt of the most wild, the most poor  
Came a just arm struggle  
for democracy, justice, and liberty  
And it won't stop until that 65 year old dictatorship,  
the Partido Revolucionario Institucional  
(Institutional Revolutionary Party) is buired in the ground  
and the people's voicce is heard once again  
  
So check it out:  
On January 1st, they became known as  
the Zapatista movement  
And they have a saying, and I want you all to  
sing along with me real quick.  
It goes something like this  
It goes, everything for everyone...  
and nothing for ourselves.  
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.  
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.  
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.  
Yeah, sing that shit...  
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.  
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.  
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.  
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves...
