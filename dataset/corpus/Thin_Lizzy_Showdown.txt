Johnny cool was the king  
The leader of the boot boys  
He'd never cause no trouble  
In a rumble make some noise  
  
He heard about some chick  
And they she like to rock  
He said "come here honey"  
"let me see you lift up your frock"  
  
There's gonna be a showdown  
  
Miss Lucy was a chick  
He knew she like to ball  
He said "come on Lucy"  
"it doesn't matter to me at all"  
  
But miss lucy got a fella  
With a flick knife in his hand  
Johnny cool pulls a shotgun  
The man is in command  
  
There's gonna be a showdown  
  
King cool  
King Kong  
King king  
With all the kings  
  
King of hearts he's a lover  
King of spades he's a brother  
King of clubs makes a dollar  
King of diamonds the wedding ring  
  
There's gonna be a showdown
