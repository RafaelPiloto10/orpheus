What is that strang air in the sky.  
Why should a strange star pass me by.  
  
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind,  
The silly people just like you and better too.  
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning on the faces  
Of the people in the churches of the land.  
  
That's all a way that I cut from the lives.  
The day has come at last.  
  
People that cry in the boulevard,  
Their eyes are blind they cry so hard.  
  
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind,  
The silly people just like you and better too.  
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning on the faces  
Of the people in the churches of the land.  
  
That's all it seems, there is only one dream.  
The day has come at last.  
  
That's all it seems, there is only one dream.  
The day has come at last.  
  
What you have done makes me ashamed.  
Ill blow it up and start again.  
  
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind,  
The silly people just like you and better too.  
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning in the faces  
Of the people in the churches of the land.  
  
That's all it seems, there is only one dream.  
The day has come at last.
