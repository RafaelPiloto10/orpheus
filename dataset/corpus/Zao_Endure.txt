I will endure.  
It will endure in me.  
Until the end forever,  
I will endure.  
If we continue in these ways,  
Rebellion bends towards hatred.  
We rise up for our cause  
And forsake the outsiders.  
Where is this love, this understanding?  
Who will stand?  
What will break down  
If this uprise of self is left to reign? (This has chose?) for a standard to
uphold.  
An answer for the questions.  
Wavering of beliefs lead to destruction.  
Nothing remains constant to, to its origin.  
But the unchanging faith of Christ,  
The One stable since, since creation.  
Thoughts have come and theories have gone.  
Nothing has lasted through, through the resistance.  
But can deny, who can dispute  
The faith that's been throughout  
Since the foundation of the beginning?  
It has always been and will always be.  
Forever.  
It has been proven. it shall remain.  
This faith has stood the test.  
It persists through the conflict,  
Through the revolt against its ways.  
Nothing has held true like this.  
No other has revealed such strength.  
The roots deep within,  
Entangling around my Rock.  
Never letting go of this truth,  
The power that sustained.  
I will endure in what I believe, and what I believe  
Will endure in me.
