A crack in the smile  
But she's always in style while she waits  
Waving goodbye but she's too tired to cry and she's wasted  
A letter he wrote  
But it's far too expose so he throws it away  
The sound of regret as it's counting the steps back to safe  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to leave you with perfume and promises  
But we'll never know 'till we capture and bottle it  
'Cause wouldn't it be such a shame  
If all was wasted  
  
Not an inch of the room  
That isn't in bloom or in light  
So we drink 'till its dawn  
Every drip 'till it's gone and we're wasted  
It's a thing of the truth  
But we'll lie and we'll look for the perfect escape  
And the moment will go like melted snow in the rain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stay for another morning  
Study the curves on my face  
Stay even when we're unknowing  
Stay 'till they tear you away  
  
[Chorus]
