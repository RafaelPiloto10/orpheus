In the morning you go gunning for the man who stole your water  
And you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border  
And the mourners are all singing as they drag you by your feet  
But the hangman isn't hanging so they put you on the street  
  
You go back Jack do it again wheels turning round and round  
You go back Jack do it again  
When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend  
In a room with your two timer but you're sure you're near the end  
  
Then you love a little wild one and she brings you only sorrow  
All the time you know she's smiling you'll be on your knees tomorrow  
You go back Jack do it again...  
  
Now you swear and kick and beg us that you're not a gambling man  
Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand  
Your black cards can bring you money so you hide them when you're able  
In the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table  
You go back Jack do it again...
