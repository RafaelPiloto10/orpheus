Operator I'm looking for a girl  
You've got to help me get through  
I don't know much about her  
So I'm relying on you  
She got rhythm but no sense of timing  
She likes living but she's got no address  
Operator you've got to get me out of this mess  
Let me tell you about her  
  
She ain't got a face  
She ain't got a name  
She ain't got a leg to stand upon  
She's out of touch  
But not out of mind  
And I've got to see again that gypsy child  
Operator this is the call of the wild  
  
She's a hitch hiker never gets a ride  
But you can bet she's on time  
She's always around but so hard to find  
She causes trouble she never takes offense  
Dirty mind a heart of gold  
Operator don't you put me on hold  
  
She ain't got a face  
She ain't got a name  
She ain't got a leg to stand upon  
She's out of touch  
But not out of mind  
And I've got to see again that gypsy child  
Operator this is the call of the wild  
  
She ain't got a face  
She ain't got a name  
She ain't got a leg to stand upon  
She's out of touch  
But not out of mind  
And I've got to see again that gypsy child  
Operator this is the call of the wild  
  
She ain't got a face  
She ain't got a name  
She's out of touch  
But not out of mind  
She ain't got a face  
She ain't got a name  
She's out of touch  
But not out of mind
