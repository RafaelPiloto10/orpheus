What's got you so jumpy?  
Why can't you sit still, yeah?  
Like gasoline you want to pump me  
And leave me when you get your fill, yeah  
Every time I touch you honey you get hot  
I want to make love you never stop  
Come up for air you push me to the floor  
What's been going on in that head of yours  
  
[Chorus]  
Unskinny bop  
Just blows me away  
Unskinny bop, bop  
All night and day  
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop  
She just loves to play  
Unskinny bop nothin' more to say  
  
You look at me so funny  
Love bite got you acting oh so strange  
You got too many bees in your honey  
Am I just another word in your page, yeah, yeah  
Every time I touch you honey you get hot  
I want to make love you never stop  
Come up for air you push me to the floor  
What's been going on in that head of yours  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're sayin' my love won't do ya  
But that ain't love written on your face  
Well honey I can see right through ya  
We'll see whose ridin' who at the end of the race  
  
What's right  
What's wrong  
What's left  
What the hell is going on  
  
[Chorus]
