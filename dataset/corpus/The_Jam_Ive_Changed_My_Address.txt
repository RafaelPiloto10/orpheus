Knew the time to leave had come when you pointed out your ring  
Never could see what was in this matrimony thing  
Baby, baby, baby you sure made a noise when I left  
And your father started shouting lest you ironed my shirts  
'fore I left  
Would've liked to explain first but it was a split decision thing  
Couldn't see me settling down with a mortgage and a kid  
Now I hear you've been looking for me  
Combing every single inch  
You'll probably find me in Hyde Park  
Try the hotel first then a bench  
Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address  
I didn't mean to make you cry but I know it's for the best  
Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address  
It's OK being in love girl, but then fun is second best  
No one's gonna tie me down  
Nobody tell me what to do  
Don't you see I've got to be free  
Sorry baby that's the way it is - get with me  
I said maybe!  
I didn't mean to break your heart and I know it's not your choice  
Better think of it this way, there's other fools to entice  
That's right!  
Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address  
I didn't mean to make you cry but I know it's for the best  
Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address  
It's OK being in love girl, but then fun is second best  
Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address  
I didn't mean to make you cry but I'm sure it's for the best  
Baby, baby, baby I've changed my address  
It's OK being in love girl, but then fun is second best
