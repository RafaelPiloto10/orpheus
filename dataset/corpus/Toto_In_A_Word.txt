Stop, taking for granted  
I am the one who's wrong  
You might be surprised  
Time standin' still - seems like we don't belong  
You'll realize  
Start giving to me all you can  
Stop telling me girl just where I stand  
  
Chorus:  
It's your turn you should show what you know to me  
One I've not heard before  
My concern you can't tell what you know to me  
You can't say it all in a word  
  
Life turns around  
Time not to look away  
And face what you see  
Truth shows itself - watch everything you say  
When you're talking to me  
You find yourself just in time  
No don't be afraid of what you'll find on the way  
  
Chorus:  
It's your turn you should show what you know to me  
One I've not heard before  
My concern you can't tell what you know to me  
You can't say it all in a word  
  
It's your turn you should show what you know to me  
One I've not heard before  
My concern you can't tell what you know to me  
You can't say it all in a word  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
Chorus:  
It's your turn you should show what you know to me  
One I've not heard before  
My concern you can't tell what you know to me  
You can't say it all in a word  
No you can't say it all in one word...
