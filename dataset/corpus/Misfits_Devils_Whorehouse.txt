She works at the devil's whorehouse  
She loves carnality  
In her human pit of love  
Entrance into heresy, well  
  
When I sin, I sin real good  
When I sin, I sin for sure  
  
Come on up to the devil's whorehouse  
Intimate hell of a demon slut, well  
Angels take their time in falling  
Come alive in the house that screams  
  
When I sin, I sin real good  
When I sin, I sin for sure  
  
Come alive in the house that screams  
Come alive in the house that screams  
  
This is the devil's whorehouse  
Night time for beating backs, well  
Said this is the devil's whorehouse  
Night time for midnight masses  
  
When I sin, I sin real good  
When I sin, I sin for sure  
  
Come alive in the house that screams  
Come alive in the house that screams  
  
When I sin, I sin real good  
When I sin, I sin for sure  
When I sin, I sin real good  
When I sin, I sin for sure
