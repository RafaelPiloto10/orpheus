Jeane,  
The low life has lost its appeal  
And I'm tired of walking these streets  
To a room with its cupboards bare  
Jeane,  
I'm not sure what happiness means  
But I look in your eyes and I know...  
That it isn't there  
  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried...  
Oh Jeane...  
  
There's ice on the sink where we bathe  
So how can you call this a home  
When you know its a grave  
Yet you still have that greedy grace...  
As you tidy the place  
But it will never be clean...  
Jeane  
  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried...  
  
Gash on the nail  
Its just a fairytale...  
And I don't believe in magic anymore, Jeane...  
  
But I think you know,  
I really think you know  
Oh yes I think you know the truth, Jeane  
  
No heavenly choirs not for me  
And no not for you  
Because I think you know  
I really think you know  
I think you know the truth  
Oh Jeane  
  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried and we failed  
We tried...
