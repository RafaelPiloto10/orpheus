You can have girls and girls  
You can have boys and boys  
You can have sex and violence  
You can have space age toys  
You can have anything that you think will fit  
As long as it's box office, as long as it's a hit  
  
Cinema, cinema  
  
You can have birdmen and snowmen  
You can have women in red  
Hero taxi drivers talk about evil dead  
Black hats and white hats you know what I mean  
A flashdance welder and Jesus in jeans  
  
Cinema, cinema  
  
Norma Jean has gone with the wind  
And we'll never, never see her no more  
Jimmy Dean you drove that machine  
Chased a dream, chased a dream  
  
We've been up the junction, down the yellow brick road  
We've got beauty with beast  
And a prince with a toad  
We've got future adventures  
You believe man can fly  
Put on your 3-d glasses  
Get a shark in the eye
