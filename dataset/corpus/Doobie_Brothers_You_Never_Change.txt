You're still playing that time-worn melody  
Play it now for old time's sake once more  
When you want me, you won't be usin' me  
Like you've done a thousand times before  
'Cause I found out now  
You never change  
Ain't no use in foolin' myself  
You never change at all  
  
You're still sayin'  
That you're misunderstood  
Won't go fallin' this time, that's for sure  
All your methods won't do you any good  
They've all been tried a thousand times before  
  
'Cause I found out now  
You never change  
Ain't no use in foolin' myself  
You never change at all  
  
It ain't no use, you'll never change  
Stop your runnin' around...
