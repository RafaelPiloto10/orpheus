Anytime you wanna love me you can love me anytime  
Early morning, late at night, anytime the time is right  
Oh, if you want to hold me, well, you know that you can  
Anytime, anytime, I'm your man  
  
Baby you're something, you're something else  
I'll keep you're loving all to myself  
I live for the moment when it's just you and me  
Baby, just you and me  
  
Anytime you wanna love me you can love me anytime  
'cause I'm ready and I'm willing, name the placem name the time  
December through november, just give me your hand  
Anytime, anytime, I'm your man  
  
So hold me close, close as you can  
Whisper to me, now what's your plan  
You can trust me, understand baby, understand  
  
Anytime you wanna love me you can love me anytime  
Oh, if you want to hold me, well, you know you always can  
Anytime, anytime, I'm your man
