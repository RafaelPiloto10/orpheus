I stood in this sun sheltered place  
'Til I could see the face behind the face  
All that had gone before had left no trace  
  
Down by the railway siding  
In our secret world, we were colliding  
All the places we were hiding love  
What was it we were thinking of?  
  
So I watch you wash your hair  
Underwater, unaware  
And the plane flies through the air  
Did you think you didn't have to choose it  
That I alone could win or lose it  
In all the places we were hiding love  
What was it we were thinking of?  
  
In this house of make believe  
Divided in two, like Adam and Eve  
You put out and I receive  
  
[Chorus]  
Down by the railway siding  
In our secret world, we were colliding  
In all the places we were hiding love  
What was it we were thinking of?  
  
Oh the wheel is turning spinning round and round  
And the house is crumbling but the stairways stand  
  
With no guilt and no shame, no sorrow or blame  
Whatever it is, we are all the same  
  
Making it up in our secret world [x3]  
Shaking it up  
Breaking it up  
Making it up in our secret world  
  
Seeing things that were not there  
On a wing on a prayer  
In this state of disrepair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shh, listen
