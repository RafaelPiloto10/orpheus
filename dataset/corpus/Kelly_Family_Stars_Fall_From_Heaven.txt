  
  
It's cold outside  
And the moon is bright  
And I'm all alone tonight  
If I was a star  
That shined so bright  
I'd shine my love to you  
  
It's not the words you say  
Neither the way they're said  
And it's not the things you do  
That make me want to fly  
Oh baby  
  
When a star falls from heaven  
Don't ask me why  
When a star falls from heaven  
It just makes me cry  
  
When stars fall from heaven  
I don't know why  
When stars fall from heaven  
Gonna see me cry  
  
It's cold outside  
It's dar out here  
You're far and I'm alone  
The stars shine bright  
As the tears roll down  
My burning cheeks as I cry  
  
It's not the words you say  
Neither the way they're said  
And it's not the things you do  
That make me want to fly  
Oh baby  
  
When stars fall ...  
Hey hey hey hey yeah ...
