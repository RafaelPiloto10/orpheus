Well it's crazy, but oh baby oh baby,

Last real kiss. I do belive with laugh and remanise, wait a minute, don't

All my love was all I had.

You'll be leavn' me but to bad.  
(B-e-t don't make desions what you bad.)  
So pack your trunks and run along.  
(I know your indepentent you can make it on your own)  
Here with me you had a home  
(Time is up for essances, why spend it alone.  
  
All those nights I waited up for you, promises you made  
Without comin' through. So much time you waisted, that's  
why I had to replace
