I never made it back to Boston  
I've always been a rambling man  
But by the time I got to Phoenix  
She didn't quite fit in my plans  
I lost my heart in San Francisco  
And found it in the streets of Baltimore  
There must be someone wanting true love  
Could it be you?  
Hey vie got so much inside me to give  
What can I do?  
It seemed that Rachel's wings got colder  
She finally crossed loves cheating line  
She fell for some young Dallas cowboy  
Hey, I never saw the danger signs  
Whiskey and women was my weakness  
Jack Daniels let me down again
