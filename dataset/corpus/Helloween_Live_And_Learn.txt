Live and Learn  
  
Remember the first time you've faced the dark  
Why were you so afraid?  
Hiding so many secrets inside  
When fearshave got to be tamed  
  
I promisse I'll still be there  
To keep my promisse  
I'll still be there  
  
To watch over dreams at night  
And follow you through the day  
You shot the doors but I'm right behind  
Where shadows remain  
  
I promisse I'll still be there  
To Say I promisse  
I'll still be there  
  
Don't ask me why we'll be like brothers  
Skating on the ice of mortall loneliness  
  
Live and Learn with your mind  
Find a way out of madness  
You dream on (of) paradise  
Who's gonna take you there
