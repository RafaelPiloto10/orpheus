When I'm down I make a call.  
Got the number written on the wall.  
First it's busy then I try again.  
Oh, who's she talking to, could it be him?  
  
I got the number and it starts to ring.  
I get excited and I start to dream.  
I start to fantasize of memory lane.  
Then she answers and she says right way.  
She says I'm home on my own, home all alone.  
So I got off the phone.  
  
(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time.  
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind.  
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl.  
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight.  
  
I have something got to say to you.  
Amnesia and my train of thought.  
On the tip, tip of my tongue.  
I had a vision when I was young.  
  
You floated in, we floated up.  
Through the window and down the hall.  
I had a smoke and went upstairs.  
Turned the door and opened the key. She spoke...  
I'm on my own, home all alone.  
So I got off the phone.  
  
(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time.  
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind.  
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl.  
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight.  
  
(She's tight.) She's giving me the go.  
(She's tight.) She's giving me the high sign.  
(She's tight.) We'll turn off the lights.  
(She's tight.) Pull down the shades.  
(She's nice, she's tight.) Turn on the cam'ra.  
(She's nice, she's tight.) And getting ready for action.  
  
Turn off the radio.  
Turn on the video.
