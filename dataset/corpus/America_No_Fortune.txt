We were dancin' in the middle  
We could hardly hold our heads up  
I think we had too much to drink  
I remember wondering what they'd think  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
We were thinkin' 'bout the future  
We were trying not to laugh  
Then you made me cry instead  
I remember wishing I was dead  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Well I'm coming home lady  
I'm your homecoming man  
Trying hard to stand the rain  
Gettin' back on my feet again  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
