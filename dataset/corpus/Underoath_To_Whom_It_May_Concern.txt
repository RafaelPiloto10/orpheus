So hold your head up high  
And know it's not the end of the road  
Walk down this beaten path before you  
Pack your things and head home  
At the end of the road  
You'll find what you've been looking for  
  
I know 'cause my feet have the scars to show  
I was lost with vague direction  
And no place to call home  
  
It's time for you to press on  
This is not your war  
Set your sights to North and press on  
This is not your escape  
Wash away what they thought of you  
Because in this place, we're all as good as dead  
...End cycle...  
  
Behind the mask you'll find yourself alone  
It's not the end of road for you
