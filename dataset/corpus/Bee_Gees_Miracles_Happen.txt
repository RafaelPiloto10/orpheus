Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
If we just try  
We can put it back together, you and I.  
And all the bad is blown away.  
I never said goodbye.  
  
Is the writing on the wall  
That makes you see.  
And it's the saviour of my soul.  
And what I say that must be heard  
With love in every word.  
  
Close your eyes, don't let go,  
Don't get lost in the falling snow.  
Always out of place alone,  
With someone you're not sure of.  
  
Broken wings don't arrive.  
It's a storm but you still survive.  
  
It's gonna take a miracle.  
  
So I go around believing you.  
I say good night, stay forever and  
Nobody knows how much  
I pray for you at night.  
And miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
And yesterday  
There was nothing in my life worth living for.  
You were there and I was born,  
The very strength to carry on  
A miracle has come.  
  
Hold on tight, call my name,  
Don't get caught in the midnight rain.  
Part of me believes in you,  
You're someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there,  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
And through it all we rise and fall,  
Tear it apart and stay forever.  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
Red, blue, black and white.  
True light shine on anyone.  
Two hearts make it right.  
And all that love can change.  
  
Close my eyes, don't let go.  
I'll be lost in the falling snow.  
Always out of place alone,  
With someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
And through it all we rise and fall.  
We tear it apart and stay forever.  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen.  
  
Hold on tight, call my name,  
Don't get caught in the midnight rain.  
Part of me believes in you,  
You're someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there,  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
Close my eyes, don't let go.  
I'll be lost in the falling snow
