Everybody wants to have a girl like you  
But I'm the one and it's right  
Somebody comes along and says they play your song  
My wish becomes his delight  
He'll try to take you from me  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
Not gonna get far from me  
Don't wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind (so...)  
Don't wanna let you go  
Some things money can't buy  
  
Your smiles pasted  
My time is wasted  
You say I told you so, told you so  
You can't tell lies from facts  
He'll try to hold you back  
You make the tension grow, grow and grow  
He'll try to take you from me  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
Your not gonna get far from me  
Don't wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind (so...)  
Don't wanna let you go  
Some things money can't buy...  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
  
Don't wanna let you go
