I've been standing in the dark  
Staring out the window at the moon  
With a heartache like I've never known before  
And I can't eat and I can't sleep  
This pain inside, it's like it's killing me  
It's over, he said  
You don't love me anymore  
  
So this is lonely  
Now I know how it feels to lose  
This is lonely  
It's nothing anyone on earth can do  
Only time can heal  
This hurt I feel  
Cause he ain't coming back  
That's what he told me  
Now I'm lonely  
  
He did everything I wanted  
Still I took his love for granted too long, it seems  
There ain't nothing I can do to right this wrong  
And it's too late to turn back time  
And all my tears ain't gonna change his mind  
It's over, he said  
You don't love me anymore  
  
So this is lonely  
Now I know how it feels to lose  
This is lonely  
It's nothing anyone on earth can do  
Only time can heal  
This hurt I feel  
Cause he ain't coming back  
That's what he told me  
Now I'm lonely  
  
This is lonely  
So this is lonely  
It's over, he said  
You don't love me anymore
