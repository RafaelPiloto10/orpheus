Change, change, it's all rearrangin'  
Lookin' around at the situation  
Go back, see what you're doin'  
The way you're takin' life, you're goin'  
To rack and ruin  
I'm turning circles, so stay away  
We've all got somethin' wrong to say  
Slow down, see where we're headin'  
The way things are goin' now  
Your life it ain't pleasin'  
Had my share of up and down  
Don't spend time, don't spend time  
Rushin' around.  
I'm turning circles, so stay away  
We've all got somethin' wrong to say.  
Uh-uh uh-uh  
Uh-uh uh-uh  
I'm turning circles, so stay away  
We've all got somethin' wrong to say.  
Uh-uh uh-uh (turning circles)  
Uh-uh uh-uh (stay away)
