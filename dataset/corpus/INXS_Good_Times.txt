Everybody shake  
Everybody groove  
Everybody shake  
  
Mary, Mary, you're on my mind  
The folks are gone and the place'll be mine  
Mary, Mary, wanna be with you  
  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna put a call to you  
'Cause I feel good tonight  
And everything's gonna be right, right, right  
  
I'm gonna have a good time tonight  
Rock and roll music gonna play all night  
Come on, baby, it won't take long  
Only take a minute just to sing my song  
  
Boney Moroney's gonna be with him  
I said, Long Tall Sally's gonna be with Slim  
And Short Fat Fanny's gonna, she's gonna be there too  
  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
Well, I've got to put a call to you  
'Cause I feel good tonight  
And everything's gonna be right, right, right  
  
I'm gonna have a good time tonight  
Rock and roll music gonna play all night  
Come on, baby, it won't take long  
Only take a minute just to sing my song  
  
Boney Moroney's gonna be with Jimmy  
Long Tall Sally's gonna be with him  
And Short Fat Fanny's gonna be there too  
  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
I've got to put the call to you  
'Cause I feel good tonight  
And everything's gonna be right, right, right  
  
I'm gonna have a good time tonight  
Rock and roll music gonna play all night  
Come on, baby, it won't take long  
Only take a minute just to sing my song
