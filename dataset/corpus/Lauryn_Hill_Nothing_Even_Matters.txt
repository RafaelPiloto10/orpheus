Now the skies could fall  
Not even if my boss should call  
The world it seems so very small  
'Cause nothin' even matters, at all  
  
See nothin' even matters  
See nothin' even matters at all  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters at all  
  
See, I don't need no alcohol  
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall  
Without it, I'd go through withdrawal  
'Cause nothin' even matters at all  
  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters at all  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters at all  
  
These buildings could drift out to sea  
Some natural catastrophe  
Still there's no place I'd rather be  
'Cause nothin' even matters to me  
  
See nothin' even matters  
See nothin' even matters to me  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters to me  
  
You're part of my identity  
I sometimes have the tendency  
To look at you religiously, baby  
'Cause nothin' even matters to me  
  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters to me  
Said I don't, my baby, baby  
  
Now you won't find me at no store  
I have no time for manicures  
With you it's never either or  
'Cause nothin' even matters no more  
  
See nothin', it don't matters  
See nothin' even matters no more  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters no more  
  
Now my team could score  
And make it to the final four  
Just repossess my 4 x 4  
'Cause nothin' even matters no more  
  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters no more  
Nothin' even matters, oh oh oh  
  
To me, to me, to me, to me, to me  
To me, to me, to me, to me, to me  
  
Nothing even matters  
Nothing even matters no more  
Nothing even matters  
Nothing even matters  
  
Nothing but you  
Nothing but you  
Nothing but you
