After night, you've gone away  
There's nothing I can do  
Baby, after the night, I can't make you stay  
After you telling me you're through  
  
Now after the night, there'll be somebody new  
Loving these gone red  
Tomorrow'll be another idle day for me  
After you've gone away  
  
Now you hold your life  
Having your fun  
Oh, baby, I'll be the lonely one  
I'll be  
  
After night, you'll go your way  
Thinking you've done right  
Oh, baby, I'll be here left all alone  
Mama, after the night
