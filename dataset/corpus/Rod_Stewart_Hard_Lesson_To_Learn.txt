I drifted into the notion  
That you were looking for me  
I told myself that devotion  
Would flow from your heart to me  
  
When I looked into your eyes  
Still no reflection did I see  
Of love light glowing within there  
That I hoped there would be  
  
And it's a hard lesson to learn my friend  
A hard lesson to learn  
Sometimes you gonna get what you want  
Times you gonna get burned  
  
I took a chance on emotion  
Washing my heart out to see  
A single wave on the ocean  
You feel so distant from me  
And there's a shadow dark upon your smile  
A sadness living in your eyes  
Storm clouds rolling in an outofdaught  
Guess I been living alive  
  
And it's a hard lesson to learn my friend  
Hard lesson to learn  
Sometimes you gonna get what you want  
Sometimes you gonna get burned  
Sometimes you gonna get what you want  
Sometimes you gonna get burned  
  
And it's a hard lesson to learn my friends  
Hard lesson to learn  
Sometimes you gonna get what you want  
Sometimes you gonna get burned  
  
I drifted into the notion  
That you were looking for me  
I told myself that devotion  
Would flow from your heart to me  
But when I looked into your beautiful eyes  
Still no reflection did I see  
Of love light glowing within there  
That I kind o hoped there would be  
  
And it's a hard lesson to learn my friends  
Hard lesson to learn  
Sometimes you gonna get what you want  
Sometimes you gonna get burned  
Sometimes you gonna get what you want  
Sometimes you gonna get burned  
Sometimes you gonna get what you want  
Sometimes you gonna get burned  
Sometimes you gonna get what you want  
Sometimes you gonna get burned  
  
Yeah, yeah,yeah  
Yeah, yeah oh  
  
Sometimes you gonna get what you want  
Sometimes you gonna get burned
