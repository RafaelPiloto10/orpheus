Some of these days  
You're gonna miss your Donna  
Some of these days  
You're gonna feel so lonely  
You'll miss my huggin'  
You'll miss my kissin'  
You'll miss me honey  
When you're far away  
  
You're gonna be so lonely  
For me only  
Cause you know daddy  
You had you way  
And if I leave you  
You know it's gonna grieve you  
You're gonna miss your sweet lovin' Donna  
Some of these days  
  
And if I leave you  
You know it's gonna grieve you  
You're gonna miss your sweet little Donna  
Some of these days  
  
Hey honey call me when you got time  
Know what I mean...
