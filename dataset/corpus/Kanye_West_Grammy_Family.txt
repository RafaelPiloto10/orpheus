Oh, it can't be G.O.O.D music my Grammy Family  
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry  
Now I'm hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B  
But you niggaz gon' get in 'til you get to Miami  
  
GLC gon' be stoned as Angie  
I be Don C, Johnny Patrone and me  
It's a celebration, bitches, more bottles of champaign  
I ain't in love with the same stripper that sprung T  
Pain and all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap, man  
  
Dawg, I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest  
Stuntin' out the middle of nowhere like Vegas  
From the Chi, the city of hella haters  
Where we keep risin' to the top like elevators  
  
Hi haters, I'm back of hiatus  
I feel just like you, I mean even I hate us  
Turn the radio down I mean every song  
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian  
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on  
  
Until Khaled turned up the volume  
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin'  
Nas done told you come on homie we major  
Really Doe told you hoes where we stayin'  
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playin'  
  
Dawg, it can't be G.O.O.D. music the Grammy Family  
A little bit a stuntin', flickin', dawg, it ain't deep  
I'm only tryin' to spend what they claim you can't keep  
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side  
Like Lake Shore Drive, The Grammy Family  
  
It's the Cons fool, word  
  
No, it can't be G.O.O.D. music my Grammy Family  
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry  
Now we hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B  
And after music meeting wit evenings with Angie  
  
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me  
And we be in Miami so when they spot me in Bentley  
It's gon' be a stampede 'cuz we be racin' Bentleys  
No different than Grand Prix's  
  
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze  
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed  
I started independent with owners from land speed  
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed  
  
And since I got my shot like I was call and man be  
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B  
We'll be waitin' in the telly like Jamie and Fancy  
  
Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties  
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby  
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby  
  
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath  
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed  
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step  
  
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check  
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is  
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is  
  
The Grammy Family  
On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night  
Celebrate tonight, oh, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
