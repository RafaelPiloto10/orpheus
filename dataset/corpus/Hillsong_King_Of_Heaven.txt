Verse  
You tore the night apart  
And ripped the silent skies in half  
Your glory breaking through the dark  
  
And here our worlds collide  
Divinity in man confined  
This great design drawn out for me  
  
Chorus  
Emmanuel  
God with us  
Emmanuel  
Hallelujah  
  
Verse  
You hold the ends of time  
Yet place Yourself here into mine  
My life is now forever changed  
  
Our eyes be lifted up  
Our great eternal hope arrives  
This great design drawn out for me  
  
Bridge  
In our silence  
Heaven whispered out  
In our darkness  
Glory pierced the night  
  
We were broken  
But now we're lifted up  
King of heaven  
God is here with us  
  
Hallelujah  
Angels cried aloud  
Singing holy  
All the praise resound  
  
King of heaven  
On the earth be found  
King of heaven  
On the earth be found
