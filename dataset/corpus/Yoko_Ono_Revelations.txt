Oh, please don't give me that!  
  
Yes, I'm a witch,  
I'm a bitch  
I don't care what you say,  
My voice is real.  
My voice speaks truth,  
I don't fit in your ways.  
  
I'm not gonna die for you,  
You might as well face the truth,  
I'm gonna stick around for quite awhile.  
  
We're gonna say,  
We're gonna try,  
We're gonna try it our way.  
We've been repressed,  
We've been depressed,  
Suppression all the way.  
  
Were not gonna die for you,  
Were not seeking vengeance,  
But were not gonna kill ourselves for your convenience.  
  
Each time we don't say what we wanna say, were dying.  
Each time we close our minds to how we feel, were dying.  
Each time we gotta do what we wanna do, were living.  
Each time were open to what we see and hear, were living.  
  
Well free you from the ghettos of your minds,  
Well free you from your fears and binds,  
We know you want things to stay as it is,  
Its gonna change, baby.  
  
Its gonna change, baby doll,  
Its gonna change, honey ball,  
Its gonna change, sugar cane,  
Its gonna change, sweetie legs.  
So don't try to make cock-pecked people out of us.
