Have you ever been kicked to the curb  
When the party finally ends  
Just when I thought that you left me for dead  
You dust me off again  
  
Maybe you thought you could throw me away  
Like a shoe that doesn't fit  
But you've created your Frankenstein  
And now you've gotta live with it  
And here I am  
  
Thought I'd turn and walk away  
Guess this ain't your lucky day  
  
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'  
I'm here to put you through hell  
Too bad if you don't believe it  
You've done it to yourself  
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'  
Who cares if you hate my dog  
Maybe I'll get another  
Just to piss you off  
  
I don't mind tying up the phone  
And sleepin' in real late  
Haven't you noticed me fillin' the fridge  
With all the foods you hate  
And here I am  
Thought I'd turn and walk away  
Guess this ain't your lucky day  
  
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'  
I'm here to put you through hell  
Too bad if you don't believe it  
You've done it to yourself  
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'  
Who cares if you hate my dog
