Wednesday's child is a child of woe.  
Wednesday's child cries alone, I know.  
When you smiled, just for me you smiled,  
For a while I forgot I was Wednesday's child.  
  
Friday's child wins at love, they say.  
In your arms Friday was my day.  
Now you're gone, well I should have known,  
I am Wednesday's child, born to be alone.  
  
Now you're gone, well I should have known,  
I am Wednesday's child, born to be alone.  
  
Wednesday's child, born to be alone.
