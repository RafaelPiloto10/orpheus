Don't let my feet get off the ground  
Today I'm glad to be standing here  
But all the time I spent tunnelling down  
To some place where I'm not so clear  
  
I've been holding out for this time  
Standing straight in my own line  
Was hoping you're making it too  
  
All the hours we were learning to fly  
We're chasing night-lights round the room  
I can never repay when I learnt from you  
I know you're seeing it your own way too  
  
Your head just went for another walk  
But it's coming home and it hangs in the hall  
Your head in your hand as you're suffering  
But you I know what state you're in  
  
Fall on my knees and my hair rolls around  
But even on my knees I know I can stand  
If it's coming home it's coming for you  
I can see me standing with dunston and you  
  
I've been holding out for my neighbour  
Standing straight for my brother  
Was hoping you're making it too
