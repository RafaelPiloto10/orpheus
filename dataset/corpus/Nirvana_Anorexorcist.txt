You need a path to cross  
Into a place where everyone you see  
Has had a time to try to Play!  
  
If you go get shot  
When you'll be what you name  
Protector of your gun  
Everyone plays with your gun  
  
Way, way, way, way  
Everyone wants to try to gun you gun you down in pain  
Want to see you try to play  
I want to describe you  
Put your name as a national woman  
I don't like your coffee  
I want to have your friendship  
As a jock, and to the top  
  
Way, way, way, way
