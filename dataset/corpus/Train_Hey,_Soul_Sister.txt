Hey, hey, hey  
  
Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains  
I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I let you go and blow my mind  
Your sweet moonbeam, the smell of you in every single dream, I dream  
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided who's one of my kind  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo,  
The way you move ain't fair, you know!  
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do, tonight  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me  
You gave my life direction, a game show love connection we can't deny  
I'm so obsessed, my heart is bound to beat right out of my untrimmed chest  
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Mah Daughter  
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well you can cut a rug, watching you's the only drug I need  
So gangsta, I'm so thug, you're the only one I'm dreaming of  
You see, I can be myself now finally, in fact there's nothing I can't be  
I want the world to see you'll be, with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do,  
Tonight  
Hey, hey, hey  
Tonight  
Hey, hey, hey  
Tonight
