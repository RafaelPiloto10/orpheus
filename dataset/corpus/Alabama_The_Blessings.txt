I satnd here lookin' up at the starts tonight, how can one man have so much in  
Life  
As I look around me, what a picture it paints, I'm much more than lucky, I  
Oughta give my thanks  
There's food on the table, a log on the fire, and in my woman's eyes there's  
Love and desire  
  
The blessings, sent from above, oh, the blessings, a life full of love  
When I look around I can see, all that's been given me, so I lift my eyes up  
To the sky  
I want to give my, my, my, my, my thanks for the blessings  
  
Sometimes I fall asleep at the end of the day and I forget to thank you, I'm  
Ashamed to say  
But as I lay m down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep  
I know you can hear me here on earth, thank you for giving me more than I  
Deserve  
  
The blessings, sent from above, oh, the blessings, a life full of love  
When I look around I can see, all that's been given me, so ilift my eyes up  
To the sky  
'cause I want to give my, my, my, my, my thanks for the blessings  
  
Blessings, when I look around, I can see, all that's been given me  
So, I lift my eyes up to the sky, 'cause I want to give my, my, my, my, my  
Thanks for the blessings  
The blessings, oh, the blessings
