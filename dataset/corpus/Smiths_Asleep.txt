Sing me to sleep  
Sing me to sleep  
I'm tired and I  
I want to go to bed  
  
Sing me to sleep  
Sing me to sleep  
And then leave me alone  
Don't try to wake me in the morning  
'Cause I will be gone  
Don't feel bad for me  
I want you to know  
Deep in the cell of my heart  
I will feel so glad to go  
  
Sing me to sleep  
Sing me to sleep  
I don't want to wake up  
On my own anymore  
  
Sing to me  
Sing to me  
I don't want to wake up  
On my own anymore  
  
Don't feel bad for me  
I want you to know  
Deep in the cell of my heart  
I really want to go  
  
There is another world  
There is a better world  
Well, there must be  
Well, there must be  
Well, there must be  
Well, there must be  
Well...  
  
Bye bye  
Bye bye  
Bye...
