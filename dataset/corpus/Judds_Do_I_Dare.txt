Do I dare show him lovin'?  
Do I go for double or nothin'?  
Do I act like I don't care?  
Or, do I dare?  
  
Do I do what my heart's sayin'?  
Do I hide my love awaitin'?  
Make believe that he's not there?  
Or, do I dare?  
  
This girl's got a problem  
She don't know what to do  
If there's some way of tellin'  
When a man is true  
  
Will he love me faithfully?  
Will he leave me blue?  
Should I run?  
Or, could this be the one?  
  
Do I dare jump in the middle?  
Sure, I care more than a little  
If he don't fall, I'll loose it all  
Tell me, do I dare?  
  
Do I dare?  
Do I dare?  
  
Do I tell him that I've held him  
In my dreams so tight?  
Well, could I risk one little kiss?  
Or, should I take a chance tonight?  
  
Do I do what my heart's sayin'?  
Do I hide my love awaitin'?  
Make believe that he's not there?  
Or, do I dare?  
  
Lord, do I dare?  
Lord, do I dare?
