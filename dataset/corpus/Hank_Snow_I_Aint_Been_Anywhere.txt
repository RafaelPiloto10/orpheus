I was sittin' at home just a-listenin' to my radio  
An' along came a fella who apparently had been on the go  
Well, he started in a-braggin' 'bout ev'rywhere he'd been  
And there isn't any place in this whole world he hasn't seen  
You ask me where I've been, an' I'm a-going to tell you, Pard  
Why, I ain't even been outside the gate in my backyard  
  
I ain't been anywhere, Joe  
I ain't been anywhere, Joe  
I didn't want to go, so  
I guess I'll never know, Joe  
An old stick in the mud, Bud  
I ain't been anywhere  
  
I ain't seen London, Paris, Washington, Chicago,  
Bombay, Mandalay, Calgary, Cashmere,  
Thailand, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland,  
Halifax, Poland, Switzerland, Scotland,  
Liverpool, Dry Gulch, Tombstone, Moscow,  
Carlsbad, Leningrad, Stalingrad, too bad!  
  
I ain't been anywhere, Joe  
I ain't been anywhere, Joe  
I didn't want to go, so  
I guess I'll never know, Joe  
An old stick in the mud, Bud  
I ain't been anywhere

I ain't been anywhere, Joe  
I ain't been anywhere, Joe  
I didn't want to go, so  
I guess I'll never know, Joe  
An old stick in the mud, Bud  
I ain't been anywhere

I ain't been anywhere, Joe  
I ain't been anywhere, Joe  
I didn't want to go, so  
I guess I'll never know, Joe  
An old stick in the mud, Bud  
I ain't been anywhere

I ain't been anywhere, Joe  
I didn't want to go, so  
I guess I'll never know, Joe  
An old stick in the mud, Bud  
I ain't been anywhere  
  
Wait a minute! Horsehair!  
Why, doggone it, that's my hometown  
So I guess I must 'a' been there, huh?  
  
I ain't been anywhere!
