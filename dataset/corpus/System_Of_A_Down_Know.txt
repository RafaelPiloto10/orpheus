Cursed Earth,  
Cursed Earth,  
Cursed Earth,  
Cursed Earth.  
  
I will never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart all  
Because we all live in the valley of the walls when we speak  
We can peak from the windows of their mouths to see the land  
The women chant as they fly up to the sun.  
  
You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, Ever think you know why,  
Know.  
  
Books all say different things while people flap their yellow wings  
Trying to soar by being a whore of life  
And almost everything the sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead  
But now's a bird able to fly able to die able to break your cursed earth  
(fuck your mother's earth)  
  
You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, Ever think you know why,  
Know.  
  
On the other side, on the other side, the other side,  
Do you ever try to fly, Do you ever try to fly?  
Have you ever wanted to die, you ever want to die?  
  
Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly,  
Don't ever try to fly, unless you leave your body on the other side,  
Never try to die, you ever try to die.  
  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, Ever think you know why,  
Know.
