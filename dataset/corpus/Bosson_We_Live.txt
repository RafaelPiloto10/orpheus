We Live and we die  
And we learn to find  
The things we live and die for  
  
I don't want to be an ordinary man  
No I don't want to be as neat as a new pin  
I don't care about just being safe and calm  
Give it up for little li li life  
Give it all up for little li li life  
  
I don't want to be a worker everyday  
No I don't want to be a boss that you obey  
I don't care about what people might just say  
Give it up for little li li life  
Give it all up for little li li life  
  
And the time that we have inside it keeps on ticking, till the end  
So it's time that we live our lives and celebrating  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to say I didn't take the chance  
I don't want to say I never learned the dance  
I want to be someone, someone they show respect  
Give it all up for a little li li life  
Give it all up for a little li li life  
  
And the time that we have inside it keeps on ticking, till the end  
So it's time that we live our lives and celebrating  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Life is all to short to spend on doing boring things,  
And I want and I want I want to have fun  
Holding on to be the one I am  
Holding on to be the one I am...  
  
[Chorus]
