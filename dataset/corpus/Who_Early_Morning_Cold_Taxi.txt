3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old,  
With life's best side on the downward slope,  
It's in my own hands, I know I'll cope,  
My girl's with me and all my friends can see.  
  
Here I am again,  
Early morning cold taxi.  
Early morning cold taxi.  
  
Done it before, do it again,  
Know from experience it's not in vain,  
She's the best I've had, I cannot see, what someone else can do to me.  
It's a long way home but love's so warm, you'll see.  
  
Here I am again,  
Early morning cold taxi.  
Early morning cold taxi.  
  
Early morning cold taxi,  
Each time I do it, I feel so down and out,  
Early morning cold taxi,  
'Though my mind thinks strange I'll keep on, no doubt.  
  
3:36, it's cold, I know I'm growing old,  
One day we'll be wed,  
This I know for it's what she said,  
Then no more will my mind be uneasy.
