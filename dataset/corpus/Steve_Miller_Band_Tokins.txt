Sittin' gettin' higher in the back of a limousine  
While people all around me  
They are finding it harder to dream  
Impossible people seen only in nightmares  
Are beginning to make it real  
And disorder keeps fadin'  
The times they are changin'  
Well, I wish I was behind the wheel  
So I could live it just a little bit longer  
Do my best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
We've got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
Well, time and time and time again  
I've been stuck out in the rain  
But life has been so doggone sweet  
There's no reason to complain  
But the time has come for all to be one  
Yes, we can talk about it now  
And from the middle of the mess  
Here comes one more guess  
And I know it's gonna work somehow  
If we can live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
We've got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
Cause we've gotta live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
We've got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
Now who would ever believe it could happen  
Right here in my hometown  
Especially when it's so far north  
Of the Mason-Dixon line  
But some of the people they just won't forget  
While others slip into regret  
And if things keep goin' the way they're goin'  
I just might get killed yet  
But I wanna live it just a little bit longer  
Do my best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
We've got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
And in a while I know it's gonna change  
And in a while I know it's gonna change
