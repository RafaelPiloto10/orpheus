She came from nowhere and she stole my soul  
Her love was criminal  
I finally found what I was looking for  
Now I can't let it go  
  
We break up, to make up  
Yeah you got me spinning like a yo yo yo  
But I know that you know, yeah  
That girl you will always be mine  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me, back to me  
  
I get so high when she go down down low  
She work it nice and slow  
  
We going round and round and back and forth  
Can't take it anymore  
  
We break up, to make up  
You got me spinning like a yo yo yo  
  
But I know that you know  
That girl you will always be mine  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me, back, back to me  
  
There goes my baby  
My wholesome lady  
Hold me down if my whole world went crazy  
That' s what she spoke  
Just what she said  
Now that's a joke  
That talk is dead  
Know I got to get over the love I had  
The door I keep it open just in case she come back  
Can't deal with the emotions to the point I'm sad  
And I know my hearts broken but I've got so attached  
Baby come back I won't get no sleep  
She more than I want and all that I need  
Locked up my heart and threw away the key so  
And when my baby come back I'm crossing my T's dotting my I's  
And now I can't eat  
Out of my mind  
And that's how it's gonna be so, so  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me, back, back to me  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me, back, back to me
