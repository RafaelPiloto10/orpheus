(note: this is Skold, not Marilyn Manson. It is one of the demos that was
stolen from him that he was recording as a follow-up to his 1996 album
entitled Skold)  
  
Rewrite the consitution.  
Let's justify the revolution.  
The end is here.  
  
If you're a part of the institution.  
You're not a part of the solution.  
Bow down to fear.  
  
I, I, I am the president.  
I, I, the emperor.  
I, I, I am the king of the world.  
  
The only good god is a dead god.  
The only god good for me.  
The only good god is a dead god, baby.  
The only damn god I need.  
  
Don't draw your own conclusion.  
Submit to the grand illusion.  
Get on your knees.  
  
There will be no absolution.  
No final step of evolution.  
The end is near.  
  
I, I, I am the president.  
I, I, the emperor.  
I, I, I am the king of the world.  
  
The only good god is a dead god.  
The only god good for me.  
The only good god is a dead god, baby.  
The only damn god I need.  
  
The only good god is a dead god.  
The only god good for me.  
The only good god is a dead god, baby.  
The only damn god I need.  
  
Your world means nothing to me.  
Your saviors a fool still in your dreams.  
And when you're wrapped in your blame,  
Fullfill your own prophecy.  
No skin off my teeth.  
  
The only good god is a dead god.  
The only god good for me.  
The only good god is a dead god, baby.  
The only damn god I need.  
  
The only good god is a dead god.  
The only god good for me.  
The only good god is a dead god, baby.  
The only fucking god I need.  
  
I killed your king of deceit.  
Chaos come onto me.  
I am free.  
And when you're ultimately,  
Consumed by your own fucking greed.  
You will see.
