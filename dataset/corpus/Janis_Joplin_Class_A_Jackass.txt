Did you think I'd stand there  
While you kicked me in the face  
Doesn't make much sense to push me down  
I need explanation to adjust my way of thought  
Did you think you'd find me hanging round  
And it's ten years later and I haven't left your side  
Even though you gave me reason to  
And I'm standing over your body's losing life  
I guess things are hard to name a few  
Did you think I'd take it when you pushed me in disgrace  
Very hard to leave that behind  
I hate aggravation but that's why you made me fight  
Have to face it you were just high.
