It's like the middle of a... age  
I feel the space between us all  
A forced expense  
But the big divide  
Between the devil and the deep blue sea  
Let's take a chance with beginner's luck  
We have nothing so there's nothing to lose  
I can't believe the only reasons we're here  
Are the reasons in the Bank of England  
  
Hear me now  
We've only started  
They'll just exploit us but it's only day one  
We haven't got that far  
Not far at all
