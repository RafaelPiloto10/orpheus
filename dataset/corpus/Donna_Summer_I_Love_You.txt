From my once upon a time album  
A song about two people who fell in love  
Showing up one day face to face  
  
Well he searched and searched for nights and days  
Till he found the one he loved  
And he wrapped her in his arms again  
And then he thanked the stars above  
That he found what he'd been looking for  
And he stared her in the eyes  
  
He said "I love you"  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
She stared him right back in the eyes  
With a look of disbelief  
Then she gazed off into somewhere else  
Was it real or just a dream?  
And she pulled him oh so close to her  
And she whispered in his ear  
  
She said "I love you"  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
  
They said "I love you"  
Yes, they really do  
They said "I love you"  
Yes, they do  
  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
So if you find someone you love a lot  
You must never let them go  
You just hold them tight with all your might  
And you say three little words  
  
You say "I love you"  
Yes, I really do  
You say "I love you"  
Yes I do  
You say "I love you"
