Sometimes you're up  
Sometimes you're down  
Sometimes fate can kick you around  
When it's winter up here  
It's summer down under  
Sometimes clear skies  
Sometimes thunder  
  
Life is a Corduroy Road  
Life is a Corduroy Road  
  
Well me and my honey  
And my 61 'vette now  
I had to sell everything else  
To get out of debt now  
I always dreamed about  
Cruisin' down Route 66 yeah  
Well I finally got to do it  
But there ain't much left now  
  
Life is a Corduroy Road  
Life is a Corduroy Road  
  
What's goin' on  
As you get a little older  
Feel a little bolder  
Got no time to lose  
Who wants to die  
With a quiver full of arrows  
Pull the string back now  
Let'em all loose, yeah  
  
Life is a Corduroy Road  
Life is a Corduroy Road  
Life is a Corduroy Road  
Life is a Corduroy Road  
That's right  
Look out now
