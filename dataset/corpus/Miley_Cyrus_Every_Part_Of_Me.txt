Ooooh-ooh...  
  
I feel like I'm a million miles away from myself  
More and more these days  
I've been down so many open roads  
But they never lead me home  
And now I just don't know  
  
Who I really am  
How it's gonna be  
Is there something that I can't see?  
I wanna understand  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe I will never be  
Who I was before  
Maybe I don't even know her anymore  
Maybe who I am today  
Ain't so far from yesterday  
Can I find a way to be  
Every part of me?  
  
So I'll try, try to sort things down  
And find myself get my feet back on the ground  
It'll take time but I know I'll be alright  
Cause nothing much has changed...  
On the inside  
  
It's hard to figure out  
How it's gonna be  
Cause I don't really know...  
I wanna understand  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe I will never be who I was before  
Maybe I don't even know her anymore  
Maybe who I am today  
Ain't so far from yesterday  
Can I find a wa to be  
Every part of me, yeah?  
  
[Bridge:]  
I don't wanna wait too long  
To find out where I'm meant to belong  
I've always wanted to be where I am today  
But I never thought I'd feel this way  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe I will never be who I was before  
Maybe I don't even know her anymore  
Maybe who I am today  
Ain't so far from yesterday  
Can I find a way to be  
Every part of me?  
  
Every part of me.
