At the end of the rainbow, there's happiness  
And to find it how often I've tried  
But my life is a race, just a wild goose chase  
and all my dreams have been denied  
  
Why have I always been a failure  
What can the reason be  
I wonder if the world's to blame  
I wonder if it could be me  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
Watching clouds drifting by  
My schemes are just like all my dreams  
Ending in the sky  
  
Some fellows look and find the sunshine  
I always look and find the rain  
And some fellows make a winning sometime  
And I never even make a gain  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
Waiting to find the little bluebird in vain.
