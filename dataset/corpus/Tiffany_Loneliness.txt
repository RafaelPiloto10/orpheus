(harold beaty)  
Baby like a symphony  
That's how love should be  
Like a haunting melody  
Haunting my memory  
Ooh  
One day loneliness will bring  
You and I together again  
No doubt in my mind  
I know it's just a matter of time  
You were my first love  
And that your heart will always remember  
You'll be my last love  
Oh I'm yours, I'm yours  
Till the first of forever  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
So if your new love  
Calls another name in her sleep  
That's one of the symptoms  
That your hold on her is growing weak  
So don't torture your heart  
By paying for one more heartache  
You're only human  
You're entitled to more than one mistake  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Baby like a symphony  
That's how love should be  
Like a haunting melody  
Haunting my memory  
Ooh  
One day loneliness will bring  
You and I together again  
No doubt in my mind  
I know it's just a matter of time  
You were my first love  
And that your heart will always remember  
You'll be my last love  
Oh I'm yours, I'm yours  
Till the first of forever  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together, together again
