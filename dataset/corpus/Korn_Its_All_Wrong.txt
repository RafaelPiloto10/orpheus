What's it gonna be today?  
Keep chipping at my soul  
And why must it disobey?  
The only thing I loathe  
  
How many times a day must I die?  
Nothing's gonna work today  
I'm killing time  
Looking all around to find a way  
It's all wrong  
Knowing that my demon won  
I'm done!  
  
Have I been lead astray?  
Blaming the righteous  
What do you think they'd say?  
Attacking the altar  
  
How many times a day must I die?  
Nothing's gonna work today  
I'm killing time  
Looking all around to find a way  
It's all wrong  
Knowing that my demon won  
I'm done!  
I'm done  
  
I'm done with faceless feelings  
I'm done with anything  
I'm done trying to support you  
and sacrificing everything  
  
Everything, everything!  
  
How many times a day must I die?  
Nothing's gonna work today  
I'm killing time  
Looking all around to find a way  
It's all wrong  
Knowing that my demon won  
I'm done!
