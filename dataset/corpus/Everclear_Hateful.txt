She is livin' far away from a lonely man in the San Francisco Bay,  
He is dreamin' hard of a girl all claid in bad plaid and mad at the whole
world,  
All her friends they are blessed impressed intelligent freaks,  
All of them are six feet tall all of them are hateful to me,  
She sleeps alone and wet with her phone in her face all tied up in her old
bed,  
She walks alone everyday up and down the rainy streets in her own weird way,  
All her friends they are blessed impressed intelligent freaks,  
All of them are six feet tall all of them are hateful to me,  
Hateful, yeah they're hateful to me,  
Hateful, yeah they're hateful to me,  
Hateful, yeah they're hateful to me,  
Hateful,  
Getting very hateful
