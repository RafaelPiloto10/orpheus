Poor Otis dead and gone, Left me here to sing his song  
Pretty little girl with the red dress on  
Poor Otis dead and gone  
Yeah, back down, turn around slowly  
Try it again, remembering when  
It was easy, try it again  
Much to easy, rememberin' when  
All right, look at my shoes, Not quite the walkin' blues  
Don't fight, too much to lose, Can't fight the runnin' blues  
Well, I've got the runnin' blues  
Runnin' away, back to L.A.  
Got to find the dock of the bay  
Maybe find it back in L.A.  
Runnin' scared, runnin' blue  
Goin' so fast, what'll I do  
Well, I've got the runnin' blues  
Runnin' away, back to L.A.  
Got to find the dock of the bay  
Maybe find it back in L.A.  
All right, look at my shoes  
Not quite the walkin' blues  
Don't fight, too much to lose  
Can't fight the runnin' blues  
All right, look at my shoes  
Not quite the walkin' blues  
Don't fight, too much to lose  
Can't fight the runnin' blues
