Oh my God! I'm feeling crazy man  
What could it be?  
As I walk into this place everyone's staring at me  
Somehow I feel I've got a fucked up disease  
As I part the seas  
Fingers come out pointing at me  
Do I make you laugh?  
Do you think I'm funny? Ha ha  
Or funny queer?  
Bitch, get outta here  
Let me make myself clear  
I don't give a fuck  
All you people can suck my motherfuckin' dick!  
  
What's with the hostility?  
Why is it so provoked?  
You're living in a fantasy that's how you cope  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
Feel that you're superior  
I feel your just plain absurd  
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
  
Oh my god! This shit is crazy man  
Look at this scene as I watch these  
Stupid people act like they are machines  
They should really all drop their knees  
Oh, the jealousy that's the one thing I guarantee  
Do I make you laugh?  
Do you think I'm funny? Ha ha  
Or funny queer shit? Get out of here  
Let me make myself clear  
I don't give a fuck  
All you people can suck my motherfuckin' dick!  
  
What's with the hostility?  
Why is it so provoked?  
You're living in a fantasy that's how you cope  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
Feel that you're superior  
I feel your just plain absurd  
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
  
What's with the hostility?  
Why is it so provoked?  
You're living in a fantasy that's how you cope  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
Feel that you're superior  
I feel your just plain absurd  
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy
