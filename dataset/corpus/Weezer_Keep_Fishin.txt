You'll never be  
A better kind  
If you don't leave  
The world behind  
  
Waste my days  
(Waste my days)  
Drown aways  
(Drown aways)  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's just the thought of you  
In love with someone else  
It breaks my heart to see  
You hangin' from your shelf  
  
You'll never do  
The things you want  
If you don't move  
And get a job  
  
Waste my days  
(Waste my days)  
Drown aways  
(Drown aways)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh girl when I'm in love with you  
Keep fishin' if you feel it's true  
There's nothing much that we can do  
To save you from yourself  
  
Waste my days  
(Waste my days)  
Drown aways  
(Drown aways)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh girl when I'm in love with you  
Keep fishin' if you feel it's true  
There's nothing much that we can do  
To save you from yourself  
  
You'll never be  
A better kind  
You'll never be  
A better kind  
  
Whoa ohh  
Whoa ohh (x 7)  
  
Waste my days  
Waste my days (x 7)
