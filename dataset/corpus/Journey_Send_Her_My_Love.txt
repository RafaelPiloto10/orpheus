It's been so long  
Since I've seen her face  
You say she's doin' fine  
I still recall  
A sad cafe  
  
How it hurt so bad to see her cry  
I didn't want to say good-bye  
  
[Chorus]  
Send her my love, memories remain  
Send her my love, roses never fade  
Send her my love  
  
The same hotel, the same old room  
I'm on the road again  
She needed so much more  
Than I could give  
  
We knew our love could not pretend  
Broken hearts can always mend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Callin' out your name I'm dreamin'  
Reflections of a face I'm seein'  
It's her voice  
That keeps on haunting me  
  
Send her, send her my love  
Roses never fade  
Memories remain  
Send her, send her, my love
