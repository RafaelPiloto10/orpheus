I would have given you all of my heart  
But there's someone who's torn it apart  
And she's taking almost all that I've got  
But if you want, I'll try to love again  
Baby I'll try to love again but I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest, baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest  
Cause when it comes to being lucky she's cursed  
When it comes to lovin' me she's worst  
But when it comes to being loved she's first  
That's how I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest, baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest  
  
I still want you by my side  
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried  
Cause I'm sure gonna give you a try  
And if you want, I'll try to love again  
But baby, I'll try to love again, but I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest, baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest  
  
Cause when it comes to being lucky she's cursed  
When it comes to lovin' me she's worst  
But when it comes to being loved she's first  
That's how I know  
  
The first cut is the deepest, baby I know  
The first cut is the deepest
