Run like hell, yeah movin' fast  
Don't fail me now know you gotta last  
Move it on up to the quick step, go  
And I get more speed when, when I get real low  
Yeah runnin'  
Can't kill a dead man, let your secrets fly  
Yeah Runnin'  
Can't kill a dead man, move it on up  
As fire fills the sky  
  
Can't kill a dead man  
Gotta, gotta get just a little more  
Got the wake-up call head hit the floor  
See there ain't nothin' more that I can lose  
So I get real slow when I have to choose  
Yeah runnin'  
Can't kill a dead man, let your secrets fly  
Yeah runnin'  
Can't kill a dead man, move it on up  
As fire fills the sky  
  
I'm leavin', I'm stayin', I'm broken down  
For grievin', conveyin' I am renowned  
In all my dreams I know I can  
In all my dreams I am a dead man  
I'm leavin', I'm stayin', I'm broken down  
I'm leavin'
