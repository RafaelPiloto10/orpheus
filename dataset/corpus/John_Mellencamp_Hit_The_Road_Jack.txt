Ah, ah, ah, ah, hey hey hey, yeah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, hey hey hey, yeah  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
Hit that road Jack and don't you come back no more  
  
I said baby baby don't treat me so mean  
Your the meanest old woman that I ever seen  
I guess if you say so I'm gonna have to pack my things and go  
  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no  
More  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, yea  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, hu-huh, hey hey hey  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, uh-huh, hey hey hey  
  
I said baby baby don't treat me this way  
I'll get back on my feet someday  
I don't care if you do, your just no good  
You ain't had no good loving and ....  
  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, yeah, yeah  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, hey hey hey  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, hey hey hey  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
Hit that road Jack and don't you come back no more, yeah
