Took a little time, before we're done to love me  
Took a little more than I ever did before  
Took your bad intentions  
Took all your excite  
And if I didn't mention  
Took my inhuman rights  
It's a heavy-weight title bout  
The more I live the more I find out  
  
[Chorus]  
Damned, for if I love me  
Damned, for if I care  
Damned, for all the make you feel betters  
As the damned scream this ain't fair  
Damned, for if I love me  
Damned, for if I care  
Damned, for all the make you feel betters  
As the damned scream this ain't fair  
  
Had a little time before I went and fucked me  
Had a little trouble, getting up off the floor  
Had you're I'm not like that  
Had a hand up in my face  
Head bobbing like a wet rat  
No love for the human race  
The more fuel, the farther I go  
The more I live the more I...  
No-no-no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Damned if I do and damned if I don't  
Damned if I will and damned if I won't  
Damned for your screamin' that this ain't fair  
God damn your screamin', I don't care  
  
Took a little time before you tried to fuck me  
Made a little spot for you right there, on the floor  
So fuck your good intentions  
Fuck your human rights  
Fuck your finger in my face  
This time I'm gonna bite  
  
[Chorus]
