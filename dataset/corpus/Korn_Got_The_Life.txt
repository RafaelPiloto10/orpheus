Hate, something, sometime, someway, something kick off the for me  
Something, inside  
I'll never ever follow  
So give me something that is for real  
I'll never ever follow  
  
Get your boogie on  
  
Hate, something, someway, each day, dealing with no forgiveness  
Why? This shit inside  
Now everyone will follow  
So give me nothing just feel  
And now this shit will follow  
  
God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?  
God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say  
God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?  
God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say  
  
Each day I can feel it swallow, inside something they took from me  
I don't feel your deathly ways  
Each day I feel so hollow, inside I was beating me  
You will never see, so come dance with me  
  
Dance with me  
Rumbiddieboo  
Rum bum dee dumb dee bum diddie doo  
Lie!  
  
God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?  
God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say  
God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?  
God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say  
  
Got the life  
  
Got the life
