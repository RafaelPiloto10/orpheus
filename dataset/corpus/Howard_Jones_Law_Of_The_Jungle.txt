Law of the jungle only the fit survive.  
Better make your life your own, do the survival jive.  
There are no answers, words are Cul-de-sac  
And the pity with actions... Difficult turning back  
  
Don't give a thought about those lucky dice  
Paranoid thoughts of worldly vice  
The big thumb it never rests on you  
Anything you want lies here for you...  
Takes a bit of time, means a bit of work  
Heart will give the sign it'll make me look.  
  
Ain't got a clue why I'm here at all  
So while I'm here I'm gonna have it all  
Science men won't explain a thing  
In this prison my soul must sing.  
  
Don't give a thought about those lucky dice  
Paranoid thoughts of worldly vice  
The big thumb it never rests on you  
Anything you want lies here for you...  
Takes a bit of time, means a bit of work  
Heart will give the sign it'll make me look
