I want to see where the sirens sing  
Hear how the wolves howl  
Sail the dead calm waters of the pacific  
  
Dance in the fields of coral  
Be blinded by the white  
Discover the deepest jungle  
  
I want to find the secret path  
A bird delivered into my heart, so  
  
It's not the end  
Not the kingdom come  
It is the journey that matters, the distant wanderer  
Call of the wild  
In me forever and ever and ever forever  
Wanderlust  
  
I want to love by the blue lagoon  
Kiss under the waning moon  
Straying, claiming my place in this mortal coil  
  
Riding the dolphins  
Asking the mountains  
Dreaming Alaska  
The earth can have but earth  
  
I want to find  
  
It's not the end  
  
Look into my eyes and see the wanderer  
See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder
