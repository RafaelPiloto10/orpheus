Crash bang wallop, I'm a lover again  
I've got my eyes on the road and I'm feeling no pain  
I've found a real fine woman  
I'm heading to see her  
Bye bye, melancholy, listen to me  
We had a long long ride  
But it isn't to be  
I've found a real fine woman  
I'm heading to see her  
Get out of my way, get out of my life  
I don't need anybody to tell me how to be right  
Don't try to stop me, I've got the answer  
I won't need anybody except my woman tonight  
I can't help it if I'm starting to smile  
I've got a full gas tank and it's only a mile  
'Til I'll be with my little woman  
I'm ready to see her  
So I say  
Bye bye, melancholy, listen to me  
We had a long long ride  
But it isn't to be  
I've found a real fine woman  
I'm heading to see her  
Get out of my way, get out of my life  
I don't need anybody to tell me how to be right  
Don't try to stop me, I've got the answer  
I won't need anybody except my woman tonight
