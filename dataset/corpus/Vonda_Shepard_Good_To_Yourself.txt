I stopped at an all night diner  
Oh, it seemed like a romantic thing to do  
Yeah, but I'm lonely, it ain't like the movies  
In the old days  
I saw you sittin' in the corner counting change,  
Like you were counting your daydreams  
Then your eyes, they suddenly hit me like a railroad train  
  
Oh, sometimes I think I might be immune to a guy like you  
But I can't walk away, no I can't walk away  
Oh, tonight I see you're at the end of the line, well, me too  
But we all gotta pay  
  
I know you'd be good to me  
I know you'd try to be good to me  
But in the end, baby can't depend on no one else  
When the chips are down, I have found  
You better be good to yourself, good to yourself  
  
I guess I've known you before, maybe in high school  
or maybe you're just one more guy I went looking for  
The boy next door  
Or maybe I'm the girl with the see-through eyes  
But I watch too many movies,  
I get tangled in the story of someone else's life  
Baby, who am I, and who are you?  
  
Oh, sometimes I go to bed at night  
And I think that I'm with you  
Then I say a little prayer, 'cause I threw it all away  
The other day you called up to see if I miss you  
And all I could say was  
  
I know you'd be good to me  
I know you'd try to be good to me  
But in the end, baby can't depend on no one else  
When the chips are down, I have found  
You better be good to yourself, good to yourself  
  
Night has a clever disguise  
She makes me believe that I'm lonely  
I should know by now if I can make it to tomorrow  
I can work it out  
  
'cause in the end, baby can't depend on no one else  
When the chips are down, I have found  
You better be good to yourself, good to yourself
