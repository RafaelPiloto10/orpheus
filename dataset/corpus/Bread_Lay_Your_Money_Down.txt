Put your cards on the table  
Gotta lay your money down  
Show your heart if you're able  
Gotta lay your money down  
  
I've waited long enough  
This time I'm gonna call your bluff  
And see what you got  
And what you been keepin' from me  
  
Girl if you really mean it  
Put your lovin' on the line  
'Cause if I've never seen it  
How 'm I gonna know it's mine  
  
Baby I'm through...  
With nothin' but talk from you  
Gotta lay your money down  
  
All these moves you been makin'  
Like a game of keep away  
I've had all I'm a-takin'  
It's catchin' up to you today  
  
'Cause baby I'm through...  
With nothin' but talk from you  
Gotta lay your money down
