(If at first in love you lose)  
(Don't give up, try again)  
And love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around) around  
Ooo Yeah  
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around) around  
Yeah  
  
So you wanted to be  
Everything you'd heard him say he'd always needed  
But, you're my everything and you mean the world to me  
Were things that he never said  
  
It's such a silly thing  
For you to say  
That you don't want love around  
Don't you know that ...  
  
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around), around  
Ooo Yeah  
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around)  
Yeah  
  
I wish there could be  
The kind of love  
Where there would be no wrong (No wrong, never be no wrong)  
So that heartache and pain  
And the misery of a bad love  
Would all be gone  
  
To get over the first love  
Is kinda hard, baby  
But, don't let it get you down  
Don't you know that ...  
  
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around) around  
Ooo, Yeah  
Love is gonna be better (Yeah)  
Better than ever, (Oooh Yeah) Yeah  
The second time around  
Yeah  
  
To get over the first love  
Is kinda hard, baby  
But, don't let it get you down  
Trust me, baby  
(Love will be better)  
If you trust me, baby  
(Better than ever) (Try me)  
You can love me, baby  
(The second time around)  
  
I really do believe you should try me, baby  
(Love will be better) Yeah  
(Better than ever) (Try me)  
Try me Yeah  
(The second time around) (Around, around)  
  
(Love will be better)  
If you trust me, baby  
(Better than ever)  
You can love me, baby  
(The second time around)  
I really do believe  
(Around, around)  
  
(Love will be better)  
I know  
(Better than ever)  
Next time it will  
(The second time around)  
Your love  
(Around, around)
