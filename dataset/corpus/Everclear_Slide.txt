We were fading  
Like the bottom of a bad dream  
We were heading south  
Looking for a good time  
  
Faces look so pretty  
In the spotlight  
All blown out  
And bathed inside a world of white  
  
Sometimes I feel like I am holding it together  
Sometimes I feel like everything is fine  
Sometimes I feel like I'm out of control  
I feel like I am falling  
Like my life is on a slide, slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
  
It was sunny on the streets  
Down there by the water  
We would get hammered on the beach  
Right down by the water  
  
She was slightly out of reach  
A rich man's only daughter  
I think she slept with me  
Just so she could piss off her father  
  
I am elastic I am easy with the damage  
I am ecstatic I am hungry for the climb  
Sometimes I feel like I am falling apart  
I feel like I am falling  
Like my life is on a slide, slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
  
I know it's wrong but  
I just can't seem to act my age  
I know it's wrong but  
I just can't seem to control my rage  
  
My heart is racing and  
I am losing my mind  
Sometimes I feel like my life is on a slide  
Slide  
  
Those faces look so scary  
In the harsh light  
All blown out  
And bathed inside a world of white  
  
We were shining  
Like the good part of a bad time  
We were laughing, happy  
Just to be along for the ride  
  
Sometimes I feel like I am really lucky  
I have made it through  
Bruised and scarred  
And half alive  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm out of control  
I feel like I am falling  
Like my life is on a slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
  
Yes I know it's wrong but  
I just can't seem to act my age  
Yes I know it's wrong but  
I just can't seem to control my rage  
  
My heart is racing and  
I am losing my mind  
Sometimes I feel like my life is on a slide
