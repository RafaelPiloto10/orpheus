King Kong, you gotta come home  
You've a wife and family all alone in the jungle  
Are you receiving OK?  
  
King Kong you done what you shouldn't a did  
You got a woman back home and a couple of kids  
And they get so tired of waiting  
  
And if we lived in another world  
I'd be a boy and you'd be a girl  
If we lived in another world  
Who knows ...  
  
I will repair all the pavements you've cracked if you come back and say you'll
be mine  
Yes, I will fix all the mortars and bricks  
But a tree house will do us just fine  
  
King Kong, you gotta come home  
You've a wife and family all alone in the jungle  
Do you remember OK?  
  
King Kong, hanging out in LA  
It's a change from New York  
Won't you have a nice day  
You may even get a movie come your way  
  
And if we lived in another world  
You'd be a boy and I'd be a girl  
If we lived in another world  
Who knows ... who knows ...  
  
I will give back all the love you can give  
If you're gentle and you will be kind  
You stomping off to the US of A wasn't quite what I had in my mind  
  
And if we lived in another world  
I'd be a boy and you'd be a girl  
If we lived in another world  
Who knows ... who knows ...  
  
I will repair all the pavements you've cracked if you come back and say you'll
be mine  
Yes, I will fix all the mortars and bricks  
But a tree house will do us just fine  
  
I will give back all the love you can give  
If you're gentle and you will be kind  
Yes, I will fix all the mortars and bricks  
But a tree house will do us just fine
