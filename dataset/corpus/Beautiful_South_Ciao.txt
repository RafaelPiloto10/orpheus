I've been so happy since I walked away  
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today  
'Cause you were nothing but a big mistake  
And life is wonderful, now that I'm rid of you  
  
Oh I must have been crazy to have stayed with you  
I can't believe I thought I was in love with you  
But now the scales have fallen I can really see  
And I say go to hell, 'cause that's where you took me  
  
Well, I've felt better since I slammed that door  
You always cramped my style, I never noticed before  
It's been a non-stop party since I flew the coop  
I can't believe I fell for such a loser like you  
  
And is it any wonder that I felt so blue  
When I was always having to put up with you  
  
Oh, here we go again, just lay the blame on me  
Don't say another word, 'cause sweetheart, you're history  
  
I know that you miss me really, bet you wish that you still had me  
You'll never find someone like me but I've got no regrets at all  
  
Because I've met this girl and she's so good to me  
She's really beautiful, fantastic company  
And, when I'm with her I realise what love can be  
Because she's fifty times the person you'll ever be  
  
Good luck, mister, do you think I care?  
Since you've been gone the offers have been everywhere  
I've got a million guys just lining up for me  
I've turned a corner, boy, my life is ecstasy  
  
Well, I've been in heaven since I walked away  
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today  
'Cause you were nothing but a waste of space  
And life is wonderful now that I'm over you  
Over you  
Over you
