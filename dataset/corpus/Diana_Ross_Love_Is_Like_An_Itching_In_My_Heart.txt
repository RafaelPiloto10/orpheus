The love bug done bit me,  
Didn't mean for him to get me,  
Woo, get up in the morning  
And I'm filled with desire,  
No, no, I can't stop the fire,  
Love is real live wire,  
Oo, it's a burning sensation,  
Far beyond imagination.  
  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart, tearing it all apart,  
Just an itching in my heart,  
And, baby, I can't scratch it.  
  
Keeps me sighing, oo  
Keeps me yearning,  
No mama can't help me,  
No daddy can't help me  
I've been bitten by the love bug,  
And I need some information  
o help me out of this situation,  
Now, when you're ill you take a pill,  
When you're thirsty, drink your fill,  
What you gonna do, oh yeah,  
when love gets a hold, a hold on you,  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart,  
And, baby, I can't scratch it.  
  
Love is a nagging irritation,  
Causing my heart complication,  
Love is a growing infection,  
And I don't know the correction,  
Got me rocking and a-reeling,  
And I can't shake the feeling.  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart,  
tearing it all apart,  
Just an Itching in my heart,  
And, baby, I can't scratch it.
