I get these killer headaches  
I get one everyday  
I wake up with a migraine  
Since you ran away  
  
Got a load of tension  
Burnin up my neck  
Something is wrong with my suspension  
So pass those tablets to this wreck  
  
Aspirin damage - Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain - destroys the brain  
No one told me bout Aspirin damage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
Rom the medication taken  
Oh yeah  
  
I balance my Excedrin  
And Anacins in stacks  
I'm a pain reliever junkie  
I got a Bayer on my back  
  
I went to see the doctor  
He walked me down the hall  
Said "Strip down 'til you're naked  
Your suit, your tie and all."  
  
Aspirin damage - Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain - destroys the brain  
Aspirin damage, my disadvantage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
From the medication taken  
Oh yeah  
  
Aspirin damage - Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain - destroys the brain  
Aspirin damage, my disadvantage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
From the medication taken  
Oh yeah
