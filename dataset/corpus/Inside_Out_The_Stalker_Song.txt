Imagine me and you, I do  
I think about you day and night  
It's only right to think about the girl I stalk  
Each day and night,  
So happy together.  
  
I dated you, for just a week  
You dumped me and I cried real hard  
And still can't sleep.  
So now I'll have to force you to come back to me,  
So happy together.  
  
I can't see me stalking nobody but you for all your life  
When you're with me baby the skies will be blue  
For all my life.  
  
I call you up at 2 am  
I wake you and hang up the phone  
And do it again.  
That's what you get for goin' out with other men,  
So happy together.  
  
I can't see me stalking nobody but you for all your life  
When you're with me baby the skies will be blue  
For all my life.  
  
I see you, you don't see me  
I'm hidden with my telephoto lense up in the tree  
You're walking and you look around, suspiciously,  
So happy together.  
  
"Hey...sugar...I like your eyebrows....no no that's kinda lame.  
I got it, I got it. Hey baby, it's me again....surprise! That's a good  
one, I like that, surprise, haha."  
  
I've got your cat, don't be alarmed,  
As long as you come talk to me,  
He won't be harmed  
We'll go and get a bite to eat  
I'll come unarmed  
So happy together...forever and ever...so happy together.  
  
"Get out of the tree with the cat in the air."
