From the minute I turned and laid my eyes on you, I had no eyes of my own  
I was blind to the world, you were too good to be true  
But you were something to see, so very young and alone  
And I still don't believe the way you turned on me  
Now where's the girl that I knew?  
I gave you somewhere to live and then somebody to love  
You gave me nothing but trouble, man, I've been such a fool  
  
You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you  
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you  
  
How do you abuse me, let me count the ways  
How many hours in how many days  
How does it amuse you, let me count the pain  
How many rules breaking how many games  
  
[Chorus]  
How do you abuse me, let me count the ways  
How many hours in how many days  
How does it amuse you, let me count the pain  
How many rules breaking how many games  
  
You got your ass out of gear and your soul out of whack  
Go on and take all your stuff, don't even bother to pack  
In every way I want you out of my life  
But I'll kill you if you don't come back, I'll kill you if you don't come back  
  
In the pit of the night you used to pull me so close  
And then you'd hold me so tight  
And in the wink of an eye you used to give me it all  
And with a kiss in the darkness you'd deliver the light  
  
And in the pit of the night I hear you laughing so loud  
I know you're laughing at me  
Oh ain't it funny and sad the way I fell for your lies  
The way I fell into love and then I begged to be free  
  
You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you  
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somebody bless all the girls in the sand on the beach  
They're dreamin' of boys and staying just out of reach  
Bless all the cheerleaders down on the track  
They're glistening like diamonds with sweat on their backs  
  
Bless all the girls in the gangs on the street  
They're looking for danger and they're holding their piece  
Bless all the girls staying late after school  
They're playing with fire and oh they're playing it cool  
  
And bless all the shy girls who're learning to dance  
They stare in the mirror and they conjure romance  
Bless all the girls who are always alone  
They kneel down in prayer and they wait up by the phone  
  
Bless all the homecoming queens of the night  
They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights  
And bless all the girls who know what love is about  
They try not to cry and then they try to put out  
  
And bless all the homecoming queens of the night  
They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights  
And bless all the girls who know what love is about  
They try not to cry and then they try to put out  
  
Somebody bless all these girls that I never have met  
But damn you and curse you after all that you've done  
You're the one girl I'll never forget  
You're the one girl I'll never forget  
  
Somebody bless all these girls and everything that they do  
But damn me and curse me for still needing you  
  
And I'll kill you if you don't come back  
  
I'll kill you if you don't come back
