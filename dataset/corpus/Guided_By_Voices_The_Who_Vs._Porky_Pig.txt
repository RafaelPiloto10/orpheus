Hey go  
Quick, be off, be sinking  
Lown down whale the navy wing  
It clears out congested arenas  
They sell rocking host balloons  
And they're celebrating children  
And the weeping circus  
  
And the smoking-nosed robot  
Tasted blackens the sticks  
Like clowns from a fire, the albatross winks  
Faked to the back goes right wing shield  
All in a day's work  
  
We met at one of the Kinks' yeah  
We could come from the inner circle  
Of the dry ??  
Until it is just one trap  
One threaded ??
