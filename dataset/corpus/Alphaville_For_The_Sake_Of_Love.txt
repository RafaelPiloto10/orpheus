I forgive, I forgive  
I forgive all my friends who left me alone, I forgive the wall that it had so
many stones  
I forgive the lord that he never sent a priest, I forgive the hangman, I
forgive the beast  
I forgive the winter that it was so cold, I forgive my father that he was so
bold  
I forgive the ashes that they couldn't stay flames, I forgive the acid, I
forgive the rains  
I forgive James Joyce that I couldn't read his books,  
I forgive that you've never given back what you took  
  
I forgive the puzzle that I didn't fit, I forgive the shit that I couldn't
write a hit  
I forgive the dog that she never came home, I forgive all the ways that they
always lead to rome  
I forgive the worm in the very last tree, I forgive the girls who haven't
forgiven me  
I forgive inspiration when it came to late, I forgive all the ladies when I
had to wait  
I forgive superman that I didn't stay clean, I forgive, I forgive, anyone,
anything  
For the sake of love, for the sake of love  
For the sake of love  
  
I forgive the angels who could never take me high,  
I forgive all my dreams that I couldn't really fly  
I forgive the thought that I couldn't stop thinking,  
I forgive all the drinks that I couldn't stop drinking  
  
I forgive the clock that it didn't wake me up, I forgive the driver, I forgive
the cab  
I forgive all the moments that they wouldn't stay, I forgive all the years
that they've flown away  
I forgive the promises that they've been broken, I forgive the curses that
they have been spoken  
I forgive all the prophets and the saints of the past, I forgive the stars
when they fell too fast  
I forgive the joke that it didn't make me laugh, I forgive desire that I had
to starve  
I forgive all the love for the sake of love, I forgive all sakes for the fake
above  
For the sake of love, for the sake of love  
For the sake of love
