What can I say ?  
He's a-walking away  
From what we've seen.  
  
What can I do  
Still loving you ?  
It's all a dream.  
  
How can we hang on to a dream,  
How can it really be the way it seems ?  
  
What can I do ?  
He's a-saying we're through  
Without a word.  
  
What can I try ?  
I still don't see why  
He says what he does.  
  
How can we hang on to a dream,  
How can it really be the way it seems ?
