Saw a bird with a tear in his eye  
Walking to New Orleans, my, my, my  
Hey, now, Bird, wouldn't you rather die  
Than walk this world when you're born to fly?  
  
If I was the sun, I'd look for shade  
If I was a bed, I would stay unmade  
If I was a river I'd run uphill  
If you call me you know I will  
If you call me you know I will  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, Freedom  
Oh, Liberty  
Oh, Leave me alone  
To find my own way home  
To find my own way home  
  
Say what I mean and I don't give a damn  
I do believe and I am who I am  
Hey now Mama come take my hand  
Whole lotta shakin' all over this land  
  
If I was an eagle I'd dress like a duck  
Crawl like a lizard and honk like a truck  
If I get a notion I'll climb this tree  
Or chop it down and you can't stop me  
Chop it down and you can't stop me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Went to the well but the water was dry  
Dipped my bucket in the clear blue sky  
Looked in the bottom and what did I see?  
The whole damned world looking back at me  
  
If I was a bottle I'd spill for love  
Sake of mercy I'd kill for love  
If I was a liar I'd lie for love  
Sake of my baby I'd die for love  
Sake of my baby I'd die for love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna find my own way home
