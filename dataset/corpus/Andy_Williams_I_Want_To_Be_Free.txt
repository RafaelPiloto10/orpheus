I want to be free like the bluebird flying by me  
Like the waves out on the blue sea  
Your love has to tie me, don't try me, say goodbye  
  
I want to be free, don't say you love me, say you like me  
But when I need you beside me  
Stay close enough to guide me, confide in me, oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
I want to hold your hand, walk along the sand  
Laughin' in the sun, always havin' fun  
Doin' all those things without any strings to tie me down  
  
I want to be free like the warm September wind, babe  
Say you'll always be my friend , babe  
We can make it to the end, babe  
Again, babe, I gotta say  
  
I want to be free  
I want to be free  
I want to be free
