Everybody wants to feel happy, even if you think that you don't  
Everyone wants to know the secret, even if you think that you don't  
Everybody thinks they're different from the next man now  
But we just got to realize we're just the same  
  
Always appear to be someone better  
You know there will always appear to be someone worse  
You know there'll always appear to be someone better  
You know there'll always appear to be someone worse, oh  
  
Everyone has got their character  
Everyone has got their personality  
But the longing is still the same  
So what is the answer by easy on yourself  
Make yourself feel at ease maybe that's the answer  
  
Always appear to be someone better  
You know there will always appear to be someone worse  
Always appear to be someone better  
You know there'll always appear to be someone worse, oh  
  
We're just the same don't you know  
We're just the same don't you know  
Looking over there  
He looks different, she looks different  
They might even be different  
But we're just the same, don't you know  
We're just the same, don't you know  
We're just the same
