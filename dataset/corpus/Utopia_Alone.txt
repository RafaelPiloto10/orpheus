Let me ask you a question  
Will you lend me your ear  
Do you know the meaning of emptiness  
If not I'll make it clear  
Alone, alone  
Nobody knows how lonely it can be  
And I'm so tired of being alone.  
Let me tell you a story  
One you've probably heard  
One about the man who was lost  
And I can tell you in one word  
Alone, alone  
Nobody knows how lonely it can be  
And he was tired of being alone  
Alone, alone  
Nobody knows how lonely it can be  
And I'm so tired of being alone.  
There's an end to the fable  
Where does all of this lead  
That for everyone who needs someone  
There is someone there to need  
Alone, alone  
Someone is still alone  
Alone, alone  
Someone is still alone.
