Where is the rhyme, where is the reason  
Who stands to judge me in this way  
Some call it choice, some call it treason  
Why find me guilty on this day  
  
Stay home and watch it on T.V.  
Stay home and watch it on T.V.  
See you - See me  
  
Now is the time, now is the season  
When we should have something to say  
You keep your faith, I'll keep my freedom  
Why should we listen anyway  
  
Stay home and watch it on T.V  
Stay home and watch it on T.V  
See you - See me  
  
How is there no way of pleasing  
And who has the answer of the day  
When will they stop all of the squeezing  
Why should we play the game their way  
  
Stay home and watch it on T.V  
Stay home and watch it on T.V  
See you - See me  
Stay home and watch it on T.V  
Stay home and watch it on T.V  
See you - See me
