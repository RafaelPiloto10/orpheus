On a Tuesday morning we pass in the hallway  
But you don't notice  
I'm sure you don't even know my name  
But I don't care about that  
  
With fake nails, color contacts  
Extensions decorating my hair and wearing fake fur  
Why am I looking for true love?  
Fighting is okay, but I'm tired of that  
  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
That's why I'm dreaming of you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If I close my mouth, lies and truth are the same  
  
It's a line that moves my soul, but I can't hear anything  
From far away someone is calling me  
But I don't yet want to return  
The noise of the city is comfortable  
  
Cold, kind, I'm enfolded in my own private zone  
Why am I always searching for a place to be?  
I laugh, I cry, I don't mind if I hurt people  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
  
That's why I'm always with you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same  
There are days when I want to run away  
And forget everything  
  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
That's why I'm dreaming of you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same
