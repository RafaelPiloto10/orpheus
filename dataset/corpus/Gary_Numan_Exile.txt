I heard it in my sleep  
A voice more dead than old  
I thought I'd known the fear  
But then it touched my soul and said:  
  
You will pray for me  
Bow your head to me.  
  
It came for me at night  
And took me dream by dream  
To where everything is dark  
And no-one hears you scream  
Took everything I loved  
And turned love into pain  
It said I'm the prophecy  
And I'll make you believe in me.  
  
Sacrifice for me  
Be humility.  
  
It said:  
I'll make everyone pay  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forget  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forgive  
I'll make everyone pay.  
  
And so it comes to this  
Death or eternity?  
Or would you like to pay  
For all humanity?  
Do you believe in faith?  
Than choose. heaven or hell or me?  
A shadow on the sane  
The final treachery of god.  
  
You will kneel for me  
Lose your eyes for me.  
  
Betray the world for me  
Burn your soul for me.  
  
It said:  
I'll make everyone pay  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forget  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forgive  
I'll make everyone pay.
