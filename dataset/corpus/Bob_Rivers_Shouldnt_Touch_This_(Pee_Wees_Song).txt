(Can't Touch This - MC Hammer)  
  
You shouldn't touch this  
You better not touch it hu-hu  
Gonna' touch it anyway  
Cuz' it feels good ha-ha  
  
My name is Pee-Wee Herman  
And I really want to say  
I think it's peachy keen  
To be exposed like this  
So listen up boys and girls  
Your fate's in your own hands  
You only go round once in life  
So grab it while you can  
  
You shouldn't touch this  
You better not touch it  
Gonna' touch it anyway  
  
Don't cuff me  
Wait, Where we goin'?  
Don't you know who I am?
