Help... help... can anybody help me now?  
Help... help... my mind is lying on the ground  
I don't know, I just don't know if I'm still alive  
I see the sun, the sun is up again, another day of just the same  
  
I'm slowly going mad, emptiness is all I have  
I see the sun, the sun is up again, another day of just the same  
Help... help... can anybody help me now?  
Help... help... my mind is lying on the ground  
  
In the mirrors on the walls, with the crosses standing tall  
I see misery take another hold of me  
I'm hanging on to a memory... I'm hanging on to myself  
The wine is turning sour, I'm longing for my final hour  
  
Never to be free, cursed for eternity  
I'm hanging on to a memory... I'm hanging on to me  
Be it God or Satan, whoever you are  
You're hiding in the shadows  
  
You cursed me with the Devil's mark  
I'm hanging to a memory... I'm hanging on to myself  
The wine is turning sour, I'm longing for my final hour  
Never to be free, cursed for eternity  
  
I'm hanging on to a memory... I'm hanging on to me  
Help... help... I'm slowly going mad  
Help... help... emptiness is all I have  
I smash the mirrors... the mirrors on the wall  
  
I have to smash them all before they crush my soul  
Help... blood... I'm bleeding now, Help... I'm bleeding bad  
I'm bleeding on the floor  
Help... help...  
  
I can't take this anymore
