You don't have to touch it to know  
Love is everywhere you go  
You don't have to touch it to feel  
Love is every second we steal  
Love is love is nothing without you  
Love is love is everything you do  
Open up your eyes  
And you will see  
Love is love is everything to me  
You don't have to touch it to be  
Wrapped up in emotion like me  
Everyone must feel how I do, yeah  
Love is just to be close to you  
Love is love is nothing without you  
Love is love is everything you do  
Open up your eyes  
And you will see  
Love is love is everything to me  
And you know that love is love  
It's written in black and blue  
And everything you say  
Must bring her closer, closer to you  
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba  
You don't have to touch it to know  
Love is everywhere you go  
You don't have to touch it to feel  
Love is every second we steal  
Love is love is nothing without you  
Love is love is everything you do  
Open up your eyes  
And you will see  
Love is love is everything to me  
Love is love is nothing without you  
Love is love is everything you do
