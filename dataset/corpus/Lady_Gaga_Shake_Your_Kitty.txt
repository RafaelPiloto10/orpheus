Ow, come here boy  
  
I met a drummer last week  
I pulled... down  
With bottom knocked back  
And your stone washed dice  
I want you more  
  
He cried, "Mother! What'd you do to me?"  
I said, "Mother mother mother's for babies  
Call me kitty."  
  
Yeah  
  
Shake your kitty  
Shake your kitty (meow)  
Put your arms around me, babe  
I'm giving you permission to feel me  
  
Shake your kitty  
Shake your kitty (meow)  
Put your arms around me, babe  
I'm giving you permission to feel me  
  
Shake your shake  
Shake shake  
Shake your sh-shake  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake  
  
I took a drummer by the hand  
To the juke box then  
We hit the floor  
With your Van Halen pin  
And your dark side burns  
I want you more  
  
He cried, "Mother! What'd you do to me?"  
I said, "Mother mother mother's for babies  
Call me kitty."  
  
Oh, why don'tcha  
  
Shake your kitty  
Shake your kitty (meow)  
Put your arms around me, babe  
I'm giving you permission to feel me  
  
Shake your kitty  
Shake your kitty (meow)  
Put your arms around me, babe  
I'm giving you permission to feel me  
  
You'll never call me by my name  
But I still want you  
You play some pretty tricky games  
But I still want you  
Your best friend drives a fancy car  
But I still want you  
You're working every hour  
But, but I still want you yeah!  
  
If you see a girl this pretty  
Shake her, shake her, shake her kitty  
When you see a girl that's pretty  
Shake it, shake it, shake that kitty  
  
Shake your kitty (meow)  
Put your arms around me, babe  
I'm giving you permission to feel me  
  
Shake your kitty  
Why don't you  
Shake your kitty (meow)  
Put your arms around me, babe  
I'm giving you permission to feel me  
  
When you see a girl this pretty  
Shake her, shake her, shake her kitty  
When you see a girl that's pretty  
Shake your, shake your, shake that kitty  
  
Shake your shake  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake
