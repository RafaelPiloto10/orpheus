Deep inside your soul there's a hole you don't wanna see  
Every single day what you say makes no sense to me  
Even though I try I can't get my head around you  
  
Somewhere in the night there's a light in front of me  
Heaven up above with the show, abandons me  
Even though I try I fall in the river of you  
You've managed to bring me down too  
  
All you're faking (Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up)  
Shows you're aching (Get Up, Get Up, Get Up)  
  
Every single day what you say makes no sense to me  
Lettin' you inside, isn't right, don't mess with me  
I never really know what's really going on inside you  
I can't get my head around you  
  
All you're feeling (Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up)  
Shows you're breathing (Get Up, Get Up, Get Up)  
  
Deep inside your soul there's a hole you don't wanna see  
Covering it up like a cut with the likes of me  
You know I've really tried, I can't do anymore about you  
  
The cut's getting deeper (Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh)  
The hill's getting steeper (Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh)  
  
I guess I'll never know what's really going on inside you  
I can't get my head around you  
I can't get my head around you  
I can't get my head around you  
I can't get my head around you
