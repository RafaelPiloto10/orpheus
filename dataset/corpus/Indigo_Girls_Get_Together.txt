Love is but a song we sing  
And fear's the way we die  
You can make the mountains ring  
Or make the angels cry  
Though the bird is on the wing  
You may not know why  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
Some may come and some may go  
We will surely pass  
When the one that left us here  
Returns for us at last  
We are but a moment's sunlight  
Fading in the grass yeah  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
If you hear the song we sing  
You will understand  
You hold the key to love and fear  
All in your trembling hand  
Just one key unlocks them both  
It's there at your command  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
Try to love one another right now  
Try to love one another right now
