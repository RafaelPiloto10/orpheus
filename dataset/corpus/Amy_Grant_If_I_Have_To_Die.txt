Do you have a heavy heart? 'Cause you try to play the part  
Of a life that you don't know and now it's scaring you?  
'Cause you're saying all the right words but no one's ever heard  
The voice that's crying out inside your heart  
Saying please don't make me die for you, I've gotta make you see  
That there's a part of me I never want to lose  
But if I have to die for you somehow let me see  
That you're more than words I need a glimpse of you  
But it's Sunday church again and the habit to pretend  
Is stronger than you knew, look how it's ruling you  
But it's friends you try to blame, oh I've done it just the same  
'Cause it's easier than answering to Him  
You think that they're playing games  
They leave and never act the same  
And you don't want a part of their show  
Yes you think there's something more  
But not inside these holy doors  
Well what are you looking for?  
Yes we have to die for Him, that's the struggle that you see?  
'Cause it's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do  
But no it's not impossible, He's been waiting so long for you  
But don't be afraid 'cause He knows the pain  
Because He had to do it for you, for you
