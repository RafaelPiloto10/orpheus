Early man walked away  
As modern man took control  
There mind's weren't all the same  
(And) To conquer was their goal  
So he built his great empire  
And he slaughtered his own kind  
(And) He died a confused man  
(He) Killed himself in his own mind  
(He) Killed himself in his own mind  
(He) Killed himself in his own mind  
(He) Killed himself in his own mind  
  
Let's Go!  
  
Were only gonna die from our own arrogance  
That's why we might as well take our time.
