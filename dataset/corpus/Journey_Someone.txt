All alone again tonight  
A place you know too well  
Guess there's something in your life  
Going through the motions  
  
And you like to say you got burned  
Well you're not the only one  
You've reached the why and lonely  
On the streets where you roam  
  
You can go back to where you've been  
Are you ready to try again?  
  
Once you let someone love you  
You'll find an open door  
A place in your heart you've never been before  
Believe it's never too late  
For someone to set you free  
Once you let someone love you  
(Someone love you)  
(Someone love you)  
  
Commitment's just a word  
You could've wrapped your heart around  
It's your foolish pride and freedom  
Got you standing your ground  
  
The same faces every night  
Where you stay it's the closing time  
It don't stop the empty feeling  
When you're just wasting your time  
  
A leap of faith, another chance  
What if you can dance?  
  
Once you let someone love you  
You'll find an open door  
A place in your heart you've never been before  
Believe it's never too late  
For someone to set you free  
Once you let someone love you  
(Someone love you)  
(Someone love you)  
  
You can go back to where you've been  
Are you ready to try again?  
  
Once you let someone love you  
You'll find an open door  
A place in your heart you've never been before  
(Believe it's never too late) never too late  
(For someone to set you free)set you free  
  
(Someone love you) someone love you  
Won't you let someone love you  
(Someone love you)  
(Someone love you)
