You Inspire Me  
When my eyes begin to glaze  
You Inspire Me  
In so many ways  
When I'm on the ground  
You seem to know  
How to pull the blessings down  
And spread them all around  
You Inspire Me  
When my well is almost dry  
You Inspire Me  
And in the twinkling of an eye  
I am back on my feet  
You're so inspiring to me  
The road is long and it winds through the night  
But when you're near you let there be light  
You Inspire Me  
When my eyes begin to glaze  
You inspire me  
In so many ways  
I am back on my feet  
You're so inspiring  
I don't have to wish upon a star  
That's how inspiring you are
