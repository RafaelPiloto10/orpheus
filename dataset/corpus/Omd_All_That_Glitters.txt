All that glitters  
Is not gold  
So don't believe  
What you've been told  
And take a chance of being strong  
Because they'll destroy you  
If you're wrong  
  
Only lovers act this way  
You see  
Only lovers are so cruel  
  
All your friends are here tonight  
Never ones to miss a fight  
Their applause for what you've done  
Rings in the darkness when they've gone  
  
Only lovers act this way  
You see  
Only lovers are so cruel  
  
I would die here next to you  
I will make your dreams come true  
There's so much I had to say  
I got lost along the way  
  
All that glitters is not gold  
So don't believe what you've been told  
  
Only lovers act this way  
You see  
Only lovers are so cruel  
  
Only lovers act this way  
You see  
Only lovers are so cruel
