Sunrise comes and I don't know why  
Living loves and the day does fly  
Soon the moon and baby and I  
Will be lyin' side by side  
  
How many of your skies are blue?  
How much of your love is true?  
Where to get them eyes of green?  
I'm knowin' you know just what I mean  
  
If I have to go I won't be long  
Maybe we'll move to Tennessee  
Leave these Texas blues behind  
See Susanna and Guy  
  
Well, I'm in this cold room all alone  
I guess I'll try the telephone  
It'll be busy or she won't be home  
Tomorrow is another day  
  
Sunrise comes and I don't know why  
Living loves and the day does fly  
Soon the moon and baby and I  
Will be lyin' side by side
