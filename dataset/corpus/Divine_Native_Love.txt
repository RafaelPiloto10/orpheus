Dance Rock Feel the heat  
Rock your body to the Native Beat  
  
[Chorus]  
Step by step  
  
Slowly I turn  
Step by step  
See'mon  
Well here I am I got the heat  
I'm gonna rock to the rhythm of the Body heat  
  
See'mon now lets have big fun  
Rock to the rhythm lets get undone  
  
Designer jeans my teenage dream  
Of love is on my mind  
This Native Love is restless  
And I'm just not satisfied  
  
And I never get enough  
Of that Native Love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Slowly I turn  
Step by step  
  
See'mon  
My car is by Ferrari  
And my body's Jack La Lanne  
My clothes are by Armani  
And my hair is by Elaine  
Tiffany and Cartier are  
Telling me the time  
This Native Love is restless  
And I'm just not satisfied  
And I never  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Slowly I turn  
Step by step  
See'mon  
  
Hey GO man here  
I am for everyone to see  
If I'm not your type  
Well that's alright  
Cause that just don't matter to me  
I got the rhythm and the rhyme  
And I'm right on time  
And I'm gonna blow your mind  
This Native Love is restless  
And I'm just not satisfied  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Slowly I turn  
Step by step  
See'mon
