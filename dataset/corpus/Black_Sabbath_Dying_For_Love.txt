Can you hear, the people sing their song,  
To tunes of glory, they move as one.  
Refugees of liberation marching on,  
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.  
  
When you take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's  
Left is humanity.  
  
It's getting closer, change is bound to come.  
There's someone out there, holding candles to the  
Sun.  
Then an answer, says that peace will come around,  
Stand in line, take your time and be proud.  
  
Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is  
Humanity,  
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you  
And me.  
  
Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,  
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love.

You, dying for love.  
Brothers, sisters, dying for love, saints and sinners,  
Dying for love,  
Dying for love.
