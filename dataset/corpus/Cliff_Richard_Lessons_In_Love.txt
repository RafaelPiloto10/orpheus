First you cuddle up beside me nice and near  
Then you whisper all the things I long to hear  
That's the first lessson in love  
Mmmm...Give me your heart  
Then you put your two sweet lips on mine like this  
And you'll learn the magic of a tender kiss  
That's the next lesson in love  
Mmmm....lesson in love  
It's so easy when you know how  
O my darling let me show you now  
Last you whisper I love you so sweetly  
Then I'll know you've learned it all completely  
That's the last lesson in love  
Mmmm...baby love me true
