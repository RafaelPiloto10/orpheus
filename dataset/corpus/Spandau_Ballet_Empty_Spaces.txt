Once there were times, love when we could touch the air between  
And out across this room we'd fill the space with all our skins  
And if we just touch hands, life would shine with electric dreams  
No matter how many miles, nothing hurt long distance hearts  
And there was always something there that space could never keep apart  
But now I know inside that something's died  
When we're apart, all we have are empty spaces  
It's not like we're building walls, too hard to climb to make us blind  
It's just so much numbing space to hollow out the heart and mind  
And I can hear echoes of ghosts of love, we left behind  
I'll always love April, we fell in love and we planted seeds  
And now we walk through fallen trees and leaves are crushed beneath  
And I will always live in autumn  
Now we're agreed, all we have are empty spaces  
I thought this was meant to be our love had an energy  
But only as time evolved and all of our strength dissolved  
And we'll never feel the flame that burned so naked again  
I walk through Kentish Town and all the rain, rain pouring down  
So many people here but space like this I've never found  
And as I get back home and step inside  
I realize, all I have, all I have are empty spaces
