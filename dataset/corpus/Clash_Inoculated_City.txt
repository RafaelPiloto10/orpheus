The soldier boy for his soldiers pay  
Obeys the sergeant at arms whatever he says  
  
The sergeant will for his sergeant's pay  
Obey the general order of the battle play  
  
The generals bow to the government  
Obey the charge you must not relent  
  
What of the neighbors and the prophets in bars?  
What are they saying in the public bazaar?  
We are tired of the tune  
You must not relent  
  
At every stroke of the bell in the tower there goes  
Another boy from another side  
  
The bulletins that steady come in say those  
Familiar words at the top of the hour  
  
The jamming city increases its hum  
And those terrible words continue to come  
  
Through bras music of government hear those  
Guns tattoo a roll on the drums  
  
No-one mentions the neighboring war  
No one knows what they're fighting for  
We are tired of the tune  
You must not relent
