Such a strange pre-occupation  
Such a strange peculiar breed  
How it's shining in its armour  
Made of gold and made of steel  
It can strike a chord inside you  
Like a generation's need  
Speaking happy words of promise  
  
Big generator  
Lives out of sight  
Big generator  
Hands upon the wheel  
  
Moving to the left  
Movin'  
Moving to the right  
big generator  
moving through the night  
  
Second nature sacrifice  
Even if you close your eyes  
We exist through this strange disguise  
  
I have heard it said to someone  
Or maybe it was me  
There is a reason to experience  
Psychedelic so we could see  
To be growing up before us  
Like the black and white of love  
Be the focus  
Be the chorus  
  
Big generator  
Hands upon the wheel  
Big generator  
In for the kill  
  
Second nature comes alive  
Even if you close your eyes  
We exist through this strange device  
  
Moving to the left  
Moving to the right  
Big generator  
Moving through the night  
  
We are the voices of the big generator  
  
Moving through the night  
Movin'  
  
Flying out the soft machine, we offer  
All surprise to you  
Praise oh praise this anthem generator  
  
Moving through the night  
Movin'  
  
We are the voice of every
