Eat my self  
From a silverspoon  
Think I need some of that  
Breathing room  
Do you hear  
The ringing in my ear  
Am I the only one  
Who can make myself  
Disappear  
  
Plasmatic  
What is wrong when your  
Ego is a rose in bloom  
Plasmatic  
All I know is my  
Ego is a room without a view  
  
Fed up of repeating myself  
You are looking for something I haven't got  
Fed ex dreams when things are too slow  
Only let you know what you need to know  
  
Plasmatic  
What is wrong when your  
Ego is a rose in bloom  
Plasmatic  
All I know is my  
Ego is a room without a view  
  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
For you and me  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
For you and me  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
  
Plasmatic  
What is wrong when your  
Ego is a rose in bloom  
Plasmatic  
All I know is my  
Ego is a room without a view  
  
Plasmatic  
All I know is my Ego  
Plasmatic  
All I know is my Ego  
Plasmatic  
All I know is my Ego  
  
Plasmatic  
What is wrong when your  
Ego is a rose in bloom  
Plasmatic  
All I know is my  
Ego is a room without a view
