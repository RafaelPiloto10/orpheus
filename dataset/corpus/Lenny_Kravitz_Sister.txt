Sister  
Did you have to fall in love  
With a man  
That never was  
  
Up to no good  
He took your soul  
And he stole your only heart  
Flipped your wig and left a permanent scar  
  
Sister  
Did you have to go away  
You left your home  
And the things you had to say  
  
It didn't feel good to let you slide  
I never got to say goodbye  
I miss you girl I think I'm gonna cry  
  
If they knock on your door  
You already gave  
You don't need no more of what's ailing you  
Just lean on your soul with all that it takes  
  
May god bring you back home to America  
America, America, America, America.  
  
Sister, sister, sister, sister, sister  
It's just a test of faith  
Your heart is pure so the devil's in your face  
I'll see you soon  
  
'Cause they haven't got a case  
And you'll be free  
In a beautiful place, in a beautiful place  
In a beautiful place, in a beautiful place  
  
If they knock on your door  
You already gave
