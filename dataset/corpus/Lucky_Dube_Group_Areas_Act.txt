If I'm dreaming don't wake me up if it's a lie don't tell me the truth  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause what the truth will do, it's gonna hurt my heart  
Being in the darkness for so long now  
Mr. President, did I hear you well Last night on TV  
You said:  
The group areas act is going Apartheid is going (x2)  
  
Ina me eye me sight the future so bright  
I mean I my eyes  
I see the future so bright  
  
When the blackie manna coming together  
With the whitey manna (x2)  
Whitey manna coming together with the blackman  
  
[Chorus:]  
If I'm dreaming  
  
Gazing at my crystal ball I see the future so bright  
The fighting's gonna stop now  
We'll forgive and forget I know Mr. President  
You can't please everyone  
But everybody liked it  
When you said  
  
Group areas act is going  
Apartheid is going (x2)  
  
[Chorus:]  
If I'm dreaming (till fade)
