[Intro]  
My summer rain  
  
[Verse 1]  
I prepared for the worst in a storm  
It doesn't take long before I'm shaking  
I watch the news end, wait for the forecast  
I fill a tall glass, try to be patient  
It's been a long time, I feel my temperature rise  
You might be moving too fast, oh  
Wait for the sirens, sit in the silence  
I sit on my hands  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I feel the breeze, feel the sea swelling and drowning me  
I feel the night, feel the sunlight, I feel everything  
I feel your love, and I'm done and I surrender now  
I want my level, you've got to bring him, bring him down  
  
[Chorus]  
I thought you were a game  
Turns out you were the summer rain  
You came  
To wash away the love I made  
I needed you in every way  
My summer rain  
My summer rain  
My summer rain  
My summer rain  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was mistaken, but I feel safe here  
So now we're making some kind of rainbow  
The storm has broken, two words are spoken  
And I am soaking, and now you're love so  
Love me for all time, and feel my temperature rise  
Thought you were moving too fast, oh  
But I was just scared to let you into my head  
And let you see my past  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I feel the breeze, feel the sea swelling and drowning me  
I feel the night, feel the sunlight, I feel everything  
I feel your love, and I'm done and I surrender now  
I want my level, you've got to bring him, bring him down  
  
[Chorus]  
I thought you were a game  
Turns out you were the summer rain  
You came  
To wash away the love I made  
I needed you in every way  
My summer rain  
  
[Bridge]  
When you live in fear  
You miss everything  
I was struggling  
When you stop fighting  
The war within  
Everybody wins  
  
[Chorus]  
I thought you were a game  
Turns out you were the summer rain  
You came  
To wash away the love I made  
I needed you in every way  
My summer rain  
My summer rain  
My summer rain  
My summer rain
