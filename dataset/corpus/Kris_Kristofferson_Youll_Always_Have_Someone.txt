Discontent, you must leave  
Leaving love, leaving me  
So go away for your dreams to come true  
But should young dreams grow old  
And warm friendships grow cold  
There'll be someone waiting for you  
  
And if you ever find  
That fate is unkind  
An' the devil starts taking his dues  
When your fair weather friends  
Leave when fair weather ends  
There'll be someone waiting for you  
  
You'll always have someone who loves you  
You're never alone, don't you see  
And when your world's slowing down  
You'll need someone around  
Let that someone always be me  
  
You'll always have someone who loves you  
You're never alone, don't you see  
And when your world's slowing down  
You'll need someone around  
An' let that someone always be me
