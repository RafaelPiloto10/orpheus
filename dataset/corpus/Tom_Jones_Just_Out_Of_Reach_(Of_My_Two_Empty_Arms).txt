Love that runs away from me  
Dreams that just won't let me be  
Blues that keep on bothering me  
Chains that just won't set me free  
  
Too far away from you and all your charms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
Each night in dreams I see your face  
Memories time cannot erase  
Then I awake and find you gone  
I'm so blue and all alone  
  
So far away from lips so sweet and warm  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
Oh honey, you know, what lonesome feeling that I have all the time  
It's just knowing that I know you'll never be mine  
And the dreams that always keeps on hurtin' me in my sleep  
I know they're only vows that you and I could never keep  
  
Too far away from lips so sweet and warm  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms
