Chorus:  
Come on, everybody!  
Get on, with your party!  
And don't let nobody say you're wrong.  
O. K.  
So you've lost control,  
But they'll never steal your soul  
No way!  
That they're gonna spoil your fun.  
  
Greedy men, in far off places,  
Don't be afraid to show your faces.  
We know what you've done is wrong,  
But clap your hands, and sing along now!  
Don't even bother, to let us know,  
When you flick the switch and stop the show,  
Because the party has begun,  
And we'll still be dancing, as-you-run-now!  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh no, don't think that I'm not scared,  
Oh no, don't think that I'm prepared.  
I just take each day as it comes,  
Because it may - it may -,  
It may be the last one!  
I know they don't care about me,  
I ain't got no money, ain't a V. I. P.  
And I know they don't care about you,  
You may - as well - enjoy your life like I do!
