The sheets won't need changing everyday  
The freezer supply should last a year  
Those hidden little points that you're away  
Nothing much has changed since you were here  
  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
While you're out jogging and I'm sat snogging  
Some fool on a lakeside bench  
  
And when she calls I hope it's you that dials  
I hope it's you that feels this love inside  
And when I touch her I hope it's you that smiles  
And when I die I hope it's you I'm beside  
To die with her would be a worthless lie  
To die with her would be a worthless die  
To die together would be worth a try  
To die together would be worth a try  
  
The family pack seems larger than it should  
Two for one's no good when there's just one  
I'd raise a bigger smile if I could  
But me minus you equals none  
  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
When you're out fishing and I'm sat wishing  
  
You instead of him  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
When you're out exercising and I'm there prising  
The pants of I my latest sin  
  
And when we kiss she knows it's you I kiss  
'Cause when we kiss I always start to cry  
You just can't cover up these lying lips  
When I die I hope it's you I'm beside  
To die with her would be a worthless lie  
To die with her would be a worthless die  
To die together would be worth a try  
To die together would be worth a try  
  
An ambulance flashed past me in the street  
Just yards from where we were to meet  
I was half hoping you were dead meat  
That it was you that was under the sheet  
  
And as you lay there alone in the ward  
Fumbling for the keys to death's door  
At least I'd have summoned up the nerve  
To whisper you these words  
  
Finally! Quietly! Actually!  
I love you!
