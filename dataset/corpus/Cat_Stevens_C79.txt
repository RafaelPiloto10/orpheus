Sit you down, sit you down young gentlemen  
There's something I want you to know  
You keep on asking me, keep on asking me why  
Oh why are we here? It started a long time ago  
Me and your mom on the night, yeah, yeah, yeah, we met  
  
I was on the road again, she was in C79  
I'll never, never forget, I'll never forget that night  
No, no, no, no  
  
We met in a back road, behind the stage  
She had the best figure by far  
A thousand hours I've looked at her eyes  
But I still don't know what color they are  
Yeah, me and your mom on the night, good lord, we met  
  
I was on the road again, she was in C79  
She was a junkie then, I was having a good time  
Back on the road again  
  
Oh momma, I was on the road again, she was in C79  
I'll never never forget, I'll never forget that time  
Back on the road again, yes, I'm traveling that line  
I was a pop star then, I'm still having a good time  
  
She believed me
