I'm not in love  
So don't forget it  
Its just a silly phase I'm going through  
And just because  
I call you up  
Don't get me wrong  
Don't think you got it made  
I'm not in love  
No no no  
Its because  
  
I like to see you  
But then again  
That doesn't mean  
You mean that much to me  
So if i call you  
Don't make a fuss  
Don't go and tell your friends  
about the two of us  
I'm not in love  
Oh no no  
It's because  
  
Oh oh oh  
You wait a long time for me  
Oooo ooo you wait a long time yeah  
  
I keep your picture  
Right there on the wall  
It hides a nasty stain thats been lying there  
  
So don't you ask me to give it back  
I know you know it don't mean on thing to me  
  
I ain't in love  
no no no no  
It's because  
  
Oh oh oh  
You wait a long time for me  
oooo ooo you wait a long time yeah  
  
I'm not in love  
No I'm not in love  
no no no  
I ain't in love  
no no no no  
It's because  
  
Oooooh  
You wait a long time for me  
Darlin ooo  
You wait a long time for me  
  
I ain't in love, I ain't in love no no no  
I ain't in love, I ain't in love, I ain't in love  
I ain't thinkin bout you baby  
I don't miss you like crazy

Keep waiting, keep waiting.
