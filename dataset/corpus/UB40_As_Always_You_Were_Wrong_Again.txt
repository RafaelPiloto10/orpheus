We'll raise the price of parking fines  
A boost for the economy  
If that don't work we close the mines  
And starve the poor of industry  
  
We proved again we rule the waves  
A blow for white democracy  
That Britain's never shall be slaves  
So long as they agree with me  
  
We'll close the roads, divide the land  
Put out the rage that burns within  
Break the link of dirty hands  
At any cost we'll always win  
  
Keep them poor and wanting more  
Deprive them of their basic rights  
The hunger banging at their door  
Will take away their will to fight  
  
As always you were wrong again  
To us a little seems a lot  
Don't turn your back on desperate men  
Cause we can see how much you've got
