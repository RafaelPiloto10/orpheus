Yo  
Woo, ooo  
  
Sorry, if I'm perfect  
Sorry, I don't give a  
(What)  
Sorry, I ain't a diva  
Sorry, just know what I want  
Sorry, I'm not a virgin  
Sorry, I'm not a slut  
(Ohh)  
I won't let you break me  
Think what you want  
(Ohh, aaa, ohh)  
  
To all my dreamers out there  
I'm with you  
To all my underdogs  
Haa, I feel you  
Lift your head high  
And stay strong  
Keep pushin' on  
Aah
