We explore the men's room  
We don't give a shit  
Ladies' lost electricity  
Take vows inside of it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Desire to dance  
Too startled to try  
Wrap my legs 'round you  
Starting to fly  
  
Let's explore  
Up there, up there, up there  
On the twenty-fifth floor  
  
Circle all around me  
Coming for the kill, kill, kill  
Oh kill me baby  
Like a kamikaze  
Heading for a spill  
Oh, but it's all spilt milk to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's soar  
Up there, up there, up there  
On the twenty-fifth floor  
  
We do not eat  
Flower of creation  
We do not eat  
Eat anything at all  
Love is, love was, love is a manifestation  
I'm waiting for a contact to call  
Love's war  
Love's cruel  
Love's pretty  
Love's pretty cruel tonight  
I'm waiting here to refuel  
I'm gonna make contact tonight  
  
Love in my heart  
The night to exploit  
Twenty-five stories over Detroit,  
And there's more  
Up there, up there, up there  
  
Stoned in space  
Zeus, Christ, it has always been rock and so it is and so it shall be  
Within the context of neo rock  
We must open up our eyes and seize and rend the veil of smoke which man calls
order  
Pollution is a necessary result of the inability of man to reform and
transform waste  
The transformation of waste  
The transformation of waste  
The transformation of waste  
The transformation of waste is perhaps the oldest preoccupation of man  
Man being the chosen alloy, he must be reconnected via shit, at all cost  
Inherent within us is the dream of the task of the alchemist to create from
the clay of man  
And to recreate from excretion of man pure and then soft and then solid gold  
  
All must not be art  
Some art we must disintegrate  
Positive, anarchy must exist  
  
I feel it swirling around me  
I feel it feeling no pain  
I'm waiting above for you baby  
I know that I'll see you up there  
I'm floating in a door backward  
On boundaries over this world  
I'm waiting above in the sky, dear  
Upon a ...
