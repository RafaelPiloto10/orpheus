There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari-Mac  
And make no mistake she's the girl I'm gonna track  
Lots of other fellas try to get her on the back.  
But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early.  
  
[Chorus]  
Mari-Macs mother's makin' Mari-Mac marry me  
My mother's makin' me marry Mari-Mac  
Well I'm gonna marry Mari cause Mari's takin' care o' me.  
We'll all be feelin' marry when I marry Mari-Mac.  
  
Now Mari and her mother are an awful lot together  
In fact you hardly see the one without the other  
And people often wonder if it's Mari or her mother  
Or both of them together I'm courting  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well up among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
Well I had a Bonnie lass sittin' on my knee  
A bumble bee stung me right above the knee  
Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I said to bonnie lass how we gonna pass the day  
She said among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
Where all the boys and girls are making out so free  
Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wedding's on a Wednesday, everything's arranged  
Soon you'll never change your mind unless your mind is changed  
Of making the arrangements and feelings lots of rage  
Marriage is an awful undertaking  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sure to be a grand for grand of that a fair  
Gonna be a fork and plate for every man that's there  
And I'll be a bugger if I don't get my share  
Although I may be very much mistaken  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari Mac  
Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track  
Lots of other fellas try to get her on her back  
But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early  
  
[Chorus]
