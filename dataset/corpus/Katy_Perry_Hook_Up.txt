Oh, sweetheart  
Put the bottle down  
You've got  
Too much talent  
I see you  
Through those  
Bloodshot eyes  
There's a cure  
You've found it  
  
Slow motion  
Sparks, You got that chill  
Now don't deny it  
But boys will be boys  
Oh, yes they will  
They don't want  
To define it  
Just give up the game  
And get into me  
If you're looking  
For thrills  
Then get cold feet  
  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I go slow  
So if you want me  
I don't come cheap  
Keep your thing  
In your pants  
And your heart  
On your sleeve  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I fall deep  
Cause the more you try  
The harder I'll fight  
To say goodnight  
  
I can't cook, no  
But I can clean  
Up the mess you left  
Lay your head down  
And feel the beat  
As I kiss  
Your forehead  
  
This may not  
Last but this is now  
So love the one  
You're with  
You wanna chase  
But you're chasing  
Your tail  
And quick fix  
Won't ever  
Get you well  
  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I go slow  
So if you want me  
I don't come cheap  
Keep your thing  
In your pants  
And your heart  
On your sleeve  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I fall deep  
Cause the more  
You try  
The harder  
I'll fight  
To say goodnight  
  
Cause I feel  
The distance  
Between us  
Could be over  
With a snap  
Of your fingers  
Oh, oh, oh, yeah  
  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I go slow  
So if you want me  
I don't come cheap  
Keep your thing  
In your pants  
And your heart  
On your sleeve  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I fall deep  
Cause the more  
You try  
The harder  
I'll fight  
To say goodnight  
  
Oh, sweetheart  
Put the bottle down  
Cause I don't wanna  
Miss out
