If you want me to stay  
I'll be around today  
To be available for you to see  
I'm about to go there  
Then you'll know  
For me to stay here  
I've got to be me  
  
You'll never be in doubt  
That's what it's all about  
You can't take me for granted and smile  
Count the days I'm gone  
Forget reachin' me by phone  
Cause I promise  
  
I'll be gone for a while  
And when you see me again  
I hope that you have been  
The kind of person  
  
That you really are now  
You got to get it straight  
How could I ever be late  
When you're my woman  
Taking up my time  
  
Oh how could I ever allow  
I guess I wonder how  
I could get out a pocket for fun  
When you know that  
You're never number two  
Number one's gonna be number one  
  
I'll be good  
I wish I could  
Get this message over to you now  
When you see me again  
  
I hope that you have been  
The kind of person  
That you really are now  
I'll be so good  
I wish I could  
  
Get this message over to you now  
Get this message over to you now  
I'll be so good  
I wish I could
