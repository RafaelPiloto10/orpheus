Oh, I am a cheat and I'm a liar, oh, but you're a lovin' ball of fire  
I'll leave you like a bum without a penny  
And while I'm home with the blues, I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo  
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney  
I said, listen to me, baby, I gave up the lovin' trade  
I'm tired of all this runnin', jumpin', playin'  
But you're like it down under the world with the Australian girls  
And there's not a word of truth in what you're sayin'  
Oh, but I am a cheat and I'm a liar and you're a lovin' ball of fire  
Honey, I'll leave you like a bum without a penny  
And while I'm home with the blues, I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo  
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney  
This is my greatest act, I've come boomerangin' back  
Grinnin' like a Rudolf Valentino  
But then you grab your travel load like a swingin' grimmin' dog  
And hopped on that fast boat to Sydney  
'Cause I'm a cheat and I'm a liar but you're a lovin' ball of fire  
Honey, I'll leave you like a bum without a penny  
And while I'm home with the blues, I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo  
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney
