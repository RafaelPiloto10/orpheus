Baby, if a wall of stone were built around your heart  
Oh, don't you know, don't you know?  
I would tear the wall apart  
'Cause nothing, nothing, nothing, I said no, not nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
If a sea of fire, it was surrounding you  
Oh, don't you know, don't you know?  
I would find a way to get through  
Because nothing, nothing, nothing, I said no, not nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
I've been listening, baby  
For one thing, one little thing that I wanna hear  
Come on and tell me, come on tell me  
Do you really, really, really, really want me here?  
Because nothing, nothing, nothing, I said no, not nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
Yeah, I'm listening, baby  
(Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you)  
Yeah, I'm listening, baby  
For one thing, for one little thing that I wanna hear  
Come on and tell me, come on and tell me  
Do you really, really, really, really want me here?  
Because nothing, nothing, I said nothing, no, no, not nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
Oh, I said nothing, I said nothing, I said nothing, no, no, no, no, not
nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
Yeah, yeah
