One light shining bright, it's made from many colors  
Just like every ocean's made from many drops of rain  
One soul takes many shapes, to make up the human race  
One fire, many lives share the same sun every day  
  
Old beliefs let us down, many roads lead to heaven  
One love, many faiths all share the world in search of grace  
Across the universe, the same force that moves the earth's  
In my heart, makes me whole, wash my doubt and fear away  
  
In a big deep blue sky on a beautiful day  
For the moment is now, there's perfection in every way  
  
Feel it flow from me  
Tantra my eyes can see  
Where we all belong  
Tantra watch over me  
  
Like a bird on a wing like the eye of a storm  
There's a circle of life when every child's born  
I get caught up in time lose all reality  
A prisoner of my own design  
Where my freedom is where I choose to be  
  
Look for some kind of sign from the heaven's above  
I hear one voice, I am the love I choose to love  
  
Feel it flow through me  
Tantra, my eyes can see  
Where we all belong  
Tantra, watch over me  
  
Like roses in bloom  
Like a Mountaintop majesty  
Like an orange harvest moon  
Wonders for all to see  
  
Look for some kind of sign from the heaven's above  
I hear one voice, I am the love I choose to love  
oh yeah  
  
Feel it flow through me  
Tantra, my eyes can see  
Where we all belong  
Tantra, watch over me  
  
Feel it flow through me  
Tantra, watch over me
