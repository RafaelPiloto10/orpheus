[Verse 1: LL Cool J]  
Sippin somethin on the rocks  
I got a shorty that makes the bed hop  
I got plans to spoil you even though you sayin stop  
Ima drop that phantom on you baby watch  
Roberto Cavali and the Denali, am I hot?  
Malibu Beaches and hydrofoil yachts  
Baddest Mercedes, Lorenzos, and silver fox  
I keep it flowin see we goin to the top  
Ima get you everything, give a damn how much you tell me to stop  
You want it hotter then we take it 'cross seas  
Party jumpin is bumpin, tokin somethin in Belize  
... I know you want it sucka free  
Know you wantin to shine, even though you fightin me  
... Take it easy player  
Talkin greasy player, know you can feel me player  
Uhh... you put it down tight  
Yeah you not havin what you want dont even sound right  
  
[Chorus: Timbaland]  
Hey lady! I'm gonna hit you with a wine Mercedes  
Somebody's gotta work with the mouth my baby  
All you do is rub my back  
Rub my back! Rub my back! Rub my back! Rub my back!  
I said MY baby  
Watch television is the Escalade-y  
Go shoppin when you want to baby  
All you do is rub my back  
Rub my back! Rub my back! Rub my back! Rub my back! Ohh!  
  
[Verse 2: LL Cool J]  
Lay down for a while preety, relax a minute  
... I caught a feelin when you represented  
Gave you that Mercedes, you better get up in it  
... Get off the corner, come to pop some vintage  
You never seen a player flip your whole life  
Dip the Caddy on the freeway, hittin the strobe light  
... You got a mean walk at times right?  
Im here to shine like, I get your mind right  
Uhh, Charles Jordan girl if you wanna take a hit  
Gotta? between the lippers this is it  
... Lazy, lay back and court the chips  
Some call it trickin or ballin, depends on who you wit  
Him or L baby, so who you gonna pick  
Mack motor, I told ya, I want ya livin rich  
You don't know about a brother  
Blow around a brother, money flow around a brother  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3: LL Cool J]  
Dont trip I know you like the rocks  
Wanna dip round the corner in the drop  
Music bumpin you frontin although you say you're not  
... You got your eyes on the watch  
You love the Pasha, the ?, the Cartier is hot  
... Baby you need somethin, shop  
You got me trippin and goin bananas, baby stop  
I caught a mean one, you never seen one  
She like cream, how brothers gonna front on me?  
Spoilin somethin the average homey never see  
I mean its only some money, nuttin to me  
... But yet and still you question me  
I got is that's if you want it or ima set you free  
... Got em in line they beggin me  
Baby regardless your body is killin me  
Girl Im lovin your anatomy  
Your personality, so whatcha want from me?  
  
[Chorus]
