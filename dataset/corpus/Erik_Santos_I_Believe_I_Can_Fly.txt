I used to thing dat I could not go on  
And life was nothing but an awful song  
But I now I know the meaning of true love  
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms  
  
If I can see it  
Then I can do it  
If I just believe it  
There's nothing to it  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
I think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly
