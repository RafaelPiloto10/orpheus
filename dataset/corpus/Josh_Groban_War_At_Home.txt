Fallen brother, he's a fallen husband  
He's about to be woken in his hospital bed  
He doesn't want to rest  
He just wants to run  
And he's tired of being told that he's the lucky one  
  
Caped crusader, she's a newborn leader  
But you should see her when her daughter's on the phone  
And she wipes the tears away  
And she laces up because there's still hell to pay  
And it sure feels like hell today, today  
  
And she says  
You see these hands they're bruised and brown  
They're yours alone  
Hold on love we're still going down  
Hold on love we're still fighting at home  
The war at home  
  
Innocence behind his broken expression  
He's a child of mercy he's our unlearned lesson  
And he's trying to wake up  
From this wilderness his world has now become  
He's reaching out to those he's running from  
  
And he says  
You see these hands they're bruised and brown  
They're yours alone  
Hold on now we're still going down  
Hold on now we're still fighting  
  
And it's (one step forward and two steps back)  
This is all who are marching  
(One step forward two steps back)  
This is young and old  
(One step forward two steps back)  
Through the void of silence  
You are not alone  
  
You see these hands they're a million strong  
They are yours now  
Hold on now we're all going down  
Hold on now we're all fighting at home  
The war at home
