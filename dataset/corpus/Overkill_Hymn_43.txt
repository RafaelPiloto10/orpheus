Oh, Father, high in Heaven  
Smile down upon Your son  
He's busy with his money games  
His women and his gun  
Oh, Jesus, save me  
And the unsung Western hero  
He killed an Indian or three  
And then he made his name in Hollywood  
To set the white man free  
Oh, Jesus save me  
If Jesus saves  
Well, He'd better save Himself  
From the gory, glory seekers  
Who use His name in death  
Oh, Jesus save me  
If Jesus saves  
Well, He'd better save Himself  
From the gory, glory seekers  
Who use His name in death  
Yeah, oh, Jesus save me  
Well, I saw Him in the city  
And on the mountains of the moon  
His cross was rather bloody  
He could hardly roll His stone  
Oh, Jesus save me
