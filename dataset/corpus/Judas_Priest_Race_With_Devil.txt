You'd better run  
You'd better run  
You'd better run from the  
Devil's gun  
The race is on  
The race is on  
Now you'd better run from the  
Devil's gun  
  
Strange things happen  
If you stay  
The devil will catch you  
Anyway  
He'll seek you here  
He'll seek you there  
The devil will seek you  
Everywhere  
  
Lead break  
  
And when he finds you  
You'll soon find out  
The devil's fire just won't  
Go out  
He burns you up  
From head to toe  
The devil's grip just won't  
Let go.
