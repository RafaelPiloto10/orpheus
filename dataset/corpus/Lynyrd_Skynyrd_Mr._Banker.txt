Mister Banker  
Mister please, how much does money mean  
Won't you reconsider Mister  
Won't you do this thing for me  
  
Ain't got no house  
Ain't got no car  
All I got, lord, is my guitar  
But you can have that Mister Banker  
  
Won't you bury my papa for me  
Oh Mister Banker please  
Listen to how that sound  
  
I would not be here on my knees  
But hey Mister Banker  
It means so much to me  
Oh won't you reconsider Mister  
Won't you do this thing for me  
  
I told you Mister  
I ain't got no house  
Ain't got no car  
  
I got me a 1950 Les Paul guitar  
Won't you take it Mister Banker  
Won't you bury my papa for me  
Oh Mister Banker please
