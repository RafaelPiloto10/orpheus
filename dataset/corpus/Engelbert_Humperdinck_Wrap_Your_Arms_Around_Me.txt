Wrap your arms around me  
When you're so far away,  
At the end of each day  
Counting the moments  
'Till you fade away.  
Inside my soul,  
Under passion's control,  
Are feelings I can't find  
The words to explain  
Just like the first time  
I'm helpless again.  
[Chorus]  
Wrap your arms around me  
Let your love surround me  
Make love to me now like never before.  
Wrap your arms around me  
From the day you found me  
You'll never be alone.  
  
The nights are so cold,  
With just your memory to hold  
I've tried to be strong,  
Reaching out holding on.  
Alone in my bed,  
I cling to each word you said,  
Wanting you more everyday we're apart  
And each precious moment  
Is safe in my heart.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take me in your arms  
Hold me  
You are the one,  
Only you I want to be with you  
We belong together  
We were so close  
The nights are so cold  
Want to be with you  
Miss you anyway  
I want to be with you  
Hold me, love me, love me  
Just like the first time  
I'm helpless again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wrap your arms around me  
And you'll never be alone  
Wrap your arms around me  
You'll never be alone  
No, you'll never be alone.
