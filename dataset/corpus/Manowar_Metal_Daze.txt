I hear the sound in a metal way  
I feel the power rolling on the stage  
'Cause only one thing really sets me free  
Heavy metal, loud as it can be  
  
Baby I was born to play music  
I am a man with a screaming guitar  
There's a light in a middle of the stage  
And in a minute I'll be wearing it all  
I don't know another way of living  
Man I couldn't really care  
Give me a pair of jeans and a riff that's mean  
And girls that love to share  
  
Heavy metal, metal daze  
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze  
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze  
  
Living like there's no tomorrow  
Yeah Currie says we're on the edge  
He said man you're really graffic  
This bands a social wedge  
Yeah we all got hearts made of metal  
And our blood is hot molten rock  
And If I don't hear the sound of metal  
I go into shock  
  
So mister D. J. play just one for me  
You know the one with the crashin' and the screams  
'Cause only one thing really sets me free  
Heavy metal loud as it can be
