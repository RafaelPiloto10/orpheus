Just a minute of your time  
Yes I've been known to delude myself  
So let me put those rose  
Colored glasses to the test  
  
Now is this real enough for you  
Cause blonds here don't jump out of cakes  
If that never impressed you much  
  
Come board this lunatic express  
  
Just why do they say  
Have a nice day anyway  
We both know they wouldn't mind  
  
If I just curled up and died  
Let's not give that one a try  
Chin up put on a pair of these roseys  
Raise those blinds  
Chin up a happy mask was never  
Your best disguise  
Chin up put on a pair of these roseys  
In no time you will feel almost fine  
  
Almost rosey  
  
Now some girls here will huddle with  
No not footballers that are rich  
But will confide in small white sticks  
He bats as The Virginian Slim  
  
Then I tried once to comply  
With an authority that would  
Subsidize my wild side  
But at this altar was sacrificed  
  
Yes you can laugh a femme fatale  
In a bride's dress now married to  
The effortlessness of the cracks  
That lie now in between the facts  
  
Now about when violet died  
The cause still unidentified  
She thought her love would be enough  
But you can't seduce seduction  
  
Her tentacles of endless want  
Reach through my corridors  
And tempt me to taste of her power  
I sober with the witching hour  
  
And when I hear of one more bomb  
Yes we have all been robbed of song  
And nightingales who throw their arms up  
When is enough enough?
