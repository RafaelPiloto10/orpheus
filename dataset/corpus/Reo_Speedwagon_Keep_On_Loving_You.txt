You should have seen by the look in my eyes, baby  
There was somethin' missin'  
You should have known by the tone of my voice, maybe  
But you didn't listen  
You played dead, but you never bled  
Instead you laid still in the grass all coiled up and hissin'  
  
And though I know all about those men  
Still I don't remember  
'Cause it was us, baby  
Way before them, and we're still together  
And I meant, every word I said  
When I said that I loved you I meant that I loved you forever  
  
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you  
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do  
I don't want to sleep, I just want to keep on lovin' you  
Baby, I'm gonna keep on lovin' you  
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do  
I don't want to sleep  
I just want to keep on lovin' you
