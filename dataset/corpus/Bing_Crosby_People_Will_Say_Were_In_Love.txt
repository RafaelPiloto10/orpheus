Don't throw bouquets at me  
Don't please my folks too much  
Don't laugh at my jokes too much  
People will say we're in love  
  
Don't sigh and gaze at me  
Your sighs are so like mine  
And your eyes mustn't glow like mine  
People will say we're in love  
  
Don't start collecting things  
Give me my rose and my glove  
  
Well, sweetheart, they're suspecting things  
People will say we're in love
