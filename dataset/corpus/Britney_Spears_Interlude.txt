Britney: Hey, what' s up?  
This is Brit and I' m not in right now,  
So do your thang, beep?  
Ha, ha, ha...  
I' m just kidding  
  
(Tone beeps)  
  
Guy: (Scuffs)  
Yo Brit, you' re a nerd!  
You really need to change that message.  
But I was thinking about that movie we saw the other night.  
You know how she had all that fame and all that money,  
But she still wasn' t happy!  
Wouldn' t that make a cool song?
