Brothers here I stand  
Spread my wings and take command  
The sky he justly planned  
The boy become a man  
  
After all this time  
I tell myself that I'm  
Not just wasting time  
Oh you know I'm not that way inclined  
  
Brothers if you hear  
Raise your flags and make it clear  
There is more to fear  
If we wait for another year  
  
After all this time  
I tell-a tell-a myself that I'm  
Just passing through time  
  
Oh  
  
After all this time  
I tell myself that I'm  
Not just wasting time  
Oh you know I'm not that way inclined  
  
Brothers fight or fall  
It's man for man and one for all  
No more can we crawl  
Brothers, brothers hear the call  
  
After all this time  
I tell myself that I'm  
Not just wasting time  
Oh you know I'm not that way inclined  
  
Brother brother  
Brother brother  
  
Brother fight or fall  
It's man for man and one for all  
  
Brother brother  
Brother brother  
  
What you want?  
We gotta fight for one another!
