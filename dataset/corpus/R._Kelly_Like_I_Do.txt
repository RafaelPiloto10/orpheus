Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R.  
Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R.  
  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh  
  
I ain't a doctor, can't save a life  
To say I could, I'd be outta my mind  
I ain't no pro athlete, can't run for miles  
That's another thing I won't even try  
  
See there's a lot of things that I can't do  
Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of  
But in a couple of categories, I do  
I blow the competition out of the water  
  
There's only 2 things, in this world  
That I'm the best at, it's true  
Number 1 is music, and baby girl  
Number 2, can't nobody rock your body out  
Like I do, like I do, like I do  
Can't nobody work your body out  
Like I do, like I do, like I do  
  
I ain't a painter, ain't got a brush  
To paint a portrait of love  
I ain't no pilot, can't take you up  
So you can fly through the heavens above  
  
See there's a lot of things I can't do  
Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of  
But in a couple of categories, I do  
Blow the competition out of the water  
  
There's only 2 things, in this world  
That I'm the best at, it's true  
Number 1 is music, and baby girl  
Number 2, can't nobody rock your body out  
Like I do, like I do, like I do  
Can't nobody work your body out  
Like I do, like I do, like I do  
  
I can be your trainer, I can be your trainer  
Come on in my health club  
Bend it over, stretch (ooh)  
Stretch (ooh), stretch (ooh)  
Baby let me you train ya  
  
I can be your trainer, I can be your trainer  
Come on in my health  
Bend it over, stretch (ooh)  
Stretch (ooh), stretch (ooh)  
Baby let me you train ya  
  
There's only 2 things, in this world  
That I'm the best at, it's true  
Number 1 is music, and baby girl  
Number 2, can't nobody rock your body out  
Like I do, like I do, like I do  
Can't nobody work your body out  
Like I do, like I do, like I do  
  
Oh, gonna make your body say  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Baby (baby), whoa baby  
Ooh, ooh, ooh,  
Forget about it, listen shawty  
Can't nobody rock your body, like the R.
