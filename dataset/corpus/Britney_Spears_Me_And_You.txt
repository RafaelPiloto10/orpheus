Oh (oh)  
yeah (yeah)  
  
Oh you caught me  
In my house last night  
I was only thinking  
Bout you  
Me  
I  
Don't know what  
I doubt it cause I like you so much  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause now i'm your friend  
So don't try and break up  
You're all I want  
And I've waited for so long  
Come on it will be  
You and me  
Just the two of us  
oh yeah  
  
Everywhere  
I hear you calling  
In the street  
All around me  
Up on my garden wall  
I can't stop thinking bout you  
Oo Oo yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
I see you in the shops  
One day  
Realising  
You wern't liking me before  
All I have now is my own house  
Cause you don't even care about me  
  
Chorus  
  
Why won't you  
Be my friend now  
I don't like  
cause i've learned so much about you  
All I hear now is I hate you  
you're so worked up in your own personal life  
you don't even think about me  
  
And I see you falling  
I go and help you  
  
Chorus  
  
last Chorus
