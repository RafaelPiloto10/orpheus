Did you ever see the faces of the children,  
They get so excited  
Waking up on Christmas morning  
Hours before the winter sun's ignited.  
They believe in dreams and all they mean  
Including heaven's generosity.  
Peeping round the door  
To see what parcels are for free  
In curiosity.  
  
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.  
He doesn't know who Jesus was  
Or what praying is.  
How can he be saved  
From the eternal grave?  
  
Surrounded by his friends  
He sits so silently  
And unaware of everything.  
Playing poxy pinball,  
Picks his nose and smiles and  
Pokes his tongue at everything.  
I believe in love  
But how can men who've never seen  
Light be enlightened.  
Only if he's cured  
Will his spirits future level ever heighten.  
  
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.  
He doesn't know who Jesus was  
Or what praying is.  
How can he be saved  
From the eternal grave?  
  
Tommy, can you hear me?  
Tommy, can you hear me?  
Tommy, can you hear me?  
How can he be saved?  
  
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me!  
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me!  
  
Tommy, can you hear me?  
Tommy, can you hear me?  
Tommy, can you hear me?  
How can he be saved?
