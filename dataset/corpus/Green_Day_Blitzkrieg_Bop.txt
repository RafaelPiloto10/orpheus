You're fallin' in a straight line.  
You're going through a tight wind.  
The kids are losing their minds.  
The Blitzkrieg Bop!  
  
We're piling in the back seat.  
We're generating steam heat.  
Pulsing to the backbeat.  
Blitzkrieg Bop!  
  
Hey ho, lets go.  
Shoot'em in the back now.  
What they want, I don't know.  
They're all reved up and ready to go.
