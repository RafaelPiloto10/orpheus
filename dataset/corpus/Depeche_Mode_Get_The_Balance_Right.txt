There's more besides joyrides  
Little house in the countryside  
Understand, learn to demand,  
Compromise, sometimes lie  
Get the Balance right, get the balance right  
Be responsible, respectable,  
Stable but gullible  
Concerned and caring, help the helpless  
But always remain ultimately selfish  
Get the balance right, get the balance right  
You think you've got a hold of it all  
You haven't got a hold at all  
When you reach the top, get ready to drop  
Prepare yourself for the fall, you're gonna fall  
It's almost predictable  
Don't take this way, don't take that way  
Straight down the middle until next Thursday  
Push to the left, back to the right  
Twist and turn 'til you've got it right  
Get the balance right
