Honey you are a rock  
Upon which I stand  
And I come here to talk  
I hope you understand  
  
That green eyes  
Yeah the spotlight, shines upon you  
And how could anybody deny you  
  
I came here with a load  
And it feels so much lighter  
Now I met you  
And honey you should know  
That I could never go on without you  
Green eyes  
  
Honey you are the sea  
Upon which I float  
And I came here to talk  
I think you should know  
  
That green eyes  
You're the one that I wanted to find  
And anyone who tried to deny you  
Must be out of their mind  
  
Because I came here with a load  
And it feels so much lighter  
Since I met you  
And honey you should know  
That I could never go on without you  
  
Green eyes  
Green eyes  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Honey you are the rock  
Upon which I stand
