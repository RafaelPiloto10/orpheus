[Chorus]  
Welcome to..  
Welcome to..  
Welcome to the song.  
  
Hear the words of the syncopated rhythms.  
Welcome to the song.  
And when it calls you, time to move on.  
We go!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel the strength of a hundred thousand heartbeats,  
Cry welcome to the song.  
And as it lifts you, time to move on.  
We go!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Drawn from the inside,  
Time to move on.  
We go!  
We go!
