You turned down the love that I tried to give you  
Tore out my heart and my will to live  
I won't deny I still feel the same  
If I had it all to do over I'd do it all over again  
I'm a fool to feel you the way I do  
'Cause only a fool would keep on loving you  
So I'll take the hurt and I'll take the pain  
If I had it all to do over I'd do it all over again  
I can't erase these memories of you  
I can't forget the sweet kiss that I knew  
Oh, where is my pride, where is my shame?  
If I had it all to do over I'd do it all over again  
If I had it all to do over I'd do it all over again
