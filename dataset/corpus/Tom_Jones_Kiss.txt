You don't have to be beautiful  
To turn me on  
I just need your body, baby  
From dusk till dawn  
You don't need experience  
To turn me out  
You just leave it all up to me  
I'll show you what it's all about  
  
You don't have to be rich to be my girl  
You don't have to be cool to rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with  
I just want your extra time and your kiss  
  
You got to not talk dirty, baby  
If you wanna impress me  
You can't be too flirty, mama  
I know how to undress me  
I want to be your fantasy  
Maybe, you could be mine  
You just leave it all up to me  
We could have a real good time  
  
You don't have to be rich to be my girl  
You don't have to be cool to rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with  
I just want your extra time and your kiss  
  
I think I'd better dance now  
  
Women, not girls, rule my world  
I said they rule my world  
Act your age woman, not your shoe size  
Maybe we could do the twirl?  
You don't have to watch Dynasty  
To have an attitude  
You just leave it all up to me  
My love will be your food  
  
You don't have to be rich to be my girl  
You don't have to be cool to rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign, I'm more compatible with,  
I just want your extra time and your kiss
