Hey, people are you ready to get in the streets,  
To be your own police?  
Are you ready to start tonight,  
To stand up and fight for your rights?  
  
Chorus  
Woah ... oh, I gotta' know.  
I gotta' know.  
I gotta' know.  
I gotta' know.  
  
Young people would you do the patriotic thing?  
Are you ready to stand up and sing,  
That you're tired of the war and all that shit?  
Oh, tell me, are you ready to do your bit?  
  
Chorus  
  
You gotta' take a stand,  
Give your brother a helping hand.  
We got to start today,  
So tomorrow our kids can play.  
We better do what's right,  
So we don't have to fight,  
No more.  
  
'bout the only way I see that we can change the plan,  
Is to vote and get our man.  
The man whose not afraid,  
And one whose not over-paid.  
  
Chorus  
  
You gotta' take a stand,  
Give your brother a helping hand.  
We got to start today,  
So tomorrow our kids can play.  
We better do what's right,  
So we don't have to fight,  
No more.
