Tornados spinnin', I sit here grinnin'  
I think we've all seen this movie before  
This is confusin', almost amusin'  
It's hard to tell up and down anymore  
When did it get so crazy, how did we lose control  
Everybody's shouting, how bad it really sucks  
  
Situation normal  
All funked up, We're all funked up  
  
We had some leaders, and they were cheaters  
But they came out smelling like a rose  
We should reject them, but we respect them  
For what they do when the door is closed  
Nothing in this world a simple man can do  
Stand up and be counted, ain't you had enough  
  
Situation normal  
All funked up, Yeah we're all funked up  
We're functionally dysfunctional  
We're functionally yeah dysfunctional  
We're all funked up  
  
Don't you know the meaning of the word snafu  
Better known as trouble for me and you  
Murphy's law will get ya, he's on his way  
Same ole same ole shit a different day  
  
Tornado's spinnin', I sit here grinnin'  
I think we've all seen this movie before  
This is confusin', almost amusin'  
It's hard to tell up and down anymore  
Everybody's shouting, how bad it really sucks  
  
Situation normal  
All funked up, we're all funked up  
We're all funked up  
We're all funked up  
  
Oh  
All funked up
