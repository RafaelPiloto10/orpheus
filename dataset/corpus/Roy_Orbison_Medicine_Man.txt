I'll bring you the talon from an eagle  
A big black pearl from the sea  
I'll bring one and twenty ponies  
If you'll bring Wildflower to me  
Medicine Man,Make your magic mine  
Turn Wildflower to a clinging vine  
Medicine man won't you please help me  
Don't leave me down in misery  
Rattle them bones,then roll them stones  
And make Wildflower mine  
I will bring you white buffalo  
I'll bring honey from the bee  
I'll keep fire-water flowing  
If you'll get the big chief to agree  
Medicine Man, Help me if you can  
Write a secret message in the sand  
Medicine man, please let her know  
Tell Wildflower that I love her so  
Take the breeze and shake the trees  
And make Wildflower mine  
Now she has no use for a white man  
Helpless and worthless like me  
Tell her father Big-Strong-Hand  
To let Wildflower comfort me  
Medicine man,medicine man  
Let it be known throughout the land  
Medicine man, medicine man  
I have to have the hand of Wildflower  
Take this piece of calico  
Make a dress with a pretty bow  
Tie it with a thread of lace  
Take it to your secret place  
Go into your sacred dance  
Say a prayer for our romance  
And make Wildflower mine
