She Was My Lady  
(David Gates)  
  
No one has heard  
No one has seem her  
Nobody else  
Carin' but me  
She was a child  
She was a woman  
When she was here  
She was my lady  
  
Never before  
Was I dependin'  
Then she came on  
Filled in my life  
She kept me on  
My best behavior  
She was my lord  
She was my savior  
  
She became my sanctuary  
Some place I could lay me down  
She would always help to carry  
All the things that weigh me down  
  
Nobody knew  
How much I loved her  
Not even her  
Not even me  
She was my queen  
She was my lover  
When she was here  
There was no other
