You know that I'm a crazy bitch  
I do what I want when I feel like it  
All I wanna do is lose control (oh, oh)  
But you don't really give a shit  
You go with it, go with it, go with it  
'Cause you're fucking crazy rock n' roll  
  
You said hey  
What's your name  
It took one look  
And now I'm not the same  
Yeah you said hey  
And since that day  
You stole my heart  
And you're the one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, and that's why I smile  
It's been a while  
Since every day and everything has  
Felt this right  
And now you turn it all around  
And suddenly you're all I need  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
  
Last night I blacked out I think  
What did you, what did you put in my drink  
I remember making out and then (oh, oh)  
I woke up with a new tattoo  
Your name was on me and my name was on you  
I would do it all over again  
  
You said hey (hey)  
What's your name (what's your name)  
It took one look  
And now I'm not the same  
Yeah you said hey (hey)  
Since that day (since that day)  
You stole my heart  
And you're the one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
  
You know that I'm a crazy bitch  
I do what I want when I feel like it  
All I wanna do is lose control  
You know that I'm a crazy bitch  
I do what I want when I feel like it  
All I wanna do is lose control  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
The reason, the reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh
