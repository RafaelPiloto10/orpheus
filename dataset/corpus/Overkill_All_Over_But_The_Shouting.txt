Once upon a time  
When you had us all in line  
Thought that we would never learn  
The word out on the street  
Was you never felt the heat  
Even when the fires burned  
Then the dogs of war  
Barking at your door  
Is this what it's all about?  
So we broke the deal  
It's how it made us feel  
Drummer started on the shout  
  
Heard a thousand drummers on a solitary light  
Heat of a thousand summers explode into the night  
They hid behind the curtains, their faces were concealed  
A voice above the ashes screamed  
I want to make a deal  
I'm back on my heels  
  
Hell raising, drums blazing  
All over but the shouting now  
Hell raising, drums blazing  
Careful what you wish for, you may get it now  
Hell raising, drums blazing  
All over but the shouting now  
  
The look upon your face  
When we blew it into space  
And let the pieces fall about  
Destruction on the ground  
The heart of freedom found  
In a voice could only shout  
The pain would go away  
The pride inside would stay  
The blood is dripping you're alive  
The ones that stood and fell  
Were all remembered well  
The cross of an animal 5  
  
Cold calculation got them to fall into line  
Annihilation, got them working the shine  
They scream and shout  
All over but the  
Beat generation in a room full of war  
Evacuation as the stones hit the door  
They want out, all over but the shout  
  
So, once upon a time  
When we lit the line  
Thought that we would never learn  
The word out on the street  
They melted in the heat  
Even when the fires burned  
Then the dogs of war  
Scratching at your door  
Is it what it's all about?  
So we broke the deal  
For everything you steal  
We start the drummer on the shout
