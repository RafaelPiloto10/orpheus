A vagabond dreamer, a rhymer and singer of songs  
Singing to no one and nowhere to really belong  
I met a beautiful lady, a pure Southern belle of the ball  
Like Scarlet O'Hara loved no one and wanted them all  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never forget you and love you inspite of your faults  
The good and the bad I want to remember it all  
I did a new dance and you did your Tennessee Waltz  
The party's all over I came uninvited  
I'm leaving and taking the belle of the ball  
  
There will always be someone I guess that's the way it should be  
I guess I should know that someone used to be me  
They'll gather around her soon they'll all look the same  
At the feet of the lady are lover's without any names  
  
[Chorus]
