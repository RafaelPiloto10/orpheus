Listen mister i won't waste your time  
I hope all the mistakes you made were a lot like mine  
Lovin' girls too much sometimes they made you cry  
Maybe we've got more livin' to do with a lot less pain  
Here, let's drink to you  
These are the words i knew would break the ice  
I held my hand out and he shook it twice  
It seemed to me like i'd been here before  
Deja vu, familiar voice  
And the salute of my choice  
  
Salute gentlemen of days gone by  
Ladies of leisure and of flashing eye  
May some romantic fool turn on your light  
As for me i'm in between  
All that i can do is dream  
  
You got a lot more livin' to do  
And a lot more lovin' too  
When you make it through the night with no end in sight  
And the dawn peeks through  
You got a lot more livin' to do  
  
Salute nightingales upon the tide  
Brothers of the cloth tonight who must be tried  
May all of your martinis be forever dry  
As for me i'm in between  
All that i can do is dream  
  
You got a lot more livin' to do  
And a lot more lovin' too  
When you make it through the night with no end in sight  
And the dawn peeks through  
You got a lot more livin' to do  
And a lot more lovin' too  
You got a lot more livin' to do  
And a lot more lovin' too
