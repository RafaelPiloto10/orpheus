I've been told it's just a matter of time  
before you meet someone who opens your eyes  
But time's on my side so nevertheless  
I know the pain of too much happiness  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all part of my way of giving  
and I'm giving it all to you  
More than love it's a way of living  
and what more would you have me do  
  
Although I'm not a guy that means to hurt  
and if at times it seems our love won't work  
I tell you honey, you must surely realize  
See all confusion in my cloudy eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Although I'm not a guy that means to hurt  
and if at times it seems our love won't work  
I tell you honey you must surely realize  
See all confusion in my cloudy eyes  
  
[Chorus]
