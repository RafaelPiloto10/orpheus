Ocean of motion  
Squirming around and up and down  
Pushing together  
Scattering mountains all around you  
That is the sound of a new born world  
And a light from a curious sky  
It has begun  
You're in the hands of destiny  
  
Thrashing with violence  
Hurling its lava up and down  
Furnace of frenzy  
Burning with power uncontrolled  
That is the sound of a new born world  
And the light from a curious sky  
It has begun  
You're in the hands of destiny  
  
Is that the chariot with stallions gold  
Is that a prince of heaven on the ground  
Is that the roar of a thunderflash  
This is my world and it's waiting to be crowned  
Father, son, looks down with happiness, life is on its way
