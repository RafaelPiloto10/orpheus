Well the little things that you say and do  
Make me want to be with you  
Oh, rave on it's a crazy feeling  
And I know it's got me reelin'  
  
When you say I love you  
Rave on  
The way you dance and hold me tight  
The way you kiss when we goodnight  
  
Rave on its a crazy feeling  
And I know its got me reelin'  
When you say I love you  
Oh, Rave on  
  
Well rave on its a crazy feeling  
And I know its got me reelin'  
I'm so glad your revealing your love for me  
Rave on, Rave on, tell me,  
  
Tell me not to be lonely,  
Tell me, you love me only  
Rave on to me
