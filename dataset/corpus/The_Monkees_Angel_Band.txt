By Michael Nesmith  
My latest sun is sinking fast,  
My race is nearly run,  
My strongest trials now have passed,  
My triumph is begun.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Oh, bear my longing heart to Him  
Who bled and died for me,  
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin  
And brings me victory.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Fade out...
