He'll break your heart  
Don't let it start  
But if you think it's better  
Go ahead and buy 'm a sweater  
Carol, you fool  
You think you got it so bad  
(thank you!)  
Tryin' to steel some money  
Just to get some more of what you had  
And he's got the dog  
And he has no log  
No, he won't come back  
So put away your black-jack  
You wanna try  
(you wanna try)  
To rob some mexican guy  
(to rob a mexican guy)  
Beat him on the head  
(oh, you beat him on his head)  
Maybe make him dead  
(you just might make him dead)  
Just so you can fly  
(oh, you wanna fly)  
From pittsburgh out to see him  
(you said you really gotta see him)  
Carol, you're a foolish fool  
(carol, oh-oh, girl!)  
You don't really need him  
Carol carol

(to rob some mexican guy)  
To rob some mexican guy  
(to rob a mexican guy)

Beat him on the head  
(please, don't beat him on his head, girl)  
(but they wanna make him dead  
And he wants me to ...)  
Maybe make him dead

Just so you can fly

From pittsburgh out to see him  
(ooh, you really gotta see him)  
Carol, you're a foolish fool  
(carol, oh-oh, girl!)  
You don't really need him

You was a fool
