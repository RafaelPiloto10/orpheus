Woke up one morning saw a rooster  
Struttin' by my house  
6 pack rings round his neck  
"Cock o' the block"  
Don't stop now  
Don't stop now  
  
What keeps big daddy happy?  
What makes the buzzard buzz?  
A leaky quart of motor oil  
"Head for the hills"  
Don't stop now  
Don't stop now  
  
We pulled into economy island  
"King shit and the golden boys"  
Plenty more where we come from  
"Top o' the line"  
Don't stop now  
Don't stop now  
  
Don't stop now  
Don't stop now
