What would you do if I told you that I'm falling in love again?  
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands  
A way to make my heart beat faster.  
Is this heaven we're living in?  
A way to make my life worth living.  
I've fallen in love again.  
  
I've got to ask you now, baby:  
What would you say if I told you that I'm falling in love again?  
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands  
A way to make my heart beat faster.  
Is this heaven we're living in?  
A way to make my life worth living.  
I've fallen in love again.
