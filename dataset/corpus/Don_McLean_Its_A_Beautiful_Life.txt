I wish my brain would operate instead of standing still.  
It's all so complicated,  
The thread of my own thoughts seems to be disappearing into what seems  
To be a logical conclusion.  
  
I guess I just ran out of ideas.  
I've heard a million songs about this and that,  
And they gave me satisfaction  
But I see,  
It's a Beautiful life.  
  
Now comes the second verse and I have to at least keep the measures  
Straight.  
It's been a long time now and i'm really insecure about it all.  
I guess I didn't like seeing all the things I saw, Who needs it?  
It's been a little painful and I hope I don't like the pain,  
Cause I'd hate to think of myself like that  
  
'Cause I see,  
It's a Beautiful life.  
I like the old things, But I just can't give up the idea  
Of trying something a little bit different,  
Even if it's stupid  
  
'Cause I see,  
It's a Beautiful life.  
Yes, I see,  
It's a Beautiful life.  
And I see,  
It's a Beautiful life
