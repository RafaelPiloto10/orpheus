You think you're gonna make me sulk, you and your fancy car, ah-ha-ha  
But I can tell you honey your tricks ain't gonna get you far, ah-ha-ha  
They say that money's got a magic touch  
But not to me, it doesn't mean that much  
You won't have me tonight  
All right, all right, all right, all right  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy  
But I'll never be your girl  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
  
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today, ah-ha-ha  
I wouldn't keep a thing from you, I gave them all away, ah-ha-ha  
The girls might fall for everything you've got  
But I'm not one of them, you know I'm not  
You won't have me tonight  
All right, all right, all right, all right  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy  
But I'll never be your girl  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
So long, so long, so long  
So long, so long, so long
