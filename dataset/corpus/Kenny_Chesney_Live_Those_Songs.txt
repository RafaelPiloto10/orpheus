Saw him sittin' on a sidewalk in Fresno...  
Braided hair and a tye-dyed t-shirt on.  
Talkin' to himself about Vietnam,  
About the tour he did and the deal he got.  
He said,"This world ain't the same if you ask me.  
If I could be somewhere else,  
I'd tell you where I'd be...  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'd be rollin' on a river with Creedence.  
Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue.  
I'd be knee-deep in sand on  
A Panama Beach In the spring of '72.  
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay,  
Watchin' the tide roll in.  
He said,"What I wouldn't give just to  
Live those songs again."  
  
Saw him workin' the counter at Walgreens...  
With a new haircut and a Bachelor's Degree.  
Talkin' to himself about his raw deal,  
Cussin' Uncle Sam and the GI bill.  
He said,"This world ain't the same if you ask me.  
If I could be somewhere else,  
I'd tell you where I'd be...  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He said,"This world ain't the same if you ask me.  
If I could be somewhere else,  
I'd tell you where I'd be...  
  
[Chorus:]
