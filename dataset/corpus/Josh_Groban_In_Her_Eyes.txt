She stares through my shadow  
She sees something more  
Believes there's a light in me  
She is sure  
And her truth makes me stronger  
Does she realize  
I awake every morning  
With her strength by my side  
  
I am not a hero  
I am not an angel  
I am just a man  
A man who's trying to love her  
Unlike any other  
  
In her eyes, I am  
  
This world keeps on spinning  
Only she stills my heart  
She's my inspiration  
She's my northern star  
  
I don't count my possessions  
But all I call mine  
I will give her completely  
'Til the end of all time  
  
I am not a hero  
I am not an angel  
I am just a man  
A man who's trying to love her  
Unlike any other  
  
In her eyes, I am  
  
In her eyes I see the sky  
And all I'll ever need  
In her eyes time passes by  
And she is with me  
  
I am not a hero  
I am not an angel  
I am just a man  
A man who's trying to love her  
Unlike any other  
  
In her eyes, I am  
In her eyes, I am
