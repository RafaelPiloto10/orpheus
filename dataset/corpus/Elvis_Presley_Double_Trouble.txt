Some guys fall in love with one girl, I gotta fall for two  
There's just so much loving that one heart's supposed to do  
So I go around with my heart dragging on the ground  
Dogging me around, I'm the sorriest sight in town  
  
[Chorus]  
I got double trouble, I got double trouble  
I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else oh yeah!  
  
I guess there's gotta be two dark clouds hanging over me  
My future looks a bumpy as a matchbox on the sea  
Every time I think that I have finally got it made  
Some losing cards are played, I just can't make the grade  
  
[Chorus: x2]
