Placed in the wilderness, naked and cold  
The night draws the warmth from my flesh  
Howls in the distance  
The wolves they catch my scent  
They yearn for my blood warm and fresh  
  
But I  
  
Cannot run, I cannot hide  
I'm moments old, yet terrified  
Snarling breath is on my face  
I am damned in this place  
  
Morning breaks the evening darkness  
Daylight sings so loud  
Father holds my in his arms  
And laughs for he is proud  
'All is well' my mother cries  
A kiss for me her child  
But at night my heart turns black  
And calls me to the wild  
  
In the night where the wolf-bane grows  
In the night when the full moon glows  
  
Cry wolf  
  
Alone in your room  
By the light of the moon  
Your glory is shining so bright  
You prey for the day  
Oh show me the way  
The devil takes over tonight  
It's too late, night is here  
The time that you dread  
The time when you loose all control  
  
Your bodies in pain  
You cry in vein  
Satan takes over your soul  
  
Cry wolf  
  
Even a man who's pure of heart  
He says his prayers by night  
Bane from a wolf when the wolf bane grows  
And the moon's full and bright  
  
I cannot resist their call  
It strengthens as I age  
To the pack to join the feast  
And fear immortal rage  
Never can I live the life  
Of every normal child  
Forever I must answer  
To the call of the wild  
  
The call of the wild
