In the beginning  
You really loved me, oh  
I was too blind  
I could not see, now  
  
But now that you left me  
Ooh, how I cried out, I keep crying  
You don't miss your water  
'Till your well are undried  
  
I kept you crying  
Sad and blue, oh my, oh  
I was a playboy  
I just wouldn't be true  
  
But now that you left me  
Good Lord, how I cried, I keep crying, I keep crying  
Ooh, I've been miss my water  
No I never miss my water  
'Till my well are undried  
  
I sit here and wonder  
How in the world this could be, my, oh my  
I never thought, oh, I never thought  
You ever leave me  
  
But now that you left me  
Good Lord, good Lord, how I cried out  
You don't miss your water  
You don't miss your water  
'Till your well are undried  
  
Ooh, You don't miss your water, oh  
You don't miss your water  
'Till your well are undried  
I miss my water  
I keep missing my water  
I keep missing my water  
And I want my water  
I need my water  
I love my water  
And I want my water  
And I'm little destined now  
And I'm little destined now  
I want my water  
I need wanting my water.
