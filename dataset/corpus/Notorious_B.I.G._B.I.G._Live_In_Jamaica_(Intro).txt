Ladies and Gentlemen  
We're gonna ask you for some fanfare... The band fanfare because... Ladies and
gentlemen... Sting has always gone ahead of itself.  
They have done it again and again and again.  
I remember the year they brought in the fat boys they were hotter then ten
thousand fire sides.  
And if you know... And if you enjoy hip-hop... If you want one of the coldest
brothaz out of North America... A brotha that gave you a song like  
Juicy...  
[Bigge] Uh-huh...  
[Jamaican Host]  
You hear a crew in Jamaica with something that goes like this  
"Who the heck is this  
Paging me in the morning  
At the crack of dawning"  
[Bigge] Yeauh!  
[Jamaican Host]  
Please welcome... For the first time... In Sting 96... Please welcome
(welcome... Welcome)  
The Notorious.... The Notorious... B. I. G... Aka bigge!
