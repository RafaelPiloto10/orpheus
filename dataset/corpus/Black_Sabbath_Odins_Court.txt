As you walk alone the night surrounds you like a shroud  
The dreams you had were once of love and being proud  
Misty horizons block your vision of the world  
But the raven's eyes will show you all you need to know  
  
The land you loved is now so barren and so cold  
The name of God rings out so high in your soul  
This time is masters will lead us by the sword  
And should we fait them all prevails in Odin's court
