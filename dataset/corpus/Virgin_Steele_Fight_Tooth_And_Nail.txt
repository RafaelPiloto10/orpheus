Fight, fight tooth and nail  
Fight, fight tooth and nail  
  
It's the law of the jungle  
The strongest will survive  
And that's the rule I live by  
Think fast and stay alive  
Keep the eye of the tiger  
Gather cunning, strength and speed  
Use evry trick you know  
Don't retreat until they bleed  
  
Your hand's a dwadly weapon  
Your teeth can rip in two  
Get'em before they get you  
There's no more time to loose  
  
[Chorus]  
Fight, fight tooth and nail  
If you think they'll show you mercy  
You better think again  
You gotta fight  
  
I'm akin to the lion, the tiger and the bear  
I use what nature gives, to rip and  
Slash and tear  
I'm really very gentle, rather make love  
Than go to war  
But if you try to harm me  
You'll die by neture's law  
  
My hand's a deadly weapon,  
My teeth can rip in two  
A present of death I give you  
I'll run you through and through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Once more into the cobra's nest  
A poisoned victory  
Blood stains the sands of history  
If you'll wage war, you'll get no pity from me, oh no...  
  
[Chorus]
