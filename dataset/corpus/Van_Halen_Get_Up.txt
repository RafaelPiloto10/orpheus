[Chorus 1:]  
Feel like throwing in the towel don't be a fool  
They're out to knock you out, put you down  
For the count  
Watch the left, watch the right, below  
The belt  
They'll run you round and round it's plain to see  
It's never gonna stop they'll run ya till you drop  
There ain't no power around can keep a good man down  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
There's still some fight in me  
That's how it'll always be  
Hold your head up high, look 'em in the eye, never say die  
Get up and make it work  
You say that love has got you down well that's bull  
If love has got you down then love can pick you right back up  
There ain't no power around can keep a good man down  
Walking down a dead end street  
No mercy at your feet  
They're holding all the cards, making things so hard, before it goes too far  
Get up and make it work  
Get up and make it work  
  
[Chorus 1]  
[Chorus 2]  
  
Get up and make it work  
Get up and make it work  
Get up and make it work  
Get up and make it work
