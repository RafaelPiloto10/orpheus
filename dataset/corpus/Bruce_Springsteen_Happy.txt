Some need gold and some need diamond rings  
Or a drug to take away the pain that living brings  
A promise of a better world to come  
When whatever here is done  
I don't need that sky of blue  
All I know's since I found you, I'm happy when I'm in your arms  
Happy, darling, come the dark  
Happy when I taste your kiss  
I'm happy in a love like this  
  
There's a house upon a distant hill  
Where you can hear the laughter of children ring  
Guardian angels, they watch from above  
Watching over the love that they bring  
But at night I feel the darkness near, I awake and I find you near  
I'm happy with you in my arms  
I'm happy with you in my heart  
Happy when I taste your kiss  
I'm happy in love like this  
  
In a world of doubt and fear  
I wake at night and reach to find you near  
Lost in a dream, you caught me as I fell  
I want more than just a dream to tell  
  
We're born in this world, darling, with few days and trouble never far behind  
Man and woman circle each other in a cage  
A cage that's been handed down the line  
Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars  
Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars  
Happy in each other's arms  
Happy, baby, come the dark  
Happy in each other's kiss  
I'm happy in a love like this
