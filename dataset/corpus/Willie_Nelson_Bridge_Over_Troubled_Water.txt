When you're weary and feeling small  
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all  
I'm on your side when times get rough and friends just can't be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
  
When you're down and out when you're on the street  
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you  
I'll take your part when darkness comes and pain is all around  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
  
Sail on silver girl sail on by  
Your time has come to shine all your dreams're on their way  
See how they shine if you need a friend I'm sailing right behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind  
I will ease your mind
