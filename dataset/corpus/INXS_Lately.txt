I never knew much  
Enough was enough  
The reasons were not always there  
But the look in your eyes  
Hides that surprise  
I would never have counted on this  
  
Well lately  
You look around  
You're wondering what your doing  
Yeah lately  
You look around  
Your wondering what you seeing  
What your doing  
  
The taste of your freedom  
Was sweeter than love  
'Cause you never had a chance to live  
Your blue sky calls  
To seduce and bewitch  
And give you the wings of your fate  
  
Well lately  
You look around  
You're wondering what your doing  
Yeah lately  
You look around  
Your wondering what you seeing  
What your doing  
  
I never knew much  
Enough was enough  
The reasons were not always there  
But the look in your eyes  
Hides that surprise  
I would never have counted on this  
  
Well lately  
You look around  
You're wondering what your doing  
Yeah lately  
You look around  
Your wondering what you seeing  
What your doing  
  
Well lately  
You look around  
You're wondering what your doing  
Yeah lately  
You look around  
Your wondering what you seeing  
What your doing
