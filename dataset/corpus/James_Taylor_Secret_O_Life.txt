The secret of life  
Is enjoying the passage of time.  
Any fool can do it,  
There ain't nothing to it.  
Nobody knows how we got  
To the top of the hill.  
But since we're on our way down,  
We might as well enjoy the ride.  
  
The secret of love  
Is in opening up your heart.  
It's okay to feel afraid,  
But don't let that stand in your way.  
'Cause anyone knows  
That love is the only road.  
And since we're only here for a while,  
Might as well show some style.  
Give us a smile.  
  
Isn't it a lovely ride?  
Sliding down, gliding down,  
Try not to try too hard,  
It's just a lovely ride.  
  
Now the thing about time  
Is that time isn't really real.  
It's just your point of view,  
How does it feel for you?  
Einstein said he  
Could never understand it all.  
Planets spinning through space,  
The smile upon your face,  
Welcome to the human race.  
  
Some kind of lovely ride.  
I'll be sliding down,  
I'll be gliding down.  
Try not to try too hard,  
It's just a lovely ride.  
Isn't it a lovely ride?  
Sliding down, gliding down,  
Try not to try too hard,  
It's just a lovely ride.  
The secret of life  
Is enjoying the passage of time.
