I was searching (searching) on a one-way street  
I was hoping (hoping) for a chance to meet  
I was waiting for the operator on the line  
(She's gone so long) What can I do?  
(Where could she be?) no, no, no, don't know what I'm gonna do  
I gotta get back to you  
  
You gotta slow down (slow down) sweet talking woman (slow down)  
You got me running (run, run)  
You got me searching  
Hold on (hold on) sweet talking lover (hold on)  
It's so sad if that's the way it's over  
  
I was (walking) many days go by  
I was thinking (thinking) about the lonely nights  
Communication breakdown all around  
(She's gone so long) What can I do?  
(Where could she be now?) no, no, no, don't know what I'm gonna do  
I gotta get back to you  
  
You gotta slow down (slow down) sweet talking woman (slow down)  
You got me running (run, run)  
You got me searching  
Hold on (hold on) sweet talking lover (hold on)  
It's so sad if that's the way it's over  
  
I've been living (living) on a dead-end street  
I've been asking (asking) everybody I meet  
Insufficient data coming through  
(She's gone so long) What can I do?  
(Where could she be?) no, no, no, don't know what I'm gonna do  
I gotta get back to you  
  
You gotta slow down (slow down) sweet talking woman (slow down)  
You got me running (run, run)  
You got me searching
