[Chorus]  
In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox  
It's playing all my favorite memories  
One by one they take me back  
To the days when you were mine  
And i can't stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
I don't need no quarters  
Don't need any dimes  
You filled it up forever  
When you said goodbye  
Heaven knows i love old melodies  
They were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind that's playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Song by song those melodies  
Were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind that's playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tag  
No i can't stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
[Chorus]
