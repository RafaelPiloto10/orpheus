North side, east side  
Little Willy, Willy wears the crown, he's the king around town  
Dancing, glancing  
Willy drives them silly with his star shoe shimmy shuffle down  
Way past one, and feeling alright  
'Cause with little Willy round they can last all night  
Hey down, stay down, stay down, down  
'Cause  
  
[Chorus:]  
Little Willy, Willy won't go home  
But you can't push Willy round  
Willy won't go, try tellin' everybody but, oh no  
Little Willy, Willy won't go home  
  
Up town, down town  
Little Willy, Willy drives them wild with his runaround style  
Inside, outside  
Willy sends them silly with his star-shine shimmy shuffle smile  
Mama done chase Willy down the hall  
But laugh, Willy laugh, he don't care at all  
Hey down, stay down, stay down, down  
'Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Little Willy, Willy won't  
Willy won't, Willy won't  
Little Willy, Willy won't  
Willy won't, Willy won't  
Little Willy, Willy won't  
Willy won't, Willy won't  
Little Willy, Willy won't  
Willy won't, Willy won't  
  
[Chorus x2]
