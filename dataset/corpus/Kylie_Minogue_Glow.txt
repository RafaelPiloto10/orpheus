[Verse:]  
Glow, silhouettes and shadows  
Glow, I'm waitin' in the dark  
Oh, heavy hearts are beatin'  
Glow, close  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why won't you ever leave?  
I cry your name in pleasure every time that I'm in pain  
It's drivin' me so crazy, the way you make my heart deceive me  
I toss and I turn all night long, all night  
All night long, all night, all night long, all night  
It's alright now, alright  
It's alright now, so right  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Gold, shadows then it splatters  
Love every night, it grows  
So how I can I endure it?  
I glow  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why won't you ever leave?  
I cry your name in pleasure every time that I'm in pain  
It's drivin' me so crazy, the way you make my heart deceive me  
I toss and I turn all night long, all night  
All night long, all night, all night long, all night  
It's alright now, alright  
It's alright now, so right  
  
[Bridge:]  
It's alright now, alright  
It's alright now, so right  
It's so oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
All night long, now  
All night long, now  
All night long, now  
It's alright now, it's alright
