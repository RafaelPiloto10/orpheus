Venue after venue, I've been through  
Coming to the telly, so I can bend you  
Send you to the store, condoms and more  
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores  
Could it be my hardcore metaphor  
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor  
Open up the Lex door  
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired  
I'm a roll blunts while you spin  
You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving  
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin  
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se  
Much foreplay, that's my forte  
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death  
She looking for a man, honey he just left  
Violate me, he get beat to death  
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left  
Grand Marnier increase the don strength  
Two four-fifths within my arms length  
With a calm breath I say we gots to float  
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat  
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine  
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen  
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue  
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu  
Beautiful, that's how the night goes  
Get out them tight clothes  
Get in some night clothes  
I invite those girls that smoke lye  
Keep it real with you  
You keep it real with I  
We be tight like frog's ass  
Have you screaming "Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance"  
  
Would you ride with me? (Yeah)  
Would you lie for me? (That's right)  
Would you get high with me? (For sure)  
Would you die for me? (No doubt)  
Would you ride with me? (Yeah)  
Would you lie for me? (That's right)

These hoes don't treat you like I treat you  
Like my contacts, I can see right through  
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?  
Queen Bitch means number one and two  
Wifey, ya'll ain't got to like me  
Go head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one  
Y'all know where I'm from  
Bucktown, lay your ass down  
You don't wanna play around (with me)  
Probably just mad because Frank chose me  
A fly cu-tie, you just a grou-pie  
Girls call my telephone just to hang up  
While me and you is in the crib, laying up  
Oh he ain't tell you that we live together  
And that we gonna have a kid together  
Whatever, me intimidated, never  
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim  
Anyway, I fuck better than you  
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you  
If I fuck another nigga, don't mean nothing  
B.I.G. is in my heart from the start  
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch  
Chicks who used to be around, where they at now?  
(See I don't care bout them other broads)  
B.I.G. kept it real with me, and that's that
