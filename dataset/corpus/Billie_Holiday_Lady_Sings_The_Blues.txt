Lady sings the blues  
She's got them bad  
She feels so sad  
Wants the world to know  
Just what the blues is all about  
  
Lady sings the blues  
She tells her side  
nothing to hide  
Now the world will now  
Just what the blues is all about  
The blues ain't nothing but a pain in your heart  
when you get a bad start  
When you and your man have to part  
I ain't gonna just sit around and cry  
And now I won't die  
Because I love him  
  
Lady sings the blues  
she's got 'em bad  
She feels so sad  
The world will know  
She's never gonna sing them no more  
  
No more
