(Sip somethin')  
Uh, sip somethin'  
(Sip somethin')  
I wouldn't drink that, if I was you  
  
[Chorus]  
With every sip of my drink (uh)  
I get a little bit closer (uh-huh)  
And when I'm tryin' to re-think (yeah)  
I can't really get focused (uh, uh)  
I wasn't tryin' to be mean  
I can see that it's hopeless (uh)  
Cause your persistence overpowers me  
I know you rollin' out with me  
  
I was stayin' at the Shore Club, leanin' in the red room  
Seen this tan mami, she was fresh off the sand dunes  
Big bottles and models and poom-pooms  
Surroundin' my table, watchin' me like cable  
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades  
Had the Prada shoes on 'cause the world is a stage  
Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair  
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air  
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice  
Like she finished her drink and started chewin' on my ice  
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white  
That's when I realized it'll be a long night  
The vibe was right, she was laced in all white  
Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic  
You ever try to focus, resist with all your might  
But every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm talkin' tan lines, belly rings and things  
DJ rubbin' my thing, makin' my head swing  
All the honies was schemin'  
Cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin', oh God I must be dreamin'  
My vision was blurry, the party was rockin  
The tools was knockin, honey want to get it poppin'  
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil  
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled  
What would you do, if you was a Don  
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blond?  
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm  
Cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb  
You dancin' in your seat, and singin' along  
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform  
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm  
But you take another sip to prove that you strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take it to the bridge  
  
I can't call it, I can't tell  
Honestly, I'm drunk as hell (uh-huh)  
And me, I can not believe (lay back baby)  
This night out is windin' down (uh)  
You keep buyin' all these rounds for me (aw man)  
I know what you want from me (yeah)  
I know what you want  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Rollin out with me (roll out)  
Rollin out with me (uh, roll out)  
Roll out (roll out)  
Yeah (uh, uh, roll out)  
(uh, uh, roll out)  
(uh, uh, roll out)  
(uh, uh, roll out)  
(uh, uh, roll out, yeah)  
(Yo Timbo! Bar's on you baby, hahahaha)  
(Yeah!)
