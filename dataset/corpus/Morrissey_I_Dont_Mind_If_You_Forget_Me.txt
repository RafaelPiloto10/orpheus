I don't mind  
I don't mind if you forget me  
Having learned my lesson  
I never left an impression on anyone  
  
So now you send me your hardened 'regards'  
When once you'd send me 'love'  
Sincerely I must tell you  
Your mild 'best wishes'  
They make me suspicious  
  
I don't mind  
I don't mind if you forget me  
Having learned my lesson  
I never left an impression on anyone  
The pressure to change, to move on  
Was strange  
And very strong  
So this is why I tell you  
I really do understand  
Bye bye  
  
I don't mind if you forget me  
No no no no no no no  
  
You can only be strong for so long  
It may not eat you but it will beat you  
So this is why I tell you  
I really don't understand  
This time  
  
Rejection is one thing  
But rejection from a fool  
Is cruel  
Rejection is one thing  
But rejection from a fool  
Is cruel  
And I don't mind if you forget me  
I don't mind if you forget me
