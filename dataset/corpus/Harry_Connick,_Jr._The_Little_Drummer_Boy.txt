Come they told me  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
A new born king to see  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
  
Our finest gifts we bring  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
To lay before the king  
Pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum  
  
So to honor him  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
When we come  
  
Little baby  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I am a poor boy too  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I have no gift to bring  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
That's fit to give to our king  
Pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum  
  
Shall I play for you  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
On my drum  
  
Mary nodded  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
The ox and lamb kept time  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I played my drum for him  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I played my best for him  
Pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum  
  
Then he smiled at me  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
Me and my drum
