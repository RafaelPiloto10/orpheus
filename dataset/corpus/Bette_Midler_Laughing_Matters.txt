Live at five and CNN  
Keep us all abreast  
Of breaking stories that can tend  
To make us anxious and depressed  
Problems with no answers  
Hang on like somechronic cough  
And every day some brand new issue  
Rears it's head to piss you off  
Bad guys win  
Optimism's wearing thin  
Things are spinning out of control  
Cynicism's all the fad  
World evens could make us mad  
As hatters  
Almost every day  
Some underpinning slips away  
These aren't laughing matters  
Time bombs tick  
People keep on getting sick  
And a nickel's not worth a cent  
Wickedness and greed abound  
Just as peace is gaining ground  
It shatters  
Hate is here to stay  
And justice goes to those who pay  
Friend, these aren't laughing matters  
The truth is scarier by far  
Than anything that Stephen King could write  
The stories in the paper are  
The daily small decline and fall  
Spelled out in black and white  
Oh, what to do, what to do?  
How to take a brighter view  
When your noodle's totally fried  
Human spirits need to be  
Leavened by a little levity  
So take those blues  
And bounce them off the wall  
Keep your humor please  
'Cause don't you know it's times like these that  
Laughing matters most of all
