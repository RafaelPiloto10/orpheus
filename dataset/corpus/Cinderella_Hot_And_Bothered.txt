You got me jumpin' right out of my skin  
You keep it up and I'll be comin' on in  
You start a feelin' you're the cream of the crop  
You gonna break my heart or just make it stop  
You told me that you'd always love me true  
But then I heard you told another guy too  
Take a cold shower but the water boils hot  
The way you twist and shake it girl  
You tie me in a knot  
And get me hot  
  
Ooo hot and bothered  
So hot and bothered  
You get me  
Hot and bothered  
Come on now  
  
Now listen  
I pick you up at eight by ten we do the town  
Empty my pockets just a tryin' to get you down  
Throw in the towel I think your games are such a bore  
Just when I think I've lost you pull me to the floor  
And get me hot  
  
Ooo hot and bothered  
So hot and bothered  
You get me  
Hot and bothered  
So hot and bothered  
  
Ooo you get me hot  
Hot and bothered  
So hot and bothered  
Baby baby baby get me hot  
  
Ooo hot and bothered  
So hot and bothered You get me  
Hot and bothered  
Hot and bothered  
So hot and bothered  
You get me  
Hot and bothered  
Hot and bothered  
So hot and bothered  
Hot and bothered  
You get me  
Hot and bothered  
So hot and bothered  
Ooo hot and bothered  
Hot and bothered
