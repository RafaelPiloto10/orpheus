Operator, please connect me with 1982  
I need to make apologies for what I didn't do  
I sure do need to tell her that I've thought the whole thing through  
And now its clear that she is what I should have held on to  
  
[Chorus]  
They say hindsight's twenty-twenty  
But I'm nearly goin' blind  
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine  
Its that same ole lost love story  
Its sad but its true  
There was a time when she was mine in 1982  
  
Postman can you sell me a special kind of stamp  
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man  
Back into the wasted years of my living past  
I need to tell her now I know how long my love will last  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Losin' my mind, goin' back in time to 1982
