You used to float just like a boat upon the tide  
You used to run when things were done you used to hide  
You talk of ships you talk of boats you talk of games  
And now you're down you ain't around its such a shame  
  
'Cause you got something to give  
Something to hold onto  
Why don't you live  
And you just forget about fixing up fate  
Maybe you'd stop pick yourself up  
Now its too late Oh  
It ain't easy when you fall  
It ain't easy when you fall  
It ain't easy when you fall  
No it ain't no good at all  
  
You didn't know this world ain't slow you gotta move  
You made no sound I watched you drown I watched you loose  
Your loneliness you knew it best but its a drag  
'Cause in the end I lost a friend I feel so sad  
  
'Cause you had something to give  
Something to hold onto  
Why did you live  
If you just forgot about fixing up fate  
You'd be here you'd be near  
Now it's too late Oh  
It ain't easy when you fall  
It ain't easy when you fall  
It ain't easy when you fall  
No it ain't no good at all  
  
Oh, oh hey  
It ain't easy when you fall
