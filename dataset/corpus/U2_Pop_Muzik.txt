Radio video  
Boogie with a suitcase  
You're living in a disco  
Forget about the rat race

Sell it like a hotcake  
Try some, buy some  
Fee fie foe fum

Dance to the super mart  
Dig it in the fast lane  
Listen to the countdown  
They're playing our song again  
  
Wanna be a gun slinger  
Don't be a rock singer  
Eenie meenie miney mo  
Which a way you want to go
