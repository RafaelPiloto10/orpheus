As I lay by your side and hold you tonight  
I want you to understand this love that that I feel  
Is so right and so real I realize how lucky I am  
And to you ever wonder if my love is true  
There is something that I want to make clear with you  
  
There's no way I could make it without you  
There's no way that I'd even try  
If I had to survive without you in my life  
I know I wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way  
  
It means so much to me whenever I see that 'wanting me' look in your eyes  
I don't know how I could do without holding you close every night  
I've waited so long just to have you to hold  
Now that I've got you, I'll never let go  
  
There's no way I could make it without you  
There's no way that I 'd even try  
If I had to survive without you in my life  
I know I wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way  
  
I never knew what to do, what I was missin'  
Now you say forever, I find my heart is listenin', yes, I'm listenin'  
  
There's no way I could make it without you  
There's no way that I 'd even try  
If I had to survive without you in my life  
I know I wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way
