She said I could never do that  
But I know you can, you are in my dream  
We are one person not two of a kind  
And what was mine is now in your possession  
I could feel you underneath my skin  
As the wind rushed in,  
Sent the kitchen table crashing  
She said nobody move  
Or I'll bring the house down  
I hardly know which way is up  
Or which way down  
People are strange God only knows  
I feel possessed when you come round  
  
It was one of those times  
Wished I had a camera on me  
Six foot off the ground  
Well I know how that sounds  
Look above you and beyond me too  
That kind of view don't need an explanation  
I'm not lying, not asking for anything  
I just want to be there when it happens again  
  
I hardly know which way is up or which way down  
People are strange God only knows  
I feel possessed when you come round  
  
Whenever you invade my home  
Everything I know flies out the window  
It's above you and beyond me too  
I don't want an explanation  
But I'll be there when you bring the house down  
  
I hardly know which way is up or which way down  
People are strange God only knows  
I feel possessed when you come round  
People are strange  
I feel possessed when you come round
