I can't understand it  
The search for an answer  
Is met with a darker day  
And we've been handed these moments  
Forever  
But I'm reassured  
There's another way  
  
You don't have to close your eyes  
There is room for love again  
Ease the pain to realize  
All that love can be  
  
Forced apart by time and sand  
Take a step  
And take my hand  
And don't let it go  
Never let go  
  
Broken, once connected  
We were so strong and so blessed  
In a simple way  
So don't let me go it alone  
  
Turn your head up to the sky  
Nothing down below but me  
Face the truth to realize  
All that we could be  
Torn apart by rage and fear  
Hold on to what brought you here  
Don't let it go  
Never let go  
  
Hold your head up to the sky  
Nothing down below but me  
Face the truth and realize  
All that we could be  
  
Turn your head up to the sky  
Nothing down below  
Don't let go
