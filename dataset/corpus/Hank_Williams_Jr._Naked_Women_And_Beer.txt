Well you head on out in the jungle  
Lookin' for the girls to tumble  
Up and down and all around the stage  
But when the women start takin' their clothes off  
  
Now we have got some strange laws  
The most hypocritical thing around these days  
'Cause where I live in Tennessee  
Why an auto parts calender hey that's pornography  
But go right down the road, read what the sign says  
  
Naked women and beer we got it all in here  
For your eyes and your ears  
They show it all in the clear  
Way up north and down south  
Whoo, somebody shut my mouth  
  
Now I ain't sayin' it's right  
But I ain't sayin' it's wrong  
But myself I enjoy the site  
Of pretty girls dancin' to their songs  
  
And it's been like that since way back when  
From little Egypt to the Vegas strip  
And when the music starts groovin'  
And the girls start movin'  
Ain't nothing gonna make 'em quit  
  
Naked women and beer, we got it all in here  
For your eyes and your ears  
They show it all in the clear  
Way up north and down south  
Whoo, somebody shut my mouth  
  
Nak-nak-nak-nak-nak-naked women  
Nak-nak-nak-naked women  
Ice cold beer it's all together in here  
Naked women and beer  
  
C'mon in out of the rain  
We got the girls that will make you  
Spend all your change  
Naked women and beer
