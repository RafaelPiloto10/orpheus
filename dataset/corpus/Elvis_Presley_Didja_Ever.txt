Freezin', sneezin'  
You wanna dry your back and, well

You're at a drive-in movie  
With a cute brunette  
A countin' on the kisses that you figure to get  
Closer, closer, then she hollers whoa

You're on a Sunday picnic  
And then it starts to pour  
You run through poison ivy, scratch until you're sore  
Ants come dancin', carry off the bread  
Didja' ever get one of them days  
When you should've stayed in bed?  
Yeah days days days days days days days days
