You packed your bags, I heard you left last night  
You left a world of broken hearts  
You couldn't tell us why  
You only made us cry  
Like in '64  
The days are long the gloom is hid by night  
They make a point we can't deny  
The pain we can't conceal  
The feelings that we feel  
Those that never heal  
So here's a lullaby  
Close your eyes and sleep tonight  
So here's a lullaby  
Close your eyes and make us cry  
  
The world you dreamed  
We tried to make our lives  
You made a point we can't deny  
I know the dream was real  
The difference is feel  
How mysterious  
You stole the show, you know you played it right  
Way back in 1965  
Oh no, well well  
The truth was far from real  
Reality was feel  
Why not save a seal  
  
The days are long your tune is in the song  
Without your love along the way  
You said the things you know could make it right  
If we did'nt lose the way
