Well, I know that you're tired of living this way,  
We've been trying to get high without having to pay.  
  
The walls are all empty, it's not a permanent state,  
Just let me tell you that it's not too late.  
  
[Chorus]  
You're a brain drain, you go on and on like a blood stain.  
You're a drain brain, you go on and on like a blood stain.  
  
Well, you know I ain't selfish, there's always a way.  
If a thing ain't worth having, you're having to pay.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got so much to offer, but I can't pay the rent,  
I can't buy you roses 'cause the money's all spent.  
  
Well, you sat in my car, you drank my champagne,  
You stole all my silk but you gave me no change.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got so much to offer, but I can't pay the rent,  
I can't buy you roses 'cause the money's all spent.  
  
Well, you sat in my car, you drank my champagne,  
You stole all my silk, you left me no change.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
