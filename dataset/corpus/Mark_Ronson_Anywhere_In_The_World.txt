[Verse:]  
Come with me, come with me,  
I found a new movement,  
Get everybody out on the street  
  
On the street, on the street  
I found a new rhythm  
To move our bodies to, to the beat  
  
As we move our feet in unison  
Kicking up the rain or the sand in the sun  
It gives my heart that feeling  
Could be anywhere  
  
[Chorus:]  
Anywhere in the world  
(Moving like this, feeling like this)  
Anywhere in the world  
(No matter where you are)  
  
We could be anywhere in the world  
(Moving like this, feeling like this)  
Anywhere in the world  
(No matter where you are)  
  
Moving like this, feeling like this  
No matter where you are  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Follow me, follow me  
To the river where on these streets  
You can discover every part of me  
  
Parts of me, part of me  
Many memories make a story  
Come on make another one with me  
  
Yes we clap our hands along with the drum  
Sync'ing with the pattern like we're all part of one  
It gives my heart that good, good feeling  
Could be anywhere  
  
[Chorus:]  
Anywhere in the world  
(Moving like this, feeling like this)  
Anywhere in the world  
(No matter where you are)  
  
We could be anywhere in the world  
(Moving like this, feeling like this)  
Anywhere in the world  
(No matter where you are)  
  
Moving like this, feeling like this  
No matter where you are  
  
[Bridge:]  
Follow me  
Down, down to the river  
The sunset's golden  
The water seems silver  
  
Follow me  
Down, down to the river  
We could be anywhere in the world  
But we're together  
  
[Chorus:]  
Anywhere in the world  
(Moving like this, feeling like this)  
Anywhere in the world  
(No matter where you are)  
  
We could be anywhere in the world  
(Moving like this, feeling like this)  
Anywhere in the world  
(No matter where you are)  
  
Moving like this, feeling like this  
(Anywhere in the world)  
No matter where you are
