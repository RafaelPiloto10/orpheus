[From "The Book of Jonah"]  
  
"7 Years Have Gone, It Can No Longer Be Left Undone  
The Candle Must Be Burn Again, And Pain  
Must Follow the Unholy Flame  
So Burn...Burn...Burn  
And Free the Spirit From Its Chain"  
  
Here I AM Blinded Again By That Flame  
In Every Candle That I Burn, Burn !  
I See That Same Face Return, It Returns  
  
Eyes In Pain, My Little Queen Are You A Dream  
In Every Candle That I Burn, Burn !  
I See That Same Face Return, It Returns  
[Solo: Mike]  
Time Has Come For You To Tell The Truth, What Shall I Do  
Tears Are Running From Her Eyes  
If She Could Only Tell Me Why, Tell Me Why  
[Solo: Mike]  
The Jonah...The Jonah  
  
In Twisted Key She Speaks A Word To Me And Then I See  
Her Face Falling Apart  
The Word "Jonah" Is Her Mark, She's Branded  
[Solo: Andy]
