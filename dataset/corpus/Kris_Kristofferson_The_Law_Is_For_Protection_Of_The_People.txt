Billy Dalton staggered on the sidewalk someone said he stumbled and he fell  
Six squad cars came screamin' to the rescue hauled old Billy Dalton off to
jail  
Cause the law is for protection of the people rules're rules and any fool can
see  
We don't need no drunks like Billy Dalton scaring decent folks like you and me
no siree  
Homar Lee was nothing but a hippie walkin' through this world without a care  
Then one day six scrapping brave policemen held down Homar Lee and cut his
hair  
Cause the law is for protection of the people rules're rules and any fool can
see  
We don't need no hairy headed hippies scaring decent folks like you and me no
siree  
Oh so thank your lucky stars we've got protection  
Walk the line and never mind the cost  
And no wonder who them lawmen were protecting  
When they nailed the Saviour to the cross  
Cause the law is for protection of the people rules're rules and any fool can
see  
We don't need no little speaking prophets  
Scaring decent folks like you and me no siree
