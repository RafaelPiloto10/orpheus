You and I were friends from outer space  
Afraid to let go  
The only two who understood this place  
And as far as we know  
We were way before our time  
As bold as we were blind  
Just another perfect mistake  
Another bridge to take  
On the way of letting go,  
  
This ain't goodbye  
It is just the way love goes  
But when the words aren't warm enough,  
To keep away the cold, oh no  
This ain't good bye  
It's not where our story ends  
But I know you can't be mine,  
Not the way you always been  
As long as we've got time  
Then this ain't goodbye  
Oh no, this ain't goodbye  
  
We were stars up in the sunlit sky  
No one else could see  
Neither of else ever thought to ever ask why  
It wasn't meant to be  
Maybe we were way too high  
To ever understand  
Baby we were victims of all, all the foolish plans  
We began to divide  
  
But this ain't goodbye  
This is just the way love goes  
But where's the woman now to keep way the cold, oh no  
This ain't goodbye  
It's not where our story ends  
But I know you cant be mine  
Just like the way you've always been  
As long as we got time,  
This ain't good bye,  
Oh no, this ain't good bye,  
Oh oh, oh no this ain't goodbye  
No na na, na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
Na na na this ain't goodbye  
  
You and I were friends from outer space

The only two who understood this place  
And as far as we know  
This ain't goodbye  
Oh no this ain't goodbye  
This ain't goodbye  
Oh no this ain't goodbye  
This ain't goodbye  
It's just the way love goes  
But when the words aren't warm enought, to keep away the cold, oh no,  
This ain't goodbye  
This isn't where the story ends  
But I know you can't be mine  
Like the way you've always been  
Oh no, don't say it  
No na na, na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
Na na na don't say good bye
