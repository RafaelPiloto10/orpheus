You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
A friend of mine in so much misery  
Some people sail through life, he is struggling  
I said, "Hey man, let's go out and get some wisdom"  
First he turned on me, then turned off his nervous system  
  
You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
You can have it all laid out in front of you but still won't make it think  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Someone I love has got a problem  
Some people thirst for truth, he would like a drink  
I said, "Hey man, this could be risky"  
He said everything's okay, as he downed another bottle of whiskey  
  
You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
You can have it all staked out in front of you but still won't make it sink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Preacher at my church likes to talk about Satan  
Could be that he knows him, he acts like he's possessed  
I said, "Hey man, let's hear about God's realization for a change"  
He said, "We ain't got time for that, first you must hear of the evils of
fornication"  
  
You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
You can have it all staked out in front of you but still won't make it sink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no
