I'm coming back, back home to you  
And I know now for sure that my wandering days are through  
I've looked around, most every place  
But all that I ever see is your lovely face  
When I come back, darling, say you'll marry me  
I want to spend my life with you  
A little band of gold for everyone to see  
I'll tell the world if you marry me  
But out of mind is out of sight  
Didn't know that your love would be watching me each night  
Thought I'd have fun with someone new  
But now that I know it is your love that's so true  
When I come back, darling, say you'll marry me  
I want to spend my life with you  
A little band of gold for everyone to see  
I'll tell the world if you marry me  
When I come back, darling, say you'll marry me  
I want to spend my life with you  
A little band gold for everyone to see  
I'll tell the world if you marry me
