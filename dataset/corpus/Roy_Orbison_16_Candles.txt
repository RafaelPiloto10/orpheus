Happy birthday, happy birthday, baby  
Oh, I love you so  
  
Sixteen candles make a lovely light  
But not as bright as your eyes tonight (as your eyes tonight) (oh)  
Blow out the candles, make your wish come true  
For I'll be wishing that you love me, too (that you love me, too)  
  
Youre only sixteen (sixteen)  
But you're my teenage queen (youre my queen)  
Youre the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen (I've ever seen) (oh!)  
  
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow  
For ever and ever for I love you so (for I love you so)  
  
Youre only sixteen (sixteen)  
But you're my teenage queen (youre my queen)  
Oh, you're the prettiest, loveliest girl I've ever seen (I've ever seen) (oh!)  
  
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow  
For ever and ever for I love you so (for I love you so)  
For I love you so!!!
