Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
  
While shepherds watch their flocks by night,  
They see a bright new shining star,  
They hear a choir sing a song,  
The music seemed to come from afar.  
  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,  
Came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child,  
Not a single room was in sight.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day
