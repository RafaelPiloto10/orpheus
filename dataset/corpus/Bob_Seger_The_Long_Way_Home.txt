Winners, losers and small time misusers  
Do what they must on their own  
Lovers, dreamers and beautiful schemers  
All take the long way home  
Some have their reasons  
Some lose their way  
They all want so much to succeed  
How do you tell them apart  
The best of them leave with their hearts  
  
Now that it's summer  
I went to the river  
The water was never too cold  
Always together through all kinds of weather  
We took the long way home  
She was the best  
I ever knew  
Somehow she drifted away  
  
Now that I'm older  
The nights seems much colder  
I spend too much time alone  
Sometimes in summer  
I kept thinking of her  
And I'll take the long way home  
I'll still take the long way home
