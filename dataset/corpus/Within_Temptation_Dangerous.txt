I know I won't change, I have tried  
Was feeling so caged, hands tied  
I can't find anything feeling so right, it's blinding hope  
  
The Reaper is close, save a spot  
A matter of time, can't deny  
I won't try to run, run, run  
This destiny's mine  
  
The countdown has begun  
the walls are falling down  
my life is on the line  
the fear is mine  
  
It's dangerous to sacrifice  
It makes your blood run to throw the dice  
It's dangerous, it's what you like  
It's what you'll die for to live this life  
We're going on and we'll never stop  
We're going on till our worlds collide  
It's dangerous  
So dangerous  
Dangerous  
  
I know it's not safe, close my eyes  
I search for the edge of Earth  
'cause that's the only place I'll ever find that makes me hope  
  
A thief in the night, out of sight  
It's out there waiting to ignite  
the favor will rise, rise, rise  
taking over my mind  
  
The countdown has begun  
the walls are falling down  
my life is on the line  
the fear is mine  
  
It's dangerous to sacrifice  
It makes your blood run to throw the dice  
It's dangerous, it's what you like  
It's what you'll die for to live this life  
We're going on and we'll never stop  
We're going on till our worlds collide  
It's dangerous  
So dangerous  
Dangerous  
  
Nothing matters anyhow  
It's like I'm floating on the ground  
Into the hands, there I dive  
With my life flashing by  
Like the time is slowing down  
When the world is out of sight  
All the memories in my mind  
Won't leave me behind  
It's dangerous, (dangerous)  
It's dangerous, (dangerous)  
It's dangerous!  
  
It's dangerous to sacrifice  
It makes your blood run to throw the dice  
It's dangerous, it's what you['re] like  
It's what you'll die for to live this life  
We're going on and we'll never stop  
We're going on till our worlds collide  
It's dangerous  
So dangerous  
Dangerous
