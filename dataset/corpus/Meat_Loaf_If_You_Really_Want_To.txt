You say you're all alone,  
And after all the changes you've been through today  
You can use a little tenderness, right now  
  
OK, I've been alone,  
And I can understand the way you feel tonight  
Maybe together we can charge it all right now  
  
I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes  
You need somebody you can hold onto  
  
If you really want to, I'd love to hold you  
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto  
  
You say, he broke your heart,  
He left you crying, but he did not set you free  
And now you feel like you can never love again  
  
OK, so let me know,  
It's up to you how long you let his memory stay  
And do you really want to carry on this way  
  
I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes  
You need somebody you can hold onto  
  
If you really want to, I'd love to hold you  
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto  
  
If you really want to, if you really want to,  
Then I really can't deny you  
  
So many things you need to know, so many left to say  
But you mean more than words I know,  
I can help you chase the pain away  
  
I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes  
You need somebody you can hold onto  
  
If you really want to, if you really want to  
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto  
If you really want to, if you really want to,  
Then I really can't deny you  
  
If you really want to, if you really want to  
If you really want to
