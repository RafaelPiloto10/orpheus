We'll be rockin' till the morning after  
If you stay one more night with me  
Just stay one more night with me  
If you stay one more night with me  
We'll be rockin' till the morning after  
  
Your body's close to mine  
When we're kissing I am opening the door  
And we forget the time  
Gonna take you where you've never been before  
  
Sharing every breath we take  
It feels like every minute is a wall  
The magic moment is awake  
And I want it all  
  
[Chorus]  
If you stay one more night with me  
Just stay one more night with me  
If you stay one more night with me  
We'll be rockin' till the morning after  
  
[Repeats]  
I'm coming on to you  
Let me take you on the journey of your life  
I'll show what I can do  
Leave it to imagination, close your eyes  
Your lips are filled with heat  
And your heart is beating faster with the treat  
Your hands are soft and warm  
And I touch you from your head down to your feet  
You're bringing down the stars for me  
I feel I'm on the verge of lose my cool  
And heaven is the place to be  
Beyond my control  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
