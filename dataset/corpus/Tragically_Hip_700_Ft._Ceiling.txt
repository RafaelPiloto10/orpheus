Let's go to the park, lets go watch 'em floodin' out there after dark,  
Don't have to think of nothin' and I love that for, for the way I'm feeling
700 foot, 700 foot ceiling  
  
Let's take it to the top of the tobacco nation we can aim the dish for
hardcore invitations and I hate that for, for the things I'm thinking when the
clouds are low, 700 are sinking  
  
It's part hard, hard to remember it's part hard to say parts unknown,  
Unknown forever and those parts fade away but leanings toward, toward a full-
stop's all I hear you say  
  
One foot on the stump, the other's on the pulpit 700 foot,  
700 foot pulpit and I love that for, for the way I'm feeling 700 foot,  
700 foot ceiling in our own backyard, we can do some floodin' when it's cold
and dark,  
Don't have to think or nothin'
