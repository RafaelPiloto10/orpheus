Chill in the bones, chill in the air  
Do you think that I haven't been around?  
Boy I wasn't born yesterday, yesterday  
Coming home late at night, flowers on the doorstep  
Trying to make it right  
Boy you gotta be high's what I got to say  
I got to say, I've done all I can  
I've given you every chance to prove you are my man  
But now there's nothing left to lose  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
Yeah, I'm gone, I gotta be moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
'cause I'm gone  
I gotta be movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
Movin' movin' movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
  
I think i'll go do the mall, make a couple of calls  
Gonna hang with the girls  
Just to keep from crying on a shoulder  
Ain't gonna turn back  
Nothing you can say can change that feeling that you get  
When you know that it's finally, finally over  
I've made up my mind  
Even though it hurts to leave your love behind  
I've got nothing left to lose  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
Yeah, I'm gone, I gotta be moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
'cause I'm gone  
I gotta be movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
Movin' movin' movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
  
I'm gone  
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do  
Even if your heart is trying to tell you to  
Stay a little bit longer, trell you to  
Try a little bit harder, baby I know  
I can't live another day, sleep another night  
Waiting for you to change into something I  
Wish you could have been  
It's not what I'm into now  
  
I've done all I can  
Given you every chance to prove  
You are my man  
But now there's nothing left to lose  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
Yeah, I'm gone, I gotta be moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
'cause I'm gone  
  
I gotta be moving on  
Free from your spell  
Taking care of me myself  
Yeah, I'm gone  
I gotta be moving on  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
I'm gone, moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
Moving on  
Free from your spell  
Taking care of me myself  
  
Moving on, I'm gone  
Free from your spell, independent  
I'm gone
