We are the crowd  
We're c-coming out  
Got my flash on it's true  
Need that picture of you  
It's so magical  
We'd be so fantastical  
  
Leather and jeans  
We're rock glamorous  
Not sure what it means  
But this photo of us  
It don't have a price  
Ready for those flashing lights  
Cause you know that baby I  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm your biggest fan  
I'll follow you until you love me  
Papa-paparazzi  
Baby there's no other superstar  
You know that I'll be  
Your papa-paparazzi  
Promise I'll be kind  
But I won't stop until that boy is mine  
Baby you'll be famous  
Chase you down until you love me  
Papa-paparazzi  
  
I'll be a girl backstage at your show  
Velvet ropes and guitars  
Yeah 'cause you're my  
Rockstar in between the sets  
Eyeliner and cigarettes  
  
Shadow is burnt  
Yellow dance and we turn  
My lashes are dry  
Purple teardrops I cry it don't have a price  
Loving you is cherry pie  
Cause you know that baby I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Real good  
(We're dancing in the studio)  
Snap snap to  
(That shit on the radio)  
Don't stop  
(For anyone)  
We're plastic but we still have fun!  
  
[Chorus]
