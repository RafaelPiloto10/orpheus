On the wires I can hear you comin'  
With a rush and a strummin'  
This electric phase ain't no teenage craze  
In your house a phone is ringin'  
  
Just a hot touch that keeps lingerin'  
You said loving's easy only if you please  
All I need is communication  
Not a line on your reputation  
  
I don't want a handshake  
There ain't no big mistake  
  
There's no illusion in this wild confusion  
Who knows I'm crazy, no chance of maybe  
I'd like to know you better  
But I"m goin' down so fast  
  
Help me now to feel it, I just can't conceal it  
Sweet time I've got to show you how it's really got to be  
Just let me be alone, left with your dialing tone  
  
There's no illusion in this wild confusion  
Who knows I'm crazy, no chance of maybe  
I'd like to know you better  
But I"m goin' down so fast  
  
On the wires I can hear you comin'  
With a rush and a strummin'  
This electric phase ain't no teenage craze  
In your house a phone is ringin'
