Save me  
Free me from my heart this time  
The train's gone down the track  
And I, I've stayed behind  
Nothing can free me  
From this ball and chain  
I made up my mind  
I would leave today  
But you're keeping me going  
I know it's insane  
'Cause I love you and lose again  
When the heart calls  
The mind obeys  
Oh, it knows better than me  
If I hold on  
Just one more day  
Then maybe, babe, you'd hear me true  
'Cause nothing can free me  
From this ball and chain  
I made up my mind  
I would leave today  
But you're keeping me going  
I know it's insane  
Because I love you and lose again  
Ooh, ooh  
Nothing can free me  
From this ball and chain  
I made up my mind  
I would leave today  
But you're keeping me going  
I know it's insane  
'Cause I love you and lose again  
Because I love you and lose again
