Tell me, will I ever be the one  
To take my hands off the wheel  
And let it slide?  
Seems like I've always been the one  
That can't sit back and just enjoy the ride  
Just enjoy the ride  
  
Feels like I'm on a speed train  
Blowin' through the fast lane  
And I gotta chase the high  
  
Oh, I can't shake it  
Need to break it  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm lookin' for light on rainy days  
Need it so much, so many ways  
Constantly throwing myself in a bind  
Whoa, I got no time to hesitate  
I want it now, why should I wait?  
I've tried but I just can't be satisfied  
Be satisfied  
  
If you give me everything I want  
I still would try to take a little more of you  
Oh, yeah  
Feels like I'm on a countdown  
But I'm gonna burn out  
If I don't change my point of view  
Oh, what do I gotta do?  
  
Oh, I can't shake it  
Need to break it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What is it like on a peaceful day?  
Just to have you stay  
And watch the world fade away?  
What is it like if you just slow down?  
Surrender to the sound  
Of nothing else around?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Be satisfied  
  
Satisfied!
