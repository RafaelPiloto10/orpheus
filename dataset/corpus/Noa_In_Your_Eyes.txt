Ayelet chen, ayelet chen  
Be galut tismacheni  
You ba layla, you ba layla  
Betoch cheyka meloni  
  
In your eyes  
I see something distant  
Waiting for  
  
In your eyes  
I see something constant  
Longing for  
  
The smallest hands  
I've ever seen  
But hard as steel  
The straightest back  
That's ever been  
Deep inside you're shivering  
  
And I feel you  
Every time I look in the mirror  
I feel you  
Don't hide your tears away from me  
I feel you  
Every time I look in the mirror  
I feel you  
  
Ayelet chen, ayelet chen  
Be galut tismacheni  
You ba layla, you ba layla  
Betoch cheyka meloni  
  
In my ear you would always whisper  
Soothing words  
I could hear in your voice beauty  
Different worlds  
  
Too proud to ever ben  
Forest Hills Napoleon  
The village girl turned city cat  
Desert in your velvet hat  
Strength of will turning wheels  
Handkerchief and faded heels  
Silver hair, cheeks of rouge  
And a heart that's huge  
  
And I feel you  
Every time I look in the mirror  
I feel you  
Don't hide your tears away from me  
I feel you  
Every time I look in the mirror  
I feel you  
  
Ayelet chen, ayelet chen  
Be galut tismacheni  
You ba layla, you ba layla  
Betoch cheyka meloni  
  
Every time I look in the mirror and see your eyes
