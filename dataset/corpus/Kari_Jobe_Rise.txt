Lead us to You  
Show us Your mercy  
Your majesty lifted up on high  
It tells of Your goodness  
  
Your name is true  
Your name is holy  
Your splendor is written in the skies  
It tells of Your greatness  
  
We will rise  
To praise You  
Offer our lives before You  
Let every nation, All of creation  
We will rise  
You are worthy  
Lift up our eyes to Your glory  
Let every nation, All of creation  
We will rise  
  
We stand in awe  
You won the victory  
Your enemies tremble at Your name  
It speaks of Your triumph  
You clothe the poor  
You mend the broken  
You heal our hearts  
You take our shame  
It speaks of Your kindness  
  
We will cry out Your renown  
You are the God who has saved us  
We will rise to praise You  
We lift a glorious sound  
You are the one who redeemed us  
We will rise to praise You
