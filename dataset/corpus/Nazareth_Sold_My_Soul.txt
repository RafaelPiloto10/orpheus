I prayed to God and Jesus  
But I guess they didn't hear  
My sacrifice was useless  
My pleas fell on deaf ears  
So I cried in desperation  
Bowed to evil sorcery  
  
I looked to the Lord in heaven  
But he must have looked away  
My crying eyes repentant  
Please send her love to light my day  
So I cried in desperation  
Bowed to evil sorcery  
  
I sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
I sold my soul to the devil  
So I cried in desperation  
Bowed to evil sorcery  
I sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
I sold my soul to the devil  
Sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
I sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
sold my soul to the devil  
to the devil  
Sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
I sold my soul  
I sold my soul  
I sold my soul to the devil
