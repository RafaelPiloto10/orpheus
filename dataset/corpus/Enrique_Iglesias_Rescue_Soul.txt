I need you  
(oh yeah)  
I need you  
(oh yeah)  
I need you  
(oh yeah)  
How can I just let you walk away  
Just let you leave without a trace  
When I stand here taking Every breath with you.  
Standin' all alone on the bedroom floor.  
Thinkin' about it more n more  
  
Chorus- where are you staying  
Are you in the world  
i'll do anything  
for you to be my girl.  
  
Yeah where has is taken me  
Drivin' me mad  
how are you copin' without your man.  
  
Chorus (x3)
