Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Hey man  
Tell me what were you thinking?  
What the hell were you saying?  
Oh, come on now, stop and think about it  
Hey now  
Maybe you should just listen  
Maybe you should stop talking for a second  
Shut up, listen to me  
You're so obvious  
You're so oblivious  
And now you wonder why  
You're the one alone  
So don't apologize  
You don't even realize  
You screwed it up this time  
Now you're the one alone  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Hey bro  
I'm just tryin' to let you know  
You really think that you're special  
Oh, come on now, I've seen so much better  
Hey there  
Did you actually think that I cared?  
Don't know if you want to go there  
Oh, come on now, keep on, keep on dreamin?  
You're so obvious  
You're so oblivious  
And now you wonder why  
You're the one alone  
So don't apologize  
You don't even realize  
You screwed it up this time  
Now you're the one alone  
If you want to be my, uh, uh, oh  
You know you can't play games  
And you know what I mean  
Sorry, but you don't get my, my-why-why-why  
I'm gone, you're still dreaming  
About me over and over and over and over again  
You're so obvious  
You're so oblivious  
And now you wonder why  
You're the one alone  
So don't apologize  
You don't even realize  
You screwed it up this time  
Now you're the one alone  
You're so obvious  
You're so oblivious  
And now you wonder why  
You're the one alone  
So don't apologize  
You don't even realize  
You screwed it up this time  
Now you're the one alone  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Uh, uh, oh, oh, oh  
Alone
