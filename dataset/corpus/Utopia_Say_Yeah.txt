I didn't call this meeting and  
I never heard such beating around  
Around the bush and  
You can't commit to something so  
  
You won't come up with nothing at all  
Unless you're pushed  
But I wanna get this straightened out  
I'm getting tired of waiting  
  
When I say when will you lay your love down for me,  
Don't say what  
When I say why won't you put out something for me,  
Don't say what, say yeah  
  
We had a good thing going but  
We never did quite know what it was  
But it was good so  
Why don't we just start over and  
  
Maybe I can help you lower your guard  
I think we should  
But you gotta stop resisting me  
I wanna get some kissing  
  
I don't believe in magic but  
You could avert a tragedy here  
I got to say that  
I think you've got the power and  
  
You know the final hour has come  
So don't delay 'cause  
I wanna get this straightened out  
I'm getting tired of waiting
