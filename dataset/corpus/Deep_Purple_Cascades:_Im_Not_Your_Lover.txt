You know I'm not your lover now  
It might as well be said  
And then you say you're leaving  
Or maybe I'm just hanging on a thread  
When I gave you everything  
It didn't seem that much  
You gave me your opinion  
With the usual heavy handed touch  
  
What can I do  
About the rain that falls on you  
I'm not your lover now  
I'm not your lover now  
  
What can I do  
About the rain that falls on you  
I'm not your lover now  
I'm not your lover now  
  
My head is spinning endlessly  
My sense won't react  
Then I'm falling through a black hole  
Part of me is never coming back  
  
How you can lose a thing  
You never really had  
And you always hurt the one you love  
And you just love to hurt me bad  
  
What can I do  
About the rain that falls on you  
I'm not your lover now  
I'm not your lover now  
  
What can I do  
About the sky that falls on you  
I'm not your lover  
  
You really must be going now  
By god, is that the time?  
Let me put you out of my misery  
They call it being cruel to be kind  
I only insult my friends my friend  
The rest can go to hell  
You can read it anyway you want  
Oh well, you're not so bad yourself  
  
What can I do  
About the rain that falls on you  
I'm not your lover now  
I'm not your lover now
