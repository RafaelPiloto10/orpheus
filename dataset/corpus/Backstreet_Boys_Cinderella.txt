As I was walking down a  
Path in the woods one day I  
Came across a vision that caught my eye  
  
There was a lady standing  
Right there beside a well, and I heard her whisper  
What you wish for you can have  
  
Then the vision went away  
I thought that I had lost her  
The girl I had been waiting for  
I can't believe I just saw her  
She is the finest thing, I ever could imagine  
Now I want her next to me, cause I want, cause I want more  
Whoahhhh  
  
Chorus  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll always cherish  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll love forever  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
  
She is a gentle flower, she is the sun and rain and  
She could be the reason for my joy and my pain  
The first thing I see each morning, the last thing I see at night  
You know if I could have all that  
That's all I wish for in my life  
  
Why did she have to go  
What do I say to find her  
This girl is the only one  
I cannot deny her  
She's making love to my mind  
And I can't forget this feeling  
It's her voice that's calling  
It's her voice I need  
Whoahhh  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
You're all that I want  
You're all that I need  
Come back to me now  
Cinderella  
  
(Chorus Fade)
