We've been through days of thunder  
Some people say we don't belong  
They try to pull us under  
But here we stand together in the new year strong  
  
Let's get on with the show  
(Let's get started)  
Turn the lights down low  
(Turn the lights down low)  
You were there from the start  
(You were there)  
We know who you are  
And this one goes out to  
  
[Chorus]  
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone  
This one goes out to you,  
Everyone  
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done  
This one goes out to you  
  
We've been inside the circus  
We take the pleasure with the pain  
I guess there's something about us  
Whatever comes around will always stay the same  
Oh yeah  
  
Let's get on with the show  
(Oh let's get started)  
Turn the lights down low  
(Turn the lights down low)  
You were there from the start  
(You were there)  
We know who you are  
(we know who you are)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now we're minutes away  
Till it's time to play  
Our heartbeats are rising  
They're letting you in  
Time for the show to begin  
  
Here  
We're standing stronger from what you've done  
This one goes out to you, you, you  
You make us feel like we've just begun  
And this one goes out to you... yeah  
  
[Chorus: x2]
