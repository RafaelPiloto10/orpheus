People see us everywhere they all think you really care  
But myself I can't deceive I know it's only make believe  
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care  
My hopes my dreams come true my one and only you  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe  
My hopes my dreams come true my life I give for you  
My heart or wedding ring my all my everything  
My heart I can't control you lure my very soul  
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe  
My one and only prayer
