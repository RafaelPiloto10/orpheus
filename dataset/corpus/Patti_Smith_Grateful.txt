Ours is just another skin  
That simply slips away  
You can rise above it  
It will shed easily  
  
It all will come out fine  
I've learned it line by line  
One common wire  
One silver thread  
All that you desire  
Rolls on ahead  
  
Like a ship in a bottle  
Held up to the sun  
Sails ain't going nowhere  
You can count every one  
Until it crashes unto the earth  
And simply slips away  
You can hide in the open  
Or just disappear  
  
Ours is just a craving  
And a twist of the wrist  
Will undo the stopper  
With abrupt tenderness  
Die little sparrow  
And awake  
Singing  
  
It all will come out fine  
I've learned it line by line  
One common wire  
One silver thread  
All that you desire  
Rolls on ahead
