Love me tender, love me true  
Oooh baby what a song could do  
We were sharp like needles in the dark, no question mark  
My friend billy was one of a kind  
Growin' up and runnin' wild  
We could take a sunset and make it real  
We stood together on the edge of a knife  
(Fools) To be friends, brothers for life  
  
And we have seen the night run, it's a thousand miles away  
Yes we have seen the night run, it passed us by in just one day  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
Used to say well it's me and you  
Oooh we could make dreams come true  
And we put some magic in this night, oh feels so right  
Came across your photograph  
Everything was just a laugh  
Where do you go when you reach the end  
Into the night we would explode  
With hand on my heart, rules of the road  
  
[Chorus 1 x2]  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Big city lights they fade then they go  
(Along with your sense of humor, no...)  
Some people give up and lose the fight  
We could prove it night after night after...  
  
[Chorus 2 x3]
