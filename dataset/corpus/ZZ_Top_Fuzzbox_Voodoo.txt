I went down with the fuzzbox  
Grindin' a pound or two  
Say I'm down, with a fuzzbox  
Poundin' and a workin' it through  
  
And because you got fuzz  
Go on and do what you want to do  
  
I got down with a fuzzbox  
Checkin' out what it could do  
It was step-2... blue voodoo  
Fuzzed another hour or two  
  
Just do it man  
Go with yo' hand  
Once you understand  
Got to do what she wantcha to  
  
Now lay down on your hot spot  
Listen what I'm tellin' you  
Said lean down witchu hot spot  
Hit chu with the blue voodoo  
  
Just do it dude  
Everybody do  
Once it's understood  
Talkin' fuzzbox blue voodoo
