Sometimes they're in a bottle  
Sometimes a pair of high heal shoes  
Some come rolled in paper  
Some have six strings and only play the blues  
Once you meet the devil  
There's no way he'll let you be  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
Skeletons in closets  
Ghost underneath the bed  
They hide out in pictures  
And in words better left unsaid  
They hang around like perfume  
And haunt me like an ancient melody  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
[Chorus:]  
There's things I can?t leave alone  
'Cause they won't leave me alone  
What I want ain't what I need  
Still I reach for the things I crave  
Better try to runaway  
Maybe I'm afraid of being free  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
So roll one up and light it  
Pickup my old guitar  
I'm playing crossroads  
Drinkin' whiskey from the mason jar  
There's heartache at my front door  
Says she needs my company  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
There's demons chasing me  
There's demons chasing me  
  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
There's demons chasing me  
There's demons chasing me  
There's demons chasing me  
There's demons chasing me  
  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me
