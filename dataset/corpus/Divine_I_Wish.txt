I tried to get you out of my head  
  
But the more that I tried  
  
You're back in my mind again  
  
I must admit that I only got regrets  
  
Since you walked out on me  
  
Took my life my love and my happiness  
  
I'll always be thinking of you  
  
Wondering if you ever think of me too  
  
How I hope and I pray that someday  
  
I'll hold you in my arms again  
  
1 I wish that I had you in my arms again baby  
  
I'll hold you so tightly boy I can't pretend  
  
That I don't love you, don't need you  
  
The pain never ends  
  
Who's gonna love me like you do  
  
When nights are cold I can't help but shed a tear  
  
When I recall all those precious memories we shared  
  
You'd hold my hand and make me feel so safe and warm  
  
I'll tried to move on  
  
But you still have my heart and my soul  
  
I'll always be thinking of you  
  
Wondering if you ever think of me, too  
  
How I hope and I pray that someday  
  
I'll hold you in my arms again  
  
Repeat 1  
  
There will never be another you  
  
You have changed my very existence as it were  
  
Don't you know I love you more  
  
I love you more, love you more  
  
Than you'll never know  
  
Repeat 1 until fade
