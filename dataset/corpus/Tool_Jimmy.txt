What was it like to see  
The face of your own stability  
Suddenly look away  
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?  
Eleven and she was gone.  
Eleven is when we waved good-bye.  
Eleven is standing still,  
Waiting for me to free him  
By coming home.  
Moving me with a sound.  
Opening me within a gesture.  
Drawing me down and in,  
Showing me where it all began,  
Eleven.  
It took so long to realize that  
You hold the light that's been leading me back home.  
Under a dead Ohio sky,  
Eleven has been and will be waiting,  
Defending his light,  
And wondering  
Where the hell have I been?  
Sleeping, lost, and numb.  
So glad that I have found you.  
I am wide awake and heading home.  
Hold your light,  
Eleven.  
Lead me through each gentle step by step  
By inch by loaded memory.  
I'll move to heal  
As soon as pain allows so we can  
Reunite and both move on together.  
Hold your light,  
Eleven. Lead me through each gentle step by step  
By inch by loaded memory  
'Til one and one are one, eleven,  
So glow, child, glow.  
I'm heading back home.
