Hello what keeps you going  
The way we're running through these years  
I guess they're showing  
  
I don't have no clever lines  
To explain my state of mind  
Well it doesn't matter  
It's just a while since I could feel  
This song is what I need  
Like a wake up wake up call  
  
Hello what made you come here  
You defy all kinds of logic  
When you don't stay clear  
  
I don't talk the way you do  
I guess you feel the same way too  
But it doesn't matter  
We meet somewhere in between  
This song and what we need  
Like a wake up wake up call  
  
We're just laying down this track  
Guess I'll have to call you back  
But it doesn't matter  
We'll connect again one day  
An the song will find it's way  
Like a wake up wake up call
