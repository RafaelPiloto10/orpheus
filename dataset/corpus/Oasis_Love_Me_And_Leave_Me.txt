Don't believe in jesus  
don't believe in jah  
don't believe in the wars we fight  
just to prove how real we are  
  
i believe in lovers  
i believe in friends  
i believe in heaven here on earth  
'till the, the beginning ends  
  
love me and leave me  
love me and leave me  
love me and leave me  
leave me to love  
  
don't you ever tell me it came from above  
just love me and leave me  
leave me to love  
  
i believe in heroes  
i believe in stars  
i believe that we'll meet one day  
say hello in some astral bar  
  
i believe in brothers  
i know you know who you are  
here's to those who bore us  
and made us what we are  
  
love me and leave me  
love me and leave me  
love me and leave me  
leave me to love  
  
don't you ever tell me it came from above  
just love me and leave me  
leave me to love
