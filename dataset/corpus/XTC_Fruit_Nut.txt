Tending my fruit, tending my fruit  
Ah you've got to have a hobby  
A man must have a shed to keep him sane  
  
Spraying my buds, spraying my buds  
Got to keep away diseases  
I mix the poisons and the wife don't complain  
  
Some people say  
That I am out of my tree  
Or just a strawberry fool  
Someday they'll see  
'Til then I'll blow you a raspberry  
'cause apples and pears are me  
  
So I'm tending my fruit  
And I don't give a hoot  
'Cause it keeps me sane, it keeps me sane

To keep him sane, to keep him sane, yeah keeps him sane  
Yeah to keep him sane, to keep him sane, yeah it keeps him sane
