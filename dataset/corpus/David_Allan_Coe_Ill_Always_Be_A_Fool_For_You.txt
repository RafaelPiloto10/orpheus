You change just like the weather I never know if you'll be hot or cold to me  
Can't you see what I've been going through  
We belong together even though I know at times it just can't be  
Honey can't you see I'll always be a fool for you  
I'll always be the first to say I'm sorry I'll always be the last to say we're
through  
I'll always be the one to take another chance  
In this romance I'll always be a fool for you  
  
I'll always be the first to say  
I'll always be a fool for you
