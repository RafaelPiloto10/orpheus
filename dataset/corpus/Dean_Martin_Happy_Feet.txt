Sound of rain on the window pain  
Makes a mighty sweet and soft refrain  
But I never found a sound as sweet  
As the tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
Mocking bird never says a word  
But his pretty music must be heard  
Well there is no music with a beat of  
The tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
Honey when we're dancing  
It is so divine  
Count of we're much closer  
Closer than quarter to nine  
  
The band down in Dixieland  
Got a rhythm makes you clap your hand  
But there is no rhythm I repeat  
Like the tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
Tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
Tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
Honey when we're dancing  
It is so divine  
Account of we're much closer  
Closer than quarter to nine  
  
I love the band down in Dixieland  
I got a rhythm makes you clap your hand  
But there is no rhythm I repeat  
Like the tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
  
The tippity tippity tap of happy feet  
Tippity tippity tap of happy feet
