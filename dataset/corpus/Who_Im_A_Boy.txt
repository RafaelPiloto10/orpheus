One girl was called Jean Marie  
Another little girl was Felicity  
Another little girl was Sally Joy  
The other was me, and I'm a boy  
  
My name is Bill, and I'm a head case  
They practice making up on my face  
Yeah, I feel lucky if I get trousers to wear  
Spend evenings taking hairpins from my hair  
  
I'm a boy, I'm a boy  
But my ma won't admit it  
I'm a boy, I'm a boy  
But if I say I am, I get it  
  
Put your frock on, Jean Marie  
Plait your hair, Felicity  
Paint your nails, little Sally Joy  
Put on this wig, little boy  
  
I'm a boy, I'm a boy  
But my ma won't admit it  
I'm a boy, I'm a boy  
But if I say I am, I get it  
  
Want to play cricket on the green  
Ride my bike across the street  
Cut myself and see my blood  
Want to come home all covered in mud  
  
I'm a boy, I'm a boy  
But my ma won't admit it  
I'm a boy. I'm a boy  
But if I say I am, I get it
