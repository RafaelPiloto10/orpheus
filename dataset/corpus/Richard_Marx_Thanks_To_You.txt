You gave me life,  
Gave me your heart  
Your shoulder when I needed to cry  
You gave me hope when all my hope is gone  
Wings so my dreams can fly  
And I haven't told you enough  
Haven't been good enough, making you see  
  
Chorus:  
  
My love for you will live in my heart  
Until eternity's through....  
I see your smile in the eyes of my child  
I am who I am, Mama, Thanks to you  
  
You gave me your word,  
Gave me your voice  
Gave me your everything,  
Each breath of your life  
You believe when I can never have  
You teach my faith to survive  
And I never can do enough  
Never thank you enough, for all that you are  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
I know the treasure, I'm filled with grace  
Whenever I see your face  
  
(... Music....).  
  
And I see your smile in the eyes of my child  
I am who I am, Mama, Thanks to You  
To you.....
