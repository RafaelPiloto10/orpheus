You were my sun  
You were my Earth  
But I bet you didn't know all the ways I loved you  
No  
  
So you took a chance  
And made other plans  
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down  
No  
  
You don't have to say what you did  
I already know  
I found out from him  
Now there's just no chance for you and me  
You're not with me  
Don't it make you sad about it?  
  
You told me you loved me  
Why did you leave me all alone?  
Now you tell me you need me  
When you call me on the phone  
  
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused  
With some other guy  
The bridges were burned  
Now it's your turn to cry  
  
Cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
Yeah, yeah  
  
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid  
But it wasn't like you only talked to him  
And you know it (Don't act like you don't know it)  
  
All of these things people told me  
Keep messin' with my head

When you call me on the phone (Baby, call me on the phone)  
  
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused  
With some other guy (I'm not like them, baby)  
The bridges were burned  
Now it's your turn to cry (It's your turn)
