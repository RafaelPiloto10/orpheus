At any given moment on any day  
And when it does  
You personally will meet The Wraith  
Face to face  
  
Join us for The Wraith's exhibit of Shangri-La

It's the arrival the mighty 6th jokers card  
Is it the end of the world?  
Yes, it is the end of the world  
And it's also the beginning  
The beginning of a brand new saga
