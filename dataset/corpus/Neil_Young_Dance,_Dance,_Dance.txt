Never thought love  
had a rainbow on it  
Used to think a cloud  
was a nightmare  
That was up until  
I first met you  
Now I go around  
hoping you care.  
  
Dance, dance,  
feel it all around you  
Dance, dance, dance,  
Never thought love  
had a rainbow on it  
See the girl dance  
See the girl dance.  
  
Mississippi mud  
never touched her fingers  
California sand  
lies in her hand  
Love her more than life  
as the daylight lingers  
Early in the morning  
I'll be her man.  
  
Dance, dance,  
feel it all around you  
Dance, dance, dance,  
Mississippi mud  
never touched her fingers  
See the girl dance  
See the girl dance.
