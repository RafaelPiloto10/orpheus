When I awoke  
There you stood beside me  
I wonder now were you there all the time  
Like a rose beneath the snow I've been waiting  
And it took your kiss to make me come alive  
  
[Chorus]  
Sleeping heart, love is all around you  
Empty arms, what are you waiting for  
Rub your eyes your handsome prince has found you  
Sleeping heart, Sleep no more  
  
You don't have to tell me where you come from  
I loved you in my dreams a long long time  
In my slumber I kept seeing someone  
And I recognized you when your lips touched mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rub your eyes your handsome prince has found you  
Sleeping heart, sleep no more
