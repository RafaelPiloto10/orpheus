And when my drug will start to get me down  
Shes always there you know she always can be found  
And never lifted way to much on me  
She always seems to be in touch with me you see she knows  
And I am drawn to her it is as though  
I were a moth and she the candles' glow  
And when the world has got the best of me  
Shes seems to have the power to change my destiny  
I try to tell her what is on my mind  
And even though the words are hard to find she kknows  
That when she comes to me  
It is as though  
I were the earth and she new fallen snow  
And I will sing of all the things she knows  
She gives me wings with all the things she knows
