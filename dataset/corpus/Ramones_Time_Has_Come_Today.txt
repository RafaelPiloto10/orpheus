Time has come today  
Young hearts can go their way  
Can't put it off another day  
I don't care what others say  
They say we don't listen anyway  
Time has come today, hey  
  
The room has changed today  
I have no place to stay  
I'm thinking about the subway  
My love has blown away  
My tears have come and gone  
Oh Lord I got to run  
I got no home  
No, I have no home  
  
Now the time has come  
Nowhere (place) to run  
Might get burned up by the sun  
But I'll have my fun  
I've been loved, pushed (put) aside  
I've been crushed by tumbling tide  
And my soul has been psychedelicized  
  
Now the time has come  
There are things to realize  
Time has come today  
Time has come today
