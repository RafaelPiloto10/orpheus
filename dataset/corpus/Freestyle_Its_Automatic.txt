[Chorus]  
It's automatic [Repeat: x4]  
  
Girl I can see right through your false defenses  
You act as if you can ignore the sound  
My force detectors tell me your pretending  
All of your systems are about to go down  
No need to panic, I know you feel it  
If you can stand it, just dance  
I'm your mechanic, I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know the secrets to your circuitry girl  
To your diskette I have to access code  
Don't try to fight this electricity girl  
From all this power you might overload  
No need to panic, I know you feel it  
If you can stand it, just dance  
I'm your mechanic, I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girl I can see right through your false defenses  
Before you know it, I will be in control  
My force detectors tell me your pretending  
Your force repellors can no longer hold  
No need to panic, I know you feel it  
If you can stand it, just dance  
I'm your mechanic, I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's automatic baby  
It's automatic  
I realize baby  
All the things you fantasize baby  
It's in your eyes baby  
So let your body rock  
Shake that thing  
  
I'll make you wet baby  
I'll make you sweat baby  
I'm your best bet baby  
So let your body rock  
  
I know you feel it, just dance  
I know you feel it, romance  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I know you feel it, romance  
I know you feel it, just dance  
No need to panic, I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
It's automatic, I know you feel it
