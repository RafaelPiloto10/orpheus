Yes, I am blind  
No, I can't see  
The good things  
Just the bad things, oh...  
  
Yes, I am blind  
No, I can't see  
There must be something  
Horribly wrong with me?  
  
God, come down  
If you're really there  
Well, you're the one who claims to care  
  
Love's young dream  
I'm the one who shopped you  
I'm the one who stopped you  
'Cause in my sorry way I love you  
Love's young dream  
Are you sorry  
For what you've done?  
Well, you're not the only one  
And in my sorry way I love you  
  
Yes, I am blind  
But I do see  
Evil people prosper  
Over the likes of you and me  
Always  
  
God, come down  
If you're really there  
Well, you're the one who claims to care  
  
Little lamb  
On a hill  
Run fast if you can  
Good Christians, they want to kill you  
And your life has not even begun !  
You're just like me, you're just like me  
Oh, your life has not even begun !  
You're just like me, you're just like me  
And your life has not even begun !  
You're just like me, just like me  
And your life has not even begun !  
You're just like me, you're just like, just like me  
And your life has not even begun !
