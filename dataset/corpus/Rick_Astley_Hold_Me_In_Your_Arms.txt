We've been trying for a long time  
To say what we want to say  
But feelings don't come easy  
To express in a simple way  
  
But we all have feelings  
We all need loving  
And who would be the fool to say, that if you  
  
Hold me in your arms  
I won't feel better  
If you hold me in your arms  
We can brave this storm together  
  
We both know there's a problem  
A problem that we've got to face  
So put your trust in me, lover  
No-one's ever gonna take your place  
  
'Cause we all have a problem  
We all have fears  
But there's always got to be a way  
Yes we all have feelings  
We all need loving  
And you would be a fool to say, that if you  
  
Hold me in your arms  
I won't feel better  
If you hold me in your arms  
We can brave this storm together  
  
You only have to hold me  
Touch me to make me feel so good  
You only have to hold me  
Feel me  
To make me feel the way you know I should  
  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
When you gonna hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms
