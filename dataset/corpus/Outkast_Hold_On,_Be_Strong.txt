Hold on , be strong  
Take off your thong  
Cmon  
This is how we sing the song  
Sing along  
  
I come to every club with intention to do harm  
With a prosthetic arm  
And smelling like Boone Farm  
Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms  
Paranoid thief it to steal from his own mom  
Kuniving Kon  
Artis with a bomb  
Strapped to my stomach screaming  
"Let's get it on"  
A lust that love the drank  
Drunk driving a tank  
Rolling over a bank  
Cops see my and faint  
It's drastic  
And I'm passed my limit of coke  
I think I'll up my high by slitting your throat  
Push a baby carriage into the street  
Till it's minced meat  
Your men's been beat  
The minute I step foot on your street  
This is fight music  
  
Hold on , be strong  
Take off your thong  
Cmon  
This is how we sing the song  
Sing along  
  
Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders  
And scratch their dandruff  
And everybody need to quit actin hard and shit  
Before you get your ass whooped (I'll slap the fuck out ya!)  
And everybody needs somebody to love  
Before it's too late  
Its too late  
  
Hold on , be strong  
Take off your thong  
Cmon  
This is how we sing the song  
Sing along
