I treat this like my thesis  
Well-written topic, broken down into pieces  
I introduce then produce  
Words so profuse it's abuse how I juice up this beat  
Like I'm deuce, two people both equal  
Like I'm Gemini, rather Simeon  
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it  
You can't stop it, drop it  
Your whole crew's microscopic  
Like particles while I make international articles  
And on the cover  
Don't discuss the baby mother business  
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness  
First handed I'm candid  
You can't stand it, respect demanded  
And get flown around the planet  
Rock Hard like granite or steel  
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel  
And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads  
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad  
  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
  
I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest  
I wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis  
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it  
You gonna fall trying to ball  
While my team win the pennant  
I'm about to begin it  
For a minute, then run for senate  
Make a slum lord be the tenant give his money to kids to spend it  
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented  
Our survival since our arrival  
Documented in The Bible, like Moses and Aaron  
Things gon' change, it's apparent  
And all the transparent gonna  
Be seen through, let God redeem you  
Keep your deen true  
You can get the green too  
Watch out what you cling to  
Observe how a queen do  
And I remain calm reading the 73 Psalm  
'Cause with all this going on I got the world in my palm  
  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
  
Now I be breaking bread sipping  
Manichevitz wine  
Pay no mind party like it's 1999  
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine  
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind  
Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller  
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella  
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture  
Or collecting residuals from off The Score  
I'm making sure I'm with the 144  
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war  
Word to Boonie  
I makes a lot like a Sunni  
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community  
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic  
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep  
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship  
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip  
(Every time i take sips!)  
  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!  
You can get the power!  
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour!  
You can get the money!
