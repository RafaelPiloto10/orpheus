Somewhere back in time  
I was told by a friend of mine  
That I would meet someone like you  
Someday  
Well I always hoped it was true  
And I never stopped believing  
You'd come along as you did  
In just the perfect way  
Chorus:  
Days like these  
I believe  
The world's such a fine place to be  
After all here we are  
In love just you and me  
Let me take this time  
To thank you for  
Days like these  
You know there is no pot of gold  
At the end of our rainbow  
There's only love  
Simply love  
It's all that we can share  
For when we're old and gray  
And we look back on the days gone by  
We'll see the love that we shared  
Is the love we have today  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Hey, yeah, yeah  
I want to thank you baby  
Now I can't believe  
This is happening to me  
I look in your eyes  
And it's love I see  
And it's more than I thought love could be  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Days,  
Like these....
