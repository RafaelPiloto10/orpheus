[Chorus]  
Most thugs front when they get the chance (say what?)  
Some thugs hit the blunt when they get the chance (say what?)  
Live thugs stack chedder, then they make plans (say what?)  
  
I, Cool J, NY2K  
Rule milleniums with my compadres  
They tounges sway with really nothing to say  
They pack guns, but I stack funds  
I'm second to none  
My hot streak's just begun  
You want to bring beef? You got to serve it well-done  
You ran the wrong way, now you livin' on the run  
Not some, each one's a bum, every one  
Coughed up a lung, became my son  
Flames I brung, platinumn weighs a ton  
Heavy on the chest, I pitty all the rest  
I put 'em to the test  
I spit it like I'm blessed  
I testify  
I have no need to lie  
I buried many, still many want to die  
I zone out crazy, starin' don't faze me  
Got ya whole strategy shook  
It's too daisy  
  
[Chorus]  
Clack, relaod, clack, reload  
Got ya pictures sittin' in my lap  
He explode  
Duck when you hear the rat-tat-tat  
'Cause once you cross over baby, ain't no comin' back  
believe that  
I flows when I hit that  
Strive till I get that  
Never mind a set-back  
No time to wet that  
A lyrical hi-jack, you don't want to try that  
Creep wit' my CD, don't let 'em know you buy that  
One in the snips, one in the whip with the low jack  
Call a 911 to get the LL back  
Original bells, LL  
Rocked them till they fell  
Competition bailed  
Looked like mince green when mic had 'em swelled  
Wrote all them rhymes and never gonna sell  
Meanwhile, I'm countin' prezzies in the the 'tel  
And in the meanwhile, I throw my baby in Chanelle  
  
[Chorus]  
Unh, I'm lyrically hot tonight, come on  
Unh, I'm lyrically hot tonight, come on  
Layin' low to catch you on stage so I can run on  
Matter fact, you not on my level, I throw my son on  
Mission is complete, technique is unique  
Defeat the rhyme weak and mine ya knee-deep  
Rewind a rip beats and give jeeps the heat  
Even if you walkin', wit' ya walkman in the street  
Actin' gassed up, but you really on need  
How you countin' your paper kid, without a GED?  
Slow down, let me do my thing now, hold up  
Maybe that's the reason you stressed, quick to roll up  
Put the L down, picked the other LL up  
Maybe we can straighten this out before it's toe-up  
Watch me closely, boom! I'm a blow-up  
And spend the whole rest of my life stackin' dough up  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoo, Vinnie Biggs, you hot with this one, dawg  
Roundtree  
Rock The Bells  
Unh, Brian Daughtery  
Unh, all my peeps, my peeps, my peeps across the land  
Know what I mean? we gonna keep gettin' paper  
This is real  
This is real, right here  
Rock The Bells  
It's deeper than the deepest blue sea, dawg  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
I'm feelin' it like you feelin' it  
ha ha, word up  
I'm lovin' it like you lovin' it baby  
Rewind it, it's short
