I know it's hard  
In a world gone mad  
To find the truth  
To understand  
And I know it's hard  
To turn the page  
To walk the line  
To have the faith  
  
But sometimes when it's light  
And you can see  
Sometimes when this world  
Just seems to be so cold  
Sometimes when you're lost at sea  
Drowning in your pain  
Sometimes the sun shines through the rain  
  
I know it's hard  
In a world so cold  
To feel the love  
I know it's hard  
And I know it's true  
That in the end  
We all find our way  
And that's life my friend  
  
But sometimes when it's light  
And you can see  
Sometimes when this world  
Just seems to be so cold  
Sometimes when you're lost at sea  
Drowning in your pain  
Sometimes the sun shines through the rain  
  
World keeps turning  
Nothing changes  
Hope this time  
We can rearrange the stars  
It can't be that hard no  
  
Sometimes when it's light  
And you can see  
Sometimes when this world  
Just seems to be so cold  
Sometimes when you're lost at sea  
Drowning in your pain  
Sometimes the sun shines through the rain  
  
Sometimes when it's light  
And you can see  
Sometimes when this world  
Just seems to be so cold  
Sometimes when you're lost at sea  
Drowning in your pain  
Sometimes the sun shines through the rain  
  
Ooo let it shine  
Shine through the rain  
Ooo let it shine  
Shine through the rain  
Sometimes the sun shines through the rain  
Don't you know it's gonna shine yea  
Shining down on you  
Sometimes the sun shines through the rain
