There's a place in the city they call the Archway  
Where we rented three rooms for a dollar a day  
and I worked semi-skilled at the capstans for years  
And my wife was a good woman but the love disappeared  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage goes down they're the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
How I hope they can cope with the damage I've done  
I found me a band, I went out on tour  
So the kids wouldn't know I was with them no more  
When they said, "Where's me dad?" She'd say, "He's a star!"  
Oh if only stars knew what fools they all are.  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage goes down they're the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
How I hope they can cope with the damage I've done  
I got a new contract, I got a new life  
No more capstans for me and I've got a new wife  
Sometimes she gets angry, says she wants a family  
Then that nightmare returns like a ghost haunting me  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage breaks up you're the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
How I hope you all cope with the damage we done
