You say leave me alone  
And later call me on the phone  
What was I thinking then?  
Why do you not give in?  
You tell me all the time  
That I need to get in line  
What do you want from me?  
What part do you not see?  
I hear you met someone else  
And are no longer by yourself  
I guess that's good for you  
No longer will you  
Worry  
About me  
  
[Chorus:]  
But opportunity  
Is knocking at the door  
And it's coming more slowly  
Than it ever has before  
You're wasting your time  
I'm really all decided  
My mind is made up  
My head is not divided  
I want to have a victory  
No complicated history  
A simple faded memory  
Is all you could become to me  
No kind words  
No sweet things  
No insults  
And bad dreams  
Anymore  
  
It's still raining in my head  
Though good morning's poked her head  
Leaving the clock upright  
Ticking right on the wall  
How could it stop a man  
Who never could remain  
Another wasted time  
Another waste  
Did you know it  
Gone all night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to have a victory  
No complicated history  
A simple faded memory  
Is all you could become to me  
No kind words  
No sweet things  
No insults  
No bad dreams  
Anymore  
Anymore
