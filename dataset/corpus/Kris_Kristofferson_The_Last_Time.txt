Darling, the seasons are changing  
See now, the leaves, how they die  
Love needs no reason for ending  
Come kiss your baby goodbye.  
Darling, the last time you lied, was it really the last time  
Have all the tears that you cried simply dried up and gone  
All in the world you can hurt anymore is my feelings  
What ever love ever was, never lasted too long.  
Maybe the best of our life was the beautiful dreamin'  
That conscience was destined to crumble like castles of sand  
All there is left of our love is a little girl's laughter  
Let her keep making believing as long as she can.  
Now and again I still hear some old song, I don't want to  
Is it the same over there where you found your new friends  
Sometimes at night I still wake up and feel something missing  
Maybe I'll never believe in forever again.  
Darling, the seasons are changing  
See now, the leaves, how they die  
Love needs no reason for ending  
Come kiss your baby goodbye.
