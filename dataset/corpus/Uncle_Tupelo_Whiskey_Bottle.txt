Persuaded, paraded, inebriated, and down  
Still aware of everything life carries on without  
'Cause there's one too many faces with dollar sign smiles  
Got to find the shortest path to the bar for a while  
  
A long way from happiness  
In a three hour away town  
Whiskey bottle over Jesus  
Not forever, just for now  
Not forever, just for now  
  
There's a trouble around, it's never far away  
The same trouble's been around for a life and a day  
I can't forget the sound, 'cause it's here to stay  
The sound of people chasing money and money getting away  
  
A long way from happiness  
In a three hour away town  
Whiskey bottle over Jesus  
Not forever, just for now  
Not forever, just for now  
  
In between the dirt and disgust there must be
