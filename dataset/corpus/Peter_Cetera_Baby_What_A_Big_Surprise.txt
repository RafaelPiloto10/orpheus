Right before my very eyes  
I thought that you were only fakin' it  
And like before my heart was takin' it  
  
Baby what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
  
Yesterday it seemed to me  
My life was nothing more than wasted time  
But here today you've softly changed my mind  
  
Baby what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby what a big surprise  
  
Just to be alone  
Was a little more than I could take  
Then you came to stay  
Hold me in the morning  
Love me in the afternoon  
Help me find my way  
  
Baby what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby what a big surprise  
  
Baby what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby what a big surprise
