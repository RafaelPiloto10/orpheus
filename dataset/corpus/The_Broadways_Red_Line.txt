All alone again, the phone forgot to ring  
Even if it did, I doubt it would be for me  
Bedside table photographs of you, half smoked cigarettes  
Remember something too good to be true  
And you called me and told me you were home  
Watching movies with your friends  
While I sit by the phone I guess I'll have another cigarette  
I guess I'll write another song  
If I could be anything I'd be an aeroplane and then I'd fly so far away  
500 miles so that you could look at me that way  
The ceiling is so lonely when it's all that you can see  
Lying here on my back thinking of your smile  
And the next time you'll show it to me  
I can't help being jealous of your room when you're in it all alone  
And I can't help being jealous of your friends when you're having fun  
And I'm stuck here at home  
I took the el today and everything reminded me of you  
And I remember how you sat on the stairs  
Eating popsicles that turned your lips blue  
I knew it then I know it now  
My favorite dream has come true  
I love you so much and I'll never meet another like you.
