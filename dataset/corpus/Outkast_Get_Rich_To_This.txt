Chorus: Goodie Mob  
  
We peel out sideways (get rich to this)  
We do a hundred on the highways (get rich to this)  
Thank God for Friday's (get rich to this)  
Hey hey hey hey!! (get rich to this)  
We peel out sideways (get rich to this)  
We do a hundred on the highways (get rich to this)  
Thank God for Friday's (get rich to this)  
Say say say say!! (get rich to this)  
  
[Backbone]  
It'll be all slipp-ery, slick wid it  
Automatically? I'm the shit wid it  
I'm psyched out, Sic-Wid-It  
Like E-40 and The Click wid it  
He sucker mc better know about it  
I make your girlfriend hoe about it  
I make a muh'fucka know about it
