Walkin' alone at night in the cold rain  
Wond'rin if I will see you again  
In some corner light  
Runnin' down the road in the warm sun  
Dreaming that I am still the one  
Resting by your side  
  
You took the road to fortune and fame  
Your name in lights  
I want you to know I still feel the same  
Star, I still love you  
I still love you  
  
Remembering when you played me that first song  
The first show that you asked me along  
Just to be around  
Workin' so hard till you got that first break  
You said you could turn them around  
Give them something new  
  
You took the road to fortune and fame  
Your name in lights  
I want you to know I still feel the same  
Star, I still love you  
I still love you  
  
Got that photograph of you and me  
I hear your voice on the radio  
Will I ever lay with you again  
  
Nobody planned it we just seemed to drift now  
I always seem to have to leave  
Just as you come around  
But someday soon girl I just got to see  
I just gotta find out  
If we still have time  
  
You took the road to fortune and fame  
Your name in lights  
I want you to know I still feel the same  
Star, I still love you  
I still love you
