Interpolated in 1966 revival]  
  
[Frank:]  
We'll have an old-fashioned wedding  
Blessed in the good old-fashioned way  
  
I'll vow to love you forever  
You'll vow to love and honor and obey  
  
Somewhere in some little chapel  
Someday when orange blossoms bloom  
  
We'll have an old-fashioned wedding  
A simple wedding for an old-fashioned bride and groom  
  
[Annie:]  
I wanna wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls  
A lot of ushers in tailcoats, reporters and photographers  
  
A ceremony by a bishop who will tie the knot and say  
"Do you agree to love and honor?" Love and honor, yes, but not obey  
  
I wanna wedding ring surrounded by diamonds in platinum  
A big reception at the Waldorf with champagne and caviar  
  
I wanna wedding like the Vanderbilts have, ev'rything big, not small  
If I can't have that kind of a wedding I don't wanna get married at all  
  
[Coda:]  
  
[Frank:]  
We'll have an old-fashioned wedding  
  
[Annie:]  
If it's not a big wedding I don't wanna get married at all
