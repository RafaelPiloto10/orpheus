My head won't leave me crying  
And I lay this one  
She won't give me happy  
As I lie here alone  
My own will give you baby  
  
Call again  
Let me be the number  
You lead me away again  
It was anything I need to  
Find my way through this sand [?]  
My baby lead my head away  
And calling by my head.  
  
Boy  
When you away we go  
Sending me crawling back over  
And crawl back to say  
  
My head, my head won't rely  
On the troubles today  
And my leave my head in worry  
Like the summer rolls  
My own won't leave me happy  
Don't make me give it back  
And on we will go  
  
And have you called me there way before  
And I leave this song with you  
Feeling colder  
Than I ever have  
She won't be my lady  
And some of you fall  
  
And I give you happy  
Fools you know  
My mind is wide and away  
And for well it's gone  
And only leave me happy  
You wouldn't make me fall  
  
And when we call  
Maybe, baby say  
And you call  
I don't know again  
Say too much...
