Hard living, every day of my life  
Hard living, every night on the wine  
  
Never givin', any one any time  
Always losin', all I had all the time  
  
Yes I'm a selfish kinda man  
All I need is a helping hand  
  
Bad loser, never had anyone  
Bad chooser, never owed never won  
  
Fast mover, everyday on the run  
Never knowing, if I feel or I'm done  
  
Hard living, every day of my life  
Hard drinking, every night on the wine
