Once I had a little game  
I liked to crawl back in my brain  
I think you know the game I mean  
Well, I mean the game called 'Go insane'  
Now you should try this little game  
Just close your eyes, forget your name  
Forget the world, forget the people  
And we'll erect a different steeple  
This little game is fun to do  
Just close your eyes, no way to lose  
And I'm right here, I'm going too  
Release control, we're breaking through
