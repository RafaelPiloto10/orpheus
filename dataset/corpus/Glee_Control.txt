This is a story about control,  
My control,  
Control of what I say,  
Control of what I do  
And this time I'm gonna do it my way  
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do,  
Are we ready?  
I am, 'cause it's all about control  
and I've got lots of it  
  
When I was seventeen, I did what people told me, uh  
I did what my father said, and let my mother mold me  
But that was a long ago  
  
I'm in (control), never gonna stop  
(Control) to get what I want  
(Control) I got to have a lot  
(Control) and now I'm all grown up  
  
First time I fell in love  
I didn't know what hit me  
So young and so naive  
I thought it would be easy  
But now I know I've got to take  
(Control) I know I've got a lot  
(Control) to get what I want  
(Control) I'm never gonna stop  
(Control) and now I'm all grown up  
  
That's right, I'm on my own,  
I'll call my own shots, thank you  
  
Got my own mind,  
I wanna make my own decisions,  
When it has to do with my life, my life  
I wanna be the one in control  
  
So let me take you by the hand  
And lead you on this dance  
Cause what I've got is because I took a chance  
I don't wanna rule the world  
Just wanna run my life  
So make your life a little easier  
When you get the chance just take control  
(Control) never got a lot  
(Control) to get what I want  
(Control) I'm never gonna stop  
(Control) now I'm all grown up  
  
Free at last, out here on my own oh, yeah  
Now control this  
That's right, get my own mind  
Gotta make my own decisions  
When it has to do with my life  
I wanna be the one in control
