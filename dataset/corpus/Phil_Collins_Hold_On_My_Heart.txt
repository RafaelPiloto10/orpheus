Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
We both know we've been here before  
We both know what can happen  
  
Hold on my heart  
Cos I'm looking over you shoulder  
Please don't rush in this time  
Don't show her how you feel  
  
Hold on my heart  
Throw me a lifeline  
I'll keep a place for you  
Somewhere deep inside  
  
Hold on my heart  
Please tell her to be patient  
Cos there has never been a time  
That I wanted something more  
  
If I can recall this feeling  
And I know there's a chance  
Oh I will be there  
Yes I will be there  
Be there for you  
Whenever you want me to  
Whenever you call I will be there  
Yes I will be there  
  
Hold on my heart  
Don't let her see you crying  
No matter where I go  
She'll always be with me  
  
Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
We both know we've been here before  
We both know what can happen  
So hold on my heart
