"he did, he observed Saturday as the sabbath"  
"what, what kind of faith does that make him?"  
"Uh, he didn't have one"  
"oh, O-K"  
"He didn't believe in any one thing,  
he would go out on the street and all the kids would play the  
with a drum like thing, some kind of an instrument, yeah,  
and mama played the organ.  
she had a organ and she played that and she got a real big kick out of it."  
  
Oh Ozilline  
The moon is almost full  
And you don't need a torchlight  
To see into these woods  
Now sister bring the medicine  
To keep you from decline  
But it's the waxing and the waining  
That's always on your mind  
  
[Chorus]  
I said, oh Ozilline  
(Oh Ozilline)  
I feel for you  
I said, oh Ozilline  
(Oh Ozilline)  
I feel for you  
  
As soon as the corn's in  
The deer will come to feed  
And when the berry ripens  
The bird will come to eat  
You build by the river  
It's pretty but you'll pay  
'Cause the springtime brings the flood plain  
And your cutbank washes away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I had to put the dog down  
Before I hit the road  
Yeah I watched that sweet old life  
Become a bag of bones  
So when you're body's broken  
And your heart wants to give in  
And you hear that hoot owl callin'  
Just like she was a friend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said Ozilline she don't let you cry  
If you ask her where it hurts  
I said Ozilline she don't let you cry  
If you ask her where it hurts  
She said what a blessed sky
