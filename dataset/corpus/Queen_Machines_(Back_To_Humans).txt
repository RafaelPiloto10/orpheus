Machines  
  
It's a machines world  
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul  
When the machines take over  
It ain't no place for rock and roll  
  
They tell me I don't care  
But deep inside I'm just a man  
They freeze me they burn me  
They squeeze me they stress me  
With smoke blackened pistons of steel they compress me  
But no one but no one but no one can wrest me away  
Back to humans  
  
We have no disease no trouble of mind  
No thank you or please no regard for the time  
We never cry we never retreat  
We have no conception of love or defeat  
  
What's that machine noise?  
It's bytes and megachips for tea  
It's that machine boys  
With random access memory  
Never worry never mind  
Not for money not for gold  
  
It's software is hardware  
It's heartbeat is time-share  
It's midwife's a disc drive  
It's sex life is quantised  
It's self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised  
  
Back to humans  
Back to humans  
  
Back to machines  
Machines  
  
Living in a new world  
Thinking in the past  
Living in a new world  
How you gonna last?  
Machine world  
  
Back to humans  
  
It's a machines world  
Thinking in the past (back to humans)  
Living in a new world  
How you gonna last?  
Machine world  
  
It's a machine's world  
  
Back to humans  
Living in a new world  
How you gonna last?  
Machine world  
It's a machine's world
