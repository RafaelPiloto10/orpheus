Laughing in a crown of jewels,  
Numbness from a sceptors wound.  
Toss and Turn, I spin and learn,  
"Catch yourself before you burn."  
A joker's dance before the king,  
Jangling beads, a silver ring.  
Close your eyes and bare the sound,  
Jumping up, falling down.  
  
Falling, falling, falling, falling down.  
Look yourself in the eye before you drown.  
  
Royal rebels discover you.  
Trust? you turn there is no truth.  
And circle, circle, why are you scared?  
Why a smile instead of tears?  
I'm gulping smoke to fade away.  
Figures floating down to lay.  
Meet the joker and the thief,  
The king and queen but, no relief.  
  
Falling, Falling, Falling, Falling down.  
Look yourself in the eye before you drown.  
  
"the king is in the Falling, Falling, Falling, Falling down.  
Counting house, Look yourself in the eye before you drown.  
Counting out his  
Money"  
  
"the queen is in Falling, Falling, Falling, Falling down.  
Her parlour, eating Look yourself in the eye before you drown.  
Bread and honey"  
  
"Mary had a little lamb"  
  
I cross myself before I die  
The leaping man, he asks me, "why?"  
"well your rhythm is off" I reply,  
"Now you must dance the dance  
That you imply!"  
"Your actions will follow you full circle round,  
Your actions will follow you full circle round,  
Your actions will follow you full circle round,  
Your actions will follow you full circle round,  
The higher the leap, I said
