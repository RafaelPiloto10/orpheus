Boy:  
I could stay awake just to hear you breathing,  
Watch you smile while you are sleeping,  
While you're far away and dreaming,  
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender,  
I could stay lost in this moment forever,  
When every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure,  
  
Boy (with the vocalizing choir):  
I don't wanna close my eyes,  
I don't wanna fall asleep,  
'Cause I'd miss you babe,  
And I don't wanna miss a thing,  
'Cause even when I dream of you,  
The sweetest dream would never do,  
I'd still miss you babe,  
And I don't wanna miss a thing.  
  
Boy:  
Lying close to you,  
Feeling your heart beating,  
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming,  
Wondering if it's me you're seeing,  
And then I kiss your eyes,  
And thank God we're together,  
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever,  
  
Boy (with the vocalizing choir):  
I don't wanna close my eyes,  
I don't wanna fall asleep,  
Cause I'd miss you babe,  
And I don't wanna miss a thing,  
'Cause even when I dream of you,  
The sweetest dream would never do,  
I'd still miss you babe,  
And I don't wanna miss a thing.  
  
Boy:  
And I don't wanna miss one smile,  
I don't wanna miss one kiss,  
I just wanna be with you,  
Right here with you, just like this,  
Well I just wanna hold you close,  
And feel your heart so close to mine,  
And just stay here in this moment,  
For all the rest of time

I don't wanna close my eyes,  
I don't wanna fall asleep,
