They shut down the mine last summer, we're gettin' by on welfare  
It's Christmas Eve, I'm walkin' home, not a dollar to my name  
Night is almost on me, a night I'm almost dreading  
No store bought gifts to open, but there'll be Christmas just the same  
  
It's just another ho-omemade Christmas i-in Kentucky  
Just odds and ends I fashioned with my hear-eart and with my hands  
It's just another ho-omemade Christmas i-in Kentucky  
Our fine and fancy homemade love, God's precious gi-ift from up above  
Make up the homemade Christmas of this poor Kentucky man  
  
There's a brand new Barlow knife with a shiny wooden handle  
Gleamin' in the window down at Galen Johnson's store  
My wide eyed little Billy Boy, his face pressed to the window  
Too young for understandin' what it means to be so poor  
  
It's just another ho-omemade Christmas i-in Kentucky  
Just odds and ends I fashioned with my heart and with my hands  
It's just another ho-omemade Christmas i-in Kentucky  
Our fine and fancy homemade love, God's precious gi-ift from up above  
Make up the homemade Christmas of this poor Kentucky man  
  
Little Linda ain't no baby, hell she turns thirtee-een in April  
She's been dreamin' about that dolly in the window for half her life  
She's old enough to realise that it ain't never comin'  
I'd damn near rob a bank to get that doll and Billy's knife  
  
It's just another ho-omemade Christmas i-in Kentucky  
Just odds and ends I fashioned with my hear-eart and with my ha-ands  
It's just another ho-omemade Christmas i-in Kentucky  
Our fine and fancy homemade love, God's precious gi-ift from up above  
Make up the homemade Christmas of this poor Kentucky man  
  
It's just an
