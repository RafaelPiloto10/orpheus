I want to stand upon a rock, and watch the river flow  
With the blue sky above me and the valley down below.  
I want to hold my head up high, and listen to the wind  
Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again  
  
I want to sing the kind of songs that my dad sang to me,  
And try to be the man he hoped that I would be  
He said you only get one chance, you'd better do the best you can,  
Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again.  
  
I want to wear my Sunday coat, and hold your hand in mine,  
And hear you say you'll love me until the end of time.  
I want to find forever in every moment that we spend,  
Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again.  
  
I want to wear my Sunday coat  
And hold your hand in mine  
And hear you say you'll love me  
Until the end of time  
  
I want to stand upon a rock, like I did when I was young,  
And hold you close beside me, and watch our children run  
Cause you only get one chance to listen to th wind,  
And when it's gone, it won't be back again  
We only get one chance, so listen to the wind,  
Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again.
