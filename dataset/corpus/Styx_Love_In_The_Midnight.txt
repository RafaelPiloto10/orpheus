The time is now to take my wares to the street  
And I know how, the street's been good to me  
Maybe it's the sign of a wise man  
Maybe it's the sign of a fool  
Maybe it's the night for a rendezvous with a woman like you  
  
It's gone too far, I'll take my life into the streets  
I feel the need and I can't stop myself  
Maybe it's time to be a strong man  
Maybe it's time to be cool  
Maybe I'll take to the boulevard  
Where there's nothing I won't do  
  
Can you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love in the midnight  
There's a burning in my body  
And I'm looking for love in the midnight  
  
Better hold on tight, I'm a ravenous man  
I'll tell you anything to make you think I'm alright  
You know the moonlight brings out the devil in me  
For tomorrow, I'll regret it in the daylight  
  
Can you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love in the midnight  
Won't you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love  
  
Better hold on tight, I'm a ravenous man  
I'll tell you anything to make you think I'm alright  
You know the moonlight brings out the devil in me  
For tomorrow, I'll regret it in the daylight  
  
Can you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love in the midnight  
There's a burning in my body  
And I'm looking for love in the midnight  
Won't you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love
