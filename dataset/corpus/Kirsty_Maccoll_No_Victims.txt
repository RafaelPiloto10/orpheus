(kirsty maccoll)  
I must have been driving all day  
But I'm getting no further away  
All these towns look the same  
And the rain is falling in my eyes  
Take me away  
See all my friends for a day  
It's strange but it's true  
I'm no longer hurting without you  
I'm no victim to pity and cry for  
And you're not someone I'd lay down and die for  
I was seeing the world through your eyes  
There was not much left not to despise  
It's a shame but it's true  
I started to feel things like you do  
But I'm not tearing my heart out for you dear  
And when you wake up I won't even be here  
Sod all your funny little ways  
They don't make me laugh these days any more  
I'm no victim to pity and cry for  
Or some sad lonely encounter the night before  
I'm no victim to pity and cry for  
From some sad desperate collision the night before  
No I'm not tearing my heart out for you dear  
And when you wake up I'll be miles away from here  
Baby, I know
