Way down in Alabama  
There's a girl just a waitin' for me  
She don't have to worry  
She don't have to hurry  
Lord, I keep her so happy  
She's my sugar baby  
Sugar, sugar baby  
Sugar baby  
Sugar, sugar baby  
Lordy, Lordy pretty mama  
Yes you're tough enough  
Lordy, Lordy mama  
Go on and strut your stuff  
My sugar baby  
Sugar, sugar baby  
Sugar baby  
Sugar baby  
You know this love  
Is gonna keep on gettin' stronger  
You know my love  
Is gonna last you longer  
Sugar baby  
Sugar, sugar baby  
Sugar baby  
Sugar, sugar baby  
Sugar baby  
Sugar, sugar baby  
Sugar baby  
Sugar, sugar baby  
You know this love  
Is gonna keep on gettin' stronger  
You know my love  
Is gonna last you longer  
Sugar baby  
Sugar, sugar baby  
Sugar baby  
Sugar baby
