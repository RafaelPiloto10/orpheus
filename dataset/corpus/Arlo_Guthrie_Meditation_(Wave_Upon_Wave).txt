Loving in golden temples, my love  
Is flowing on heavenly seas  
The silent commands and heard throughout the lands  
And are weaving his patterns with ease  
  
All of the beautiful mountains beyond  
Can surely not tempt me to stay  
Even my musical melody thoughts  
Are memories in yesterday  
  
Wave upon wave of life within me  
Give me the strength to go on  
Wave after wave of love all around me  
Give me the time to catch on  
  
Wave upon wave of life within me  
Give me the strength to go on  
Wave after wave of love all around me  
Give me the time to catch on  
  
[Repeat all]
