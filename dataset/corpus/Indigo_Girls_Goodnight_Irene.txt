Sometimes I live in the country  
Sometimes I live in the town  
Sometimes I take a great notion  
To jump in the river and drown  
  
Irene goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams  
  
Last saturday night I got married  
Me and my wife settled down  
Me and my wife parted  
Think I'll take another walk downtown  
  
Irene goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams  
  
I love irene God knows I do  
Ill love her all my life  
If irene should ever leave me  
Ill take morphine and die  
  
Irene goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams  
  
Stop your rambling stop your gambling  
Stop staying out late at night  
Come home to your wife and family  
Sit by the fireside bright  
  
Irene goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams  
  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams
