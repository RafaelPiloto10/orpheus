The moment that we met  
There was something so familiar  
I felt like I'd known you for a thousand years  
And there inside your eyes  
I saw a light that I'd been missing  
  
Somewhere deep inside  
All of the lonely disappeared  
And, baby, now you're here  
I feel like I have found  
  
[Chorus]  
A long lost friend  
That I've lived for all my life  
A gentle hand  
A part of me I've been trying to find  
And now you're here  
And the search comes to an end  
I've found my long lost friend  
  
Every move I make  
Is to the rhythm of your heartbeat  
Every single breath you take  
You take with me  
  
Oh, I ask myself  
How did I ever live before you?  
You came into my life  
And put all the pieces into place  
When I saw your face  
I knew that I had found  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a storm out of the blue  
Love rained down on me and you  
So complete and so unexpectedly  
Like a movie in my mind  
I've seen a hundred times  
I feel like, I've loved you before  
Long lost friend.  
  
Now you're here  
And the search comes to an end!  
  
Long lost friend  
That I've lived for all my life  
A gentle hand  
You're a part of me I was dying to find  
And now you're here  
And the search comes to an end  
I've found my long lost friend  
I've found my long lost friend  
  
Oh, now I've found you  
My lost friend oh
