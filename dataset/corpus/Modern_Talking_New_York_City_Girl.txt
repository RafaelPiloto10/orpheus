She's living in east wood, in flat 65  
She hasn't that money, to live a good life  
And she just can't wait, to Saturday night  
In New York, New York, New York  
She working from Monday, 'til Friday night  
She hasn't that money to live on eastside  
And she just can't wait 'til it's Saturday night  
See all the city the city lights  
In New York, New York, New York  
  
[Chorus: ]  
New York city girl, the girl is mine  
New York city girl, give her some time  
New York city girl, oh here she comes  
New York city girl, oh she wants fun  
She's a New York city lover, New York is the place to go  
And I swear there is no other, and no better place I know  
  
Oh on lower east side, she's working 'til 5  
She's working so hard, she has to survive  
And she just can't wait, to Saturday night  
In New York, New York, New York  
On 5th avenue, she look for her dreams  
They are so far, but sometimes it seems  
She lives her life, just on her own  
She need the city, that's her home  
In New York, New York, New York
