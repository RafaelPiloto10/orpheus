I'd gladly lose me to find you  
I'd gladly give up all I had  
To find you I'd suffer anything and be glad  
  
I'd pay any price just to get you  
I'd work all my life and I will  
To win you I'd stand naked, stoned and stabbed  
  
I'd call that a bargain  
The best I ever had  
The best I ever had  
  
I'd gladly lose me to find you  
I'd gladly give up all I got  
To catch you I'm gonna run and never stop  
  
I'd pay any price just to win you  
Surrender my good life for bad  
To find you I'm gonna drown an unsung man  
  
I'd call that a bargain  
The best I ever had  
The best I ever had  
  
I sit looking 'round  
I look at my face in the mirror  
I know I'm worth nothing without you  
And like one and one don't make two  
One and one make one  
And I'm looking for that free ride to me  
I'm looking for you  
  
I'd gladly lose me to find you  
I'd gladly give up all I got  
To catch you I'm gonna run and never stop  
  
I'd pay any price just to win you  
Surrender my good life for bad  
To find you I'm gonna drown an unsung man  
  
I'd call that a bargain  
The best I ever had  
The best I ever had
