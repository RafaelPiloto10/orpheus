Since you're not worth my love  
I haven't given up  
I'm stronger than that  
(I'm stronger than that)  
And though my heart will break  
I'm takin' back my faith  
Cos right now my world is spinnin' too fast  
But you won't be the end of me  
If you were the one you wouldn't hurt me so bad  
You gave me the world  
  
Gave me the world to take it all away  
All you left me was yesterday  
And this space in my heart  
Now it's slowly tearin' me apart  
I'm takin' all that I learned from you  
I'll make it something I'll never do  
I can't be who you are  
You taught me how to break a heart  
You taught me how to break a heart  
  
I'll make it through this pain  
My dreams won't call your name  
I'm stronger than that  
(I'm stronger than that)  
Cos I still know how to love  
Know that will be enough  
And this moment will fade into the past  
You won't be the end of me  
If you were the one you wouldn't hurt me so bad  
You gave me the world  
  
Gave me the world to take it all away  
All you left me was yesterday  
And this space in my heart  
Now it's slowly tearing me apart  
I'm takin' all that I learned from you  
I'll make it something I'll never do  
I can't be who you are  
You taught me how to break a heart  
You taught me how to break a heart  
  
I'm takin' all that I learned from you  
I'll make it something I'll never do  
I can't be who you are  
You taught me how to break a heart  
You taught me how to break a heart  
  
I'm taking back my faith  
I'm taking back my life  
I don't care for who you are  
Cos you taught me how to break a heart  
How to break a heart  
How to break a heart  
Cos you taught me how to break a heart
