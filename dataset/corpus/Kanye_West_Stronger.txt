Cause I can't wait much longer

Cause I can't get much wronger  
Man I've been waiting all night now  
That's how long I been on ya  
I need you right now!

You could be my black Kate Moss tonight  
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight  
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?  
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior  
Damn, they don't make em like this anymore  
I ask, cause I'm not sure:  
Do anybody make real shit anymore?  
Bow in the presence of greatness  
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us  
You should be honored by my lateness  
That I would even show up to this fake shit  
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit  
Specially on my Pastel, on my Bape shit  
Act like you can't tell who made this  
New Gospel homey - take 6. And take this, haters

I don't know if you got a man or not  
If you made plans or not  
God put me in the plans or not  
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot  
But I know that God put you in front of me  
So how the hell could you front on me?  
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me  
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?  
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night  
So we gonna do everything that Kan like  
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike  
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke  
And she'll do anything for the limelight  
And will do anything when the time's right  
Uh, baby you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)
