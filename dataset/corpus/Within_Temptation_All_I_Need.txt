I'm dying to catch my breath  
Oh why don't I ever learn?  
I've lost all my trust,  
Though I've surely tried to turn it around  
  
Can you still see the heart of me?  
All my agony fades away  
When you hold me in your embrace  
  
Don't tear me down for all I need  
Make my heart a better place  
Give me something I can believe  
Don't tear me down  
You've opened the door now, don't let it close  
  
I'm here on the edge again  
I wish I could let it go  
I know that I'm only one step away  
From turning it around  
  
Can you still see the heart of me?  
All my agony fades away  
When you hold me in your embrace  
  
Don't tear me down for all I need  
Make my heart a better place  
Give me something I can believe  
  
Don't tear it down, what's left of me  
Make my heart a better place  
  
I tried many times but nothing was real  
Make it fade away, don't break me down  
I want to believe that this is for real  
Save me from my fear  
Don't tear me down  
  
Don't tear me down for all I need  
Make my heart a better place  
Don't tear me down for all I need  
Make my heart a better place  
  
Give me something I can believe  
Don't tear it down, what's left of me  
Make my heart a better place  
Make my heart a better place
