I survived, everything  
I have tried, everything (everything, everything)  
  
All the walls begin to devolve away  
Do your hands begin to shake shake shake shake shake?  
And just who do you think you used to be?  
All beings to burn to break to break to break  
  
Wave goodbye, wish me well  
I've become, something else (something else, something else, just as well)  
  
But this thing that lives inside of me  
Will surely rise awake awake awake awake awake  
And the sead that brekas right through to me  
And it comes to grab and take and take and take and take  
  
I am home, I believe  
I am home, I am free  
I am home, I can see  
Always here, finally  
  
I am home, I believe  
I am home, I am free
