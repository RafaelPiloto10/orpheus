(instrumental intro)  
Don't you really love her, don't you really care  
You've been looking forever, how did she get you there  
In the middle of madness, when all has gone  
In the middle of madness, she walks, she breathes babylon  
Isn't she so pretty, isn't she so fine  
Haven't you been blessed to hold her all the time  
In the middle of madness, when all has gone  
In the middle of madness, she walks, she breathes babylon  
(can't figure out this part)  
(instrumental)  
Have you found a heaven, try to see the worth,  
Looking at the future, she's right here on earth  
In the middle of madness, when all has gone  
In the middle of madness, she walks, she breathes babylon  
In the middle of madness, when all has gone  
In the middle of madness, she walks, she breathes babylon  
(fade out)
