Rain rain come on down  
You're so welcome at my door  
Come on down and ease the pain  
I never hurt this bad before  
  
Tears keep falling from my eyes  
And all I do is walk the floor  
It's not too hard to realize  
There's not much love here anymore  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
Rain rain come blowin' in  
Come wash these tears away again  
Leavin' has cut me to the core  
There's not much love here anymore
