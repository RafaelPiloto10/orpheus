Rebirtha strolling 'cross the street  
Juggling keys to a small red car  
Butterflies and bombs fly close  
Like she's some Disney movie star  
  
Sipping hopes and loneliness  
Since the big leagues left us dry  
Birtha, rebirtha sing a sad song  
Soothe these troubled times  
  
First time  
It's not the first time  
Last time  
No, I know I seen your place before  
Maybe in a past life  
Or maybe it was just last night  
I don't know  
  
Birtha never sang too well  
But her stereo shook glass  
Leather gripped our bodies  
As her toes curled around the gas  
  
Shaking loose out of Kansas  
First twenty minutes in black-and-white  
Birtha, rebirtha, talk to me, take to me  
Ease these troubled times  
  
Won't ever talk too much  
She had those television eyes  
My gaze never strayed too much  
Too much past those eyes  
  
She said, "I know a town where real life's a game  
Baseball's all that's real  
At night all the faces light up  
As the players take the field"  
  
First time  
It's not the first time  
Last time  
No, I know I seen your place before  
Maybe in a past time  
Maybe it was just last night  
Don't just know

Since the big leagues left us dry  
Birtha, rebirtha, sweet-talk talk 'em  
Soothe these troubled times  
  
Birtha never ever talked too much  
Had those television eyes  
Said, "We act like what we watch  
Like what we act out most the time"  
  
"Gonna take you to a town  
Where real life's a game  
Baseball is really real  
At night all the spirits lighten up  
As the heroes take the hill"  
  
First time  
It's not the first time
