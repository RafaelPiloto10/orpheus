She comes on like a rose  
And everybody knows  
She'll get you in dutch  
Well you can look but you'd better not touch  
  
Poison Ivy, Poison Ivy  
Well late at night when you're sleepin'  
Poison Ivy comes a creepin' all around  
  
She's pretty as a daisy  
But look out man she's crazy  
She'll really do you in  
If you let her get under your skin  
  
Poison Ivy, Poison Ivy  
Well late at night when you're sleepin  
Poison Ivy comes a creepin' all around  
  
Measles make mumpy  
Mumps'll make you lumpy  
Chicken pox will make you jump and twitch  
Common cold'll cool you  
Whooping cough will fool you  
But Poison Ivy Lord will make you itch  
  
You're gonna need an ocean ah  
Of Calamine lotion ah  
You'll be scratching like a hound  
The minute you start to mess around  
  
Poison Ivy, Poison Ivy  
Well late at night when you're sleepin'  
Poison Ivy comes a creepin' all around  
  
La-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la
