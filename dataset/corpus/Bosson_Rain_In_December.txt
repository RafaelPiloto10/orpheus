There are things that I regret  
There are things I can't forget  
There are things that believe  
Through the hints that I receive  
I'm not giving up not yet...  
  
So many things I wanna say  
But words are getting in my way  
So many things I wanna do  
I can make it up to you  
I believe we'll find a way  
  
Cause  
Sometimes it rains in december  
(we all know that)  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
(Don't you know that)  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that I'll never surrender...  
  
Can I get it through to you  
In spite the stupid things I do  
I never meant to say those words  
Wanna see you though it hurts  
Wish that we could talk it through  
  
I try to call you on the phone  
Just to see if you're at home  
I try to find the words to say  
How I miss you everyday  
Baby please pick up the phone...  
  
Cause  
Sometimes it rains in december...  
(we all know that)  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
(Don't you know that)  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that I'll never surrender...
