Give me an old fashioned Christmas, an old fashioned Christmas  
Family faces, wide open spaces, covered with snow  
Right now my mom there in the kitchen, basting the Christmas bird  
You'll have to take my word, you can't find that at the automat  
An old fashioned fireplace, give me an old fashioned fireplace  
My heart remembers smoldering embers, warming your glow  
I'd trade that whole Manhattan skyline, the shimmering steel and chrome  
For one old fashioned Christmas back home
