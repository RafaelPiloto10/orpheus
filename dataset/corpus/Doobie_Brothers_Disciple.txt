Night time, I jumped back in the alley  
Saw a shadow closin' in  
And blue smoke all around the figure  
A knife blade flashing grim  
I made my move to get away  
Seems like nowhere to run  
All of a sudden I was blinded by a flash  
Devil of a man with a gun  
You gotta believe it  
Now let me outta here  
Lightnin', it crackled all around me  
Storm clouds are movin' in  
The blue smoke cleared so fast around me  
The strange hunter's gone again  
I looked up to see what had happened  
There he stood in front of me  
He had a silver cape and eyes of red  
With a button down Limousine  
Man I gotta get away, gotta get away  
Lightnin', it crackled all around me  
Storm clouds are movin' in  
The blue smoke cleared so fast around me  
The strange hunter's gone again  
I looked up to see what had happened  
There he stood in front of me  
He had a silver cape and eyes of red  
With a button down Limousine  
Oh oh
