I'm not waiting for the answers  
On a Sunday afternoon  
I'm just too drunk to remember  
Why I always slip through  
  
The drugs and fake ambition  
Have been helping me to hide  
But it's the endless television  
That has kept me inside  
  
Where does it stop?  
Where does it end?  
Where do we go?  
Why am I always complaining?  
  
I can be good  
I can be bad  
I can be loved  
  
But everything's gone black  
You're looking for that sun  
You're looking for that light  
Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way  
  
Black, you're looking for that sun  
You're looking for that light  
Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way  
  
Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie  
  
I'm not asking for forgiveness  
For the things that I don't know  
But I'm really not that different  
You just made me think so  
  
Where does it stop?  
Where does it end?  
Where do we go?  
Why am I always complaining?  
  
I can be good  
I can be bad  
I can be loved  
  
But everything's gone black  
You're looking for that sun  
You're looking for that light  
Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way  
  
Black, you're looking for that sun  
You're looking for that light  
Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way  
  
Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie  
  
Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie..  
Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie..  
Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie  
Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie  
You're the big green monkey, everyone's a junkie  
  
Black  
You're looking for that sun  
You're looking for that light  
Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way  
  
Black, you're looking for that sun  
You're looking for that light  
Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way  
And I'll remember this someday  
  
Black, you're looking for that sun  
You're looking for that light  
Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way  
  
Black, you're looking for that sun  
You're looking for that light  
Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way  
  
Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie
