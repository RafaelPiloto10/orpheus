Of all the people in this world, why you and I  
With lovers here and everywhere we don't care enough to try  
Why couldn't all the hurt we're feeling now have passed us by  
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?  
  
And of all the hearts in all the world, why yours and mine  
There's so many places love could die, we must leave the earth for a time  
Oh, but it's in our hearts and it's in our bed and it's even in your eyes  
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?  
  
Somewhere out there there's lovers who want to be free  
Why couldn't love have died with them instead of here with you and me  
Oh, but it's pitiful how all these tears won't bring it back to life  
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?  
  
Oh, but it's pitiful how all these tears won't bring it back to life  
  
Oh, couldn't love have picked a better place to die?
