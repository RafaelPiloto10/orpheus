I wanna get deeper  
Deeper than skin  
I wanna be more than  
just another friend  
  
I'm ready to love you  
with all of my heart  
But I won't give it if you  
can't do your part  
  
[Chorus]  
A little bit just ain't it  
Give me all  
A little love is not enough  
Give me all  
  
Need your lovin'  
Need your kissin'  
Don't want nothin'  
To be missin'  
  
You're givin' me portions  
You wanna move fast  
What you're giving  
Is never gonna last  
  
I wanna be closer  
I need to have more  
'Cause I'm gonna love you  
like no one before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Need your lovin'  
Need your kissin'  
Don't want nothin'  
To be missin'  
  
I'm on fire babe  
You wanna build me up  
Just to let me down
