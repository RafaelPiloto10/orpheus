Here I come  
Force like a vector, radar detector,  
Abandon you cause I'm a defector  
Loyalty reflective, crooked lie objective,  
Never trust you cause you are deceptive  
Base burned sample, lyrics are ample,  
Don't step to me cause you I will trample  
Mainstream averted, tracker inserted,  
Found something pure, but it was perverted  
  
If I ever got a chance, should I swing  
Step to the side, swallow your pride,  
Ignorance breeds more laws to abide  
Ideal in your mind, expectation defined,  
Picture distorted and you claim what is mine  
Battle like war, chaos in store,  
Money and power always glorify gore  
Needless tradition, chose my position,  
Sprang like a lion to meet opposition  
  
Third verse and I'm gonna burst a new topic  
Don't come to front cause you know I'll say stop it  
Money you're a liar, printed on a flier  
Turned my back on you and you said fire  
All shapes on the wall fall to form one quote  
Check out the note that I wrote  
And the hip hop hordes that have always been born on the street  
Degenerate me  
  
Here comes my chance should I swing
