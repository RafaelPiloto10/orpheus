If it?s good to complicate then both of us are doing fine  
Just keep your eyes on your part and leave me alone to mine  
If it?s good to instigate, we're a fast horse, bet on us  
I'm not calling you an animal, I think we just fight too much  
Come on, in spite of this we're doing just fine  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Give us time to shine  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Both aligned in frame of mind but circumstance got us good  
And now you're seeing a side of me I wished no one ever would  
Yeah, if it?s right to pick a fight, we're fingers in a sugar bowl  
Love isn't perfect, even diamonds start out as coal  
Hello, in spite of this we're doing just fine  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Give us time to shine, even diamonds start as coal  
Even diamonds start as coal  
We're incomplete and infantile, even diamonds start as coal  
Give it time girl, the fire feels divine  
The sweetest things, they burn before they shine  
We think way too much  
Look at us losing touch  
A promise is a promise until  
Yeah, in spite of this we're doing just fine  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Give us time to shine, even diamonds starts as coal  
Even diamonds start as coal  
Yeah, we're incomplete and infantile  
Even diamonds start as coal
