I almost closed the door  
Cancelled on everything we opened up for  
Tonight the shadows had their say  
Their sad notions of the way  
Things really are  
Damn these blues!  
They'd turn my heart against you  
Since I was fool enough  
To find romance  
I'm trying to convince myself  
This is just a dance!  
  
We move in measures  
Through loves' changing faces  
Needy and nonchalant  
Greedy and gracious  
Through petty dismissals  
And grand embraces  
Like it was only a dance!  
  
We are survivors  
Some get broken  
Some get mended  
Some can't surrender  
They're too well defended  
Some get lucky  
Some are blessed  
And some pretend  
This is only a dance!  
  
We're dancing fools  
You and me  
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity  
It's my solo  
While you're away  
Shadows have the saddest thing to say  
  
Love  
We can't live without it  
Why do we go out and get it  
Just to turn around and doubt it  
LIke we're scared to care  
It's hard to talk about it  
Aw--it's only a dance  
Tonight the shadows had their say  
There's a sucker born a day  
I heard them say  
Born to lose  
Am I a sucker to love you?  
  
You're such a sweet love  
You're a proud man  
You're a treasure  
Time passes gracefully  
Living can be such a pleasure  
You make it easy to take it in measures  
Like it was only a dance!  
  
We're dancing fools  
You and me  
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity  
It's my solo  
Blue way  
And shadows have the saddest things to say  
  
We are survivors  
Some get broken  
Some get mended  
Some can't surrender  
They're too well defended  
Some get lucky  
Some are blessed  
And some pretend  
It's only a dance!
