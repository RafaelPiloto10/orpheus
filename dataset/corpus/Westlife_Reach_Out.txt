When everything is war  
You're living in a battle zone  
When everything is torn  
And the world is cold as stone  
  
Don't lock all the doors  
Close your heart  
Shut me out of your life  
And throw all the keys  
  
Will you reach out?  
Will you reach out for me?  
When life holds you down  
Like you're drowning at sea  
I'm the hand that you need  
'Til you land at your own destiny  
Reach out for me  
  
When everything is wrong  
Distant cries still reach my ears  
When ever you're alone  
Doesn't mean that love's not here  
  
Unlock all the doors  
And decide in your mind  
This is not how you want it to be  
  
Will you reach out?  
Will you reach out for me?  
When life holds you down  
Like you're drowning at sea  
I'm the hand that you need  
'Til you land at your own destiny  
Reach out for me  
  
Reach out  
Will you reach out for me?  
So don't hide  
I'm right here  
By your side  
Shelter you  
From your fears  
From your fears  
  
Oh your fears  
Oh your fears  
I won't be  
Far away  
I will pull you in  
Out of the rain  
  
Will you reach out?  
Will you reach out for me?  
When life holds you down  
Like you're drowning at sea  
I'm the hand that you need  
'Til you land at your own destiny  
Reach out for me  
  
Reach out  
Will you reach out for me?  
Reach out for me  
I'm the hand that you need  
'Til you land at your own destiny  
Reach out  
Reach out for me
