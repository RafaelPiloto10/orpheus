My child arrived just the other day  
Came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it  
And as he grew he said,  
I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm gonna be like you.  
  
Chorus  
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon.  
When you comin' home? '  
'Son, I don't know when, but we'll get together then.  
You know we'll have a good time then. '  
  
My son turned ten just the other day.  
He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play.  
Can you teach me to throw? '  
I said, 'Not today. I got a lot to do. '  
He said, 'That's okay. '  
And then he walked away but the smile never dimmed and he said,  
'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah.  
You know I'm gonna be like him. '  
  
Chorus  
  
Well, he came from college just the other day,  
So much like a man, I just had to say,  
'Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while? '  
He shook his head and he said with a smile,  
'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.  
See you later. Can I have them please? '  
  
Chorus  
  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away.  
I called him up just the other day.  
I said, 'i'd like to see you, if you don't mind. '  
He said, 'i'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,  
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.  
It's been sure nice talkin' to you. '  
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,  
He'd grown up just like me.  
My boy was just like me.  
  
Chorus
