Trust in me, baby, give me time, gimme time, um gimme time  
I heard somebody say, oh, "The older the grape  
Sweeter the wine, sweeter the wine"  
  
Oh, my love is like a seed, baby, just needs time to grow  
It's growing stronger day by day, yeah  
That's the price you've got to pay  
  
Trust in me, baby, give me time, gimme time  
Please, a little more time  
Takes a road runner just a little bit uh-longer, dear  
Oh, to make up my mind, I gotta make up my mind  
Oh, my love is like a seed, baby, just needs time to grow  
It's growing stronger day by day  
That's the price that we both got to pay  
  
I gotta know, know that I'm ready, oh ready to settle down  
'Cause I think too much of your loving, baby  
Yeah, I don't wanna mess your life around!  
  
So if you love me like you tell me that you're doing, dear  
You shouldn't mind paying the price, any price, any price  
Love is supposed to be that special kind of thing  
Make anybody want to sacrifice  
Oh, my love is like a seed, baby, just needs time to grow  
It's growing stronger day by day  
That's the price we both gotta pay  
  
Trust in me baby, trust in me baby  
Trust in my love, in my heart  
Keep the faith, baby, keep the faith in me, dear, in my love  
Don't turn your face away from me, dear, oh you leave a lost girl  
Oh, don't turn your love away, no no no no no no no  
You gotta believe in me, baby, yeah, trust me dear, oh
