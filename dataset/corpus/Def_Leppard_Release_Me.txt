Hey please release me, let me go  
And for I don't love you anymore  
To waste our lives would be a shame  
And release me and let me love again  
Oh I have found a new love dear  
And I will always want her near  
Her lips are warm while yours are cold  
And release me my darling let me go  
  
Please release me, let me go  
And for I don't love you anymore  
And to live our lives would be a shame  
And so release me and let me love again  
  
So please release me, let me go  
And for I don't love you anymore  
And to live our lives would be a shame  
And so release me and let me love again  
  
Hey please release me  
And for I don't love you anymore  
To live, excuse me, would be a shame  
And so release me and let me love again  
So release me and let me love again  
Let me go, let me go
