1974  
Some nights we made our love in the sand  
And at the tide we held our love in our hands  
And we listened to music the ocean was playing  
The words that our two hearts were saying  
That only two lovers can make  
Let us ride on the wind while this moment is real  
  
Your the light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade  
And this felling knowing you blessed me forever  
  
And believing I have been touch by your love  
And the pleasure of knowing the evening won't tare us apart  
  
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone  
We can gaze up the sky till the night is over  
  
Light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade  
And this felling knowing you blessed me forever  
  
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone  
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over  
  
Light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade  
  
And this feeling knowing you blassed me forever  
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone  
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over  
Light of my life  
You are welcome to my Charade...
