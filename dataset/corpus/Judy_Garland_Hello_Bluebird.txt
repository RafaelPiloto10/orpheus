Hear that bluebird, up in a tree  
Hear him, what a song  
Joy he's bringing, singing to me  
Singing, all day long  
Goodbye to skies of gray  
For I'm back home today...  
All day long I jump and run about  
You can always hear me shoutin' out  
"Hello bluebird!"  
Got no time for blues or anything  
I'm so happy, I just want to sing  
"Hello bluebird!"  
Blue skies, sun shine  
Friends that are real  
Old folks, sweetheart  
Oh, how I feel!  
I'll not go roaming like I did again  
I'll stay home and be a kid again  
"Hello bluebird, hello!"  
All day long  
I keep singing  
"Hello, I'm glad I found you, bluebird"  
Make yourself at home...  
No more blues  
Just because I'm happy  
When I'm around you, bluebird  
No more need to roam  
Up above the sun is shining  
The World is ideal  
I just can't describe the marvelous way  
That I feel...  
With nothing but the bluest skies above  
What a rosy future lies ahead  
Thank you, bluebird!  
Happy, happy, bluebird!  
Mister Bluebird, hello!
