Every now and then we find a special friend  
Who never lets us down  
Who understands it all  
Reaches out each time you fall  
You're the best friend that I've found  
I know you can't stay  
But part of you will never ever go away  
Your heart will stay  
  
I'll make a wish for you  
And hope it will come true  
That life will just be kind  
To such a gentle mind  
If you lose your way  
Think back on yesterday  
Remember me this way  
Remember me this way  
  
I don't need eyes to see  
The love you bring to me  
No matter where I go  
And I know that you'll be there  
For ever more a part of me you're everywhere  
I'll always care  
  
I'll make a wish for you  
And hope it will come true  
That life will just be kind  
To such a gentle mind  
If you lose your way  
Think back on yesterday  
Remember me this way  
Remember me this way  
  
And I'll be right behind your shoulder watching you  
I'll be standing by your side in all you do  
And I won't ever leave as long as you believe  
You just believe...  
  
Chorus:  
I'll make a wish for you  
And hope it will come true  
That life will just be kind  
To such a gentle mind  
And if you lose your way  
Think back on yesterday  
Remember me this way  
Remember me this way  
Reeee-member meeee thiiiiias waa-aay...
