Baby when you need me  
Wintertime or anytime at all  
I'll be right there for you  
Be right there whenever you call  
  
And I say baby I'm addicted  
I'm addicted to your love  
I love you more and more  
More and more than all the stars above  
  
And I say boy I love the way you walk  
And I say boy even when you talk  
You rock my world  
Feel so good to me  
Don't you know that you're my fantasy  
  
Want, I want your lovin'  
Need, I need ya  
Want, I want your lovin'  
Need, I need ya  
Can't ya see  
Your love is good for me  
  
Baby when you need me  
Wintertime or anytime at all  
I'll be right there for you  
Be right there whenever you call  
  
And I say baby you can do it  
You know how to love me, love me right  
You know just what to do  
Know just how to fill my appetite
