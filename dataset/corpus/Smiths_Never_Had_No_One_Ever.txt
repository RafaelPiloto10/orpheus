When you walk without ease  
On these  
Streets where you were raised  
I had a really bad dream  
It lasted twenty years, seven months, and twenty seven days  
I never, I'm alone, and I  
Never, ever oh, had no one ever  
  
Now I'm outside your house  
I'm alone  
And I'm outside your house  
I hate to intrude  
Oh, alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone  
I'm alone  
I'm alone  
And I never, never, oh, had no one ever  
I never had no one ever  
I never had no, no one ever  
Had no one never  
Never, no  
Oh
