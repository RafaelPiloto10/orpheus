  
Every time we lie awake  
After every hit we take  
Every feeling that I get  
But I haven't missed you yet  
  
Every room-mate kept awake  
By every silent scream we make  
All the feelings that I get  
But I still don't miss you yet  
  
Only when I start to think about it...  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you  
  
Every time we lie awake  
After every hit we take hn  
Every feeling that I get  
But I haven't missed you yet  
  
Only when I start to think about it...  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you  
  
Only when I start to think about you I know  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you  
  
I hate, you hate  
I hate, you love me  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you
