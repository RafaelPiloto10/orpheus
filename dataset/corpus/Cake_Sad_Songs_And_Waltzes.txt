  
  
  
  
I'm writing a song all about you  
  
A true song as real as my tears  
  
But you've no need to fear it  
  
'Cause no one will hear it  
  
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year  
  
I'll tell all about how you cheated  
  
I'd like for the whole world to hear  
  
I'd like to get even  
  
With you 'cause you're leavin'  
  
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year  
  
It's a good thing that I'm not a star  
  
You don't know how lucky you are  
  
Though my record may say it  
  
No one will play it
