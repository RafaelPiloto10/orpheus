Spotlight glaring down  
Silence from the crowd  
The circus is just beginning  
I tremble, looking around  
I would hate to fall and hit the ground  
In front of all these people  
That wouldn't be pleasant  
So the music plays  
And the trapeze sways  
And my heart is beating faster  
But all I hear is laughter  
From the crowd  
Cause they see right through my gaze  
Would you please tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me, yeah  
Cause I am  
Just trying to understand  
Why you don't love me  
Why you don't love me for me  
There is someone who loves you for you  
I keep lying to myself  
Trying to be somebody else  
In front of all these people  
I feel really foolish  
And when the main attraction at the masquerade  
If I keep goin' like this, I'm gonna go insane  
Is this circus act all I'll ever be?  
Yeah...  
Would you please tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me, yeah  
Cause I am  
Just playing a losing hand  
If you don't love me  
If you don't love me for me  
There is someone who loves you for you  
God loves you and me  
Let me tell you it's the kind of love that's given free  
And it doesn't fake  
And it doesn't flake  
And it doesn't play those games  
God loves me and you  
Let me tell you it's the kind of love  
It's real, it's true  
And it doesn't lie  
And it's doesn't cheat  
After it takes you off your feet  
So just... tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me, yeah  
Cause I am  
Just trying to understand  
Why you don't love me  
Why you don't love me for me  
Tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me, yeah  
Cause I am  
Just playing a losing hand  
If you don't love me  
If you don't love me for me

God is someone who loves you for you
