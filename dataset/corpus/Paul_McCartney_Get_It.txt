You've got to get it mm mm  
You've got to get it don't forget  
It doesn't come around again  
You've got to get it mm mm  
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good  
  
Once I had a little Spanish guitar  
The neighbors told me I could go pretty far  
Well I came and I went  
And my guitar got bent  
  
But I discovered that the people who love  
Are what we need if we're to get up above it all  
And that's that  
Unless the world is flat  
  
I wanna get it mm mm  
I wanna get it just in case  
It doesn't come around again  
I wanna get it mm mm  
I wanna get it and I wanna get it good  
  
Pardon me if I've been misunderstood  
I wanna get it while the going is good  
The telephone rang  
About a song I sang  
  
The life of Cadillac and ultra for sure  
Is automatic for the lady demure  
She came and she went  
Without a single dent  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Come on, let's get it mm mm  
Come on, let's get it don't forget  
It doesn't come around again  
You've got to get it mm mm  
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good
