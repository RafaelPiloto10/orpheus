Found out you're really something  
They talk about you,  
Then turn your confidence against you  
Now into nothing  
  
Grinning from the daze  
Petrified and blazed  
Feels good to know they care  
Special friends simply two faced  
  
You couldn't let go  
Your talking got you here,  
Tearing up everyone  
Respect, you don't know  
  
They say I'm jaded  
Cause they know it's true,  
With all those silly people  
On the wonder wheel  
  
Glizen from the daze  
Purified and crazed  
Feels good to hear them share  
Hateful friends simply two faced  
  
You couldn't let go  
Your talking got you here,  
Tearing up everyone  
Respect, you don't know  
  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste
