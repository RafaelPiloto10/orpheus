Summer days, where did you go,  
You've let me down so bad,  
Clouds fill the sky,  
Gone is the dream  
My happy hunting ground.  
Wild buffalo played and I never saw a rainy day.  
But it looks like summer days ain't coming back.  
  
March April May, June and July,  
You took me for a fall.  
Big chief he lie,  
Cold wind blows cool, so cold to make you die.  
Mountain breeze, ocean bay and I never saw a rainy day.  
But it looks like them summer days ain't coming back.  
  
Laredo Tornado,  
Adios amigos  
What can you do, when your dream world is gone.  
And your friends and lovers too.  
  
West Winter Street under the ground,  
The air that makes you choke,  
Towers of concrete, hellish go-round,  
Were there when I awoke  
City sky, pouring down with rain  
That can never hope to ease the pain.  
And it looks like summer days ain't coming back.  
  
Laredo Tornado  
Adios amigos.  
Laredo Tornado  
Adios amigos.
