Gypsy woman calls me  
Caution leads the way  
Words or endless stories  
Reads from a book of night and day  
Crystals in her gaze  
Shows me of a place inside a maze  
Cities golden splendor  
Only life surrender  
Candles all around me  
Mountains in the sky  
Wakes in mortuary  
This is the place where life's a lie  
Gasping in the air  
Wind breathes words - She's not there  
Deserts vast and barren  
Still the witches jargon  
Just my life surrender  
Promises of splendor  
She's a gypsy  
Blinding lights flash at me  
I can't believe this place is real  
Wake me from this dream  
Fires in stormy weather  
Silver shields the rain  
Her grip so tight that my life drains  
Poison messages sent  
Nectar from the serpent  
Never life surrender  
Psylocybin splendor  
She's a gypsy
