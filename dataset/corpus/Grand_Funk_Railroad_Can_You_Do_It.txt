One... Two...  
One, Two, Three, Four.  
  
I... went to a dance, ah, just the other night.  
Other night, other night, other night.  
The dance they was doin' there, it was out of sight.  
Out-a-sight, out-a-sight, out-a-sight.  
I knew right away, yeah, that there was nothing to it.  
Nothin' to it, nothin' to it, nothin' to it.  
I could tell right away, oh boy, even I could do it.  
Even I could do it, I could do it, I could do it.  
  
Well, first step: you got to move to the left.  
Second step: you got to go for yourself.  
Third step: well, you're doin' alright.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
  
Grab yourself a partner, then you start it movin' too.  
To and fro, to and fro, to and fro.  
The next thing you know, hey, you want to do it some more.  
Do it some more, do it some more, do it some more.  
I knew right away, yeah, that there was nothing to it.  
Nothin' to it, nothin' to it, nothin' to it.  
I could tell right away, oh boy, even I could do it.  
Even I could do it, I could do it, I could do it.  
  
Yeah, first step: you got to move to the left.  
Second step: you got to go for yourself.  
Third step: well, you're doin' alright.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
  
You grab yourself a partner, then you start it movin' too.  
To and fro, to and fro, to and fro.  
You get out on the floor and start doin' it some more.  
Do it some more, do it some more, do it some more.  
I knew right away, yeah, that there was nothing to it.  
Nothin
