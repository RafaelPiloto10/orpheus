(originally performed by Abba)  
  
Verse 1:  
I wasn't jealous  
Before we met  
Now every man that I see  
Is a potential threat  
And I'm possessive  
It isn't nice  
You've heard me saying  
The smoking was my only vice  
  
Bridge:  
But now it isn't true  
Now everything is new  
And all I've learned  
Has overturned  
I beg of you  
  
Chorus:  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
Verse 2:  
It was like shooting  
A sitting duck  
A little smalltalk  
A smiled baby  
I was stuck  
I still don't know  
What you've done with me  
A grown-up man should  
Never fall so easily  
  
Bridge:  
I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied  
I skip my pride  
I beg you dear  
  
Chorus:  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
Verse 3:  
I've had a few  
Little love affairs  
They didn't last very long  
And they've been pretty scarce  
I used to think  
I was sensible  
It makes the truth  
Even more incomprehensible  
  
Bridge:  
'Cause everything is new  
And everything is you  
And all I've learned  
Has overturned  
What can I do  
  
Chorus:  
Don't go wasting...
