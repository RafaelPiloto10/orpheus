Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time  
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I'll leave you  
Baby I'm amazed at the way you fool me all the time  
You hung me on a line  
Oh baby I'm amazed at the way I really need you  
  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something  
That he doesn't really understand  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
You're the only woman that could ever help me  
Baby, won't you try to understand  
  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something  
That he does not really understand, good God, hoo  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
You're the only one that could ever help me  
Baby, won't you try to understand  
  
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time  
Baby, I'm afraid of the way I'll leave ya'  
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you help me sing the song  
You right me when I'm wrong  
Baby I'm amazed at the way I really need ya'  
  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something  
That he does not really understand  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
You're the only woman that could ever help me  
  
Baby, won't you try to understand  
There you go,  
Baby I'm amazed, the way I really need you  
Alright, just about warming up and getting into it right about here
