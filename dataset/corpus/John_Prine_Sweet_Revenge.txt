I got kicked off Noah's Ark  
I turn my cheek to unkind remarks  
There was two of everything  
But one of me  
And when the rains came tumbling down  
I held my breath and I stood my ground  
And I watched that ship go sailing  
Out to sea.  
  
[Chorus]  
Take it back  
Take it back  
Oh no, you can't say that  
All of my friends  
Are not dead or in jail  
Through rock and through stone  
The black wind still moans  
Sweet revenge  
Sweet revenge  
Without fail.  
  
I caught an isle seat on a plane  
And drove an English teacher half insane  
Making up jokes about bicycle spokes  
And red balloons  
So I called up my local deejay  
And he didn't have a lot to say  
But the radio  
Has learned all of my favourite tunes.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The white meat is on the run  
And the dark meat is far too done  
And the milkman left me a note yesterday  
Get out of this town by noon  
You're coming on way too soon  
And besides that  
We never liked you any way.  
  
[Chorus]
