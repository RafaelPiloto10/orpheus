I've been waiting for years to buy a brand new Cadillac  
But now I've got one, I want to send it right back  
I can't afford the gas to fill my luxury limousine  
But even if I had the dough no one's got no gasoline  
  
I went to my local dealer to see if he could set me straight  
He said there's a little gas going but I'd have to wait  
But he offered some red hot speed and some really high grade hash  
But a gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere  
For any amount of cash  
  
I can score you some coke and some grade one grass  
But I can't get a gallon of gas  
I've got some downers some speed all the drugs that you need  
But I can't get a gallon of gas  
There's no more left to buy or sell  
There's no more oil left in the well  
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere  
For any amount of cash  
  
Who needs a car and a seven forty seven  
When you can't buy a gallon of gas  
Who needs a highway, an airport or a jet  
When you can't get a gallon of gas  
There's no more left to buy or sell  
There's no more oil left in the well  
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere  
For any amount of cash  
You can't buy a gallon of gas
