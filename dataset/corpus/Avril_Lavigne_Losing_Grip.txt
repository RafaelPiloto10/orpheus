Are you aware of what  
You make me feel, baby  
Right now I feel invisible to you  
Like I'm not real  
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you  
Why'd you turn away  
Here's what I have to say  
  
I was left to cry there  
Waiting outside there  
Grinning with the lost stare  
That's when I decided  
  
Why should I care  
'Cause you weren't there  
When I was scared  
I was so alone  
  
You, you need to listen  
I'm startin' to trip  
I'm losing my grip  
And I'm in this thing alone  
(oh oh yeah)  
  
Am I just some chick  
You placed beside you  
To take somebody's place?  
When you turn around  
  
Can you recognize my face?  
You used to love me  
You used to hug me  
But that wasn't the case  
Everything wasn't ok  
  
I was left to cry there  
Waiting outside there  
Grinning with a lost stare  
That's when I decided  
  
Why should I care  
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
You, you need to listen  
I'm starting to trip  
I'm losing my grip  
And I'm in this thing alone  
  
Crying out loud  
I'm crying out loud  
Crying out loud  
I'm crying out loud  
Open your eyes  
Open up wide  
  
Why should I care  
Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
Why should I care  
  
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
Why should I care  
If you don't care then I don't care  
  
We're not going anywhere  
Why should I care  
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
  
Why should I care  
If you don't care then I don't care  
We're not going anywhere
