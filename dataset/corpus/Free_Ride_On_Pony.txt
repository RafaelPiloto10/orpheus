Baby won't you tell me  
What you're tryin' to do  
You don't mean to say  
That our love is through  
Because I love you  
Yes I do  
And I've go to see it through  
  
I live on the mountain  
A hundred mile from town  
That's a long way to go  
Baby now  
But soon I'm gonna be around  
Because I love you  
Yes I do  
And I've got to see it through  
Baby now  
  
I'm gonna steal you baby away with me  
I want to love you  
Because you see  
I am riding on a pony  
In the middle of the night  
I'm gonna be there in the morning  
And I hope that it's all right  
  
Sometimes when I am lonely  
I think about your face, baby  
So I get on my pony  
And I ride over your place  
Because I love you  
Yes I do  
And I've go to see it through  
  
I want to take you, far away  
I want to love you, no matter what you say  
Because I am riding on a pony  
In the middle of the night  
I'm gonna be there in the morning  
And I hope that it's all right  
  
  
I am riding on a pony  
In the middle of the night  
I'm gonna be there in the morning  
And I hope that it's all right  
  
I am riding on a pony  
In the middle of the night  
I'm gonna be there in the morning  
And I hope that it's all right
