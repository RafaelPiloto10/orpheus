I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night  
When an XKE pulled up on my right.  
He rolled down the window of his shiny, new Jag  
And challenged me then and there to a drag.  
I said, "You're on, Buddy, my mill's running fine  
Let's come of the line, now, at Sunset and Vine  
But I'll go ya one better, if you've got the nerve  
Let's race all the way ... to Deadman's Curve"  
  
CHORUS:  
Deadman's Curve--is no place to play  
Deadman's Curve--you best keep away  
Deadman's Curve--I can hear them say  
You won't come back from Deadman's Curve  
  
The street was deserted late Friday night,  
We were buggin' each other as we sat out the light  
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green  
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine  
I flew past La Brea, Schwabs, and Crescent Heights  
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights  
He passed me at Doheny and I started to swerve  
But I pulled it out and there we were: At Deadman's curve  
  
(SPOKEN) Well, the last thing I remember, Doc, I started to swerve  
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve  
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight  
I found out for myself that everyone was right:  
  
Won't come back from Deadman's Curve!  
  
Repeat chorus and fade
