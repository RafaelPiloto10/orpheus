Cold blue steel out of money  
One eye for the beat police  
Sweet fire calling  
"You can't deny me  
Now you know what you need"  
Underneath the jungle gym  
Hollow-grey-fire-escape-thief  
Looking for Sweet Fire  
Shadow of Lady Release  
"Come with me  
I know the way" she says  
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder  
Do you want to contact somebody first  
Leave someone a letter  
You can come now  
Or you can come later"  
  
A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer  
Edgy-black cracks of the sky  
"Pin-cushion-prick-  
Fix this poor bad dreamer!"  
"Money" cold shadows reply  
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked  
Corridors spit on prayers and pleas  
Sparks fly up from Sweet Fire  
Black soot of Lady Release  
"Come with me  
I know the way" she says  
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder  
Do you want to contact somebody first  
Does it really matter  
If you come now  
Or if you come on later?"  
  
Red water in the bathroom sink  
Fever and the scum brown bowl  
Blue Steel still begging  
But it's indistinct  
Someone's hi-fi drumming Jelly Roll  
Concrete concentration camp  
Bashing in veins for peace  
Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire  
Fall into Lady Release  
"Come with me I know the way" she says  
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder  
Do you want to contact somebody first  
I mean what does it really matter  
You're going to come now  
Or you're going to come later"
