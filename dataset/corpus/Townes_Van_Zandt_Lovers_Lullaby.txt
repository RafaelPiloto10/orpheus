Dreams that have flown down the hall  
Tears that were sown on despair  
Summer's turned fall  
It don't matter at all  
When I wake and find you lying there  
Sweet silence and soft auburn hair  
  
Blues gonna dance through the sky  
Time's gonna roll soft as rain  
Sigh after sigh is gonna pass by and by  
Ah love's gonna fly on the wind  
When I gaze into your brown eyes again  
  
All the things I've seen  
And the places that I've been  
Don't mean a thing since I found you  
All that matters now  
Since I've won your love somehow  
Are these plans I keep makin'  
Not to lose you  
  
So sleep till the moon slips away  
I'm hopin' all you're dreamin' comes true  
When you rise with the day  
I might not have too much to say  
But you know that doesn't mean  
That I don't love you  
Ah you know that doesn't mean  
That I don't love you  
  
All the things I've seen  
And the places that I've been  
Don't mean a thing since I found you  
All that matters now  
Since I've won your love somehow  
Are these plans I keep makin'  
Not to lose you  
  
Dreams that have flown down the hall  
Tears that were sown on despair  
Summer's turned fall  
It don't matter at all  
When I wake and find you lying there  
Sweet silence and soft auburn hair  
Sweet silence and soft auburn hair
