Life is my friend  
Rake it up to take it in  
Wrap me in your cinnamon  
Especially in Michigan  
Well I could be your friend  
  
White clouds I'm in  
A mitten full of fisherman  
C'mon huckleberry finn  
Show me how to make her grin  
Well I'm in Michigan  
  
Cry me a future  
Where the revelations run amok  
Ladies and gentlemen  
Lions and tigers come running  
Just to steal your luck  
  
A rainy Lithuanian  
Who's dancing as an Indian  
Painted in my tiger skin  
(Especially in Michigan)  
  
Double chins and bowling pins  
Unholy Presbyterians  
Land is full of medicine  
I find it when I'm slipping in  
Into Michigan  
  
The tainted new librarian  
Who fainted when she tucked you in  
Let's float away like zeppelins  
(On stoic gusts of northern wind)  
  
Out on the farm we'll be  
Swimming with the mother duck  
Deep in the mitten where  
Lions and tigers come running  
Just to steal your luck  
  
Life is my friend  
Underwater violins  
Order now from ho chi min  
A porcelain that comes in twins  
When I'm in Michigan  
  
Throw me in the looney bin  
Cause I can take it on the chin  
The cleavage of your pillow skin  
(Is moving like a violin)
