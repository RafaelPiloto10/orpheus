Hey hey mama  
Mama what you tryin' to do?  
You keep on talkin' to me  
'Till your face turns blue  
Well do you think I'm a young boy  
Yet to make up my mind?  
Well I'm just castin' all my toys  
I'm gonna leave what's behind me behind  
I'm gonna leave what's behind me behind  
I saw an old high school friend  
Just the other day  
He didn't ask me how I'd been  
He asked me how was my pay  
Now do you call this a friendship?  
Judging from what I said  
If you do I've a real tip  
Ain't nobody gonna know about my bread  
Ain't nobody gonna know about my bread, Yah yah yaaaaahhh...  
If you got somebody, that you can trust to the very end  
I said if you do I want to be like you  
'Cause you sure got a real good friend  
You sure got a real good friend  
Friend  
Friend  
Yah...  
Woah...  
Woah...  
Woah... get it  
Woah.. yah... get it  
Aaaaahhh... Woah  
C'mon... c'mon  
Yah... yah  
Yah  
Woah  
Yah... woah... get it  
Yah
