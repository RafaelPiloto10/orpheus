Lights (Flashin')  
Sound (Crashin')  
Minds (Blowin')  
Body (Rockin')  
Eyes (Lockin')  
Lips (Touchin')  
Hearts (Pumpin')  
Pressure (Risin')  
Breathes (Takin')  
Rump (Shakin')  
Music (Makin')  
Lose (Control)  
  
Play it on your speakerphone  
Track repeat go on and on  
  
Drop your socks and grab your mini boom box  
Do the pop lock body rock  
Let the beat drop  
Till your shell shocked  
Baby what, tell me what you got  
Rock hard like a sinner block  
  
To your head bone  
Temple bone  
Through your jaw bone  
To your neck bone  
Collar bone  
Medic go on  
To your back bone  
Moving on  
Through your hip bone

Play it on your speakerphone  
Let the stars collide  
  
Stop your pockets goin' ring-a-ding-dong  
Turn your thing on speakerphone  
We can get it on  
Set your mind on  
Freaky mode  
Where you wanna go?  
Feel the buzz grow  
Let it glow  
  
To your head bone  
Temple bone  
Through your jaw bone  
To your neck bone  
Collar bone  
Medic go on  
To your back bone
