Sometimes I wonder if God laughs at me  
I hear His voice  
When I sleep  
  
Sometimes I wonder if The Holy Ghost  
Is haunting me  
In my dreams  
  
Save me  
Save me  
  
Sometimes I wonder, does an angel die?  
Rest in peace  
Here with me?  
  
Sometimes I wonder if a soul can cry?  
I feel a pain  
Next to mine  
  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
I don't think He died for me  
  
I know that Heaven is a burnt out shell  
I know forgiveness is the door to Hell  
I know confession is a black empty lie  
Look in my eyes  
Look in my eyes  
  
Save me  
  
Save me
