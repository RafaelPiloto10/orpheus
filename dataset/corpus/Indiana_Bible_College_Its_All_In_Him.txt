Verse 1  
The mighty God is Jesus  
The Prince of Peace is He  
The everlasting Father  
And the King eternally  
Wonderful in wisdom  
By whom all things were made  
The fullness of the Godhead  
In Jesus is displayed  
  
Chorus  
It's all in Him, It's all in Him  
The fullness of the Godhead is in Him  
It's all in Him, It's all in him  
The Mighty God is Jesus  
It's all in Him  
  
Verse 2  
The Alpha and Omega  
The beginning and the end  
The Living Word incarnate  
And the helpless sinner's friend  
Our wisdom and perfection  
Our righteousness and pow'r  
All we need in Jesus  
We find this very hour  
  
Bridge Worship the only saving name  
Jesus, Jesus
