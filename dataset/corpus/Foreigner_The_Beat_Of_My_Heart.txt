Ooh the beat of my heart  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
  
Always here  
I'll be close to you  
But you won't see me  
On the street or underground  
I'll be there somewhere  
You can look around  
You can listen out  
But you won't find me  
Beyond the shadow  
Of a doubt  
Oh I'll be there for you  
  
You've been living in another world  
Ever since I met you  
Don't wanna treat you like a little girl  
I know you better  
  
The beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
To the beat of my heart  
You'll find your way  
H-o-m-e  
The beat of my heart  
You won't be lonely  
  
Girl I'm here  
And I'll always be  
There when you need me  
Close at hand  
Never far away  
I'll be there for you  
  
You're such a crazy little pretty girl  
How could I ever forget you  
You tried to take me to another world  
But I wouldn't let you  
  
And the beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
To the beat of my heart  
You won't be lonely  
The beat of my heart  
Better listen to me now  
The beat of my heart  
Calling you  
H-o-m-e  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
You won't be lonely  
  
You've been living in another world  
Ever since I met you  
Don't wanna treat you like a little girl  
I know you better  
  
And the beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
To the beat of my heart  
You won't be lonely  
The beat of my heart  
Better listen closely now  
The beat of my heart  
And it's calling you  
H-o-m-e  
  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
For the beat of my heart  
You'll find your way home  
H-o-m-e  
  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
It's calling you  
H-o-m-e
