When you woke up this morning  
On your front lawn  
You had a smile on your lips and  
Your wallet was gone  
You remember some girl  
But the rest is all a blur  
Well you're not the first one to fall under  
Her spell  
I know dozens of guys who've been there  
As well  
They've got scars to show  
And they owe 'em all to her.  
[Chorus:]  
That was Lulu  
Did she fool you?  
That was Lulu  
That ain't legal  
That ain't voodoo  
That was Lulu  
Well Lulu's got charms that money can't buy  
And she's made her reputation  
Making strong men cry  
All the victims may change  
But there stories are the same  
Lulu's there whey your airplane  
Just happens to crash  
Still she walks away without even a scratch  
Leaving in flames  
But she never leaves her name  
[Chorus:]  
And I know what I'm talking about  
I saw it all from the start  
Long before she started running around  
Who do you think ran away with my heart  
That was Lulu  
[Chorus]
