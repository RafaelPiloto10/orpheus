Them that's got shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible said but it still is news  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
Rich relations give  
Crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But don't take too much  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
Money, you've got lots of friends  
Crowding round the door  
When you're gone, spending ends  
They don't come no more  
Yes, the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
Money, you've got lots of friends  
Crowding round the door  
Money's gone, and spending ends  
They don't come no more  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own
