Don't say it's like a fantasy  
When you know this is how it should be  
You kiss me  
I'm falling can you hear me calling  
You touch me, I want you  
Feels like I've always known you  
  
On a night like this  
I want to stay forever (stay forever)  
On a night like this  
Just want to be together  
On a night like this  
  
(On a, on a, on, on a, on a, on)  
(On a, on a, on, on a, on a, on)  
Now I'm getting closer to you  
Hold me, I just can't be without you  
You kiss me, I'm falling  
It's your name I'm calling  
You touch me, I want you  
Feels like I've always known you  
  
On a night like this  
I want to stay forever (stay forever)  
On a night like this  
Just want to be together  
On a night like this  
  
Seems like I've known you a lifetime (lifetime)  
Now it's time to make you mine  
On a night like this  
On a night like this, oh  
  
(You kiss me, I'm falling)  
(You touch me)  
  
On a night like this  
Just want to be together  
  
On a night like this  
I want to stay forever (stay forever)  
On a night like this  
Just want to be together  
On a night like this  
  
(You kiss me, I'm falling)  
(You touch me)  
  
On a night like this  
(You kiss me, I'm falling)  
(You touch me)  
  
On a night like this  
(You kiss me, I'm falling)  
(You touch me)  
On a night like this
