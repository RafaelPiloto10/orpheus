There's a man sitting in a concrete room  
In a place full of emptiness and gloom  
With his head in his hands he's far away  
It's a long time ago since yesterday  
  
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
  
As a boy he had made so many friends  
Now they're gone loneliness just never ends  
And in that cold concrete room he trials the day  
Yes, the price of a life is hard to pay  
  
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
  
Close your eyes, there's nothing more to see  
Close your eyes and thank the world you're free  
  
There's a man sitting in a concrete room  
In a place full of emptiness and gloom  
With his head in his hands he's far away  
It's a long time ago since yesterday  
  
And now his hands catch the tears that start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
And now his hands catch the tears that start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
And now his hands, like the tears start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
Yes, now his hands, like the tears start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
And now his hands, now his hands start to fall  
In his world of nothing at all  
Yes, now his hands.....
