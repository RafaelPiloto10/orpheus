I feel your heat in dusty whispers  
The wind is cold around your moon  
It's getting hard to keep our distance  
I know your time is coming soon  
Don't point your dream on my horizon  
Don't take your rose too far from home  
Please don't forget we're not each other  
Each soul has black thorns of his own  
  
I see you dancing  
Your song is clear  
You've got to show me, got to show me  
There's nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  
I have my loved ones you have yours  
So let us gaze upon the feast  
In God's own name let's eat together  
In God's own name please come in peace  
See how our children play together  
While you and me we stand alone  
I know we'll never be each other  
If I leave you leave me alone  
  
I see you dancing  
Your song is clear  
You've got to show me, got to show me  
There's nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear
