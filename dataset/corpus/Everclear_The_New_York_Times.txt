It make no sense to me  
I was living in a different world today  
When I heard the news  
  
I keep on having the same bad dream  
And it makes me wanna hurt all the people  
Who have done this thing to you  
  
when I see your face  
I can see you smile  
I read all about you in the new york times  
  
when I see your eyes  
I can see your life  
When I think about what happened  
It just makes me crazy  
  
this makes no sense to me yeah  
This eye for an eye thing  
It has gone too far  
I don't know anyone who does not hurt inside  
I would like to believe that we can learn from this  
And maybe some day  
Make things right  
  
I wanna believe in this world  
I wanna believe in this life  
I wanna believe in a world  
That does not seem real  
When I read between the lines  
  
when I see your face  
I can see you smile  
I read all about you in the new york times  
  
when I see your eyes  
I can see your life  
When I read the words about you  
It just makes me crazy  
  
I wanna believe in this world  
I wanna believe in this life  
I wanna believe in a world  
That does not seem real  
When I read between the lines  
  
you got to read between the lines  
  
you got to read between the lines  
  
I really wanna believe...  
I can make things right  
  
I wanna believe I can learn  
How feel all right inside  
  
I wanna believe I can learn  
How to make things right  
I wanna believe in this world  
I wanna believe in this life  
I wanna believe in a world that does not seem real  
When I read the new york times  
  
I see your face  
I can see you smile  
I read all about you in the new york times  
  
I can see your eyes  
I can see your life  
When I think about what happened it just makes me crazy  
  
when I close my eyes... you seem so alive  
When I think about you  
I wanna believe... we can make things right  
  
I wanna believe  
(I wanna believe)  
  
I wanna believe in this world  
I wanna believe in this life  
I wanna believe in a world that does not seem real  
When I read the new york times
