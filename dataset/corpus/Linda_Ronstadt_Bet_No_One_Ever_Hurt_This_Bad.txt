Sit by my window watch the rain  
I hear it beatin' on my window pane  
All the troubles I had  
Bet no one ever hurt this bad  
  
My baby left me all alone  
Wait for a letter sit by the phone  
It makes me so sad  
Cause no one ever hurt this bad  
  
Since you went away  
I can't face the day  
Night brings nothing but pain  
I thought I could go on  
I see that I was wrong  
Baby please come home  
I just can't to be alone  
  
Somebody somewhere hear my plea  
Send my baby home to me  
It would make me so glad  
Cause no one ever hurt this bad  
  
Since you went away  
I can't face the day  
Night brings nothing but pain  
I thought I could go on  
I see that I was wrong  
Baby please come home  
Well I can't stand to be alone  
  
Somebody somewhere hear my plea  
Send my baby home to me  
It would make me so glad  
Cause no one ever hurt this bad  
  
Sit by my window watch the rain  
I hear it beatin' on my window pane  
Sit by my window watch the rain  
I hear it beatin' on my window pane
