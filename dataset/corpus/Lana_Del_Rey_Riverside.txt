I seen you walk along the riverside  
I seen you walk along at ease  
And in the air I feel a silence  
It whispers perfect on the breeze  
And there's a voice that keeps me company  
It takes me closer to the stream  
And in the break of any suffering  
It makes me feel like there's no pain  
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer  
To the dream.  
To my dream I believe  
I'm up a creek and you're my paddle  
Where there is you there is my soul  
Another dream where I'm the witness  
I am the witness to your goal  
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer  
To the dream.  
To my dream I believe.
