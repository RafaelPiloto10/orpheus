Can't get down I've seen the light  
I made the choice and chose the right  
I'll put in trust take out the hate  
Don't tell me I can't cause I have faith  
I have faith in people they have faith in me  
I have faith in my society  
If you've got a problem put your trust in me  
I'll never pretend that I can't see  
I have faith in the human race  
The world's got problems  
The world's got fears  
But my trust in people  
Makes me not scared  
The world's got riots  
The world's got fights  
But I trust people will see the light
