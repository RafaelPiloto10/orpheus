The shadows of the night  
Are unleashed again  
Where their greed begins  
The end is near  
A morbid hunger for blood  
Lies in their cold black eyes  
They've come to take ouur lifes away  
  
One by one they died  
A massacre that took all night  
They had no chance, it was no fight  
You can't kil what has been killed before  
They died...  
  
With shadows on its tale  
He steppedThrough the portal  
Locked the door and ate the key  
With his life they took their way to freedom  
And be became the final keeper of the key
