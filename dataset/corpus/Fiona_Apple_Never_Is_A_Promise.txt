You'll never see  
The courage I know  
Its colors' richness  
Won't appear within your view  
I'll never glow,  
The way that you glow  
Your presence dominates the judgments made on you  
  
But as the scenery grows,  
I see in different lights  
The shades and shadows  
Undulate in my perception  
My feelings swell and stretch  
I see from greater heights  
I understand what I am still to proud to mention  
-to you  
  
You'll say you understand  
But you don't understand  
You'll say you'd never give up  
Seeing eye to eye  
But never is a promise  
And you can't afford to lie  
  
You'll never touch  
These things that I hold  
The skin of my emotions  
Lies beneath my own  
You'll never feel  
The heat of this soul  
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown  
To you  
  
You'll say don't fear your dreams  
It's easier than it seems  
You'll say you'd never let me fall  
From hopes so high  
But never is a promise  
And you can't afford to lie  
  
You'll never live the life that I live  
I'll never live the life  
That wakes me in the night  
You'll never hear the message I give  
You'll say it looks as though I might  
Give up this fight  
  
But as the scenery grows,  
I see in different lights  
The shades and shadows  
Undulate in my perception  
My feelings swell and stretch  
I see from greater heights  
I realize what I am now too smart to mention  
To you  
  
You'll say you understand,  
You'll never understand  
I'll say I'll never wake up  
Knowing how or why  
I don't know what to believe in  
You don't know who I am  
You'll say I need appeasing  
When I start to cry  
But never is a promise  
And I'll never need a lie
