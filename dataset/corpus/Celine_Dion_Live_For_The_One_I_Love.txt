A million stars' light  
This beautiful night  
This is not a night to die  
Let me sing and dance beneath the sky  
I have such love to give...to give  
I want a chance to live  
  
Live, for the one I love  
Love, as no one has loved  
Give, asking nothing in return  
  
Free, free to find my way  
Free to have my say  
Free to see the day  
Be like I used to be  
Like I'm wild bird free  
With all of life in me  
  
Live, for the one I love  
Love, as no one has loved  
Give, asking nothing in return  
  
Though this world tears us apart  
We're still together in my heart  
I want the world to hear my cry  
And even if I have to die  
Love will not die  
Love will change the world  
  
Live, for the one I love  
Love, like no one has loved  
Give, asking nothing in return  
  
I'll love until love wears me away  
I'll die and I know my love will stay  
And I know my love will stay
