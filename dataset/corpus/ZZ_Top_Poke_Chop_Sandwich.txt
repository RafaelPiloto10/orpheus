Poke chop sandwich, waitin' in the sack  
Ridin' a tom tom, a double fat back  
Got my poke chop sandwich, layin' on my drum  
Poke chop's greasy, mmm, gonna get some  
Get some of that poke chop  
Poke chop sandwich

A Louisiana black beat and the Texas bop  
Now do a Hollywood shuffle an' you just can't top it  
New York turn around and the London stomp  
African good luck combination, I know that you want  
Poke chop  
A poke chop sandwich  
A poke chop  
Double poke chop sandwich

Spider lightnin' hopkin got the big bad beat  
There ain't no question, mmm they gonna eat  
Got no spider on my bottle, there's no lightnin' on my can  
They'll take in a bucket, 'cause they damn well can  
A poke chop  
A poke at that chop  
Mmm, cut that poke chop
