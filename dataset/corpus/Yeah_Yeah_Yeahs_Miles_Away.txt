As the cars go by  
Under the sun like an enemy  
You wonder, you wonder, you wonder  
  
As a spider comes  
And looks at you like an enemy  
You wonder, you wonder, you wonder  
  
Yeah miles, miles away  
She's hurting people in a better world  
Miles, miles away  
Dressed again in the hot water  
  
You're more beautiful than ever  
Looking in the car's rear view mirror  
  
Floor is hard uncomforted  
By the second time  
She wondered, she hungered, she hungers  
Like a killers wife  
  
As the cars go by, as the cars go by  
As the cars go by, yeah as the cars go by  
Miles, miles away  
She's hurting people in a better world  
Miles, miles away  
Dressed again in the hot water  
  
Well, you're more beautiful than ever  
Looking in the car's rear view mirror  
You're more beautiful than ever  
Miles, miles, miles, miles away  
Miles, miles away
