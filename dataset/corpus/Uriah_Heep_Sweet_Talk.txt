I see your face in  
The magazine stand  
I wanna hold you in the palm  
Of my hand  
I love everything about you  
You're such a long way away  
Your sweet talk  
Ain't enough for me  
I may be deaf, but you're  
Too blind to see  
You're gonna break my bones  
With your feminine tones  
But I don't wanna hear  
Your sweet talk tonight  
Not again tonight  
When I call tonight  
Don't wanna hear your  
Sweet talk tonight  
I hear your voice on the radio  
It's gettin' so bad I don't know  
Which way to go  
Why don't you wake up girl  
You're such a long way away  
Your sweet talk ain't enough  
You see  
I need a woman  
Who's a woman to me  
You're gonna break my bones  
With those feminine tones  
But I don't wanna hear  
Oh, I don't wanna hear it  
Not tonight  
You're gonna break my bones  
With your feminine tones  
But I don't wanna hear  
None of that sweet talk tonight  
Oh, not again tonight  
When I call tonight  
Sweet talk tonight  
Not again tonight  
When I call tonight  
Don't wanna hear your sweet talk
