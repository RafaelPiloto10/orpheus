The rain poured down the wind swept avenue  
On another dark wet December afternoon  
All my cherished memories are of you  
All my warmth and comfort stayed with you  
  
I would have wrote you a letter  
but the telephone calls are free  
Cause the boys in the next apartment  
Are working all day  
They're a great bunch of guys  
But I think they're all gay  
What am I doing  
Avoiding what I'm trying to say  
  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
With you in my arms  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
  
Send me a naked picture  
By the U.S. mail  
Write a pornographic letter  
You know I won't tell  
Keep your legs closed tight  
keep your body under lock and key  
Stay home at night  
And save all the best parts for me  
  
Yeah baby  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
Yes I do baby  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight, oh  
  
I could be home in time for Christmas  
If you want me to be  
There's a plane leaves here at midnight  
Arriving at three  
But I'm a bit financially embarrased  
I must admit  
To tell you the truth my honey  
I haven't a cent  
  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
Tonight baby  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
  
Guess I'd better ring off  
Before the boys get home  
My regards to all your family  
And everyone at home  
There's a lump comes in my throat  
And a tear I can't hide  
Cause I want to see you so badly  
I just may die  
And you know why baby  
  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
With the ones that I love  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
Oh my God I wish I was home tonight  
Tonight, tonight  
  
I've been hearing voices  
Out on the street  
They say you've found some one else  
Who's really quite neat  
But he doesn't move you like I do  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
That it just ain't true
