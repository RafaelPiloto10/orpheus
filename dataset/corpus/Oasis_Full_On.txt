I hear my heart beatin' faster  
I feel it in my bones  
I want it now 'cause I have ta  
But why no-one knows  
I'm like the angel on the A train  
My eyes is diamond white  
And from the cradle till your insane  
The life you have to fight  
But no-one really knows why there's a spirit in the sky  
There's escape so long  
He will understand while I take him by the hand  
Why life's time tunnel is long  
Well it will be alright  
If you stay tonight  
It's where we both belong  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
  
I hear my heart beatin' faster  
I feel it in my bones  
I want it now 'cause I have ta  
But why no-one knows

It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
  
It's gonna be alright  
You're gonna stay tonight  
It's where we both belong  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on  
It's gonna be full on
