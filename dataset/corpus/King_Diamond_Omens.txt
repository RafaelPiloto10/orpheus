Nobody's inside the church but the bell is ringing  
For no reason the flowers are dying  
Oh, Deadly Omens  
Oh, Deadly Omens  
Inside the mansion the air is unbearable, a rotten smell  
In the dinning room the table is set for 3  
Oh, Deadly Omens  
Oh, Deadly Omens  
SOLO: Mike -SOLO: Andy  
"Miriam come here and see what I've found, it's moving  
An empty cradle swaying in the air  
I did not bring it in here, now did You?"  
"No, no, no"  
Oh, Deadly Omens  
Oh, Deadly Omens
