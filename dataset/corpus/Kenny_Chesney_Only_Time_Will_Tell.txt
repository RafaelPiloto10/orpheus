Everybody says it's going to take a little time  
Might as well get used to her running through my mind  
Her memory brought me to my knees  
When will I be back up walking  
Only time will tell but it ain't talking  
  
Lot of sleepless nights I'm sure are lying up ahead  
Wondering when the night will come when I lay down in bed  
And her memory finally decides to stop calling  
Only time will tell, but it ain't talking  
  
Only time will tell when I will finally be free  
But so far it hasn't spoken a single word to me  
Wonder when the pain will end  
And all the tears will stop falling  
Only time will tell, but it ain't talking  
  
Only time will tell when I will finally be free  
But so far it hasn't spoken a single word to me  
Wonder when the pain will end  
And all the tears will stop falling  
Only time will tell, but it ain't talking  
  
Only time will tell, but it ain't talking
