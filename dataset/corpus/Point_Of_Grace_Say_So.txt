We're the children of the King  
We're gonna say so  
We're the children of the King  
We're gonna say so, say so  
We're not ashamed to see  
We're gonna say so, say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord, He's the one we adore  
We're gonna say so, don't say no, but say so  
In this world full of compromise and sin  
We must stand for Him  
Even when it tries to pull us in  
We must fight to win  
We gotta fix our eyes on our goal  
To love our God with all our soul  
This message of hope, it must be told  
We're the children of the King  
We're gonna say so, say so  
We're not ashamed to see  
We're gonna say so, say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord, He's the one we adore  
We're gonna say so, don't say no, but say so  
The world is searching for something that will last  
We've gotta help them fast  
We must be so faithful to the task  
For the time has passed  
On our knees, we've gotta run the race  
Following Jesus at His pace (at His pace)  
Share the story of His grace  
We're the children of the King  
We're gonna say so, say so  
We're not ashamed to see  
We're gonna say so, say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord, He's the one we adore  
We're gonna say so, don't say no, but say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord, He's the one we adore  
We're gonna say so, don't say no, but say so  
Say so, don't say no, but say so
