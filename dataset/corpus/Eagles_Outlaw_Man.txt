I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son  
The highway is my legacy  
On the highway I will run  
In one hand I've a Bible  
  
In the other I've got a gun  
Well, don' you know me  
I'm the man who won  
Woman don't try to love me  
  
Don't try to understand  
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man  
  
First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe  
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day  
All of my friends are strangers,  
They quickly come and go  
  
And all my love's in danger,  
'Cause I steal hearts and souls  
Woman, don't try to love me  
Don't try to understand A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man  
oo....  
  
Woman, don't try to love me  
Don't try to understand  
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man  
  
Some me call me Abel,  
Some men call me Cain,  
Some men call me sinner, Lord  
Some men call me saint  
  
Some say there's a Jesus  
Some men say there ain't  
When you got no life to lose  
Then there's nothin' left to gain  
Outlaw man  
Outlaw man
