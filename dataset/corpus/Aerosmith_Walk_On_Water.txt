High class  
Moolah  
Bolt ons  
Fast car  
Quick fix  
Freak out  
Nose bleed  
Skull cap  
Pissed off  
Pissed on  
  
I never seen a smile that looked so sad  
You make me feel so good 'cause you're so bad  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey little darlin'  
Your love is legendary  
Love's four letters  
Ain't in my dictionary  
'Scuse my position  
But it ain't missionary  
Yeah but I want to  
Walk on the water with you  
  
Boo-tay  
Hotpants  
Tan line  
Sweet stuff  
Hookah  
Boo yah  
Knocked Up  
Hose Down  
Cool cat  
Hot flash  
  
When it comes to makin' love I ain't no hype  
'Cause I practise on a peach most every night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, the cook's in the kitchen  
And hidin' the spoons  
I'm winkin' at witches  
And howlin' at moons  
I'm afraid of the candle  
But Live for the flame  
You know who I am  
But you don't know my name  
  
(Aha, ha, ha, ha)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey little darlin'  
Your love is legendary  
You got the boo yah  
It's almost ficitonary  
'Scuse my position  
But it ain't missionary  
Yeah, but I want to  
Walk on the water with you
