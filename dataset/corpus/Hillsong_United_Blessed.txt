Verse  
Blessed are those who dwell in Your house  
They are ever praising You  
Blessed are those whose strength is in You  
Whose hearts are set on our God  
And we will go from strength to strength  
Until we see You face to face  
  
Chorus  
Hear our prayer  
O Lord God Almighty  
Come bless our land  
As we seek You  
Worship You  
  
Bridge  
For You are holy  
For You are holy  
For You are holy Lord
