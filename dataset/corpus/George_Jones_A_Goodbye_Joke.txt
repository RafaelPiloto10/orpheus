No, she not gone forever  
She's just playing one of her games  
And tonight when I get home  
Everything will be the same.  
  
'Cause when I woke up this morning  
Yes, I found her goodbye note  
It just a game she's plays  
It just a goodbye joke.  
  
She's just goin' downtown shopping  
She'll bring me back some sporty clothes  
'Cause I'm always on her mind  
No matter where she plans to go.  
  
If I thought she was gone forever  
Lord, I'd find me a hangin' rope  
That's why I'm drifting now  
It's just a goodbye joke.  
  
Ain't it funny the sense of humor  
A woman can have sometimes  
Especially that lovely woman of mine.  
Hey, bartender won't you bring me a drink  
  
'Cause I still like [unknown]  
On the words she wrote  
In her little goodbye joke...
