Why do you cry? He has risen.  
Why are you weeping? He's not dead.  
Why do you cry? he has risen.  
Why are you weeping? He's not dead.  
He paid it all on that lonely highway(hayyyy).  
And his anointing I can feel.  
He shed his blood (ohh ohh ohh).  
For my transgressions (ohh ohh ohh).  
And by his stripes we are healed.  
  
Why do you cry? He has risen.  
Why are you weeping? He's not dead.  
So as you go through lifes journey(neeeee). Don't you worry lift up your head.
Don't you cry (ohh ohh ohh) stop your weeping  
(ohh ohh ohh) He has risen He's not dead.  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't cry  
wipe your eyes  
He's not dead.  
  
(ohh ohh ohh ohh)  
Don't weep  
He's not asleep  
Je-hovah  
He's not dead  
  
(ohh ohh ohh ohh)  
Don't cry  
wipe your eyes  
He's not dead
