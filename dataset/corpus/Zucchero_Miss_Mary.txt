Angels announce with trumpets  
Crown you with jewels and stars  
Hercules lives  
Next door to Venus and Mars  
Beside your pretty blue shoulder,  
  
Something may trouble Jerome  
Now that you're up with your friends  
I know you'll never come home  
  
Singing so babe, I know this song  
Miss Mary I'm nothing without you  
Everything I've done is wrong  
Miss Mary I try not to doubt you  
  
I walk in their brilliant parade  
Banish the primitive gloom  
Now I know where I can find you  
Hung up in some Frenchman's room  
Pitiful Magdelena for all to see  
Must have been beautiful  
So just show a little mercy to me  
  
Hey babe, I sing this song  
Miss Mary I'm nothing without you  
Everything I've done is wrong  
Miss Mary I try not to doubt you  
  
There at the foot of your staircase  
I stood to take in the scene  
All the ashes of roses  
The veined steps of marble  
Purple, gold and green  
Oh I wish you were my queen  
  
They only want to possess you  
Lock you away in a vault  
Such a heavenly vision  
And dress you up in blue  
I guess it's not their fault  
  
I know this song  
Miss Mary I'm nothing without you  
Everything I've done is wrong  
Miss Mary I try not to doubt you  
  
So babe, I sing this song  
Miss Mary I'm nothing without you  
Everything I've done is wrong  
Miss Mary will I be forgiven
