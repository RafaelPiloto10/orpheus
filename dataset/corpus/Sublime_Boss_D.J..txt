There's a steel train comin' through I would take it if I could  
And I would not lie to you because Sunday mornin' soon will come  
  
When things will be much easier to say  
Upon the microphone like a boss DJ  
But I won't walk up upon the sea like it was dry land  
Boss DJ ain't nothin' but a man  
No trouble, no fuss, I know why..  
  
It's so nice, I want to hear the same song twice,  
It's so nice don't want to hear the same song twice  
  
Rumors are spreading all over my town  
But it's just stones and sticks,  
Upon the microphone is where I go to get my fix  
  
Just let the lovin' take a hold 'cause it will if you let it  
I'm funky not a junkie but I know where to get it  
No trouble no fuss I know why  
  
It's so nice I want to hear the same song twice  
It's so nice I want to hear the same song twice  
  
Oooee girl  
Oooee girl  
Oooee girl  
  
Ooee girl and there really ain't no time to waste  
Really ain't no time to hate  
Ain't got no time to waste, time to hate  
Really ain't no time to make the time go away  
  
So mister DJ don't stop the music,  
I want to know,  
Are you feelin' the same way too?  
  
I want to rock it wih you-ou girl,  
You-ou girl, you-ou girl, oooooo  
Mmmmmhmmmhhmmm  
Don't stop  
  
Cause it's so nice I want to hear the same song twice,  
It's so nice I want to hear the same song twice  
  
Nowadays all the songs on the radio,  
They all,  
All drive me crazy
