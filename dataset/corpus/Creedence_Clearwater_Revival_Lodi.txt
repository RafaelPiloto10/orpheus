Just about a year ago  
I set out on the road  
Seekin' my fame and fortune  
Lookin' for a pot of gold  
Thing got bad and things got worse  
I guess you know the tune  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
Rode in on the Greyhound  
I'll be walkin' out if I go  
I was just passin' through  
Must be seven months or more  
Ran out of time and money  
Looks like they took my friends  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again  
  
A man from the magazine  
Said I was on my way  
Somewhere I lost connections  
Ran out of songs to play  
I came into town, a one night stand  
Looks like my plans fell through  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
If I only had a dollar  
For every song I've sung  
Every time I had to play  
While people sat there drunk  
You know, I'd catch the next train  
Back to where I live  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
