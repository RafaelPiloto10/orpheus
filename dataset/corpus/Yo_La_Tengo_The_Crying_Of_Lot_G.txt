What did I miss here?  
What can't you take anymore?  
Expecting a whisper,  
I heard the slam of a door  
You say that all we ever do is fight  
Gee, I don't know that that's true.  
Then I wonder, am I right?  
Or is that part of our problem?  
Maybe I'm out of my mind.  
Maybe I'm blocking out the truth.  
But it seems like just a little thing,  
Like you don't want to listen,  
And I can't shut up.  
You don't have to smile at me.  
We don't have to talk.  
All that I ask is you stop,  
And remember, it isn't always this way.  
You have the problem,  
It comes with our private jokes.  
When you're in a fury,  
Laughter gets stuck in my throat.  
Sometimes I wonder why we have so much trouble  
Cheering each other up sometimes,  
When one or the other of us is down.  
Instead it's like, when you're in a bad mood  
I look at you and I say, maybe she's knows something  
I don't know, maybe I should be upset.  
You don't have to smile at me  
We don't have to talk.  
All that I ask is you stop  
And remember, it isn't always this way.  
The way that I feel  
When you laugh  
Is like laughing.  
The way that I feel  
When you cry  
Is so bad.
