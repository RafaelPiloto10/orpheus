It was a movement of the people, like many times before,  
Who stood up for peace and sat down for war.  
They ran from the ways, the old school ways  
Fight those different, kill to be saved.  
  
These theories came straight from their minds,  
Their hearts left trembling, deep down inside  
Well I know, now know, I know , now know.... what lies beneath...  
  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades.  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades.  
  
Let's move to the middle, embrace one and all,  
See the beauty through the skin of the Aboriginal.  
If your friend has fear, then help him to heal,  
Show him the difference gives this world appeal.  
  
Well we are so lucky today  
The earth as our playground - it's culture to amaze.  
Well I know now know I know now know.. what lies beneath...  
  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades...  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades...  
  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades...  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades...
