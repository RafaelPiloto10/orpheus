(America, America, America, America)  
Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain  
For purple moutain majesties above thy fruited plain!  
America, America, God shed His grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea  
  
(Oh beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years)  
(Thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears)  
America, America, God shed His grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea
