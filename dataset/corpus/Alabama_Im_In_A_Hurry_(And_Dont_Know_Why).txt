I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.  
  
Don't know why  
I have to drive so fast  
My car has nothing to prove  
It's not new  
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2  
  
Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why  
  
Can't be late  
I leave plenty of time  
Shaking hands with the clock  
I can't stop  
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock  
  
Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why  
  
I hear a voice  
That say's I'm running behind  
I better pick up my pace  
It's a race  
And there ain't no room  
For someone in second place.  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
