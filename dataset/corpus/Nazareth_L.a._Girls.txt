Two bucks an hour  
You can hire a car  
You can go most anywhere  
That depends on who you are  
You can be your own boss  
Takin' your own time  
The sun shines all the time  
California girls look fine  
You can truck on down the strip any time of night  
Pull an L.A. Lady to treat you right  
Stay home call her on the phone  
Sayin' come on over baby I hate to be alone  
L.A. Girls in the sunshine  
L.A. Girls in the rain  
I want to tell ya, gonna go back again  
I'm gonna go back again  
Every one's in movies  
And every one's a star  
But most of them are fillin' in time  
Workin' in some bar  
They sure don't live in Bellaire  
Like they planned to be  
Their names ain't in the sidewalk  
For everyone to see  
But you can truck on down the strip any night  
Pull an L.A. Lady to treat you right  
Stay home call her on the phone  
Sayin' come on over baby I hate to be alone  
L.A. Girls in the sunshine  
L.A. Girls in the rain  
I want to tell ya, gonna go back again  
I'm gonna go back again  
Word gets 'round the band's in town  
They're bustlin' 'round the hall  
Readin' last months Rolling Stone  
Talkin' Rock and Roll  
They got all the answers  
For everything you say  
And even if you pass them by  
They gonna tell you anyway  
But you can truck on down the strip any time of night  
Pull an L.A. Lady's gonna treat you right  
Stay home call one on the phone  
Sayin' come on over baby I hate to be alone  
L.A. Girls in the sunshine  
L.A. Girls in the rain  
I want to tell ya, gonna go back again  
I'm gonna go back there again
