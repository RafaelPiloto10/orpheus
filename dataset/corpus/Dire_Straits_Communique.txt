They want to get a statement for jesus' sake  
It's like a talking to the wall  
He's incommunicado no comment to make  
He's saying nothing at all  
  
But in the communique you know he's gonna come clean  
Think what he say  
Say what he means  
Maybe on Monday he got something to say  
  
Communication  
Communique  
Communique  
  
Maybe he could talk about the tricks of the trade  
Maybe he could talk about himself  
Maybe he could talk about the money that he made  
Maybe he'd be saying something else  
  
But in the communique you know he's gonna come clean  
Think what he say,  
Say what he means  
Maybe on monday he got something to say  
  
Communication  
Communique  
Communique  
  
And now the rumors are flying  
Speculation rising  
Say that he's been trying someone else's wife  
Somebody at the airport  
Somebody on the phone  
Says he's at the station and he's coming on the noon  
Then we get the story a serious breeze  
And a photograph taken in the hall  
You don't have to worry with the previous release  
Right now, he's saying nothing at all  
But in the communique you know he's gonna come clean  
Think what he say  
Say what he means  
Maybe on Monday he got something to say  
  
Communication  
Communique  
Communique
