Go ahead  
Go ahead  
And smash it on the floor  
Take whatever's left  
And take it with you out the door  
  
See if I cry  
See if I shed a single sorry tear  
I can't say  
That it's been that great  
No  
In fact it's been a wasted year  
  
Everybody sees and everyone agrees  
That you and I are wrong  
And it's been that way too long  
Take it as it comes  
And be thankful when it's done  
There's so many ways to act  
And there's many shades of black  
There's so many shades of black  
There's so many shades of black  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Let it out  
Lett it all out  
Say what's on your mind  
You can kick and scream  
And shout and say things  
That are so unkind  
  
Yeah  
See if I care  
And see if I stand firm  
Or if I fall  
'Cause in the back of my mind  
And on the tip of my tongue  
Is the answer to it all  
  
Everybody sees and everyone agrees  
That you and I are wrong  
And it's been that way too long  
Take it as it comes  
And be thankful when it's done  
There's so many ways to act  
And there's many shades of black  
There's many shades of black  
Yeah  
There's many shades of black  
  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Yeah  
Everybody sees and everyone agrees  
That you and I are wrong  
And it's been that way too long  
Baby take it as it comes  
And be thankful when it's done  
There's so many ways to act  
And you cannot take it back  
(Many shades of black)  
No  
You cannot take it back  
  
'Cause there's many shades of black  
(Many shades of black)  
You have many shades of black  
You have many  
(Many shades of black)  
You have many  
You have many shades of black  
  
'Cause there's many shades of black  
There's so many shades of black  
(Many shades of black)  
There's so many shades of black  
There's so many shades of black  
  
Yeah  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh
