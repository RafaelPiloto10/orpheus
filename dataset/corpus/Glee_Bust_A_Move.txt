This here's a tale for all the fellas  
Try to do what those ladies tell us  
Get shot down cause you're over zealous  
Play hard to get an females get jealous  
OK smartie, go to a party  
Girls are skantilly clad and showin' body  
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her  
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter  
New movie's showin' so you're goin'  
Could care less about the five you're blowin'  
Theater gets dark just to start the show  
When you spot a fine woman sittin' in the front row  
She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello,  
Come sit next to me you fine fellow"  
You run over there without a second to loose  
And what comes next, hey bust a move  
  
If you want it baby you've got it (repeat)  
Just bust a move  
If you want it baby you've got it (repeat)  
  
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry  
In five days from now he's gonna marry  
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can  
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man  
You say "neato" check your libido  
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo  
The bride walks down just to start the wedding  
And there's one more girl you won't be getting  
So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'  
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'  
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back  
And now you're feelin' really fine cus the girl is stacked  
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'  
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'  
Says she wants to dance to a different groove  
Now you know what to do just, bust a move  
  
If you want it baby you've got it  
If you want it baby you've got it  
Just bust a move  
If you want it baby you've got it  
If you want it baby you've got it
