Still reelin' from a relationship  
That left me torn in two  
Tryin' to find that first step  
That leads to someone new  
Gettin' me back together  
Didn't know it could be so hard  
But if I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start  
  
I need a new beginning  
And girl you fit right in  
Sometimes a new beginning  
Is found in an old friend  
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start  
  
There've been times when you and him  
Just couldn't get along  
I'd hear your knock and let you in  
Be your shoulder to cry on  
And now he's finally left you  
And I've find you in my arms  
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start  
  
I need a new beginning  
And girl you fit right in  
Sometimes a new beginning  
Is found in an old friend  
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start  
  
If I'm ever gonna mend this broken heart  
You look like a real good place to start
