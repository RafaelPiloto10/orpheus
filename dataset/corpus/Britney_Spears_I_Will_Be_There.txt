Oh yeah  
You don't have to say what's on your mind  
'Cause I know where you've been  
Give it up and leave it all behind  
And let me begin  
  
[Chorus]  
Come and hold my hand  
Let me show how friends should be  
I will make it alright  
Let me make it clear  
You can put your trust in me  
Yes I will be there  
  
[Chorus 2]  
When you need someone  
You just turn around  
And I will be there  
When you're feeling low  
Baby let me know  
And I will be there  
  
Won't you let me make it up to you  
Now you know where I am  
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do  
Just to love once again  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
Just take a stand  
I'll be here for you  
Now and forever  
Give one more chance  
  
To show you how much I care  
I'll be there  
When you need someone  
Just turn around  
  
And I will be there  
When you're in sorrow  
Just let me know and I will be there  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
I'll be there  
(I will be there)  
(I will be there)  
I will be there
