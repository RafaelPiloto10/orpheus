Now the season now the question  
Time to breathe a moments grace  
For the hunter and the hunted  
Taking time to break the pace  
  
Are you hopeful are you haunted  
By the ghost of Christmas past  
Face the future Undaunted  
Step aside or take your chance  
  
Run with the fox  
Into the wind on to the dawn of tomorrow  
Run with the fox  
Into the wild into the wild and the cold  
Beware of the rocks  
And be prepared prepare for love comes and goes  
Run with the fox  
  
Every year the revolution  
Won or lost before begun  
While we thrive on mass confusion  
Thus we walk before we run  
  
Run with the fox  
Into the wind on to the dawn of tomorrow  
Run with the fox  
Into the wild into the wild and the cold  
Beware of the rocks  
And be prepared prepare for love finally grows  
  
Let us live to tell our story  
Here on earth and out in space  
Forward on the road to glory  
History records the chase  
  
Have yourselves that certain Christmas  
Eat be glad and drink the wine  
Leave your sadness by the river  
Giving love and given time  
  
Across the ice of frozen lakes  
Run with the fox  
Along the lanes a lover takes  
Run with the fox  
Beneath the moon a Christmas moon  
Run with the fox  
And sing a tune a dreamers tune  
Run with the fox  
Across the bridge of many ways  
Run with the fox  
On to the planes where dreamers play  
Run with the fox
