Time has washed away  
And now I may wonder  
How did it all slip by  
Cause I always thought  
We had forever  
Future calls to me  
To take me away from things  
I don't want to leave behind  
Like I'm slipping away  
I can't hold on  
  
Find that path alone  
Crossroads lead me away  
But that's not what worries me  
I just want to know what's home  
  
Through it all  
My mind still wanders  
To the one who touched my soul  
Though her road leads away  
She's still my  
True love  
I could believe  
  
Will is not enough when all those  
Lost days stand in the way  
But she was  
My hopes and dreams my  
Whole world  
I could believe  
  
I still want to know  
Who can see for me  
Crossroads tell me  
  
Now you'll have to trade  
Your past away  
And find another day  
So is change a friend or an enemy  
  
Through what comes to pass  
I'll find my way  
I've seen it all before  
But is the best you can be  
The best thing to be  
Some people say  
You're just wasting time  
But that's not what worries me  
I just want to know what's home
