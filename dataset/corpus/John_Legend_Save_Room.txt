Say that you'll stay a little  
Don't say 'bye bye' tonight  
Say you'll be mine  
Just a little bit of love is worth a moment of your time  
Knocking on your door just a little  
So cold outside tonight  
Let's get a fire burning  
Oh, I know I keep it burning right  
If you stay, won't you stay, stay?  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love, save a little  
Save a little for me  
Won't you save a little?  
Save a little for me, oh  
  
This just might hurt a little  
Love hurts sometimes when you do it right  
Don't be afraid of a little bit of pain  
Pleasure is on the other side  
  
Let down your guard just a little  
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine  
Hold on to me, pretty baby  
You will see I can be all you need  
If you stay, won't you stay, stay?  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love, save a little  
Save a little for me  
Won't you save a little?  
Save a little for me, oh  
  
(pa ya pa pa)  
(pa ya pa pa)  
(pa ya pa pa)  
(da da da)  
  
Oh, come on  
Make time to live a little  
Don't let this moment slip by tonight  
You'll never know what you're missing till you try  
I'll keep you satisfied  
If you stay, won't you stay, stay?  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love, save a little  
Save a little for me  
Won't you save a little?  
Save a little for me, oh  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love  
Save a little, save a little for me  
Won't you save a little?  
Save a little for me
