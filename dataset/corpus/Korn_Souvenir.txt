I never knew what I was gonna be  
Somebody saw what I couldn't see  
And it did me up now  
I never thought I could be worthy of  
Lovin' under the sky above  
Don't let the wonderful  
Why does everybody have to fit in  
You should feel comfortable in the skin  
Just like me I am the  
  
Souvenir of sadness  
Melting to the madness  
Hands where you can feel this  
Anyone who has this  
  
Stand up! Nobody's trying to save you  
Speak up! Nobody's waiting to see you  
Wake up! Nobody's trying to play you  
Let me make it then you'll have this  
Back up! Nobody to destroy you  
Now this! Nobody else to be this hard  
Go this! Whatever's wrong with your head  
Love is my souvenir of sadness  
  
They never knew what I was gonna say  
Punch me and kick me and drown away  
Now you know you are so  
Now look at me what do you have to say  
Never give up for you anyway  
You know who you are so  
Now look at me what do you have to say  
Never give up for you anyway  
Happy child look at that  
  
Souvenir of sadness

Wake up! Nobody's trying to play you  
Let me make it then you'll have this  
Back up! Nobody to destroy you  
Now this! Nobody else to be this hard  
Go this! Whatever's wrong with your head
