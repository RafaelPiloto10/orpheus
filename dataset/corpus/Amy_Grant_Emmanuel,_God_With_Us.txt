We dim the light.  
We stoke the fire.  
We breathe the evergreen.  
Young ones wait  
  
While the old ones make up  
Tales of how it used to be.  
China dolls,  
Candy corn,  
  
Painted wooden toys,  
Treasures found  
To the wondrous sound  
Of carolling the Savior  
  
Born to us on Christmas morn.  
Emmanuel, God with us,  
Emmanuel!  
Emmanuel, God with us,  
  
The son of Israel.  
And still he calls  
Through the night,  
Beyond the days of old.  
  
A voice of peace  
To the weary ones,  
Who struggle with the human soul.  
All of us,  
  
Travellers,  
Through a given time.  
Who can know  
What tomorrow holds?  
  
But over the horizon,  
Surely you and I will find.  
  
Emmanuel, God with us,  
Emmanuel!  
Emmanuel, God with us,  
  
The son of Israel.  
And the years they come,  
And the years they go,  
Though we may forget somehow  
  
That the child once born in Bethlehem  
Is still among us now.  
(Emmanuel....)  
(Emmanuel, God with us.  
The son of Israel.)  
  
Emmanuel, God with us, (Emmanuel.)  
Emmanuel! (Emmanuel.)  
Emmanuel, God with us, (Emmanuel.)  
  
The son of Israel. (Israel.)  
The son of Israel.  
The son of Is...Israel. (Son of Israel.)
