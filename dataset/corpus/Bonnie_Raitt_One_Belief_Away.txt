Last night I thought I found you  
I saw it in a dream  
I was tangled in the rushes, baby  
You were caught up in the stream  
And the more I tried to reach you  
The more you slipped away  
And when I woke up in the darkness  
I was callin' out your name  
  
[Chorus]  
You and we dance around it  
Why is the truth so hard to say  
We long for true love, well  
We've found it, it's just  
One Belief Away  
  
There's a shadow in the garden  
And it's coiled around our hearts  
Won't you help me to believe you, baby  
Won't you show me where to start  
  
The more I try to reach you  
The more you slip away  
I want to wake up in the darkness  
And hear you callin' out my name  
  
[Chorus]
