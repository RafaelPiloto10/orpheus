I think it's funny, just a sad song  
He likes his money, now you ain't got none  
So is it mighty strange  
Now that you are so broke  
Don't try to make it man  
You haven't got a home  
  
[Chorus]  
Remember when I was in trouble  
You put down the phone  
And anywhere you go, you go alone  
  
It was a crush change, the money sure flew  
You had a flash name, imagine you're broke  
But now it's breaking up there's no one near you  
Don't try for me to call  
Cause I won't hear you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Well, don't you sit around, start to move on  
Your life is broken down, so get a new one  
And if you make it by and kiss the good life  
Why don't you make it right  
Just look at this time  
  
[Chorus]
