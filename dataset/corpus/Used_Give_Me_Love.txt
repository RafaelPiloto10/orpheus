I lived out more than a little,  
Give my insides out til there's nothing left to see  
Stepped down, left in the middle of the mess you made  
The mess I used to be  
So give me love  
Give me every little bit of your broken heart  
My heart skips a beat  
So give me love, give me love love love  
My insides out, there's nothing left to see  
  
Now I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own  
I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own  
  
From my head all the way to my feet  
Strange is what I've become  
Would you ask for a little more of me  
Why can't I find it?  
  
Empty, where my heart used to be  
Now I'm looking in the mirror, I see this monster that is me  
  
More than a little  
Just to watch you bleed leave broken words behind  
Give me love, give me love love love  
Insides out, til there's nothing left to see  
  
Now I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own  
I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own  
  
From my head all the way to my feet  
Strange what I've become  
Would you ask for a little more of me  
Why can't I find it?  
  
Empty, where my heart used to be  
Now I'm looking in the mirror, I see this monster that is me  
  
Now I needed to find, now I need to find out on my own  
I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own  
Now I needed to find, now I need to find out on my own  
Now I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own  
On my own, on my own, on my own  
  
From my head all the way to my feet  
Strange what I've become  
Would you ask for a little more of me  
Why can't I find it?  
  
Empty, where my heart used to be  
Now I'm looking in the mirror, I see this monster that is me
