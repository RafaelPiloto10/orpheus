It's getting colder  
I'm standing looking down  
There's not a sound around the town  
It's getting colder  
Colder  
  
I would show everything  
But everything is too extreme  
We'll wait and see the entropy  
At the end when we all stop lying but the sky is falling down  
And there's an angel on the ground  
  
It's getting colder  
I'm standing looking down  
There's not a sound around the town  
It's getting colder  
  
The sky is falling down  
And there's an angel on the ground  
It's getting colder  
I'm standing looking down  
There's not a sound around the town  
It's getting colder  
  
The sky is falling down  
And all the people on the ground  
Are getting colder  
I'm standing looking down again  
But you can't help me now  
I'm getting colder
