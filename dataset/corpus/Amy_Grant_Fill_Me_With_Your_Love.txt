But there are so many  
Who don't know the reason  
Their lives are wasting away  
Just souls without purpose  
They wonder in darkness  
Without a thought for the day  
Well, I'm no Savior  
I'm just a window  
Through which Your sweet love light can shine  
So clean out the corners of my darkened pane  
And fill me with Your love again  
  
Fill me with Your love again  
Fill me with Your love again  
I open my heart and soul for you to enter me  
And fill me with Your love again  
  
Fill me with Your love again  
Fill me with Your love again  
I open my heart and soul for you to enter me  
And fill me with Your love again  
I open my heart and soul for you to enter me  
And fill me with Your love again
