Time is truly wastin'  
There's no guarantee  
Smile's in the makin'  
You gotta fight the powers that be  
Got so many forces  
Stayin' on the scene  
Givin' up all around me  
Faces full a' pain  
I can't play my music  
They say my music's too loud  
I kept talkin about it  
I got the big run around  
When I rolled with the punches  
I got knocked on the ground  
With all this bullshit going down  
  
Time is truly wastin'  
There's no guarantee  
Smile's in the makin'  
You gotta fight the powers that be  
I don't understand it  
People wanna see, ya  
Those that got the answers  
Red tape in the way  
I could take you in easy  
That's just half the fun, oh boy  
Seeking satisfaction  
Keeps me on the run  
I can't play my music  
They say my music's too loud  
I kept talkin about it  
I got the big run around  
When I rolled with the punches  
I got knocked on the ground  
With all this bullshit going down  
Time is truly wastin'  
There's no guarantee  
Smile's in the makin'  
You gotta fight the powers that be  
  
If you I can - we got the power  
Fight it, got the power fight it...baby, baby  
Fight it, fight the power
