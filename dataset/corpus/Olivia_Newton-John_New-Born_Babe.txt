New-born babe  
Don't know nothing 'bout the ways of the world  
Or astronauts upon the moon, or witches on brooms  
New-born babe  
Don't know nothing 'bout the politics of people  
Or chess pieces, or old churches  
You just know your mother  
  
New-born babe  
Don't know nothing 'bout the way it's gonna be  
Or clown faces or masterpieces  
Or love affairs or rocking chairs  
I see you sleeping away, getting older every day  
  
New-born babe  
Don't know nothing 'bout the way it's gonna be  
Or clown faces or masterpieces  
Or love affairs or rocking chairs  
I see you sleeping away  
Oh, you're getting older every day
