Hark! How the bells, sweet silver bells  
All seem to say, "Throw cares away."  
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer  
To young and old, meek and the bold  
Ding, dong, ding, dong, that is their song,  
With joyful ring, all caroling  
One seems to hear words of good cheer  
From everywhere, filling the air  
Oh!, how they pound, raising their sound  
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale  
  
Gaily they ring, while people sing  
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here!  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas!  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas!  
  
On, on they send, on without end  
Their joyful tone to every home
