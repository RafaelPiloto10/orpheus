When the day breaks  
Something begins  
When your heart aches  
Do you give in?  
I heard that you were lonely  
One careful look shows you're lonely  
All night you'll fight  
With your mind, with your mind  
After lights out, don't make a sound  
Apple blossoms, come fallin' down  
Black and white sun shining brightly  
Shelter your eyes, hold on tightly  
All night you'll fight  
With your mind, with your mind  
Love thy neighbor  
You will understand  
Coffee flavor, yours or any brand  
I heard that you were lonely  
Nothing is real when you're lonely  
All night you'll fight  
With your mind, with your mind
