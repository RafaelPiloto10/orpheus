The wolves, my love, will come  
Taking us home where dust once was a man  
Is there life before a death?  
Do we long too much?  
(And never let in)  
  
[Chorus]  
Howl! Seven days to the wolves  
Where will we be when they come?  
Seven days to the poison  
And a place in heaven  
Time drawing near us  
They come to take us  
  
This is my church of choice  
Last drinks and death in last sacrifice  
For the rest, I have to say to you  
I will dream like the god  
(And suffer like all the dead children)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is where heroes and cowards part ways  
  
Light the fire, feast  
Chase the ghosts, give in  
Take the road less traveled by  
Leave the city of fools  
Turn every poet loose  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Hero  
Coward  
No more
