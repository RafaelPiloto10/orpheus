All he could think about was I'm to young for this  
Got my whole life ahead  
Hell I'm just a kid myself  
How'm I gonna raise one  
  
All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke  
So much for ditching this town and hanging out on the coast  
Oh well, those plans are long gone  
  
And he said  
There goes my life  
There goes my future, my everything  
Might as well kiss it all good-bye  
There goes my life  
  
A couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later  
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator  
Oh yeah...he loves that little girl.  
  
Momma's waiting to tuck her in  
As she stumbles up those stairs  
She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear  
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls  
  
He smiles  
There goes my life  
There goes my future my everything  
I love you, daddy goodnight  
There goes my life  
  
She had that Honda loaded down  
With Abercrombie clothes and fifteen pairs of shoes and his American express  
He checked the oil and slammed the hood, said your good to go  
She hugged them both and headed off to the west coast  
  
He cried  
There goes my life  
There goes my future, my everything  
I love you  
Baby good-bye  
  
There goes my life  
There goes my life
