We fought the truth  
As long as we lived our love  
Fearing all the solutions we found  
We drowned ourselves  
In the lake of tears theat we cried  
'Til we found out that love is its ground  
Call me a fool, but I'm not  
Our love changed - and love changed me  
I kept waiting for your answer  
Then I found out the answer was you  
No more riddles of my longings  
Now I Know that the answer is you  
I want to thank you, my creator  
I still wouldn't live my life without you
