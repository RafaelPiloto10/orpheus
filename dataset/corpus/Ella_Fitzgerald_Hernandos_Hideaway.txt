I know a dark, secluded place  
A place where no one knows your face!  
A glass of wine, a fast embrace  
It's called Hernando's Hideaway, a-way!  
  
All you see are silhouettes  
And all you hear are castanets  
And no one cares how late it gets  
Not at Hernando's hideaway, a-way!  
  
At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go  
You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know  
But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of  
You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love  
Just knock three times and whisper low  
That you and I were sent by Joe  
Then strike and match and you will know  
You're in Hernando's hideaway, a-way!  
  
I know a dark, secluded place  
A place where no one ever knows your face!  
Wine is fine with a fast embrace  
Hernando's Hideaway -away!  
  
At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go  
You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know  
But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of  
You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love  
Just knock three times and whisper low  
That you and I were sent by Joe  
Then strike and match and you will know  
You're in Hernando's hideaway!
