Growing up on Cinnamon Street. Everywhere you look there are lots of people to
meet, it's seven o'clock, the breakfast treat. Now the schoolbus is here,
hurry up and grab a seat. All the dreams are tiny ones, another week has just
begun on Cinnamon Street.  
  
There was a girl on Cinnamon Street, the same age as me, we shared the
curiosity. I won her heart 'cause I could play guitar. I promised her heaven
at once and later all the stars. But it all remained the same 'cause things
can never change on Cinnamon Street.  
  
I can hear my heartbeat the very first time we made love, life was a lazy rest
in the sun. Later we went dancing, staying up all night long - playing all our
favourite songs, Cinnamon songs: Oh oh na na na na na.  
  
I say goodbye to Cinnamon Street. Springtime is here and the air is so dry and
sweet. I walk in a cloud, the smell of cinnamon bread, it's in my blood since
the day I was born 'til I wake up... dead. And the sun is smiling gently, a
funny shade of red, Cinnamon Street.  
  
I still feel my heartbeat the very first time we made love, life was a lazy
day in the sun. Later we went dancing, hanging out all night long - singing
all our favourite songs, Cinnamon songs: Oh oh na na na na na na.
