I'm called a cow  
I'm not about  
To blow it now  
For all the cows  
  
It's funny how money allows all to browse  
And be endowed  
This wish is true it falls into pieces new  
The cow is you  
  
My kind has all run out, as if kinds could blend  
Some time if time allows, everything worn in  
Like it's a friend  
  
I said you're all a painted doll and it caused  
The walls to fall  
How far is he?  
Impatiently  
That's as far as far can be
