Do you ever feel like a plastic bag  
Drifting through the wind  
Wanting to start again  
  
Do you ever feel so paper thin  
Like a house of cards  
One blow from caving in  
  
Do you ever feel already buried deep  
Six feet under screams  
But no one seems to hear a thing  
  
Do you know that there's still a chance for you  
'Cause there's a spark in you  
  
You just gotta ignite the light  
And let it shine  
Just own the night  
Like the fourth of July  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show 'em what your worth  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
Baby you're a firework  
Come on let your colors burst  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
You're gonna leave 'em falling down down down  
  
You don't have to feel like a waste of space  
You're original, cannot be replaced  
If you only knew what the future holds  
After a hurricane comes a rainbow  
  
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed  
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road  
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow  
And when it's time, you'll know  
  
You just gotta ignite the light  
And let it shine  
Just own the night  
Like the fourth of July  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show 'em what your worth  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
Baby you're a firework  
Come on let your colors burst  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe-awe-awe  
  
Boom, boom, boom  
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon  
And it's always been inside of you you you  
And now it's time to let it through  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show 'em what your worth  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
Baby you're a firework  
Come on let your colors burst  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe awe awe
