If You (God) do really exist  
You can hear me begg  
This one little human being here  
Wants to talk with you, step forward and ahead  
  
You gave me a life  
Now show me how to live with it  
Because I'm all lost in directions  
And I need your help  
  
If You truly are there (Beyond the Heaven)  
Answer to my prays, would you please  
On my knees, waiting it so thirsty like  
(I) haven't been drinking in years  
  
If You (God) do really exist  
You can hear me begg  
This one little human being down here  
Wants to talk with you, step forward and ahead  
  
You gave me a life  
Now show me how to live with it  
Because I'm all lost in directions  
And I need your help  
  
Lord, all my life I've been owned to you  
Not an single word against yours  
Lord, all I've tried is live under your eyes  
And been a good boy  
  
But you have seen me  
(All the time)  
So you know, that I've fallen as well  
(So forgive me)  
  
If You (God) do really exist  
You can hear me begg  
This one little human being here  
Wants to talk with You, step forward and ahead  
I need to talk with You  
I need to talk with You  
Just to talk with You
