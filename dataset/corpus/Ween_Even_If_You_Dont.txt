I'm goin' crazy trying to keep you sane  
Takin' my prescriptions, forging my name  
I was happy this morning, ya finally got yourself dressed, eatin all the bacon  
Its okay i was still impressed  
  
I love you, even if you don't  
you've got your knife up to my throat, what do you want to see with me?  
  
Rooting though the garbage for treasures in the trash pile, seein my
expression will always make you smile  
Please don't touch my phone book, my friends are getting pissed off  
Ya wake em I'm the morning, I'm acting like a jerkoff  
  
I love you, even if you don't  
you've got your knife up to my throat, what do you want to see with me?  
  
I love you, even if you don't  
you've got your knife up to my throat, what do you want to see with me?  
  
I love you, even if you don't  
you've got your knife up to my throat, what do you want to see with me?  
  
Ooh-yeah-yeah
