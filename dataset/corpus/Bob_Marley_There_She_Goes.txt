There she goes with the pieces from my heart  
There she goes and now my teardrops start  
And ere I go once again  
Tru deese loonely eartaches and pain  
  
That's all remain all remain  
Now I know love is a guessin' game  
She goes with the pieces from my heart  
There she goes and now my teardrops start  
  
Who's gonna put back the pieces to my broken heart  
Once again once again now I know this could be the end  
And she gone with the pieces of my heart  
There she goes and now my teardrops start  
  
And here I go once again  
Tru deese lonely eartaches and pains  
That's all remain  
Now I know this could be the end  
  
She goes wid de pieces from my eart  
There she goes and now my teardrops start
