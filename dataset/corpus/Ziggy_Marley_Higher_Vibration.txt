These city walls  
Are like a prison  
Why we gotta keep on living  
With our backs against the wall  
  
We are creatures of love  
Victims of hate  
We gotta keep on living  
With our backs against the wall  
  
No No No  
Start living on a higher vibration  
Now we take it to the heights of creation  
  
Perfection of divinity  
Is everyone's duty  
Don't waste your time  
Living for the vanities  
We are creatures of faith  
Victims of destiny  
Which we create  
  
Now we living on a higher vibration  
'Cause we take it to the heights of creation  
  
You know what I'm talking 'bout  
don't tell me no  
Baby I could scream and shout  
But I won't  
It's a human experience  
On another sphere  
Well, it's a human existence  
On another wavelength  
  
Listen to me now  
Now We living on a higher vibration  
Then we take it to the heights of creation  
  
Let me take you little higher  
And then you take me little higher
