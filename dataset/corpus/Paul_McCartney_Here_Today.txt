And if I said,  
I really knew you well what would your answer be?  
If you were here today.  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, here to-day.  
  
Well knowing you,  
You'd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart.  
If you were here today.  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, here to-day.  
  
But as for me,  
I still remember how it was before,  
And I am holding back these tears no more.  
  
Ooh ooh ooh. I love you, ooh.  
  
What about the time we met?  
Well, I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get.  
Didn't understand a thing,  
But we could always sing.  
  
What about the night we cried,  
Because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside?  
Never understood a word,  
But you were always there - with a smile.  
  
And if I say,  
I really loved you and was glad you came along.  
If you were here today.  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, for you were in my song.  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, here to-day.
