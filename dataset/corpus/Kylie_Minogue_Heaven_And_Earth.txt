I don't really want to be the one  
To tell you time is running out  
Because it's obvious  
Just a move with the right intention  
Is all that it takes  
  
I don't really need to be the one  
To tell you things are going wrong  
Because it's obvious  
But a step in the right direction  
Is all that you need  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't have to move heaven and earth  
You don't have to change overnight  
There's never been a better time  
To make up your mind  
And put this thing right  
  
I don't mean to say that we were wrong  
But we know we need some new attention  
But just look with a new dimension  
Is all that it takes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody knows where they can make  
A change or two  
To help the situation  
Just a step with a good intention  
Is all that it takes  
  
[Chorus: x2]
