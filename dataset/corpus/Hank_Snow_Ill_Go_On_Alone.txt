We're traveling down two different roads in world so far apart  
You want me yet there's something else before me in your heart  
You're wanting me to change my life the way you're living yours  
But I can't change I see no way you wanted me before  
  
If you don't want me like I am then please don't pity me  
If you can't change a little bit then why not set me free  
If we can't live together then it's best we live apart  
You'll go your way and I'll go mine we'll both make brand new start  
  
There's nothing we can do it seems we'll never get along  
With you believing like you do you say I live so wrong  
But I can't change my way of life I lived it much too long  
You either take me like I am or I'll go on alone  
  
So either say you want my love or take the way you live  
Remember though before you get you got to learn to give  
So if it change my life or go then go it's goin' be  
Cause I can't change my life when you want something more than me
