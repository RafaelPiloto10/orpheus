It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day  
And talk about the home town a million miles away  
Is the ice still on the river, are the old folks still the same  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And when the morning came, do you remember if she dropped a name or two  
Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all the games  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Is the landlord still a loser, do his signs hang in the hall  
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall  
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And when the talk ran high, did the look in her eye seem far away  
Is the old roof still leaking when the late snow turns to rain  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And looking at the rain, do you remember if she dropped a name or two  
Won't you say hello from someone, they'll be no need to explain  
And by the way, did she mention my name
