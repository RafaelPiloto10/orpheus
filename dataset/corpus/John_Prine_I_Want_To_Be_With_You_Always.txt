I lose my blues  
Only when I'm with you  
No one else can do  
You're in my heart to stay  
And when I'm gone and I'm all alone  
I'll be singing this song  
I want to be with you always  
  
I'd be happy dear  
If you could only be here  
And always be near you  
Forever and a day  
Then we'd travel far to some big shining star  
Just you and my guitar  
And stay there sweetheart for always  
  
I hope you feel the same  
You really want my name  
You'll be the one who's to blame  
If it works out wrong that day  
'Cause my love is true, my love's only for you  
I would never be blue  
If I can be with you always  
Then we'd travel far to some big shining star  
Just you and my guitar  
And stay there sweetheart for always
