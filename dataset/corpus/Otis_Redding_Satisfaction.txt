I can get no satisfaction  
I can get no satisfaction  
I have tried, I have tried  
I have tried, I have tried  
  
I can't get me no, ha, ha  
I can't get no, uh, now  
  
When I'm driving in my car  
And the man talks on the radio  
Keep tellin' me more and more  
About that useless information  
He's tryin' to mess up my imagination  
  
And I can get me no, no, no  
And I can get me no  
Hey, hey, hey  
What I say  
You gotta, gotta, gotta groovy  
We gotta have it, we gotta have it  
We gotta have it, we gotta have it  
Keep on grooving, keep on grooving  
We keep on grooving  
God, no, my, yeah  
  
I can get no satisfaction  
I can get no, no satisfaction  
I have tried, I have tried  
I have tried, I have tried, tried, tried  
I can't get me no, no, no  
And I can't get me no, no, no, no  
  
We gotta groove it, groove it, oh my now  
We keep on knockin', knockin' baby, yeah  
Au, gotta, gotta have it  
We gotta, keep, keep, ah  
  
Whatever, why won't you wait for time  
This little girl is tryin' to put me down  
I keep on runnin' round in my sleep  
I keep on messin' up any beat  
I keep on rockin', I try to find me  
Somebody to love me  
And give me some reaction  
And I can find nobody  
No, no, nobody  
Give me no faction, faction  
Faction got to have it  
Satisfaction, we got to have it  
Satisfaction, earlier in the morning  
Satisfaction, later in the evening  
Satisfaction, and don't make my
