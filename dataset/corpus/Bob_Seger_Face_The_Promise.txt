I've been down in the Delta workin' these fields  
Breakin my back, I need a better deal  
So long Mississippi, so long Alabam  
I want to face the promise of the Promised Land  
I've got fevered dreams, mighty plans  
I need a black top road, I need a wheel in my hands  
So long Arizona, so long desert sands  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  
I'm tired of this river, these nothin' nights  
I'm small towned out, I need city lights  
So long Allegany, so long Olean  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  
I'll need a world of changes, I need a  
Brand new space  
I need an Eldorado, that's got to be someplace  
There's a line inside I think I've crossed  
You better watch out now I'm gonna  
Be my own boss  
So long Massachusetts, so long Framingham  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land  
So long North Dakota you must understand  
I need to face the promise of the Promised Land
