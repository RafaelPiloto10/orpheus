Don't try to be anything else  
But what you are  
Don't try to do anything else  
But the things you do  
'Cause I had a dream  
About seven stars  
And the seven good things  
That you are to me  
  
The very reason I'm livin'  
Is just for lovin' you  
And the seasons are changin'  
Makin' it all come true  
'Cause with the spring  
And clearing skies  
Love's soft light  
Will fill my eyes for you  
  
Who fills my head  
With these dreams  
As I'm leaving my mind  
Seven new stars are born  
Seven are waiting to die  
  
The very reason I'm livin'  
Is just for lovin' you  
And the seasons are changin'  
Makin' it all come true  
'Cause I had a dream  
About seven stars  
And the seven good things  
That you are to me
