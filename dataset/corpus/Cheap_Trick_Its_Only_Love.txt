Lonely days and lonely nights  
Seeming so much longer with the phone lines  
Torn between decisions wrong or right  
Ooh I wish I knew the stars tonight  
'cause you could look around and see  
The moving pictures of my mind's eye  
  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
It's a wonder  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
  
There we meet at some forgotten point  
On the streets of new york or was it london town  
Maybe we were daydreaming out loud  
Or maybe we nowhere  
It doesn't matter now 'cause  
You mean more to me than any hope or any dream  
I know now  
  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
It's a wonder  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
  
When I say I miss you then I mean that I need you  
When I say I need you then I mean that I miss you now  
  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
It's a wonder  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
It's a wonder  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
It's a wonder  
It's only loveit's a miracle
