There's nothing left, there's nothing right  
There's nothing left, there's nothing right  
There's nothing left, right left right  
Up down up down up down up down  
  
All right all right  
You wind me up, you bring me down  
Your reputation is all over the town  
So long as you come home to me  
I ain't complaining  
  
You fool around, we scream and fight  
The way you are treating me, you know it ain't right  
But when you are making out with me  
I ain't complaining  
  
All right all right  
You're out all night, you sleep all day  
When I get home you're going out to play  
Oh, woman give me some time and everything's fine  
I ain't complaining  
  
You just don't care, we are in a Mess  
And the company you keep ain't the best  
But when you're lying there with me  
I ain't complaining  
  
It ain't no use, you playing it loose  
And thinking it don't matter to me  
It ain't fair at all  
You only have to call my name  
And I'll come running to you  
  
But when the chips are down  
A man can only take so much fooling around  
And if you don't come home to me  
I'll be complaining  
  
All right  
There's nothing left, there's nothing right  
Our situation ain't looking too bright  
'Cause I have taken all I'm Gonna take  
Without complaining  
  
It ain't no use playing it loose  
And thinking it don't matter to me  
It ain't fair at all  
You only have to call my name  
And I'll come running to you  
  
But when the chips are down  
A man can only take so much fooling around  
And if I don't come home to you  
You'll be complaining  
  
All right all right all right all right  
All right all right
