I've never been in love before  
Now all at once it's you  
It's you forevermore  
I've never been in love before  
I thought my heart was safe  
I thought I knew the score  
But this is wine  
That's all too strange and strong  
I'm full of foolish song  
And out my song must pour  
So please forgive this helpless haze I'm in  
I've really never been in love before  
But this is wine  
That's all too strange and strong  
I'm full of foolish song  
And out my song must pour  
So please forgive this helpless haze I'm in  
I've really never been in love before
