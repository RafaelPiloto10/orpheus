She was a foxy rocker, a roxy roller  
An unchained sex machine  
Slippin' slidin', electric glidin'  
And boy she was mean  
I said mean  
High class dealer, sippin' her tequila  
Comin' on pretty strong  
Real love stealer, rebel rousin' squealer  
She said go but I said no  
  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
  
Waiting at the back door, couldn't take it anymore  
Didn't know where she'd been  
She looked pretty neat, turnin' on the heat and only seventeen  
Seventeen  
Windin' her up, bringin' her down, she wanted it just the same  
Said stick around  
That's when I found I only had myself to blame  
  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
  
High class dealer, sippin' on tequila  
Comin' on really strong  
Rhythm stealer, rattle off squealer  
She said go but I said no  
  
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no  
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no  
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no  
I say no no no  
I say no no no  
I say no no  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No
