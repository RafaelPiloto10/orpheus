When I first met you  
My life turned a page  
Chapter one was how true love was made  
You taught me with your kiss  
Things about romance I missed  
You knew everything from A to Z  
What pleases you and what pleases me  
Girl when you touched me  
I began to understand, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
You, you wrote the book on love  
And I want to read every word  
So I know everything about you  
You, you wrote the book on love  
Girl I just can't get enough of your love  
I know you wrote the book on love  
  
Each time I hold you I find something new  
Cause I know what I love about you, baby  
Girl I discover you bring out the lover in me, yeah  
You're like a fire that burns in my soul  
Like a volcano, I'm ready to blow  
Cause every time I look at you  
I feel love I can't explain,oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I hear what your heart is saying to me  
I see the picture so clearly  
I'm thirsty for the knowledge  
True love brings  
What you're near me  
  
[Chorus]
