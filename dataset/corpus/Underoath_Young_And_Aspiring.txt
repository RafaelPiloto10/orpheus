So lets not even try you're right lets ball it up and throw it out the window  
It's becoming all so clear in my mind  
I've thought this through more like once or twice  
I feel that this is my last request to you  
  
Hold your breath  
Bottle it up and save it for the next one  
It's safe to say we've been riding this all night  
None of this will ever change your mind  
It's never saf to rely on borrowed time  
Now we're both undone and it's time to open up your eyes  
  
Consenquence it's our need in times like this  
Feeling free is our modern disease  
You're a classic disaster with a knack for losing  
Your exterior  
I'm so sick  
From staring at the mirror  
  
This all needs a break from you  
And I'm used to this  
  
I fear that I am just an end  
So you'll play the mistaken and I'll play the victim  
In our screenplay of desire and I'm still writing  
The letters I'll never send  
  
Running in circles I can't forget how many times  
I've played this in my mind  
  
Feeling free feeling free  
This is my panic this is my call to arms
