I am bottled fizzy water  
And you were shaking me up  
You are a fingernail running  
Down the chalkboard I thought I left in third grade  
Now my only consolation  
Is that this could not last forever  
Even though you're singing and thinking how well you've got it made  
  
Who are you?  
And will you be through  
Yeah, it's just a phase  
It will be over soon  
Yeah, it's just a phase  
Yeah, it's just a...phase  
  
Call it women's intuition  
But I think I'm on to something here  
Temporaryism has been the black plague  
And the Jesus of our age  
I know that I sound opinionated  
Maybe biased and quite possibly jaded  
But sooner than later they'll be throwing quarters at you on the stage  
  
Who are you?  
And will you be through  
Yeah, it's just a phase  
It will be over soon  
Yeah, it's just a phase  
Yeah, it's just a, phase  
  
And I am waiting for it to be over too
