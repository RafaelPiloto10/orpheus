What can you do? You'll never win  
Where will you go when night closes in?  
Where will it lead? Will it ever end?  
Where will it stop?  
Losing a friend isn't what we had in mind exactly  
All we need is a friend I guess  
With my midnight star to guide through  
Clouds of loneliness  
You knew someone but was it love?  
So many years, push came to shove  
You had a dream, so they had one too  
You turned away, they were untrue  
In our early days we were too willing  
At the time we had yet to arrive  
Many a man and a woman found  
Trying to stay alive  
Where will you go? What will you do  
When your whole world ain't talking to you?  
Maybe you think you will see the light  
Baby, it's time you hope it's right  
And I'm all dressed up to be somebody  
All I need is a friendly face  
With my midnight crowd to glide through  
Clouds of empty space  
Seems like every time we turn around  
What we see could be anyone's guess  
Many a man and a woman found in  
Clouds of loneliness
