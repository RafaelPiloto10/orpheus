Station Mir to ground control...  
Station Mir to anyone...  
Send a rescue ship and bring our asses home.  
Station Mir to ground control...  
Systems broke down, engines gone...  
End this mission or we'll all end up marooned...  
This is ground control to Station Mir.  
You guys are doing great  
And we're sorry that you stained your underwear  
So we'll try to send you up a few clean pairs.  
Ground control to Station Mir  
You'll be alright, there's nothing wrong...  
Did you hear me, Station Mir?  
You're not coming in that clear......  
Station Mir's made up in one tin can  
Coasting by the moon...  
Their engine doesn't cruise, We should send them up some booze
