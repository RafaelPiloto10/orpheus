I'm gonna make you bend and break (It sent you to me without wait)  
Say a prayer, but let the good times roll  
In case God doesn't show (Let the good times roll, let the good times roll)  
  
And I want these words to make things right  
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life  
Who does he think he is?  
If that's the worst you got, better put your fingers back to the key  
  
[Chorus]  
One night and one more time  
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great  
He tastes like you, only sweeter  
One night, yeah, and one more time  
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories  
See, he tastes like you, only sweeter, oh  
  
Been looking forward to the future  
But my eyesight is going bad  
In these crystal balls  
It's always cloudy except for  
When you look into the past  
One night stand  
(One night stand)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(They say)  
I only think in the form of crunching numbers  
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers  
Get me out of my mind  
Get you out of those clothes  
I'm a letter away  
From getting you into the mood  
Whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(One night, one more time)  
One night and one more time  
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great  
He tastes like you, only sweeter  
One night, yeah, and one more time  
(One night, one more time)  
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories  
(For the memories, for the memories  
See, he tastes like you, only sweeter
