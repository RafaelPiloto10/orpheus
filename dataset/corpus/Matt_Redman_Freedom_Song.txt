When Jesus comes he comes in power (echo)  
He pours down his spirit like a shower (echo)  
Repeat  
  
Chorus  
O you give us freedom and joy in your presence Lord  
In your presence we're free  
O let us shout and dance and lift up our habds and sing cause we are free  
And He loves to come a fill me up  
He loves to overflow my cup  
He loves to come and bring his touch to my heart  
  
He turns my mourning into dancing (echo)  
He turns my weeping into laughing (echo)  
repeat  
  
chorus 2x
