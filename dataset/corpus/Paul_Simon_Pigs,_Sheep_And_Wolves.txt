Big and fat  
Pig's supposed to look like that  
Barnyard thug  
Sleeps on straw and calls it a rug  
Yeah that's a rug, OK  
He's walking down the street  
And nobody's gonna argue with him  
He's a half-a-ton of pig meat  
  
Up in the hills above the farm  
Lives a pack of wolves  
Never did no harm  
Sleep all day  
Hunt till four  
Maybe catch a couple of rodents  
You know carnivore  
  
Sheep in the meadow  
Nibbling on some clover  
One of the sheep wanders over  
Sits by a rock  
Separated from the flock  
He's just sitting by a rock  
  
Where'd he go?  
I don't know  
Well he was here a minute ago  
I don't know  
Sheep's dead  
Got a gash as big as a wolf's head  
Oh God  
  
Big and fat  
Pig's supposed to look like that  
Wallowing in lanolin  
He's rubbing it into his pigskin  
Police going crazy  
Let's get him  
Let's get that wolf  
Let's get him  
Let's get that wolf  
Let's get him  
Let's kill him, let's get him  
Let's kill him  
  
Court-appointed lawyer wasn't very bright  
Oh maybe he was bright  
Maybe he just had a late night  
Yeah it was just a late night  
And he files some feeble appeal  
And the governor says forget it  
It's a done deal  
Election, I don't care, election  
Let's give that wolf a lethal injection  
Let's get him, yeah get him,  
Let's kill him, let's get him  
Let's kill him, let's get him, kill him  
Let's get him and kill him  
  
Whew, slow  
Here comes the media  
Setting up their camera  
Asking everyone's opinion  
About pigs, sheep and wolves  
  
Big and fat  
Pig's supposed to laugh like that  
This is hilarious  
What a great time  
I'm the pig who committed  
The perfect crime  
  
All around the world  
France, Scandinavia  
There's candle light vigils  
Protesting this behavior  
It's animal behavior  
Animal behavior  
It's pigs, sheep and wolves  
Pigs, sheep and wolves  
Pigs, sheep and wolves  
It's animal behavior  
It's pigs, sheep and wolves
