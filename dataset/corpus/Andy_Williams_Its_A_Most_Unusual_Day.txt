It's a most unusual day  
Feel like throwing my worries away  
As an old native-born Californian would say  
It's a most unusual day  
There's a most unusual sky  
Not a sign of a cloud passing by  
And if I want to sing, throw my heart in the ring  
It's a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
It's a most unusual time  
I keep feeling my temperature climb  
If my heart won't behave in the usual way  
Well, there's only one thing to say  
It's a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
I keep feeling my temperature climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb  
Till there is only one thing to say  
It's a most, most, most, most, most unusual, most unusual  
Most unusual da-ay-ay  
Most unusual da-ay
