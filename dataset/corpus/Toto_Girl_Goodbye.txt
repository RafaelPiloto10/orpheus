Well I'm out on the road, and the devil's got my soul  
And I'm looking for the Lord in New York City  
  
Yeah I'm out on the run, got some heat, got a gun  
If they don't find me soon, it'll be a damn pity  
  
So it's  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye  
It's so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes  
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye  
Must be in the way that she cries, must be in the way that she cries  
Must be in the way that she cries  
  
Oh there's smoke in the air and there's blood everywhere  
But I'm hoping that the white man don't recognize me  
  
I'm so sorry what I've done, and I say it not in fun  
When I tell you that there's no one left inside me  
  
And it's  
  
So it's
