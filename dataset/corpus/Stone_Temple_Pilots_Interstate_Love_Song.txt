Waitin' on a sunday afternoon for what I've read between the lines - Your lies  
Feelin' Like a hand in rusted shame. So do you laugh at those who cry - Reply?  
  
Leavin' On a southern train only yesterday you lied  
Promises of what I seemed to be only watched the time go by  
All of these things you said to me  
  
Breathing Is the hardest thing to do with all I've said and all that's dead
for  
You  
You lied - Goodbye  
  
Leavin' on a southern train only yesterday you lied  
Promises of what I seemed to be only watched the time go by  
All of these things I said to you
