Baby, will you be my girl  
Kristi, will you be my girl  
I'll take you to a better place,  
There's no pain and no disgrace in a perfect world  
  
We'll drive that ragtop cadillac  
We'll drive that ragtop cadillac  
Straight across the nevada line  
Radio playin' hair flying  
No turning back  
  
Chorus  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Baby, I live for times like these  
Give me a reason to believe  
  
For a moment times stands still  
For a moment times stands still  
I feel no shame, I feel no violence  
For the moment and in the silence  
I feel that peace.  
  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Baby, I live for times like these  
Give me a reason to believe  
  
Solo  
  
Sun rises in the east  
Sun rises in the east  
For a moment in your eyes,  
I catch a glimpse of a different life  
Smile at fate  
  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Baby, I live for times like these  
Give me a reason to believe  
  
There's no famous final scene, no movie starts  
No limousines, everything we'll leave behind  
There's no waiting on the other side  
Just you and me for a better place  
I swear I live for times like these  
You're all I need  
That's all I need  
You're all I need
