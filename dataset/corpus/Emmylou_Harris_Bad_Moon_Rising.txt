I see a bad moon rising  
I see trouble on the way  
I see earthquakes and lighting  
I see bad times today  
  
Now don't go 'round tonight  
For it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
I hear hurricanes a blowing  
I know the end is comin' soon  
I fear the river's overflowing  
I hear the voice of rage and ruin  
  
I hope you have got your things together  
Hope you are quite prepared to die  
Looks like we're in for nasty weather  
One eye is taken for an eye
