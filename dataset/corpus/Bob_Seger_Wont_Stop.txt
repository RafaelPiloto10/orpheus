You can cry if you want to, you can rage at the night  
You can blame all your wounds on the workd if you like  
YOu can drink from the bottle no ice and no glass  
You can lie in the mornin' and say it's our last  
But you won't stop there, no you won't stop there  
You can tell yourself different but you won't stop there  
  
You can study the ancients, you can learn every fact  
You can follow the cycles that leave and come back  
How everything changes, it's been ever thus  
One day you're a comet the next day you're dust  
But you won't stop there, no you won't stop there  
There's always the future and you won't stop there  
  
Tyrants and kings do their usual things  
And you try to stay out of their way  
Follow the truth and you'll find what you need every day  
  
There's always tomorrow, always a chance  
You can stand in the spotlight and not have to dance  
You can find something solid,stronger than steel  
And it might touch your heart 'cause it just  
Might be real  
But you won't stop there, no you won't stop there  
It's not in your nature and you won't stop there  
No you won't stop there, no you won't stop there  
There's always tomorrow so you won't stop there.
