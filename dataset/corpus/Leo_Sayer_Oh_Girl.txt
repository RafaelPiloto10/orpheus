Oh girl  
I'd be in trouble if you left me now  
Cause I don't know where  
To look for love  
I just don't know how  
Oh girl  
How I depend on you  
To give me love when I need it  
Right on time  
You would always be there  
  
[Chorus]  
All my friends call me a fool  
They say  
Let the woman take care of you  
So I  
Try to be hip and think like the crowd  
But not even the crowd  
Will help me now  
  
Oh girl  
Tell me what am I gonna do?  
Cause I know I got  
Such a guilty face  
Girl, I feel so out of place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh girl  
I guess I'll never know  
I could save myself  
A lot of useless tears  
Girl, I've gotta get away from here  
Oh girl  
Pain will double if you leave me now  
Cause I don't know where  
To look for love  
And I just don't know how
