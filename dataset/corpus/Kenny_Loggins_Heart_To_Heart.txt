You ain't crazy  
I ain't gonna lie anymore  
What you're feelin'  
there's a reason for  
I want to do right  
Oh, I gotta do right  
Do I love you?  
Oh, you know I've tried  
But what you're after  
You can't find in my eyes  
I want to do right  
Darlin'  
Tell the truth  
Don't turn away  
This is our last chance  
To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever?  
I don't know  
Maybe we're near the end  
Darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
One by one  
We're collecting lies  
When you can't give love  
You give alibis  
Now I'm gonna do right  
This time I gotta do right  
I don't want to leave  
I don't want to say good-bye  
But sooner or latter  
There comes a time  
When you gotta do right  
Darlin'  
Tell the truth  
Don't turn away  
This is our last chance  
To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever?  
I don't know  
Maybe we're near the end  
Darlin' how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
Why are you so torn apart?  
I need a little more lovin' in my heart  
People say that love will grow  
So how was I to know  
Love that's come through years and years  
Can't find a way back home anymore  
(SOLO)  
Darlin'  
Tell the truth  
Don't turn away  
This is our last chance  
To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever?  
I don't know  
But maybe we're near the end  
So darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
Does anything last forever?  
I don't know  
But maybe we're near the end  
So darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart
