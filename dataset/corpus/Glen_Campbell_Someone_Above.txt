See the birds unfolding on the tress see them blossom into leaves  
Wise men know someone above has made it so  
See the daffodil and crocus there as they bow their heads in prayer  
For they know someone above has made it so  
When the raindrops fall the flowers grow and the rivers kiss the sea  
But there'd be no rain no river flow if there live the fools like me  
Man can build his city plan his yard paint a picture called an art  
But I know someone above has made it so  
When the raindrops fall  
  
I know someone above has made it so
