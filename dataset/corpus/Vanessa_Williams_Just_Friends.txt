Here we are once again  
It's the same old story  
You and I, me and you  
Playin' we're just friends  
When are we gonna learn that we don't  
have a choice we both know how it ends  
So we just choose to pretend  
  
In a way it's all sad and very  
For the way that things have been  
We fall out of love and back in love again uuuh  
We'll go round and round and still say  
we're just friends.  
  
Gotta stop gotta chill  
Makes no sense to be falling  
You got her, I got him  
Should not even be calling  
We can try if we want  
but we don't have a choice  
About the way we feel  
It's hard to stop when something's real  
  
In a way it's all sad and very  
For the way that things have been  
We fall out of love and back in love again  
In a way it's all kinda scary  
The things that we can't admit  
We fall out of love and back in love again  
oh yeah  
We'll go round and round and still say  
we're just friends.  
  
Still got the charm and  
I miss that burn in my heart and  
I must stay away from your arms  
So I don't fall (Don't fall)  
Fall (Don't fall)  
Fall (Don't fall)  
Fall  
  
In a way it's all kinda scary  
The things that we can't admit  
We fall out of love and back in love again  
Yeah.  
We'll go round and round and still say  
We'll go round and round and still say  
We'll go round and round and still say we're just friends.  
(Still just friends)  
Just friends
