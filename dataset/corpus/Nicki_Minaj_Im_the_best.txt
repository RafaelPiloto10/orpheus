It was back in '07 did a couple of tapes  
Did a couple DVD's made a couple mistakes  
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape  
Now it's which World Tour should I go on and take  
See you told me I would lose but I won  
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun  
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me  
Australia, Sydney  
Might run up in Disney, out in L.A. with Lindsey  
Got the eye of the tiger, the lion of Judah  
Now it's me in my time, it's just me in my prime  
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gone see it in time  
Tell them bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind  
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas  
Then a private party at the Buckingham palace  
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial  
That's Young Money, Cash Money yeah I'm Universal  
  
[Chorus]  
I hear they comin' for me  
Because the top is lonely  
What the fuck they gon' say  
What the fuck they gon' say  
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it  
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it  
I'm the best, best, best, best  
I'm the best, best, best, best  
I'm the best  
  
I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch  
Now I'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house  
You could never understand why I grind like I do  
Mikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do  
'C-c-cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was cracked  
Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track  
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards  
I just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud  
All the girls will commend, as long as they understand  
That I'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win  
'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end  
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in  
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one  
You might get addressed on the second album  
Which means you can breath, tell that motherfucker say so  
To all my bad bitches, I can see your halo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ah, it's OK  
It's OK, long as you know  
Long as you know  
Long as you motherfuckers know  
I'm the best, best, best, best  
  
[Chorus]
