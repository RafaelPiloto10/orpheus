Some people seem to have it all  
Some people always have to crawl  
Some people pay to be abused  
Some people wind up destitute  
Some people search their souls for truth  
Some people try to be of use  
Some people pray before they kill  
Some people kill just for the thrill  
  
Some people follow one man's vision  
Some others die on television  
Some people build their homes on sand  
Some people live in garbage cans  
  
Some people think that life is dear  
Some people hope the end is near  
Some people fight for right to life  
Some people hate to stay alive  
Some people dream of life on Mars  
Some people end their life in cars  
Some people throw their lives away  
Some others go on holiday  
  
Some people follow one man's vision  
Some others die on television  
Some people build their homes on sand  
Some people live in garbage cans  
  
Some people live and love in vain  
Some people don't and go insane  
Some people always need to win  
Some other people love to sin  
Some people  
  
Some people breaking all their vows  
Some people slashing sacred cows  
Some people like to worship stars  
Some people think the world's a farce  
Some people try to make ends meet  
Some others end up kissing feet  
Some people find their Holy Grail  
Some other people go to hell  
  
Some people follow one man's vision  
Some others die on television  
Some people build their homes on sand  
Some people live in garbage cans  
  
Some people never catch their breath  
Some people drink themselves to death  
Some people seem to have it all  
Some people always have to crawl  
Some people pay to be abused  
Some people wind up destitute  
Some people search their souls for truth  
Some people try to be of use  
Some people
