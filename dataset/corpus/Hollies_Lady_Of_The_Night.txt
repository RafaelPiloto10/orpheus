Chilled to the bone I see a lady  
stalking like a black cat in the night  
Shivers down my spine my mind's racin'  
wondering why the lady's taken flight  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh oh lady of the night  
Oh oh lady of the night  
  
Can't be a dream, reality's no liar  
it's not my imagination running wild  
but to suddenly appear when I'm no high flier  
It's got me so confused but tantalized  
  
Don't be confused if you don't know what I'm saying  
I'm letting you in to what's happening my friend  
One of these nights she's gonna get you  
You'll experience just what I'm going through, yeah  
  
[Chorus]
