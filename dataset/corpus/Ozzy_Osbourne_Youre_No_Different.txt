How many times can you put me down  
Till in your heart you realize  
If you choose to criticize  
You choose your enemies  
  
Everything that I say and do  
In your eyes is always wrong  
Tell me where do I belong  
In a sick society  
  
You're no different to me  
You're no different  
No different to me  
  
Look at yourself instead o' looking at me  
With accusation in your eyes  
Do you want me crucified  
For my profanity  
  
Concealing your crimes behind a  
Grandeur of lies  
Tell me where do I begin  
If you think you're without sin  
The first to cast the stone  
  
Living my life in a way  
That I choose  
You say I should apologize  
Is that envy in your eyes  
Reflecting jealousy  
  
Tell me the truth and I'll admit  
To my guilt  
If you'll try to understand  
But is that blood that's on your hand  
From your democracy
