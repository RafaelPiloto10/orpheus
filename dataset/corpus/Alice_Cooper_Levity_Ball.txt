I got my invitation to the annual levity ball  
Seeing the location is within the mirrored room  
Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find  
I got into my evening wear and left my clothes behind  
I sat down at the stairway seven hours at a time  
Writing all of this poetry that I knew would never rhyme  
The memory I know I must have had when I came in  
Was of some place I'd never ever been  
And then in came a cake all decorated in my name  
With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name  
The clock was passing out from time to time  
I saw it all at the beginning of the ending of my first levity ball
