Back on my feet  
Another week is nearly over  
We gotta meet  
Now the beat is taking over  
  
I work harder now I'm done  
I want a little fun so tight  
I took all I have to do  
And now all I want is you tonight  
  
Oh-oh  
Let's rendezvous at sunset  
Take it through to sunrise  
We'll have a night we'll never forget  
We'll have the time, the time of our life  
  
Take me away  
From here and into heaven  
Need to escape  
And I want to go together  
  
When I'm oh so close to you  
You hold me like you do, so nice  
I can feel the rhythm now  
Gotta get on down tonight  
  
Oh-oh  
Let's rendezvous at sunset  
Take it through to sunrise  
We'll have a night we'll never forget  
We'll have the time, the time of our life  
  
Rendezvous at sunset  
Rendezvous  
Rendezvous at sunset  
Rendezvous  
  
When I'm oh so close to you  
You hold me like you do, so nice  
I can feel the rhythm now  
Gotta get on down tonight  
  
Oh-oh  
Let's rendezvous at sunset  
Take it through to sunrise  
We'll have a night we'll never forget  
We'll have the time, the time of our life  
  
Rendezvous at sunset  
Rendezvous  
Rendezvous at sunset  
Rendezvous
