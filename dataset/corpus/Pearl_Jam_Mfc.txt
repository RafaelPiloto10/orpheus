Sliding out of reverse into drive.  
This wheel will be turning right, then straight.  
Off in the sunset she'll ride.  
  
She can remember a time, denied.  
Stood by the side of the road.  
Spilled like wine now.  
She's out on her own and line high.  
  
There's no leaving here.  
Ask I'm an ear.  
She's disappeared now.  
  
They said that timing was everything.  
Made him want to be everywhere.  
There's a lot to be said for nowhere.  
  
There's no leaving here.  
Ask I'm an ear.  
He's disappeared now.  
There's no leaving here.  
Ask I'm an ear.  
Fuck it. We'll disappear now.
