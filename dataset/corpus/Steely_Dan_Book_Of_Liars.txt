Bye and bye now  
We'll get over  
The things we've done and the things we said  
But not just now when  
I can 't remember  
Exactly what it was I thought we had  
'Cause I waited so long girl and I came so far  
To find out you're not always who you say you are  
  
And there's a star in the book of liars by your name  
  
Santa Claus came in late last night  
Drunk on Christmas wine  
Fell down hard in the driveway  
Hung his bag out on the laundry line  
There's a cobra gunship for his golden boy  
And there's a Hello Kitty for his pride and joy  
  
And a silver star in the book of liars by your name  
They hung a star in the book of liars by your name  
  
Stars imploding  
The long night passing  
Electrons dancing in the frozen crystal dawn  
Here's one left stranded at the zero crossing  
With a hole in it's half-life left to carry on  
But now the world's much larger than it looks today  
And if my bad luck ever blows me back this way  
  
Then I'll just look in my book of liars for your name  
I'll just look in the book of liars for your name
