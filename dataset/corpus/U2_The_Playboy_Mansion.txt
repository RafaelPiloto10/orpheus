If coke  
Is a mystery  
Michael Jackson  
History  
If beauty is truth  
And surgery the fountain of youth  
What am I to do  
Have I got the gifts to get me through  
The gates of that mansion  
If OJ is more than a drink  
And a Big Mac bigger than you think  
If perfume is an obsession  
And talk shows confession  
What have we got to lose  
Another push and maybe we'll be through  
The gates of that mansion  
  
I never bought a lotto ticket  
I never parked in anyone's space  
The banks they're like cathedrals  
I guess casinos took their place  
Love come on down  
Don't wake her she'll come around  
  
Chance is a kind of religion  
Where you're damned for plain hard luck  
I never did see that movie  
I never did read that book  
Love come on down  
Let my numbers come around  
  
Don't know if I can hold on  
Don't know if I'm that strong  
Don't know if I can wait that long  
Till the colors come flashing  
And the lights go on  
  
Then will there be no time of sorrow  
Then will there be no time for shame  
And though I can't say why  
I know I've got to believe  
  
We'll go driving in that pool  
It's who you know that gets you through  
The gates of the Playboy mansion  
Playboy mansion  
The Playboy mansion  
  
Then will there be no time of sorrow  
Then will there be no time for pain  
Then will there be no time of sorrow  
Then will there be no time for shame
