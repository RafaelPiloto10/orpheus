Last night you helped me through,  
Took me to the lovers zone.  
I saw there, images  
Projected on a wall of stone.  
I stood inside Egyptian temples,  
I looked into eternal gardens,  
Lay on the shores of distant islands,  
Listening to the sea birds song of joy.  
  
Oh, I owe it all to you,  
You make me happy,  
Oh, I owe it all to you.  
  
Late last night, we were right  
Into some exotic scene.  
Everywhere, images  
Appearing on a giant screen.  
I stood inside a glass cathedral,  
I looked into the golden canyon,  
Lay by the lakes of holy water  
Glistening like a diamond in the light.  
  
Oh, I owe it all to you,  
You make me happy,  
Oh, I owe it all to you.
