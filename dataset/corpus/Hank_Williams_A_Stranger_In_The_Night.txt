Key of d  
(d) I'm lonesome for someone, to (g) kiss me good - (d) night,  
Just the way you used to (a7) do,  
My (d) achin heart needs someone, to (g) shine loves (d) light,  
For without you, Ill (a7) always be (d) blue.  
  
1st chorus  
(d) if I (g) don't have you, to (d) help me along,  
I (g) know I can never go (d) right,  
With - (g) out you beside me, to (d) show me the way,  
I'm lost, like a (a7) stranger in the (d) night.  
  
Like a lonely dove that flies, from pine to pine,  
My heart can't be gay and light,  
Like sightless eyes, that will never see the sun,  
I'm lost, like a stranger in the night.  
  
2nd chorus  
Theres no need for me, to even try,  
Nothin will turn out right,  
When I lost your love, I lost the will to live,  
And I'm lost, like a stranger in the night  
  
3rd chorus  
Like a broken heart, that's lost on lifes sea,  
Tho I pray with all my might,  
I know I can't face, to - morrow alone,  
And I'm lost, like a stranger in the night.
