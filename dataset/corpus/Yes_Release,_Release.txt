Have you heard before, hit it out, don't look back  
Rock is the medium of our generation  
Stand for every right, kick it out, hear you shout  
For the right of all of creation  
  
We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move  
The pressure's on is there lack of concentration  
  
Power defy our needs, lift us up, show us now  
Show us how amid the rack of confusion  
Drive in thoughts of high, satisfy, in a plan  
Set it out for all to understand it  
  
We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move  
The pressure's on is there lack of concentraion  
  
Lost and wondering, maybe, how it is  
Seems to me, it's as simple as this  
No matter, where you go, you're going to find  
You won't see me in front, but you can't leave me behind  
  
Power at first to the needs of each others' days  
Simple to lose in the void sounds of anarchy's calling ways  
All unaccounted for in the craziness of power  
In the craziness  
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your brother  
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your sister  
Release, release, enough controllers  
Show some signs of appreciated loyalties  
Release, release, enough controllers  
Show some signs of appreciated loyalties  
  
Straight jacket, freedom's march, is it all, far beyond  
Our reason of understanding  
Campaign everything, anti-right, anti-left  
Anticipate the love of creation  
  
Stand for every right  
Kick it out, hear you shout  
Further the right  
Further the right  
Further the right  
Of all of creation  
  
Power at first to the needs of each others' days  
Simple to lose in the void sounds of anarchy's calling ways  
All unaccounted for in the craziness of power  
In the craziness  
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your brother  
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your sister  
Release, release  
Release, release  
Release, release  
Release, release
