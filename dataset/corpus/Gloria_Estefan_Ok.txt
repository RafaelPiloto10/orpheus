Ok, well, what's it all about  
It's allright to change your mind  
But whenever you found what you must find  
Just remember, I'm holding on the line  
So take advice from an old friend  
To the heart you must be true  
While you're doing all the things you do  
Know that always, I'm in love with you  
  
And it's hard for me to stay away  
When my emotions so alive  
So I try to live just day to day  
Never knowing where love's leading us to  
Is there no end, is there no end  
For will our hearts join over and over again, again  
  
Sometimes I cannot understand what is going on inside  
Why you're always, always on my mind  
'cause forever is such a long, long time  
To awake, so may I make it clear  
Love is never win or lose  
It isn't something we can even choose  
When true passion has slowly lit the fuse  
  
And it's hard for me to stay away  
When my emotions's so alive  
So I try to live just day to day  
Never knowing where love's  
Leading us to  
Is there no end, is there no end  
For will our hearts join over and over again, again  
  
Ok, well, what's it all about  
It's allright to change your mind  
But whenever you found what you must find  
Just remember, I'm holding on the line  
So take advice from an old friend  
To the heart you must be true  
While you're doing all the things you do  
Know that always, I'm in love with you
