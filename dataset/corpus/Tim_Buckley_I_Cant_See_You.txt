Summer princess, midnight maiden  
When I first saw you I just breathed  
Into your smile my past went fadin'  
Inside your voice, my mind was sheathed  
In lost lagoon, we waited, wadin'  
Along the streets we went paradin'  
Never looking back to where we'd been  
  
Autumn temptress, sundown angel  
Inside your blood you aren't so young  
I came to you a loving vandal  
And heard your heart and touched your tongue  
Day became a lighted candle  
Sky fell down beneath your sandal  
In your eye I began to spin  
  
Winter harlot, moontime lover  
I can't speak when I feel this way  
Don't keep your feelings undercover  
Tell me what you want today  
Don't leave me in the air to hover  
Sing it out don't make me suffer  
Don't be ashamed love is no sin  
  
Springtime woman, sunrise girl  
I am hiding behind the sea  
Trick or treat, the Hallowe'en world  
Hide and seek but you can't catch me  
I won't chase you until you hurl  
Your wing to me, and make me twirl  
You're alive underneath my skin
