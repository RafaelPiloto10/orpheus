Were up at Camp Menzies. The camp of  
Our dreams, were streams let me ender  
And sparkers and gleames. So come on and join us. For we are never blue.  
Be a member of our happy, happy, crew you too.  
  
At night round the camp fire. We laugh  
And we sing. Give a cheer for Camp Menzies  
And let the echoes ring. We'll cheer  
For our campers our garden leaders to.  
We'll cheer for you and you we do.
