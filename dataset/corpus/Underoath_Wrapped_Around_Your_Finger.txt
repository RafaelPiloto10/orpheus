You consider me the young apprentice  
Caught between the Scylla and Charibdes  
Hypnotized by you if I should linger  
Staring at the ring around your finger  
  
I have only come here seeking knowledge  
Things they would not teach me of in college  
I can see the destiny you sold  
Turning into a shining band of gold  
  
I'll be wrapped around your finger  
I'll be wrapped around your  
I'll be wrapped around your finger  
I'll be wrapped around your  
  
Mephistopheles is not your name  
I know what you're up to just the same  
I will listen hard to your tuition  
You will see it come to it's fruition  
  
I'll be wrapped around your finger  
I'll be wrapped around your  
I'll be wrapped around your finger  
I'll be wrapped around your  
  
Devil and the deep blue sea behind me  
Vanish in the air you'll never find me  
I will turn your face to alabaster  
Then you'll find your servant is your master  
  
Oh, you'll be wrapped around my finger  
I'll be wrapped around your  
You'll be wrapped around my finger  
I'll be wrapped around your  
You'll be wrapped around my finger  
I'll be wrapped around your  
You'll be wrapped around my finger  
I'll be wrapped around your finger
