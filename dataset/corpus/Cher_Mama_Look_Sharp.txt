Mama look sharp  
  
Momma, hey momma  
Come looking for me  
I'm here in the meadow  
By the red maple tree  
Momma, hey momma  
Look sharp  
Here I be  
Hey, hey momma, look sharp  
Them soldiers they fired  
Oh ma did we run  
But when we turned around  
The battle begun  
Then I went under  
Oh ma, am I done  
Hey, hey momma, look sharp  
My eyes are wide open  
My face to the sky  
Is that you, I'm hearing  
In the tall grass near by  
Ah momma come find me  
Before I do die  
Hey, hey momma, look sharp  
I'll close your eyes, my Billy  
Those eyes that can not see  
And I'll bury you, my Billy  
Beneath the maple tree  
And never again  
Will you whisper to me  
Hey, hey, oh momma, look sharp
