Carry on  
  
So what can I do, what can I say  
Do I have to stand and  
Watch you walk away  
I know there's got to be  
A better way  
I just can't go on living for today  
  
I thought I heard a voice  
Out on the wind  
And I'm sure I heard it say  
I'd find a friend  
And it said I'd find  
The answers in the end  
All I gotta do is carry on  
  
Carry on, carry on, the time is flyin'  
You need another love  
Maybe another town  
Carry on, carry on  
Don't wait until your hope is gone  
When your last chance  
Comes round  
  
I'm gonna keep on looking  
I won't quit  
Aggravation  
It ain't gonna hurt a bit  
And I believe that  
I have seen the last of it  
There's nothing left to do  
But carry on
