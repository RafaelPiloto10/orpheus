(David Bowie)  
  
It's a god awful small affair  
To the girl with the mousy hair  
But her mother is yelling no  
And her father has told her to go  
But her friend is nowhere to be seen  
As she walks through her sunken dream  
To the seat with the clearest view  
And she's hooked to the silver screen  
But the film is a saddening bore  
Cause she's lived it ten times or more  
She could spit at the eyes of fools  
As they ask her to focus on  
Sailors fighting in the dancehall  
Oh man, look at those cavemen go  
It's the freakiest show  
Take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy  
Wough man, wonder if he'll ever know  
He's in the best selling show  
Is there life on Mars?  
It's on Amerika's tortured brow  
And Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow  
Now the workers have struck for fame  
Cause Lennon's on sale again  
See the mice in their million hordes  
From Ibiza to the Norfolk broades  
Rule Britannia is out of bounds to my mother  
My dog and clowns  
But the film is a saddening bore  
Cause I wrote it ten times before  
It's about to be writ again as I ask you to focus on  
Sailors...
