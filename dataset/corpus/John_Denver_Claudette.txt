Oh, Oh Claudette  
Oh, Oh Claudette  
  
I got a brand new baby and I feel so good  
She loves me better than I thought she would  
I'm on my way to her house and I'm all out of breath  
And when I see her tonight I'm gonna squeeze her to death  
  
[chorus]  
  
Claudette  
Pretty little pet, Claudette  
Never let me fret, Claudette  
Well she's the prettiest little girl that I have ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get, from Claudette  
Oh, oh Claudette  
  
Well I'm a lucky man - my baby treats me right  
She's gonna let me hug and kiss and hold her tight  
When the date is over and I'm at her front door  
And when I kiss her goodnight I holler more, more, more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When me and my new baby have a date or three  
I'm gonna ask my baby if she'll marry me  
I'm gonna be so happy for the rest of my life  
When my brand new baby is my brand new wife  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mmm, mmm Claudette  
Oh, oh Claudette  
Mmm, mmm Claudette
