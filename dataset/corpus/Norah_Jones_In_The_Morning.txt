I can't stop myself from calling  
calling out your name  
I can't stop myself from falling  
falling back again  
in the morning,  
Baby, in the afternoon  
  
Dark like the shady corner  
inside a violin  
Hot like to burn my lips  
I know I can't win  
in the morning  
Baby, in the afternoon  
  
I try to quit you but I'm too weak  
waking up without you  
I can hardly speak at all  
  
My girlfriend tried to help me  
get you off my mind  
She tried a little tea and sympathy  
to help me to unwind  
in the morning  
Baby, in the afternoon  
  
Funny how my favorite shirt  
smells more like you than me  
Bitter traces left behind  
in stains no one can see  
in the morning  
Baby, in the afternoon  
  
You're gonna put me in an early grave  
I know I'm your slave whenever you call  
  
I can't stop myself from calling  
calling out your name  
I can't stop myself from falling  
falling back again  
falling back again  
in the morning  
Baby, in the afternoon
