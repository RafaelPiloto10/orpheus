Now we live our lives so nonchalant  
We spend our time so bon vivant  
Our Spanish nights so well arranged  
Those tasteful words that we exchanged  
We know it's all a passing phase  
  
We light our lamps for atmosphere  
And hang our hopes on chandeliers  
I don't know why we even care  
We try and try and get nowhere  
We'll change our minds, we changed our ways  
These Rhinestone Days  
  
So go our lives so nonchalant  
We spend our time so bon vivant  
I don't know why we even care  
We try and try and get nowhere  
We'll change our minds, we changed our ways  
These Rhinestone Days
