Never saw 'I love you' as a trend  
'Cause I don't really work like that  
I mean what I say when it leaves my lips, oh  
Nothin' you could say would change my heart  
'Cause I don't really love like that  
If you'd only let me in I'd show ya but I'm tired of workin' so hard  
  
You keep pushin' me away  
Tearin' down your walls is forcing me to break  
Don't know what to say, will you ever let me in?  
It's hard for me to pretend  
So tell me what you wanna do?  
Tell me is there any other way?  
  
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Tell me there's a reason to stay 'cause I'm about to get up and run  
Better think about the words you say  
If you don't wanna end up alone  
  
Tell me is there any room for me?  
'Cause when it's all said and done babe, I'm tired of singin'  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my  
  
Never confuse me with where you've been  
'Cause I don't really work like that  
If I'm holdin' you then I'm all in, in  
  
I know you're scared, yeah you've been burned  
But I won't ever hurt you like that  
If you'd take a chance I'm not like them, them, them  
Give and get nothin' in return  
You don't seem to care, you're not the only one who hurts  
Tell me is there any other way  
  
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Tell me there's a reason to stay 'cause I'm about to get up and run  
Better think about the words you say  
If you don't wanna end up alone  
  
Tell me is there any room for me?  
'Cause when it's all said and done babe, I'm tired of singin'  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my  
  
Why you gotta pull away? Pull away and leave me hangin'  
Why you gotta make me say?  
Don't make me say what you've been thinkin' all along  
  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
I'm about to get up and run  
  
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Tell me there's a reason to stay 'cause I'm about to get up and run  
Better think about the words you say  
If you don't wanna end up alone  
  
Tell me is there any room for me?  
'Cause when it's all said and done babe, I'm tired of singin'  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my
