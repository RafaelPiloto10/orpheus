What's the matter honey, are you not feeling well?  
It's okay, Momma will take care of you  
Not really sick, but don't you know I still say I am  
Dad just mumbles, "There goes my girlie son acting up again"  
  
How could you be my kid  
Mom knows I'm faking it  
But she understands what'll happen if I go  
The last four days  
  
The tough guys have been on a roll  
They show him no mercy  
Plenty of name calling  
And pushing my head in the toilet bowl  
  
They call him a loser  
But they won't get their hands on me today  
'Cause home with Momma is where I'm gonna stay  
  
We're pickin' daisies  
Who cares about them anyway  
Pickin' daisies  
They'll all be working for you someday  
  
Pickin' daisies  
They're just jealous of you  
Pickin' daisies  
Next year you'll go to private school  
  
Can't play sports or games  
I'm only really good at reading  
He can't catch a football  
Apparently that's not too cool  
  
That's why my nose is usually bleeding  
Plus they give him fat lips  
At this time yesterday, my underwear was over my head  
But I'll be safe today, I know 'cause Momma said  
  
We're pickin' daisies  
Who really cares what they think  
Pickin' daisies  
You should talk about it with your shrink  
  
Pickin' daisies  
They'll all end up in jail  
Pickin' daisies  
Marshall's is having a sale  
  
I know tomorrow it'll all start up again  
He'll be greeted with a head-lock  
And all I can do is sit and pray for the weekend  
But I know when I'm older  
  
I'll look back and laugh  
At all those kids who pulled my pants down  
And took that photograph  
'Cause we'll be through with kickball  
  
We'll all be weak and slow  
But I will be the only one  
With a magic place to go  
  
Pickin' daisies  
You're better off in the end  
Pickin' daisies  
Who cares, I'll be your friend  
  
Pickin' daisies  
You can always count on me  
Pickin' daisies  
I made you some iced tea  
  
Pickin' daisies  
Dasies  
Pickin' daisies  
Dasies  
  
Pickin' daisies  
Dasies  
Pickin' daisies  
Dasies  
Pickin' daisies  
  
You are too very handsome, just not in a traditional way  
When I was a kid, we didn't have video games, we had pinball, but I could
learn  
Well, they're just upset that they don't have earmuffs  
You can come to aerobics class with me and watch, all the ladies love you  
Who needs brand name shirts? Yours is the same thing without a fancy tag  
Why don't you go to sleep? And when you wake up, then I'll play you the Eddie
Fisher record
