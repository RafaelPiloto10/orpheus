On the phone, its 4am  
And I'm still talkin' to my friend  
Talkin' 'bout anything  
Just to hear his voice would bring  
Happiness, inside of me  
He has such a nice personality  
He tells me things that are good  
Makes me feel like how a woman should  
  
But I'm just not too sure  
If he's into me  
But I'm definitely feelin' him  
  
He's making me crazy  
Don't you know you're making me crazy  
Just one kiss from you would make  
Would make me so happy  
Would make me so complete, baby  
You're makin' me go crazy  
  
When he's near, I talk to him  
But he acts like we're not even friends  
I wonder why he acts this way  
There's just one thing  
Nothing else to say  
  
That's why I'm not too sure  
If he's into me  
But I'm definitely feelin' him  
  
He's making me crazy  
Don't you know you're making me crazy  
Just one kiss from you would make  
Would make me so happy  
Would make me so complete, baby  
You're making me go crazy...  
  
When we're alone at home  
Talkin' on the phone  
You're so nice to me  
And all this time, you got me questioning  
Are you leading me on, you're leading me on...  
  
You got me crazy  
Don't you know you're making me crazy  
Just one kiss from you would make  
Would make me so happy  
Would make me so complete, baby  
You're makin' me go crazy
