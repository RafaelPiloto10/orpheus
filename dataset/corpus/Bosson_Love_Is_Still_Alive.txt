[Chorus]  
Our love is still alive  
And all I want is just to be right by your side  
And all I'm asking you is give me one more try  
I know the future has a place for you and I  
Cause baby our love, our love is still alive  
  
You say that our love is gone and  
Whatever we did was wrong  
That everything we built is now history, yeah  
You've taken my heart away and I can't seem  
To make you stay but, baby I believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've given it all to you and I've been living my life through  
You and I'm not gonna give in now,  
We've come too far I know that we're gonna work it out  
And even if you still doubt it, baby I believe  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Believe me, things will get better  
Hold me, I'm more than a friend  
Trust me, I promise you one thing  
I'll stay with you till the end
