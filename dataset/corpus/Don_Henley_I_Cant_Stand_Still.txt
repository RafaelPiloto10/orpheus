I know you love me  
You know I love you too  
You know I always will  
No matter what you do  
  
You say you haven't got another lover  
You say you only want to make the scene  
Then you try to keep it under cover  
What does that mean?  
  
And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)  
I can't stand (while he's kissing you)  
  
So we got a little problem, baby:  
How to put together love and work  
If I could figure out that one, darlin'  
I could save us from a world of hurt  
  
I remember when we walked together  
Makin' love on a summer night  
Guess we thought that it would last forever  
We were all right  
  
But baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)  
I can't stand still (while he's touching you)  
  
I can take it if you need some freedom  
Understand it if you miss your friends  
Don't you ever try to think of me some  
You never tell me where you've been  
  
You say you haven't got another lover  
You say you only want to make the scene  
Then you try to keep it under cover  
What does that mean?  
  
And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)  
I can't stand still (while he's kissing you)  
And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)  
I can't stand still (while he's touching you)  
I can't stand still
