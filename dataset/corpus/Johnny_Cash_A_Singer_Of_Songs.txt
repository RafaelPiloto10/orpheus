I'm not a savior and I'm not a saint  
The man with the answers, I certainly ain't  
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong  
I'm just a singer of songs  
But I can take you for a walk along a little country stream  
I can make you see through lovers eyes and understand their dreams  
I can help you hear a baby's laugh and feel the joy it brings  
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing  
I'm not a prophet and I'm not a priest  
I'm not a wise man who's come from the East  
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong  
I'm just a singer of songs  
But I can take you to a city where a Man was crucified  
I can tell you how He lived and I can tell you why He died  
I can help proclaim the glory of this Mighty King of kings  
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing  
I'm not a great man, I don't claim to be  
But when I meet my Maker and He questions me  
I won't hang my head, I'll stand proud and strong  
And say, "I was a singer, Lord, I was a singer  
Yes, I was a singer of songs"
