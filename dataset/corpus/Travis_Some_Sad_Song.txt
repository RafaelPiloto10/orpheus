In the church one day you will get hurt  
In the school teacher's such a fool  
And if they would ever come 'round here  
They would ever come  
Blame it on my style, take a pill  
Don't tell me how to feel  
Bad news and tunes  
Sing it from the high  
Singin' some sad song  
Uncle Sam, playin' in the sand  
Understand, hold my hand  
Time is never gonna stop runnin'  
Never gonna stop  
Take me to the top of the trees  
Don't take me for a cracked window pane  
Bad news and tunes  
Are shinin' from the high  
Singin' some sad song  
Don't rehearse, this is the last verse  
In the hearse, goin' through your purse  
And if they would ever laugh, not here  
They would ever laugh  
Blame it on my style, once again  
Don't take me for a ride in the rain  
Bad news and tunes  
Shinin' from the high  
Singin' some sad song
