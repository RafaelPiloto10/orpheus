I became a woman of the world cause I was fed up with the farm  
And I thought pretty clothes and city lights  
Running round both day and night could do no harm  
A party girl I mixed for bout myself into a fix for running wild  
So I wrote my dad and mom asked if I could come back home to have my child  
I received the letter from the folks back home and they said things were fine  
They went on to say that Pete the boy I broke up with was about to lose his
mind  
But I couldn't hardly read the rest the words were being bloted by my tears  
I'm feelin' so ashamed he loved me then he feels the same he still cares  
So I'm going home for Pete's sake it was I who broke his heart in the first
place  
If he'll try me one more time for then I've made up my mind  
And in the morning I'm going home for Pete's sake  
Yes for Pete's sake my baby's and mine
