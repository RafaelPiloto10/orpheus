Baby please don't go, baby please don't go  
Baby please don't go, I love you so, baby please don't go  
You got dimples in your jaw  
You got dimples in your jaw  
You got dimples in your jaw  
And that ain't all, baby please don't go  
I love you baby, I always will  
You make the world go 'round and my heart stand still  
I love you baby, you're so fine  
C'mon little girl say you're gonna be mine  
Hey-hey, little girl (hey, little girl)  
Hey-hey, little girl (hey, little girl)  
Oooooh (hey, little girl)  
Hey-hey, little girl (hey, little girl)  
Hey-hey, little girl (hey-hey, little girl)  
Baby please don't go (ah, don't go honey)
