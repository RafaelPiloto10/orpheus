I know the feeling  
It is the real thing  
The essence of the truth  
The perfect moment  
That golden moment  
I know you feel it too  
I know the feeling  
It is the real thing  
You can't refuse the embrace  
It's like the pattern below the skin  
You gotta reach out and pull it all in  
And you feel like you're too close  
So you swallow another dose  
The pinnacle of happiness  
Filling up your soul  
You don't think you can take any more  
You never want to let go  
To touch the roots of experience  
The most basic ingredients  
Toi see the unseen glitter of life  
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife  
Cherish the certainty of now  
It kills you a bit at a time  
cradle the inspiration  
It will leave you writhing on the floor...  
This is so unreal, what I feel  
This nourishment, life is bent  
Into a shape I can hold  
A twist of fate, all my own  
Just grit your teeth, make no sound  
Take a step away and look around  
Just clench your fist and close your eyes  
Look deep inside, hypnotize  
The whisper is but a shout  
That's what it is all about  
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray  
You will never let it slip away  
Like the sacred song that someone sings through you  
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into  
Like the dream one day you know will come to life  
Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger  
It's the jewel of victory  
The chasm of misery  
And once you have bitten the core  
You will always know the flavor  
The split second of divinity  
You drink up the sky  
All of heaven is in your arms  
You know the reason why  
It's right there, all by itself  
And what you are, there is nothing else  
You're growing a life within a life  
The lips of wonder kiss you inside  
And when it's over the feeling remains  
It all comes down to this  
The smoke clears, I see what it is  
That made me feel this way  
This is so unreal, what I feel  
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood  
Pump through your veins, can't explain  
The element that's everything  
Just clench your fist and close your eyes  
Look deep inside, hypnotize  
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray  
You will never let it slip away  
Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after  
Like the first time love urged you to take guidance, in silence  
Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying  
Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending  
I know
