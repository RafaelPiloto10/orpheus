You could write, you could think, you could have sex  
You could leave your jewelry in a bowl beside the bed  
Stare out the window, down the lawn, to the lake  
For as long as it takes  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe, love is the new maybe  
I know what winter's about  
Too many nights, not enough days  
I watched the birds fly south  
And no, I don't wait  
The last words out of my mouth  
Stay out of my way  
And I'm in a wrong place  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe, love is the new maybe  
Maybe, love is the new maybe  
Maybe, love is the new maybe
