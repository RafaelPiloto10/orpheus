If you're reading this  
My mama's sitting there  
Looks like I only got a one-way ticket over here  
I sure wish I could give you one more kiss  
And war was just a game we played when we were kids  
Well, I'm laying down my gun  
I'm hanging up my boots  
I'm up here with God  
And we're both watching over you  
  
[Chorus]  
So lay me down  
In that open field out on the edge of town  
And know my soul is where my mama always prayed that it would go  
If you're reading this, I'm already home  
  
If you're reading this  
Halfway around the world  
I won't be there to see the birth of our little girl  
I hope she looks like you  
I hope she fights like me  
She stands up for the innocent and the weak  
I'm laying down my gun  
Hanging up my boots  
Tell dad, I don't regret that I've followed in his shoes  
  
So lay me down  
In that open field out on the edge of town  
And know my soul is where my mama always prayed that it would go  
If you're reading this, I'm already home  
  
If you're reading this, there is going to come a day  
You move on and find someone else and that's okay  
Just remember this  
I'm in a better place  
Soldiers live in peace, and angels sing amazing grace  
  
So lay me down  
In that open field out on the edge of town  
And know my soul is where my mama always prayed that it would go  
If you're reading this, I'm already home
