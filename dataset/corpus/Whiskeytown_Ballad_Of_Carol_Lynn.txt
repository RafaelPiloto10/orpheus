Loving you has gotten weird  
You'll see the sun hanging low down by your window  
And all the rain left in the world  
Won't bring you home again  
Oh, Carol Lynn  
  
And trusting you has gotten strange  
You'll close the door when the cold has gotten in  
And all the love left in the world  
Won't keep you warm again  
Oh, Carol Lynn  
  
When you need a friend to be there for you  
I won't be one who will help you out  
And when you need someone who can let you in  
You can count me out  
Oh, Carol Lynn  
  
When your life has worn you out  
You'll have the past left for you to think about  
And all the money in the world  
Can't take you back again  
Oh, Carol Lynn  
Oh, Carol Lynn
