Step out the door and it feels like rain  
That's the sound, that's the sound on your windowpane  
Take to the streets but you can't ignore  
That's the sound, that's the sound, you're waiting for  
  
If ever your world starts crashing down  
Whenever your world starts crashing down  
Whenever your world starts crashing down  
That's where you'll find me  
(Yeah)  
  
God love your soul and your aching bones  
Take a breath, take a step, meet me down below  
Everyone's the same, our fingers to our toes  
We just can't get it right, but we're on the road  
  
If ever your world starts crashing down  
Whenever your world starts crashing down  
Whenever your world starts crashing down  
That's where you'll find me  
(Yeah)  
  
Lost till you're found, swim till you drown  
Know that we all fall down  
Love till you hate, strong till you break  
Know that we all fall down  
  
If ever your world starts crashing down  
Whenever your world starts crashing down  
Whenever your world starts crashing down  
That's where you'll find me  
  
Lost till you're found, swim till you drown  
Know that we all fall down  
Love till you hate, strong till you break  
Know that we all fall down  
  
All fall down, all fall down  
All fall down, all fall down  
All fall down, all fall down  
  
Lost till you're found, swim till you drown  
Know that we all fall down  
Love till you hate, strong till you break  
Know that we all fall down
