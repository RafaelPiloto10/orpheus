You better leave my kitten all alone.  
But I told you big fat bulldog,

This dog is gonna get you  
If you don't leave her alone.

On the top of your head.  
That child is gonna miss you,  
You gonna wish that you were dead.  
If you don't leave my kitten all alone.  
Well I told you big fat bulldog,  
You better leave her alone.  
  
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you  
On the top of your head.
