I would climb any mountain, sail across the stormy sea  
If that's what it takes me baby, to show how much you mean to me  
And I guess that it's just the woman in you, that brings out the man in me  
I know I can't help myself, you're all in the world to me  
  
[Chorus]  
It feels like the first time, feels like the very first time  
It feels like the first time, it feels like the very first time  
  
I have waited a lifetime, spent my time so foolishly  
But now that I found you, together we'll make history  
And I know that it must be the woman in you, that brings out the man in me  
I know I can't help myself, you're all my eyes can see  
  
And it feels like the first time, like it never did before  
Feels like the first time, like we've opened up the door  
Feels like the first time, like it never will again, never again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open up the door, won't you open up the door  
  
[Chorus]
