High, in Castille,  
Lives senora Dali alone.  
And higher still  
She keeps her gallery.  
Distance means nothing to me.  
A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo,  
A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo...  
Debris everywhere,  
Gazing. It's amazing.  
Ferry me over,  
Ferry me over,  
Ferry me over  
The music, Dali.  
Deeper here lies hidden answers and treasures for him.  
"Oh, I prefer absence," said she,  
"My heart grows fonder alone."  
A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo,  
A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo...  
Debris everywhere,  
Gazing. It's amazing.  
Ferry me over,  
Ferry me over,  
Ferry me over  
The music, Dali.
