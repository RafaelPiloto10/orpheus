Stuck inside a jigsaw  
Of the Midwestern modern midtown  
Feeling like a trophy  
That the old man's been passing around  
Just another suit back  
From a old time college degree  
And when I walked by I heard 'em  
Saying that he was something to see  
Well, now don't you know that I'm the American Son?  
Living out the old man's fantasy of being number one  
Daddy used to tell me, "Son, you'll never kiss ass"  
I'm the last of the American Son and it's such a, such a gasp  
It's like a shot of silicon  
The way the conversation grew  
And everybody was telling me something  
That I already, already knew  
Well, I might be dumb but it didn't take that long  
For me to get out of that room and bills  
And when I ran into the streets  
The crowd was yelling he's such a, such a gasp  
Now don't you know that I'm the American Son?  
Living out the old man's fantasy of being number one  
Daddy used to tell me, "Son, you'll never kiss ass"  
I'm the last of the American Son and it's such a, such a  
Such a gasp, well, now kiss ass  
You know that Eddy's in danger of  
Of a self indulgent fool  
To mesmerize himself into thinking  
That he is just to cool for school  
Well, you know that it's fun to carry a gun  
And shoot down what you never could be  
And when the dealer calls and has got you by the balls  
You tell him that ya, you tell that ya had it from me  
Now don't you know that I'm the American Son?  
Living out the old man's fantasy of being number one  
Daddy used to tell me, "Son, you'll never kiss ass"  
I'm the last of the American Son  
And it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a  
It's such a, it's such a, it's such a gasp  
I'm the last of the American Son  
I'm the last of the American Son  
I'm the last of the American Son  
I'm the last of the American Son  
I'm the last, I'm the last  
I'm the last, I'm the last  
I'm the last, I'm the last  
I'm the last, I'm the last  
I'm the last of the American Son  
I'm the last of the American Son  
I'm the last of the American Son  
I'm the last of the American Son  
I'm the last of the American Son  
I'm the last of the American Son
