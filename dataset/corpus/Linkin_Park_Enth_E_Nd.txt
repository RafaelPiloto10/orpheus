Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park...  
Then in the middle came Motion Man...  
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix [echo]  
  
One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time  
All I know, time was just slipping way  
  
And I watched it count down till the end of the day  
Watched it watch me and the words that I say  
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins  
I know that I didn't look out below  
  
And I watched the time go right out the window  
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch  
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock  
But in the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time  
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party  
  
All for shake and made eye contact  
Party control showing all that  
Northeast, southwest coast  
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle  
  
I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder  
I brought you back of the thing  
Like the imaginary man of your dreams  
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it  
  
A sleek skin I never nerved you  
You felt lovin, I never applied a room  
Without bringing the plan  
By any means and means of leaving you teens,  
Of all those teenage scenes, I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man  
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt  
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man  
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt  
  
One thing I don't know how  
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now  
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all  
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl  
  
And I was forced to run, with you mocking me  
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly  
Remembering all those times you fought with me  
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy  
  
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale  
Every single little thing you said and make it expel  
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't
matter to me  
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter..  
In the end
