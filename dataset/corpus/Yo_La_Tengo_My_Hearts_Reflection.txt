Got something to say, sit down on the bed  
Something that I usually leave unsaid  
It doesn't come so easily, I guess that's no surprise  
I wanna see my heart's reflection in your eyes  
Let's lock the door, hide the key  
I'll try to look like you if you'll dress up like me  
And you play dumb and I'll play too, nobody has to know  
I wanna see my heart's reflection in your eyes  
In your eyes  
Let's jump this ship, let's cut out  
Let's get into the wagon and drive until the motor falls out  
I want just us two, I don't want to have to hide my heart  
I wanna see it in your eyes as we ride on and on
