The USA is movin' south  
Our power is mostly mouth  
Miami beach to Malibu  
Hot weather makes'em wanna screw  
Shemales, jumps bails  
Weird tales on the scales  
If it fails chip'n dale  
Hit the gym in animal skin  
  
Perverts in the sun  
Perving everyone  
Perverts in the sun  
Perving everyone  
  
Fruit punch  
Go to crunch  
Take a pill  
Lose your will  
Get a job, in street promotion  
Pushing handbills on the ocean  
Gang fights all night  
Garbages can's got a tan  
Rich men and hungry chicks  
Stick'em in the blender - hey big spender !  
  
Perverts in the sun  
Perving everyone  
Perverts in the sun  
Perving everyone  
  
O.J, O.J, Jose Sammy too, got nothin' to do  
The realtor hit the floor  
He's disgusted  
Wants to get'em all busted  
  
Perverts in the sun  
Perving everyone  
Perverts in the sun  
Perving everyone  
  
You guys are perverts  
  
Perverts in the sun  
Perving everyone  
Perverts in the sun  
Perving everyone  
Perverts in the sun  
Perving everyone
