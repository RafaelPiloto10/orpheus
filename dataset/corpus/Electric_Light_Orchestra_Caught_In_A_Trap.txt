Sometimes you get caught in a trap and you don't know it  
Sometimes it's better to get out while you know it  
Some people never learn they keep on falling  
You can never get out if you keep on stalling  
  
Then you get,  
  
(chorus:) caught in a trap caught in dead end  
Caught in a trap with nowhere to run  
Then you get, caught in a trap caught in dead end  
Nowhere to turn but it can't go on  
  
Caught in a trap  
  
Sometimes you got to know where to run for cover  
Sometimes your better out till the heat is over  
  
Ah you get (chorus)  
  
Caught in a trap  
  
Don't know how it happened but then it's too late  
Then you gotta move on the times, you can't wait  
  
Cus you got (chorus)  
  
(chorus)  
  
(chorus)  
  
Caught in a trap  
  
Caught in a trap  
  
Caught in a t
