There's a brand new car in your driveway  
And a blonde new girl in your bed  
You've everything you ever wished for  
Happy little bubblehead  
And you can't fill it up with promises  
You can't fill it up with lies  
And you can't fill it up with business lunches  
Oh but you can try  
Who am I to criticise you?  
Just a girl that you despise  
Welcome to designer living  
This is your designer life  
There's a big house high on a hilltop  
And another house in spain  
Mummy's little soldier's riding on the gravy train  
And my you're looking lovely  
May you stay forever young  
May you never get a conscience  
About the things that you have done  
Who am I to criticise you?  
Just a girl to twist the knife  
Welcome to designer living  
This is your designer life  
Who am I to criticise you?  
Just a girl that you despise  
Welcome to designer living  
This is your designer life  
This is your designer life  
You and your designer life
