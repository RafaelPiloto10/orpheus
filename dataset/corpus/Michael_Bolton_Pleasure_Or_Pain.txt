You pull me in, then ya push me away  
Ask me leave, then ya beg me to stay  
Bend me baby, bend me till I break  
Do you really want to know how much  
This heart of mine can take  
When I find myself in a daze sometimes  
Lovin' you has got me losin' my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it pleasure or pain  
Keeps me runnin', keeps me runnin' to you  
Pleasure or pain  
I just can't decide  
Are they one and the same  
It's confusing me blind  
Am I in love or insane  
Am I in it for the pleasure or pain  
  
Ya make me smile  
Make me thankful that I breathe  
Let me taste some heaven  
Before ya drop me to my knees  
Ya chain me baby, till it's time to set me free  
Give me everything I want  
Give me nothin' that I need  
  
Well I ask myself why I keep holdin' on  
Lovin' you is just a weakness too strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I still don't understand why I can't resist  
What keeps me comin' back, comin' back for more of this  
Pleasure or pain  
Keeps me runnin', keeps me runnin' to you  
Pleasure or pain  
I just can't decide  
Are they one and the same  
It's confusing me blind  
Am I in love or insane  
Am I in it for the pleasure or pain  
  
Keeps me runnin', keeps me running to you  
I just can't decide  
Are they one and the same  
It's confusing me blind  
Am I in love or insane  
Am I in it for the pleasure or pain
