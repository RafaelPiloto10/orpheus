Dreamin', I must be dreamin'  
Or am I really lyin' here with you  
  
Baby, you take me in your arms  
And though I'm wide awake  
I know my dream is comin' true  
  
And, oh, I just fall in love again  
Just one touch and then it happens every time  
And there I go I just fall in love again, and when I do  
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you  
  
Magic, it must be magic  
The way I hold you and the night just seems to fly  
Easy, for you to take me to a star  
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes  
  
And, oh, I just fall in love again  
Just one touch and then it happens every time  
And there I go I just fall in love again, and when I do  
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you  
  
And, oh, I just fall in love again  
Just one touch and then it happens every time  
And there I go I just fall in love again, and when I do  
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you  
  
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you
