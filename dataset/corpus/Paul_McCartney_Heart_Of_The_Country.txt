I Look High, I Look Low,  
I'm Lookin' Everywhere I Go,  
Lookin' For A Home  
In The Heart Of The Country.  
I'm Gonna Go, I'm Gonna Go,  
I'm Gonna Tell Everyone I Know  
Lookin ' For A Home  
In The Heart Of The Country.  
  
Heart Of The Country  
Where The Holy People Grow,  
Heart Of The Country,  
Smell The Grass In The Meadow.  
  
Wo Wo Wo.  
  
Want Horse, I Want Sheep,  
I Want To Get Me A Good Night's Sleep,  
Livin ' In A Home  
In The Heart Of The Country.  
  
I'm Gonna Go, I'm Gonna Go,  
I'm Gonna Tell Everyone I Know  
Livin' In A Home  
In The Heart Of The Country.  
  
Heart Of The Country  
Where The Holy People Grow,  
Heart Of The Country,  
Smell The Grass In The Meadow.  
  
Wo Wo Wo.
