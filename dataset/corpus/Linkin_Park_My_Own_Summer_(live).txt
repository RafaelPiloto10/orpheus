So this is the last treat of the night coming up right here  
This is a song, this is a tour actually, this is the first time we've played
this song on tour  
I'll spit it out eventually  
Anybody like the Deftones?  
Got any Deftones' fans in the house?  
Put em' up if you are  
Let me see you if you know the words to this shit and i'll come down and sing
it with you  
Hey you, big star, guide me when it's over  
Hey you, big mood, guide me to shelter  
'Cause I'm through, when the two hits the six and it's summer  
Cloud, come  
Shove  
The sun  
Aside  
I think God is moving his tongue  
There's no crowds in the streets  
And no sun  
In my own summer  
You guys feeling that?  
Who can help me with this shit, can you?  
Can you help me with this shit?  
Stay right here, stay right here  
Hey you..  
Stay right here  
Come on  
Yo, yo  
What the fuck is going on?  
Yea, bring him over here  
Allright bro, we gonna teach these mother fuckers this shit, ok?  
You guys gonna help us out right now?  
Allright you guys  
Chester, when you're ready bud  
The shade is a tool, a device, a savior  
See, I try  
(You better watch out)  
And look up  
(Where?)  
To the sky  
(Why?)  
But my eyes burn  
Cloud, come  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
Shove  
Shove it  
The sun  
Aside  
Cloud, come  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
Shove  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
The sun  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
Aside  
I think God is moving his tongue  
There's no crowds in the streets  
And no sun  
In my own summer
