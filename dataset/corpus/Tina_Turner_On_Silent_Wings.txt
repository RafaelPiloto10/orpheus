There was a time when I would have followed you  
To the end of the earth  
I was willing to share it all with you, the love, the hurt  
I've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dust  
But I never stopped believing in you  
I always thought our love was strong enough  
One you could hold on to  
  
You never see it coming you just let it fly  
On silent wings, silent wings  
You can't hide what you feel inside  
And the fire has left your eyes  
On silent wings  
  
I see us in my dreams and we're dancing  
I can almost hear the song  
But the prayers they go unanswered  
We both know, we're just hanging on  
I can feel the change but I'll never know the reason why  
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet  
I only know that something good has died  
Between you and me, oh, it's just a memory  
  
You never see it coming, you just go separate ways  
On silent wings, silent wings  
There's no more promises to break, our love has slipped away  
On silent wings  
  
You never see it coming, but you know it has to end  
Silent wings, silent wings  
I will never be the same again  
I feel the whisper of the wind of silent wings
