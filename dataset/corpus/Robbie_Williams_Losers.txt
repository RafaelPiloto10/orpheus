There will always be someone better than you  
Even if you're the best  
So let's stop the competition now  
Or we will both be losers  
  
I'm ashamed I ever tried to be higher than the rest  
But brother I am not alone  
We've all tried to be on top of the world somehow  
'Cause we have all been losers  
  
I don't wanna be laid down  
No I don't wanna die knowing  
That I spent so much time when I was young  
Just trying to be a winner  
  
So I wanna make it clear now  
I wanna make it known  
That I don't care about any of that shit no more  
  
Don't care about being a winner  
Or being smooth with women  
Or going out on Fridays  
Being the life of parties  
No, no more, no  
  
There will always be someone worse than you  
Sister don't let it get to your head  
'Cause you won't be on top of the world so long  
In constant competition  
  
This ain't about no one in particular  
But I could list a few  
I'm removing myself from the queue  
  
Don't care about being a winner  
Or being smooth with women  
Or going out on Fridays  
Being the life of parties  
Don't care about being hotter  
Or being Daddy's favorite  
Or if you think I'm a mimic  
Or if I am a loser  
  
Don't care about being a winner  
Or being smooth with women  
Or going out on Fridays  
Being the life of parties  
Don't care about being hotter  
Or being Daddy's favorite  
Or if you think I'm a mimic  
Or if I am a loser  
  
No, no more  
No more  
No more  
No more  
No more  
No more
