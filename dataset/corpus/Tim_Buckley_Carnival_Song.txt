The singer cries for people's lies  
He will sing for the day to bring him night  
The circus burns in carnival flame  
And for a while you won't know my name at all  
But sing and dance and love for pennies and gold  
  
The juggling clown smiles to me  
And every frown we agree is glad  
The nighttime comes to bring the bums  
From Bowery heat to crimson streets of wine  
But magic lands will never touch our sands  
  
Your children smile in single file  
They learn mistakes that others make  
They see although they cannot know  
The needs they'll need to have their greed grow wild  
But dance and sing, for others bring the shame  
And for a while you won't know my name
