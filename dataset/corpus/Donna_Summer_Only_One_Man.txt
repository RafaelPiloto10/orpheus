Spoken:  
You know ladies and gentlemen  
Please know this  
I really love my man  
And I want, exactly what he's got  
And I don't ever mind giving him every  
Bit of my love  
And baby you know  
I've got a lot to give  
I got fire in my touch  
There's nothing I won't do  
And I bend over backwards  
Just to give it all to you  
Cause there's only one man  
That can handle all this love  
Cause there's only one man  
That I want to be with tonight  
Cause there's only one man  
That can squeeze me inside  
The one man in my life  
And that's you, you and you and you  
Cause there's only one man  
That can handle all this love  
Cause there's only one man  
That I want to be with tonight  
Said there's only one man in my life  
And that's you
