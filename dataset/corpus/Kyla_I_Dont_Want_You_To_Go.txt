Here I am  
Alone and I don't understand  
Exactly how it all began  
The dream just walked away  
  
I'm holding on  
When all but the passion's gone  
  
And from the start  
Maybe I was tryin' too hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' my heart  
Things can fall apart but I know,  
That I don't want you to go  
  
And heroes die,  
When they ignore the cause inside  
But they learn from what's left behind  
And fight for something else  
  
And so it goes  
That we have both learned how to grow  
  
And from the start  
Maybe we were tryin' too hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our heart  
Things can fall apart but I know,  
That I don't want you to go  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh it's just too much  
Takin' all the whole world all by myself  
But it's not enough  
Unless I stop trusting somebody else,  
Somebody else  
And love again  
  
[Instrumental Interlude]  
  
And from the start  
Maybe we were tryin' too hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts  
Things can fall apart but I know,  
That I don't want you to go, no  
Maybe we were tryin' to hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts  
Things can fall apart but I know,  
That I don't want you to go  
Oh no, don't want you to go
