I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour  
That's when my love comes tumbling down  
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour  
That's when there's no one else around  
  
I'm gonna take you, gonna hold you  
Do all the things I told ya  
Midnight hour, oh baby  
I'm gonna wait 'til the stars come out  
  
And see the sweet look in your eyes  
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour  
That's when my love begins to shine  
Well you're the only girl I know  
  
Who really loves me so  
Midnight hour, oh yeah  
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour  
That's when my love comes tumbling down  
  
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour  
That's when there's no one else around  
I'm gonna take you, gonna hold you  
Do all the things I told ya  
  
Midnight hour, oh baby  
Yes I am
