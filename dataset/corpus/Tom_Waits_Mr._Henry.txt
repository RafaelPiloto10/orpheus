Mr. Henry stumbles home  
When the evening's done  
He's as poor as a church mouse  
High on the Meyer's rum  
Tugging at his shirttail  
Jiggling a church key  
Chewing on a toothpick  
On another binge  
Trampling the rosebush  
Whistin' to himself...  
Now don't wake up the neighbours  
Spitting on the hinge  
Rattling the milkbottles  
Tripping on a skate  
Hidin' from the Newsboys  
Before it's too late  
The Screen door's open  
Don't make no noise in the Kitchen  
Got no excuse  
For a cold, grey wife that starts bitchin'  
That the no good bum's at it again  
After she's given him  
The best years of her life  
He'll tell her he was celebrating  
Savage's divorce  
Played a hunch out at Yonkers  
You can never trust a horse  
And thrown in jail  
Swore he'd never do these things again  
He's got an alibi  
But never tells her where he's been  
"Henry! Henry!"
