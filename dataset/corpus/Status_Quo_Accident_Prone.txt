I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
'Cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
They say the devil loves his own  
And lady you just got the roll  
He drives you modus-operandi  
Well lady you don't get this soul  
What you call love I can't take no more  
Go knock on someone else's door  
  
I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
'Cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
'Cause you specialise your own kind of lies  
Lady you just hit and run  
I just want to say you keep driving that way  
And one day you will be undone  
  
I try to love you my way  
But lady you just wouldn't slow down  
You drove a right on through me  
When other guys came around  
What you call love wouldn't give to a stray  
I wouldn't treat a dog that way  
  
I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
''cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
'Cause you specialise your own kind of lies  
Lady you just hit and run  
I just want to say you keep driving that way  
And one day you will be undone  
  
One day you'll have to slow down  
And lady it could be too late  
You keep on acceleratin'  
And lady I could see your fate  
No-one wants a second-hand car  
They know it been push too far  
  
I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
'Cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
'Cause you specialise your own kind of lies  
Lady you just hit and run  
You're draggin'me down with this riding around  
And one day you will be undone  
  
I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
'Cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun
