I been thinking lately  
About the people I meet  
The carwash on the corner  
And the hole in the street  
The way my ankles hurt  
With shoes on my feet  
And I'm wondering  
If I'm gonna see tomorrow.  
  
Father forgive us  
For what we must do  
You forgive us  
We'll forgive you  
We'll forgive each other  
Till we both turn blue  
Then we'll whistle and go fishing  
In heaven.  
  
I was in the army  
But I never dug a trench  
I used to bust my knuckles  
On a monkey wrench  
Then I'd go to town and drink  
And give the girls a pinch  
But I don't think  
They ever even noticed me.  
  
Fish and whistle  
Whistle and fish  
Eat everything  
That they put on your dish  
And when we get through  
We'll make a big wish  
That we never have  
To do this again  
Again? again????  
  
On my very first job  
I said thank you and please  
They made me scrub a parking lot  
Down on my knees  
Then I got fired  
For being scared of bees  
And they only give me  
Fifty cents an hour.
