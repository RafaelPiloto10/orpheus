And you might think it's possible  
For me to think the same way that you do  
I've figured out there's nothing I can do  
To change my life  
And nothing ever will  
And you might think it's reasonable  
For me to just accept the way it is  
  
I've heard it said  
There's nothing I can do  
To change this world  
I wish it wasn't true  
There are those who say  
The world is ending every day  
But I want the chance  
I've been waiting here  
I try to hide this pain and fear  
So give me a chance  
  
And I believe it's rational  
To never want to see things  
The way they are  
I've heard it said  
That we all carry something to believe  
And some can let it .
