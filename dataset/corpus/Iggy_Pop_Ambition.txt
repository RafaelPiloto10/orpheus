I'm the kind of girl  
I want that whole wide world  
Nothing more nothing less  
I don't want second best  
  
Ah but my associates  
Why they're no more than opiates  
Always dragging me down  
Dash my hopes to the ground  
  
But they must be kidding  
Or wishful thinking  
Adding fuel to the fire  
Of my ambition  
  
I'll make a date  
Oh no I won't be late  
And why of course he'll be there  
He'll promise he'll swear  
  
But all I ever find  
Been spun that same old line  
It's happened time and time again before  
But these things and more  
Widen the score  
  
And it's one up for ambition  
I really have a go  
You know you've got to hand it to me  
I've got a heart of gold  
But I'm a wolf in mutton's clothes  
  
Someday my time will come  
I'll feel I can't go on  
I may not care or even know it's there  
But then I'll have my fun  
  
So 'till then just press on  
Don't lose your grip  
Don't lose ambition
