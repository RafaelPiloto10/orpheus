I want you to stay  
Never go away from me  
Stay forever  
But now, now that you're gone  
All I can do is pray for you  
To be here beside me again  
  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that love will conquer all  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality  
  
And now I must move on  
Tryin to forget all the memories of you near me  
But I can't let go of your love that has stopped me  
To hold on  
  
I want you to stay  
Never go away from me  
Stay forever  
But now, now that you're gone  
All I can do is pray for you  
To be here beside me again  
  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that love will conquer all  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality, ooh  
  
And now I must move on  
Tryin to forget all the memories of you near me  
But I can't let go of your love that has stopped me  
To hold on  
  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that love will conquer all  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality  
  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that love will conquer all  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality  
  
I want you to stay  
Never go away from me  
Stay forever  
I want to stay  
But I have to my way, hmm...
