Where did they go?  
Where did everybody go?  
I wanna know  
  
We couldve tried.  
Why did everybody cry,  
If you werent mine?  
  
Now, everything is gonna change  
Youve made your mind up. Well, my friend,  
Youve got a lot to learn, ya do.  
Why do we deny ourselves?  
In terms of love,  
I'm at a loss. So well.  
Oh Well, oh Well  
Oh Well, Oh Well  
  
Can't find the words  
But hey, man, everbody hurts  
When it doesn't work  
  
Now, everything is gonna change  
Youve made your mind up. Well, my friend,  
Youve got a lot to learn, ya do.  
Why do we deny ourselves?  
In terms of love,  
I'm at a loss. So well.  
Oh Well, oh Well  
Oh Well, Oh Well  
  
Your love drowned us in a hole.  
You never ever wanted her to grow.  
To grow. Oh, Oh,  
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?  
  
If everything is gonna change  
Was it worth it? Oh, my friend,  
Youve got a lot to learn, ya do.  
Why do we deny ourselves?  
In terms of love,  
You werent strong enough (Oh Well) for me...  
  
Oh Well, oh Well  
Oh Well, Oh Well  
  
Oh Well
