Gettin' up was the first mistake I made today  
Maybe if I'd stayed in bed I wouldn't hurt this way  
For now I'll have to face the world admit that we're all through  
And begin my first day without you  
  
Goin' out was the next mistake I made today  
I tried to find a place to hide to pass a time away  
I knew I couldn't stand to see someone we once knew  
All alone my first day without you  
  
Goin' home was the last mistake I made today  
He's gone and now you're all alone the silence seems to say  
A million lonely nights to all I can look forward to  
As I end my first day without you as I end my first day without you
