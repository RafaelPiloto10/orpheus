Anyone who ever loved  
Could look at me  
And know that I love you  
Anyone who ever dreamed  
Could look at me  
And know I dream of you  
Knowing I love you so  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart  
And hurt me like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
What am I to do?  
  
Every time you go away  
I always say this time it's goodbye, dear  
Loving you the way I do, I take you back  
Without you I'd die, dear  
Knowing I love you so  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart  
And hurt me like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
What am I to do?  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart  
And hurt me like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
  
Anyone who had a heart could love me too  
Anyone who had a heart would surely take me  
In his arms and always love me  
Why won't you?  
  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too, yeah  
Anyone who had a heart would simply take me  
In his arms and always love me  
Why won't you?  
  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too
