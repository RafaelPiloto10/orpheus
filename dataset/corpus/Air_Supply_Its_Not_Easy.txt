And the money she gave me, wasn't enough to pay the rent,  
But before I get some all my money's long been spent,  
It's nice to get away from all the noise back home  
It's harmless in a way we don't have that far to go.  
  
And in June we're three,  
And it's nice, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.  
With the rain came freedom, never was one more word so true  
In the ragged morning then the word came alive in you  
  
And I tried, and I tried for you  
It's not easy, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.  
All the food that we could buy wasn't enough to keep just one alive.  
But we came through summer letting autumn close your eyes.  
  
And I tried, and I tried for you.  
I can take it, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.  
It's not easy, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, that's all.
