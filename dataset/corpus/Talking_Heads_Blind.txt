Signs  
Signs are lost  
Signs disappeared  
Turn invisible  
Got no sign  
Somebody got busted  
Got a face of stone  
And a ghostwritten biography  
Dogs start to run in,  
Hungry for some food  
Dogs start a-twitching  
And they're looking at you  
It was light  
By five  
Torn all apart  
All in the name of democracy  
He's hurt  
He's dying  
Claimed he was a terrorist  
Claimed to avert a catastrophe  
Someone should'a told him  
That the buck stops here  
No one ever said  
That he was involved with thieves  
And they're blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
  
No sense of harmony, No sense of  
Time, Don't mention harmony, Say:  
What is it? What is it? What is it? Give  
A little shock, and he raises his hand  
Somebody shouts out, says: What is  
It? What is it? What is it?  
He was shot down in the night!  
People ride by but his body's still alive  
The girl in the window what has she  
Done? She looks down at me...  
Says: "I don't want to die!"  
  
And I'm blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Somebody could have told us where they go  
Crawling all around looking for foot, foot, footprints  
Now tell me what the Hell have we become?  
Some dirty little bastards What the Hell is going on?you  
No sense of harmony, No sense of  
Time, Don't mention harmony, Say:  
What is it? What is it? What is it? Give  
A little shock, and he raises his hand  
Somebody shouts out, says: What is  
It? What is it? What is it?  
He was shot down in the night!  
People ride by but his body's still alive  
The girl in the window what has she  
Done? She looks down at me ...  
Says: "I don't want to die!"  
  
They're blind and they're blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
