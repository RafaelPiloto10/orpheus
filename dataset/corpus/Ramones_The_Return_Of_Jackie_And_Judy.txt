Jackie is a punk,  
Judy is a runt  
They went down to the Mudd Club  
And they both got drunk  
Oh-yeah  
  
Jackie is a bookie,  
Judy's taking loans  
They both came up to New York  
Just to see the Ramones  
Oh-yeah  
  
And oh, I don't know why she wrote that letter  
Oh no, oh no  
Oh I don't know why  
We won't forget her, oh no  
  
Jackie's playing hooky  
Judy's playing pool  
They both got caught for cutting  
Got to go to summer school  
Oh-yeah  
  
Jackie's scalping tickets  
Judy's getting harassed  
They both got kicked outside  
Didn't have a backstage pass  
Oh-yeah  
  
And oh, I don't why she wrote that letter  
Oh no, oh no  
And oh, I don't know why,  
don't't know what's on her mind  
I don't know, no, I don't know  
  
But I can't stand to see her cryin'  
She's still cryin', she ain't tryin'  
She's going to get left behind  
Nobody wants you, nobody wants you
