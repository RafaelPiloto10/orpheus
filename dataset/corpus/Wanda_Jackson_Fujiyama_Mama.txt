I've been to Nagasaki Hiroshima too the same I did to them baby I can do to
you  
Cause I'm a Fujiyama mama and I'm just about to blow my top  
Fujiyama-yama Fujiyama  
And when I start erupting ain't nobody gonna make me stop  
I drink a quart of sakey smoke dynamite  
I chase it with tobaccy and then shoot out the light  
Cause I'm a Fujiyama mama...  
[ guitar ]  
Well you can talk about me say that I'm mean  
I'll blow your head off baby with nitroglycerine  
Cause I'm a Fujiyama mama...  
Well you can say I'm crazy stone deaf and dumb  
But I can cause destruction just like the atom bomb  
Cause I'm a Fujiyama mama...  
I drink a quart of sakey...
