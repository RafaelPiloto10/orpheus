I've had a lot of girls in my life  
They never meant that much to me  
A good time was always had by all  
But those good times: they were fleeting memories  
I used to lie to them, and then I'd kiss them  
But I kept them an arm's length away  
Well, hey man, now you know me  
And look how silly I been acting today  
  
[Chorus]  
This time I really think I'm in love. I'm in love  
This time I think I'm really in love  
This time I really think I'm in love  
This time I think I'm really in love  
  
I used to roll down the window  
And let that tape deck blow  
And look at the honey I was holding that night  
I'd say, "Hey, girl, you're the one"  
And then I'd laugh when I'd take her home  
You got your arms around my shoulders  
You got my soul confused with my heart  
You were too smart to believe all those tired lines  
And I was too dumb to know what had started  
  
I hope you don't lose that innocent laughter  
I hope time doesn't take that away  
  
[Chorus]
