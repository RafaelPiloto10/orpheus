I fell in love with a working girl  
We both grew up in a working world  
Julie Christie jaw full 'o' them pearly whites  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
She never bought herself the finest clothes  
She couldn't care less about buttons and bows  
She says what counts is what's inside  
It's just the way you look tonight  
  
It's just the way you look tonight  
You got the face of an angel  
I can feel your halo burnin' bright  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
There ain't no makeup, not a trace  
She can cut you off and put you in your place  
Her bark has gotta be worse than her bite  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
It's just the way you look tonight  
You got the face of an angel  
I can feel your halo burnin' bright  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
It's West Side Story  
Only two lovers could tell  
When you walked in the room  
Everything stopped  
It's inevitable  
Inevitable  
  
I fell in love with a working girl  
It works for me 'n' it works for her  
When we get it on lightning strikes  
It's just the way you look tonight  
  
It's just the way you look tonight  
You got the face of an angel  
I can feel your halo burnin' bright  
Just the way you look tonight
