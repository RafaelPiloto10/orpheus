If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get the same old stuff  
Life can treat you good, then turn as cold as ice  
And believe me when I tell you  
  
This thing called love, for sure, is like most things in life  
Not all bad, not all good (it's just something that I believe)  
Not all cold, not all hot (yeah, I like that)  
Not all bitter, not all sweet (sounds all right to me)  
  
So don't miss all the good, waiting for the best, there's still happiness  
Right in the middle  
Perfect love sounds real nice  
But that never seemed to happen with any relationship of mine  
It was always up and down, in then out  
And after the last goodbye, I still didn't know what it was all about  
You get disappointed if it ain't bliss all the time  
  
And you get so annoyed if you can't feel the same every night  
Not all bad, not all good (I'm tryin' to tell you that it's)  
Not all high, not all low (not all high and not all low)  
Not all heaven, not all hell (as far as I can tell)  
  
It's not some prize you win, you don't have a thing to prove, just enjoy the
groove  
Right in the middle  
Cause I've learned when it comes to love, it's the exact same reality  
That's why they say "Que sera, sera"  
Which means whatever's gonna be is gonna be  
  
Whatever's gonna be is gonna be:  
Not all bad, not all good (I need somebody to understand)  
Not all sunshine, not all rain  
(You know that too much of a good thing is really no good)  
Not all laughter, not all tears (I'm only trying to tell you)  
  
To let your good times roll, keep your self-control, there's a lot of soul  
Right in the middle
