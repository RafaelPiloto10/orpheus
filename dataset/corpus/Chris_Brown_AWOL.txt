Why you're up in here starting drama?  
Cutey got the bottie with a curve like coma  
We can disappear M.I.A until tomorrow  
We can gone...  
Feels like I should be throwin' hundred dollar bills when you pass me  
You know what's on my mind girl you don't got to ask me  
I don't need no digits I ain't tryin' do no math  
I just wanna get gonee...  
  
Chorus  
  
I got you baby girl  
So you can relax  
The way you do that  
Girl the way you move that  
You know I'm on a mission  
I ain't tryin get missin  
I'm trying to get lost...  
Lose all ya girlfriend you came with  
Cause I ain't gotta side of homies where I'm going girl  
We can go A, A, A, A, A WOL, WOL, WOL, WOL, WOL  
Turn up the phone  
Girl you don't need it  
Nobody is coming...  
Gil we can go AWOL  
  
I love the way you fit in Dolce and Gabanna  
It makes me wanna get behind it  
... and just get love  
I got the mister Money  
I'm your super and your doctor  
We can light it up and go... like a rocket  
Blow in the wind we don't need nobody watching  
We can get AWOL  
  
Chorus  
  
We're about to... now  
Let it all... now  
Ain't no turning around now  
Nobody's gonna know  
Follow me...  
We can do it anywhere  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby I'm your...  
I can try get you to New Orleans  
I ain't trying to beat it up  
I'm trying just massage it  
We can get AWOL
