Show me yours  
I' ll show you mine  
Maybe mine is bigger than yours  
Maybe mine goes deeper than yours  
That is why I cry the most  
I played your game  
But I didn' t know the rules  
Everytime we've played  
You' d come out a winner  
Now I' ve learned to play the game  
And I will never cry again  
  
[Chorus:]  
These crying games, we play  
It' s your turn to cry  
  
They say the winner takes it all  
But in my case, the winner didn't  
Take the pain  
In my case the winner didn't  
Take the hurt  
That is why I cry the most  
I played your game  
But I didn't know the rules  
Everytime we' ve played  
You' d come out a winner  
Now I've learned to play the game  
And I will never lose again  
  
[Chorus:]  
These crying games, we play  
It' s your turn to cry
