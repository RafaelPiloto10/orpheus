Well I've been out of the woods for six days and nights now  
Well I'm a little hot wired, but I'm feeling alright  
I got some money in my pocket and a long lean ride  
I got to make it down to Galveston by Saturday night, now  
  
Well I'm a little down under, but I'm feeling O.K.  
Got a little lost along the way  
  
I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
Well, I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
  
Been driving five hundred miles, got five hundred to go, yeah  
I got rock and roll music on the radio  
I got a brother on a rig just off the gulf coast  
He says the girls down there, well they're really the most, man  
  
Well I'm a little down under, but I'm feeling O.K.  
I got a little lost along the way  
  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
  
Well I got thrown out of work on the Kokomo  
Don't ask me what I'm doing, I don't know  
I hope he wasn't joking when he wrote me that letter  
Things can't get any worse, they got to get better  
  
Well I'm a little down under, but I'm feeling O.K.  
I got a little lost along the way  
  
I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day
