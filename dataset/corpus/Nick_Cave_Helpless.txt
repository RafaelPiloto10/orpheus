There is a town in north Ontario  
And I take comfort from memories there  
And in my mind I still need a place to go  
All my best changes were there  
  
Blue, blue windows behind the stars  
Yellow moon on the rise  
Big birds flying across the sky  
Throwing shadows on our eyes  
Leave us helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless  
Baby, heal me now  
  
The chains are locked and tied across the door  
They seem to help me somehow
