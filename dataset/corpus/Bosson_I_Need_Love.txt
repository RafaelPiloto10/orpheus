[Intro:]  
I need love, I want love  
  
The time was not right  
Blinded by magic in my baby's eyes  
All I ever dreamed of  
I saw you in white walking by my side  
  
But I still believe that one day  
Things work out for you and me  
And I still believe we can't be friends  
There's so much more for us to be...  
  
[Chorus:]  
I need love, I need you  
I want love, I want you  
Nothing's been the same since you walked out that door,  
You are everything that I've been looking for  
I need love, I need you  
  
So full of life And so many thing's that you wanted too  
My world was too small for you  
So try your wings the way I used to do  
  
But I still believe that one day  
When your world is cold and mean  
You will fly back home where you belong  
To the luckiest man you've seen...  
  
[Chorus:]  
I need love, I need you  
I want love, I want you  
Nothing's been the same since you walked out that door,  
You are everything that I've been looking for  
I need love, I need you  
  
So when I miss you like crazy  
I just take a walk to our place down by the sea  
To make a wish on a falling star  
And I wish you were here.... With me  
With me  
With me  
With me  
  
[Chorus:]  
I need love, I need you  
I want love, I want you  
Nothing's been the same since you walked out that door,  
You are everything that I've been looking for  
I want love, I want you  
You are the one I want' you are the one I need
