It's the sugar so sweet  
Kind I'd like to meet you at midnight  
And tell no one else about it  
  
I'm gonna make you mine  
'Cause I know we've got the time  
Now and then, baby  
Hey, I want you to know  
  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
  
Come on in the back of the '57  
Let me show you the way, the way to heaven  
You're looking so sweet, yes, you are  
I'm sure that you've got some heat  
  
I've got you on my mind  
You know you've got my time  
Now and then, baby  
Hey, I want you to know  
  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
  
I'm falling in love with you  
You make all my dreams come true  
I'm falling in love with you  
  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?
