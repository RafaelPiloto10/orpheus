Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
It ain't so much the boredom  
But the fire in her soul  
That made her life unbearable  
While living in that hole  
Of her dark surburban nightmare  
'Till she went to see the Dead  
And the self esteem she valued  
Was immediately spent  
And she had no one to turn to  
So she just turned off her mind  
She's a well adjusted wanderer  
But all this stuff takes time  
  
On the streets of old Wyoming  
There's a couple from L.A.  
They are post-environmentalists  
Looking for to stay  
'Till their friends all come to join them  
In the quest for air to breathe  
And when it gets too crowded  
They will just pick up and leave  
Like they did in New York City  
When the coast seemed quite sublime  
It don't take much but money  
And money just takes time  
  
Marie is on the lounge chair  
Draped around the pool  
Avoiding almost anyone who'd  
Desecrate he cool  
It's the reason she's attractive  
She's already self abused  
And her pride won't feel the loneliness  
That comes with being used  
She's the center of the universe  
For which she was designed  
Until she wakes up wandering  
Why all this stuff takes time  
  
Bill died of a heart attack  
Beating up his wife  
Now he's come back as a lesbian  
That's looking for his wife  
Who is now a psychoanalyst  
That likes to work with plants  
Except of course on weekends  
When she likes to wear the pants  
She's a leather goddess minister  
Who works with the confined  
It don't take much to realize  
That all this stuff takes time
