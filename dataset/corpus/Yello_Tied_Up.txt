Gulemo dilemma  
Gulemo dilemma  
Tie me up, the city heat  
Bring the bell, go down the street  
Tie me up to the babaumba beat  
Try to beat, try to fight  
Take me back into the ring tonight  
Shake it up, beat down the beat  
Shake it up to the babaumba heat  
It's the African queen, we got the summer night grand  
It's the African queen, the hottest lady in town  
It's the African queen, who keeps me on my feet  
It's the African queen, the babaumba beat  
  
All you need is love  
Take my heart  
And hold me tight forever, forever  
  
Bombo-yo, ko ko ko bombo ya

Bombo-yo, ko ko ko bombo ya
