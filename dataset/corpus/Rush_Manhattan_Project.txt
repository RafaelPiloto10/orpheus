Imagine a time  
When it all began In the dying days of a war  
A weapon, that would settle the score  
Whoever found it first  
Would be sure to do their worst  
They always had before...  
  
Imagine a man  
Where it all began  
A scientist pacing the floor  
In each nation, always eager to explore  
To build the best big stick  
To turn the winning trick  
But this was something more...  
  
The big bang,took and shook the world  
Shot down the rising sun  
The end was begun, it would hit everyone  
When the chain reaction was done  
The big shots, try to hold it back  
Fools try to wish it away  
The hopeful depend on a world without end  
Whatever the hopeless may say  
  
Imagine a place  
Where it all began  
They gathered from across the land  
To work in the secrecy of the desert sand  
All of the brightest boys  
To play with the biggest toys  
More than they bargained for...  
  
Imagine a man  
When it all began  
The pilot of "Enola Gay"  
Flying out of the shock wave  
On that August day  
All the powers that be  
And the course of history  
Would be changed for evermore...
