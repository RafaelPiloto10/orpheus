Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
He was the Playboy Type (he smoke a pipe)  
His fav'right phrase was "OUTA-SITE!"  
He had an Irish Setter  
It was a singles bar, a Tuesday night  
The moon was dim, the band was tight  
They did the bump together  
What a splendid sight,(Ren-nen-nen-nen) her teeth were white  
The drinks were cheap (it was Ladies Nite)  
He was glad that he met her  
She was an office girl ("My name is Betty")  
Her fav'right group was HELEN REDDY  
(They discussed the weather)  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a man  
She was the lonely sort, just a little too short  
Her jokes were dumb and her fav'right sport  
Was hockey (in the winter)  
He was duly impressed and was quick to suggest  
Any sport with a PUCK had to be 'bout the best  
As he jabbed his elbow in her ("Get it honey? Get it?")  
Later on they went off to where the music was soft,  
The candles were drippy, they saw a REAL HIPPY  
Who delivered their dinner  
The rice was brown, and soon they found  
That the crowd around that had jammed the room,  
Well it seemed to be getting thinner  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a man  
He took her home to a motor court  
She wouldn't kiss him, he tried to ignore it,  
But it made him angry!  
Angry, it made me angry, it made me so angry I could have killed that  
Lousy BITCH!)  
He called her a slut, a pig and a whore  
A bitch and a cunt and she slammed the door  
In a petulant frenzy!  
(A petulant frenzy, this is a petulant frenzy.  
I'm petulant, and I'm having a frenzy)  
On the sofa she weeps  
BOO HOO HOO HOO  
She weeps and she weeps  
BOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO  
She weeps and she peeks  
Through the curtain  
He just got in his car  
But the battery's dead  
So he asks to use the phone  
And she gives him some head  
And that's the end of the story  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a man  
Baby don't you want a man sometimes?
