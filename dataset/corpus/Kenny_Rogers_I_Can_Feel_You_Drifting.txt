You took me out so far that I can't swim to shore  
I've been holding on but you're not anymore  
Our love would always lead us home, constant as the Northern Star  
Here's a storm we won't get through 'cause it's not in your heart  
  
I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach  
Out there in the distance there's something else you need  
If I could be what's missing that's all I'd want to be  
I can feel you drifting  
  
In the silence that's become the company we keep  
I've realized how far we are from what we used to be  
A part of you has gone somewhere, I can't seem to touch  
I could stay and take what's left, but baby, that's not us  
  
I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach  
Out there in the distance there's something else you need  
If I could be what's missing that's all I'd want to be  
I can feel you drifting  
  
If I could be what's missing that's all I'd want to be  
I can feel you drifting, I can feel you drifting, you're out of reach
