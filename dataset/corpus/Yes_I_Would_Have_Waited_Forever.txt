I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life  
I would have waited forever - I would have given you everything I had  
I would have waited forever - There's no question, no question at all  
  
So true in the prize, would you wait for me?  
All because you got burned, so you took what you needed  
Some will always turn away, say it's reason enough  
It's another game of exploration  
Something calls at reverse and it comes to you  
Experience everything as it comes true  
  
So - It will be then  
Change - It will happen  
See - That we feel it  
All - Is completed.  
  
Don't you want the world to stop short of giving?  
Anytime of night or day, the magic things you love  
Everybody hurts when you shout, when you walk away  
Talk about it according to you  
  
I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life  
I would have waited forever - To give you everything I had  
I would have waited forever - There's no question about it at all  
  
So in between the perfect flame of you, this love will never let you down  
Just take it as it comes, for everything will come around  
  
You put your hand up: stop the flow of where you're going to  
It's another game called exploration  
How we imagine everything that we think we're going through  
It's another reason to make the break  
Everyone will move with you now to the riverside  
Experience everything, but don't let the land slide  
  
I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life  
I would have waited forever - To give you everything I had  
I would have waited forever - No question in my body and soul  
Forever
