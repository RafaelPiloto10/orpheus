I've lived a life full of sorrow  
With no where to run or to hide  
Happiness you'll see is borrowed  
All I want is you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
Gentle river take me away  
to the time of happier days  
All I need is love and company  
Gentle river bring him back to me  
  
You can spend all your time a'cryin'  
Listen here I don't need your sympathy  
Cause I've made my life to live it  
All I need is you here with me...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gentle river bring em' back to me
