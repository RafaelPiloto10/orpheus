I fade from the light  
Your glory was lost that night  
And no mind can't get me right  
And now I'm praying that you'll find me out  
Stone, stone has pulled me down  
But my faith has got me bound to your grey blue eyes  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
Don't forget my broken heart  
You remember it from the start  
You made it and it's all a part  
Of your grey blue eyes  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
You're gone and I know I'm dead  
I've lost my way  
Can't find me in your grey blue eyes  
Grey blue eyes  
Grey blue eyes  
Grey blue eyes
