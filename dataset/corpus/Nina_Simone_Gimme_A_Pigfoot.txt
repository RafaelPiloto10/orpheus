Up in Harlem on a Saturday night  
Where the highbrows get together, it's just too tight  
We all gather at the Harlem Strut  
And what we do is tut tut tut  
Ol' Hannah Brown, from way cross town  
Keeps drinking her liquor and she brings them down  
Just at the break of day  
You could hear old Hannah say  
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me daddy, 'cause I don't care  
I feel just like I wanna clown  
Give the piano player a drink  
'Cause he brought me down  
He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet  
He just send me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and check your guns  
I'm gonna be arrested when the wagon comes  
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me 'cause I don't care oh no  
Send me 'cause I don't care  
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me daddy, 'cause I don't care  
I feel just like I wanna clown  
Give the piano player a drink  
Cause he brought me down  
He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet  
He just send me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and check your guns  
I'm gonna be arrested when the wagon comes  
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me 'cause I don't care oh no  
Send me 'cause I don't care
