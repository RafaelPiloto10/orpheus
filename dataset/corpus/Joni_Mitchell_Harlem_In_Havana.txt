At the far end of the midway  
By the double Ferris wheel  
There's a band that plays so snakey  
You can't help how you feel  
Emmie Mae ran away  
With a man as dark as night  
You can see him, if you go there  
Second trumpet to the right  
  
They play "Night Train"  
So snaky  
Black girls dancing  
Long and lanky  
Barkers barking  
Step right up, folks!  
The show is about to begin  
It's Harlem in Havana time  
Step right in!  
Silver spangles  
See 'em dangle in the farm boy's eyes  
Hootchie kootchie  
Auntie Ruthie would've cried  
If she knew we were on the inside.  
  
When Emmie Mae ran away  
She came back a bottle blond  
God! The gossips had a gourmet feast  
Chomping on how she was born  
But miracle of miracles  
'cause we were underage  
She got us nearly front row seats  
To the right side of the stage  
See that tall girl?  
That's a man  
That one, too  
Big yellow feather fan  
Barkers barking  
Step right up, folks!  
The show is about to begin  
It's Harlem in Havana time  
Step right in!  
Silver spangles  
See 'em dangle in the farm boy's eyes  
Hootchie kootchie  
Auntie Ruthie would've died  
If she knew we were on the inside.
