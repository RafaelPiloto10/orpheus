Fat Lenny's gonna walk right into myself  
Fat Lenny's gonna see myself (Reflect it back on myself)  
Fat Lenny's gonna lick the shellack off the window sill  
And I say Fat Lenny's gonna lick my head off  
Stop by my friend Fat Lenny, I like him a lot (Tell him about my buddy)  
He's Fat Lenny - what  
  
Fat Lenny's gonna lick the shellack off the window sill  
And I said now Fat Lenny's gonna jump up and down (Run back down the hill)  
And I said now Fat Lenny knows what he is (to be Fat Lenny) 'cause he is Fat
Lenny (he's my buddy)  
He's Fat Lenny (I know what he is to be Fat Lenny) 'cause he's my friend Fat
Lenny  
I like Fat Lenny, I like 'cause he's my friend Fat Lenny - Fat Lenny  
What - you know - he's Fat Lenny - you know  
You know he's Fat Lenny  
  
Fat Lenny's gonna lick my brain today  
Fat Lenny doesn't like me anyway  
Fat Lenny said (my friend) today  
Fat Lenny  
  
Fat Lenny, Fat Lenny,  
Fat Lenny, Fat Lenny, Fat fat fat Lenny  
Fat Lenny, Fat Lenny  
Fat Lenny, Fat Lenny, Fat fat fat Lenny
