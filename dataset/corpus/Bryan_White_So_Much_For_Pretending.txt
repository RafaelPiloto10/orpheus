Straight out of some story  
You walk in in all your glory  
I thought you were perfect for me.  
I was out of my mind.  
  
Looked like I was winning,  
It was the best love I'd ever been in.  
Just when we were beginning, The End, you left me behind.  
And I was looking forward to a happy ending,  
So much for pretending.  
  
I should have known better,  
Than to think of happy-ever-after,  
You and me together,  
I was out of my league.  
  
I kept my heart hidden,  
Now I'm wishin' that I didn't.  
Oh, who am I kidding?  
You weren't even intrigued.  
And I was looking forward to a happy ending,  
So much for pretending.  
  
It could've been beautiful,  
If I'd only met ya,  
If I'd only let you know  
What you meant to me.  
And if I could, I would,  
Give you a demonstration  
Of how my imagination  
Thought it ought to be.  
So much for pretending.  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah  
  
Pretending, pretending, pretending  
So much for pretending.
