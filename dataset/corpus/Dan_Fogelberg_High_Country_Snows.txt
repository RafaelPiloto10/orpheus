There's a place in the Rockies  
A place that I know  
Where the world cannot find me  
And the time goes so slow.  
In the piney wood forest  
There's a flower that grows  
Through the long months of winter  
And the high country snows.  
  
To a house by a meadow  
'Neath the towering peaks  
Is a place where my heart goes  
When it's love that it seeks.  
There a woman lies waiting  
Like the wild growing rose  
Through the long months of winter  
And the high country snows.  
  
In the space of a lifetime  
A man misses much  
Till he finds him a woman  
And treasures her touch.  
When the lakes all are frozen  
And the wild wind blows  
I'll return to my darlin'  
And the high country snows.  
I'll return to my darlin'  
And the high country snows.
