Yesterday I saw a whore  
Lookin' out for more  
While she makes my body ache  
Still I walk in then I say  
  
A Well, uh  
I'm on the mic doin', uh  
The things you like and I'm, uh  
Ras M.G. and I'm, uh  
Treat you right  
  
'Cause all the ladies and me,  
You see we both agree,  
That, uh, I'm goin' down in world history, well yo  
  
Whoa, she makes my body ache  
And you know I live for more  
I won't flake or perpetrate  
I won't front no funky ho  
  
Don't get me wrong I'm just, uh  
Singin' my song  
I'm just like you,  
I like to ball my freaks all night long  
  
Not only do I rhyme  
I also cut so nice  
And all the fightin' perpetratin' DJ's want my slice  
'Cause I'm select  
  
Perpetratin' DJ's, come and look for me  
Rock me rubadub rock and roll MC  
So sweet and so nice,  
They call me delight  
  
Go,ah,go,ah,go,ah,go,ah,go,ah,go go  
  
Go Eric  
Think of somethin'  
Sing somethin'  
  
My name is Eric, I have nothing to say  
Because I am not a fucking DJ  
And if you wanna come talk to me  
Then you gotta talk to my man Bradley  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Oh, yeah  
Hold up the lyrics  
Round in the come and I see  
Because I'm not from ya'll  
Now, man, I feel it come from us  
Be yourself  
So if my lyrics are for your fuck  
Combit, for it, for my lone man  
See, that's why ya'll come to see it  
My rock, it come forward on the mic style  
See our kooky, fuckin' place  
You in our scene  
  
Uh, uh, elected  
My rhymes will be perfected  
The fightin' MC's will be dissected and rejected  
I am the most impressive,  
Aspective, and progressive  
Motivating, innovating, chillin' and digested  
  
It's obvious as ever  
It will be specialized  
If your trying to proclaim, uh  
It can't be compromised  
I am a fresh MC,  
As you can plainly see  
You won't regret a dj fresh until you soon agree  
So take a seat and feel the beat  
Of course it is okay, uh, uh  
  
Yes, I still rock M.C. (Not Judgement Day)  
Yo. You're no jumpin', Jay  
That's right. We outta here  
5000 G, 5000 G,  
We outta here, we outta here  
Peace  
Peace, nothing but peace and unity  
Seen love and no fight can go in the middle  
Say,  
  
All right
