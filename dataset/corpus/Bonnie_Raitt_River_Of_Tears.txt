I guess you got me in a sentimental mood  
Never thought I'd feel this way again  
Lyin' here with my dreams  
I get so lonely thinking of you  
River of tears  
Oceans of heartbreak  
I want to feel  
What your love can be  
I close my eyes  
The chances that I'll take  
Have made me so blind  
'Til I can't see  
I never let you know just what's been on my mind  
I never thought I'd hurt so bad for you love this long  
Lyin' here at night alone  
I keep on wonderin' just what went wrong  
River of tears  
Oceans of heartbreak  
I want to feel  
What your love can be  
I close my eyes  
Chances that I take  
Made me so blind  
'Til I can't see  
River of tears  
River of tears  
River of tears  
Oceans of heartbreak  
I wanna feel  
What your love could be  
I close my eyes  
The chances that I take  
Have got me so blind  
'Til I can't see  
River of tears  
It's a river of tear  
River of tears  
It's just a river of tear  
River of tears  
River of tears  
River of tears  
It's just a river of tears  
It's a river of tears  
It's a river of tears  
River of tears  
River of tears
