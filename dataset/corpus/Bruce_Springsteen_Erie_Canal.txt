I've got a mule and her name is Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
She's a good old worker and a good old pal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
We haul'd some barges in our day  
Filled with lumber, coal and hay  
We know every inch of the way  
From Albany to Bufallo  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
We'd better look around for a job, old gal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
You can bet your life I'll never part Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
  
Get up mule, here comes a lock  
We'll make Rome 'bout six o'clock  
One more trip and we'll go  
Right back home to Buffalo  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
Where would I be if I lost my pal?  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
I'd like to see a mule as good as my Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
  
A friend of mine once got her sore  
Now he's got a broken jaw  
'Cause she let fly with an iron toe  
And kicked him back to Bufallo  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya made your livin' on the Erie Canal  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town
