Being without you has turned out to be so inconvenient  
And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time  
You've been gone so long that it's hard to recall  
Just how the dream went  
And all but this broken heart in me I guess is doing fine  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is it still over, are we still through  
Since my phone still ain't ringing I assume it still ain't you  
I've half a mind to take the time to find somebody new  
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you  
  
That lie that I tried to slip by you  
Was told with good intentions  
It was just another way to say I love you  
And protect you from the truth  
Half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of pure prevention  
And trying to explain while I'm insane  
Is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
If I repeat myself it's cause I've nothing else to do  
And I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
