Well howdy boys, howdy, man, man it sure seems like a long time  
Since I last rode down this old trail. How ya all anyhow?  
Fellas, you see, I still have this old cigar box with me. Yes Sir!  
And better yet, all the boys out here at the R.K. Ranch are singin'  
A new song now. Hope you like it because it's my answer to  
The Blue Velvet Band. It goes like this.  
By and old willow tree in the churchyard  
On the banks of the old Rio Grande  
Lies a loved one who died broken hearted  
She was known as the Blue Velvet Band  
She was called by the angels up yonder  
As the dew kissed the pale summer rose  
As we stood there in silence, dishearted  
These words to her lover did go  
Dear Jack, you mistrusted your darling  
You said that my love wasn't true  
You've roamed o'er the wide open spaces  
But my thoughts, they were always of you  
Now, my last wish was once more to see you  
But they say you're in some foreign land  
You're forgiveness is in this last message  
From your heartbroken Blue Velvet Band  
Far away o'er the lone western prairie  
Her message sped fast o'er the way  
To the side of a bed where her cowboy  
Was grieving his life fast away  
Please grant a last wish, boys, and lay me  
Out West on that old Rio Grande  
Neath that old willow tree in the churchyard  
By my sweetheart, the Blue Velvet Band
