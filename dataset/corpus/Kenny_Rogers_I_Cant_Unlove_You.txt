Postcards and letters and pictures  
Made to last forever  
To be boxed up and tossed away  
Knick knacks and souvenirs  
In an afternoon they're out of here  
Have disappeared without a trace  
But what they mean to me can never be erased  
  
I can't unthink about you  
I can't unfeel your touch  
I can't unhear all the words  
Unsay all the things  
That used to mean so much  
Wish I could unremember  
Everything my heart's been through  
And finding out it's impossible to do  
Oh it's no use  
I can't unlove you  
  
Interstates and old songs  
Like time they go on and on  
I guess could learn to do the same  
I can wake up without you  
These two arms not around you  
Tell myself it was meant to be this way  
No matter how I try  
Some things I can't change  
  
I can't unthink about you  
I can't unfeel your touch  
I can't unhear all the words  
Unsay all the things  
That used to mean so much  
Wish I could unremember  
Everything my heart's been through  
And finding out it's impossible to do  
Oh it's no use  
I can't unlove you  
  
I wish I could unremember  
Everything my heart's been though  
And finding out it's impossible to do  
Oh it's no use  
I can't unlove you
