A fat man who was chubby that really ate too much  
How I could that I eat again  
Then I didn't want to die from my heart attack  
And this weightiness hunger can exercise again  
  
It's time for me  
I thought I was the thin man  
You should weigh some more of this  
And I'll never eat again  
I'll be overweight, got to be the thin man  
And I should've pumped more blood, and I couldn't eat more food  
  
I couldn't have some chocolate pudding  
You ate some of this again  
Even now I rode an exercise bike  
But I know I don't be gaining  
'Cause as I'm jogging my body  
The fat is gone that I never eat again  
  
It's time for me  
I thought I was the thin man  
You should weigh some more of this  
And I'll never eat again  
I'll be overweight, got to be the thin man  
And I should've pumped more blood, and I couldn't eat more food  
  
(Refrain)  
Yes, I'll be overweight, got to be the thin man  
And I should've pumped more blood, and I couldn't eat more food
