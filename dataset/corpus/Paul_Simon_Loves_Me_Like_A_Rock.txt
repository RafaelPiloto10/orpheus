When I was a little boy  
And the Devil would call my name  
I'd say "now who do  
Who do you think you're fooling?"  
I'm a consecrated boy  
Singer in a Sunday choir  
My mama loves, she loves me  
She gets down on her knees and hugs me  
She loves me like a rock  
She rocks me like the rock of ages  
And she loves me  
  
When I was grown to be a man  
And the Devil would call my name  
I'd say "now who do  
Who do you think you're fooling?"  
I'm a consummated man  
I can snatch a little purity  
My mama loves me, she loves me  
She gets down on her knees and hugs me  
She loves me like a rock  
She rocks me like the rock of ages  
And she loves me  
  
If I was President  
And the Congress call my name  
I'd say "who do  
Who do you think you're fooling?"  
I've got the Presidential Seal  
I'm up on the Presidential Podium  
My mama loves me  
She loves me  
She gets down on her knees and hugs me  
And she loves me like a rock  
She rocks me like the rock of ages  
And she loves me  
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me
