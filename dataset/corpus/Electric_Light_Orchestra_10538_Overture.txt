Did you see your friend, crying from his eyes today?  
Did you see him run through the streets and far way?  
  
Did you see him run? Did you see him fall?  
Did his life flash by on the bedroom door?  
  
Did you hear the news came across the air today?  
Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay.  
  
Did you see him hide? Did you see him crawl?  
Does his life mean more than it did before.  
  
Did you see that man running through the streets today?  
Did you catch his face, was it 10538?
