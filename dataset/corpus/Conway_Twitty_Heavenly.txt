Heavenly, heavenly, that's what you are to me  
A guiding light, in the night  
For only me to see  
Your sweet lips, your lovely eyes  
Are holding me to paradise  
A guiding star, that's what you are  
So heavenly, for only me  
(Heavenly) I feel your tender touch  
(Heavenly) I need you oh so much  
(Heavenly) Are the things you do  
(Heavenly) I'm so in love with you  
(Heavenly) Was the way you smile  
As you walk down the isle  
Heaven only knows what you mean to me  
Heavenly, heavenly  
That's what you are to me  
A guiding light, in the night  
For only me to see  
(Heavenly) Is your tender touch  
(Heavenly) I need you oh so much  
(Heavenly) Are the things you do  
I'm so in love with you  
(Heavenly) Was the way you smile  
As you walked down the Isle  
Heaven only knows what you mean to me  
Heavenly, Heavenly  
That's what you are to me  
A guiding light, in the night  
For only me, so heavenly (heavenly)
