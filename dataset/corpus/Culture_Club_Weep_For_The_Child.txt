Hey you, do you ever cry - for the child?  
  
Falling in love with strangers, feeling incomplete, hey that's me  
Some are fly, some are shy, some are acting like they own the street, ooh  
One minute we're together then the next you're acting really cool, so cool  
You can play me any way but don't ever treat me like a fool, no no no  
  
Sometimes so hateful  
Sometimes so shy  
Don't ask me why  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand  
We're twisting the style  
Ain't no need to understand  
Don't leave me alone to make it tonight  
No don't go  
  
Wearing your desperation wrapped me on your sleeve, yes you do  
You've got everything you want but you just can't get the things that you
need, oh no no no  
  
Sometimes you fake it  
Sometimes you lie  
Don't ask me why  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand, raise your hand  
We're twisting the style  
Ain't no need to understand  
Don't leave me alone to make it tonight, no no no  
  
Sweet baby  
  
You never understood  
You never treat me right  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand, raise your hand  
We're twisting the style  
Ain't no need to understand, do you understand?  
Don't leave me alone to make it tonight, yeah  
  
Weep for the child  
Weep  
Weep  
Weep  
In your heart  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand, raise your hand  
We're twisting the style  
Ain't no need to understand, no need  
Don't leave me alone to make it  
Alone to make it  
Alone to make it tonight
