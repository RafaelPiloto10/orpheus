Ooh, ooh ooh  
  
People can't be hand-made  
But he keeps slaving away  
At a stone that's too hard to break  
A girl who's too lost to save  
  
So you tried to replace me  
But you didn't get far  
And I tried to repay you  
But I only got scarred  
  
Ooh, ooh ooh  
  
She'll be breaking your fall  
And I'll be building new walls  
But this time I'll have to make sure  
To add a window for you to come back  
  
And we tried to be faithful  
But didn't get far  
Now all we'll be left with is four broken hearts  
I tried to erase you  
But didn't get get far enough away from you  
Because you still can break my heart  
  
Ooh, ooh ooh  
Ooh, ooh ooh  
Ooh, ooh ooh
