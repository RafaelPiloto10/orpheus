Everywhere I go  
I'mma plug my show, you know I gotta turn up (Got to!)  
I just left the plug  
Got a 100 birds and I put them in the trunk  
Yeah I got halves, got zips, got cuties  
Got pounds, nigga tell me what you want  
In the kitchen with a pyrex pot  
Turn it up a notch, yeah I'm 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
Got them chickens and them pigeons 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
Got them Falcons and them Ravens 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
Catch me whipping up them babies 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
And I'm whipping like it's slavery 'bout to whip it up  
  
I whip it like slavery, my trap full of babies  
Lil' mama she hate me, she say that I'm changing  
I tell her I made it, the only thing changed  
Is the money I'm making and the pamper on these babies  
I'm whipping and whipping, these pigeons and chickens  
These birds they flying from city to city  
I'm pouring up Actavis, dranking and sipping  
The color is purple, I'm drinking on Ceely  
The Bentley, the Benjis, these bitches they sucking like babies  
On the nip of them titties, like VIC get silly  
You talking bout 100 band juugs, young nigga you know that I'm with it  
I pull up, I'm serving your city  
I'm serving ODs, I got it from Mickey  
  
Everywhere I go  
I'mma plug my show, you know I gotta turn up (Got to!)  
I just left the plug  
Got a 100 birds and I put them in the trunk  
Yeah I got halves, got zips, got cuties  
Got pounds, nigga tell me what you want  
In the kitchen with a pyrex pot  
Turn it up a notch, yeah I'm 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up

I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
Catch me whipping up them babies 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
And I'm whipping like it's slavery 'bout to whip it up  
  
I'm cooking and whipping up pies, with no eyes  
I'm cooking them burgers and fries  
I'm a master in disguise  
Mama she told me I'm wise  
Looking at Benjamin Frank in his eyes  
I'm taking the plug to Hawaii  
I'm chopping on bricks circumcised  
My bitch, she came from Dubai  
She got that good brain like Devry  
I'm smoking and leaning and driving  
I hope I don't get DUI  
Watch out for the snake and the lies  
I'm trapping and whipping cream pies  
My wrists is like water come dive  
The streets is a jungle you gotta survive  
  
Everywhere I go  
I'mma plug my show, you know I gotta turn up (Got to!)  
I just left the plug  
Got a 100 birds and I put them in the trunk  
Yeah I got halves, got zips, got cuties  
Got pounds, nigga tell me what you want  
In the kitchen with a pyrex pot  
Turn it up a notch, yeah I'm 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
Got them chickens and them pigeons 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
Got them Falcons and them Ravens 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
Catch me whipping up them babies 'bout to cook it up  
I'm 'bout to cook it up, I'm 'bout to cook it up  
And I'm whipping like it's slavery 'bout to whip it up
