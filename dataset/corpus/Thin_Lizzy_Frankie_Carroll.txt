Frankie Carroll  
He got drunk last night  
I tried my best to help him  
But he wound up in a fight  
  
And his Missy got him  
She said  
"Frankie, it's alright"  
"Frankie won't do you wrong"  
  
Frankie Carroll  
He beat his kids last night  
"I don't like you kids shouting"  
"Shut up now, don't care who's wrong or right"  
  
And his Missy got him  
She said  
"Frankie, I'll keep the kids quiet"  
Frankie, Frankie, what's wrong?  
  
Frankie Carroll  
He fell to bed last night  
And his head hung off the pillow  
And his eyes were closed shut tight  
  
And his Missy  
She got up and turned out the light  
Frankie, Frankie, what's wrong?  
Frankie Carroll was with a woman last night
