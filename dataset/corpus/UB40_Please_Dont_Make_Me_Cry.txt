Please Don't Make Me Cry  
You say you are going to leave me  
I'm begging you to stay  
My baby I can't get through any way  
No I can't  
And when I wake up in the morning  
You are gone  
Little pretty thing  
You know I'll be all alone  
  
Chorus  
You'll hear me crying (mmmmmmm)  
Please don't make me cry (mmm mmmm)  
'cos I can't say good-bye (mmmmm)  
Please don't make me cry  
Because I know  
There will be nothing left for me  
  
All them good good times  
We spent together  
You said it was me and no other (yeah)  
And now you want to make me pain inside  
Darlin' I Know you are going to make me cry  
  
Chorus  
You'll hear me ..... etc  
All this pain I can't stand it  
You're going to leave  
You're going to leave this poor man on his own  
Yes you are (mmmmm)  
  
Chorus  
You'll hear me ..... etc  
All this pain I can't stand it  
You're going to leave  
You're going to leave this poor man on his own  
Yes you are  
Please don't make me cry  
Baby I'm Pleading
