If I had to live again, I'd change everything,  
'Cause everything I do, you know that I can't win.  
You say it isn't right, but you say it isn't wrong,  
How the hell am I supposed to please everyone.  
  
Tell me what it is that I'm supposed to do.  
I ain't here for everybody, but I ain't here for you,  
You said it isn't right, but you said it isn't wrong.  
I wish somebody could tell me, what it is that I've done wrong.  
  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
  
You know it's gonna get you now, and you know it starts to bring you down.  
  
Tell me what it is that I'm supposed to do,  
I ain't here for everybody, but I ain't here for you,  
It seems I have to fight, for all the things I want,  
Wish somebody could tell me what it is that I've done wrong.  
  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
  
It's forbidden.  
  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
Makes me wonder what you see.
