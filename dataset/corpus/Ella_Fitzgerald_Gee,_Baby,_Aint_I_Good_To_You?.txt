Love makes me treat you the way that I do  
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?  
There's nothing in this world too good  
For a girl so good and true  
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?  
  
Bought you a fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
A big Cadillac car, and everything  
What makes me treat you the way that I do?  
  
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?  
Bought you a fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
A big Cadillac car, and everything  
What makes me treat you the way that I do?  
Gee, baby, ain't I good, to you?
