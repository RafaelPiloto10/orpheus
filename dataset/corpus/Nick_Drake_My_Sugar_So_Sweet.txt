Yes, mama - yes, girl  
Hear me calling you  
So sweet, so sweet  
My sugar's so sweet  
My baby don't you go  
Ain't seen my little sugar come home  
So sweet, so sweet  
My sugar's so sweet  
But my baby she'd long gone  
But I've seen her - I must've been doing her wrong  
So sweet, so sweet  
My sugar's so sweet  
See my baby, don't act so smart  
I'll cut out your liver, and eat your heart  
So sweet, so sweet  
My sugar's so sweet  
Yes, mama - yes, girl  
Hear me calling you  
So sweet, so sweet  
My sugar's so swee
