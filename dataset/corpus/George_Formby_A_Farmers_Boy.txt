I've gone in for farming, I like the life, mixed up with sows and rams  
So much time I share, with the animals there, I'm beginning to baa like a
lamb.  
The air is so fresh, you get quite a thrill,  
But some of the milkmaids are much fresher still.  
To be a farmers boy, down on the farm. Can't come to harm down there.  
Early to bed makes you feel right as rain,  
Before I'm asleep I just get up again  
Down at the village inn, the daughters so nice, my fresh eggs she does enjoy  
For two eggs she lets me give her kisses a few,  
For four eggs I can kiss her yes and cuddle her too.  
Tonight I'm going to find out what a dozen will do  
Oh it's grand to be a farmers boy  
To be a farmers boy, down on the farm. Can't come to harm down there.  
Weve got fourteen pigs, that's a lot you can tell,  
Fourteen, that's not counting the farmer as well!  
I get ten bob a week, and everything found, and what have I found oh boy!  
One day the farmer said, someone, my farm tried to rob  
Two prize sheep were stolen, twas a very bad job,  
I've just sold two fine sheepskin rugs for twenty five bob  
Oh it's grand to be a farmers boy.  
To be a farmers boy, down on the farm, can't come to harm down there.  
I milk all the cows and I bob the sheeps wool,  
Then play hide and seek with a savage mad bull  
I met a country maid on marketing day, with her basket she looked so coy,  
She said she was a shepherdess they called her Bo-Peep,  
Shed lost her lambs, I said I'll help you find them don't weep  
I know that I found everything excepting her sheep  
Oh it's grand to be a farmers boy.
