Happily ever after  
Look at me, right where i want to be  
My life took a turn, it's a happy affair  
I'm never alone even when he's not there  
Happily ever after, happily ever after  
  
Happily ever after  
So carefree, look what's come over me  
All my prayers have been answered, he heard my cry  
Took all my troubles and threw them aside  
Threw them aside  
Happily ever after, happily ever after  
  
Once in a lifetime!  
I never thought i could be  
So carefree, so carefree  
Happily ever after  
  
Happily ever after  
Him and me, sunshine and laughter  
We're never alone, when there's nobody there  
We're never alone, we got love to share  
Lots of love, happily ever after  
Lost of love, happily ever after  
We've got love, happily ever after  
  
Lots of love, happily ever after  
Just look at me, right where i want to be  
  
Happily ever after
