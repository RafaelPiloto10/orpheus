One man standing on the plains of Abraham  
Watching the damaged sunrise  
One man standing near the edge of a quiet breakdown  
  
I watch the sea, it helps to anchor me  
I watch the sea, it helps to anchor me  
  
Once you start hiding you keep on hiding  
Till your paranoia calms down  
Once you start watching you keep on watching  
Till you're tied up and your spell bound  
  
Just between the ice ages anyway  
I want to talk, but I haven't got too much to say  
I don't mean to be so Nihilistic  
Forgive me if I seem to be too realistic  
  
Once you start running you keep on running  
Till your muscles start to break down  
Once you start falling you keep on falling  
Till you hit the cold cold ground  
  
I watch TV - What do you want from me?  
I watch TV - What do you want from me?  
  
Just between the ice ages anyway  
I want to talk, I haven't got enough to say  
I don't mean to be so nihilistic  
Forgive me if I seem to be too realistic  
  
Once you start hiding you keep on hiding  
Till you feel you're safe and sound  
Once you start watching you keep on watching  
Till you're tied up and you're spell bound  
  
I watch the sea, it helps to anchor me  
I watch the sea, I saw it on TV
