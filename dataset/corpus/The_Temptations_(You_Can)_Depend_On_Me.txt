Hmmmmmm...  
You...  
Need a love like mine  
That you can depend on  
When your whole world's falling in.  
When you need a friend,  
You can depend on me,  
You can depend on me.  
  
I'll be by your side  
When you need me  
When the whole world seems unfair  
When no one seems to care,  
You can depend on me,  
You can depend on me.  
  
When life seems not worth living  
And nothing seems to be going right,  
The comfort my love will be giving... giving  
Will change your darkness to light.  
  
I, I, I, I  
I'll be by your side  
When you need me  
When the whole seems unfair  
When no one seems to care,  
You can depend depend on  
Yeah, yeah,  
You can depend on me.
