Last night I went to kill  
Some time at the famous grill  
Where the tall eats the small  
There were girls all over me  
That's my insanity  
Don't call me Ringo, call me Paul  
  
I'm in heaven, I'm in hell  
Don't wipe that smile off my face  
Can't you tell  
I see faces in the weirdest places  
Please, won't you take me down  
Underneath you spell  
  
Oh, oh I'm back at midnight (alright)  
I drop my keys, could you get 'em love  
Oh, oh baby I might (he might)  
I got the stuff to keep it goin' on all night  
  
Take me down nightmare avenue  
Goin' down nightmare avenue  
I want to take you too  
  
Sharp as a sabres tooth  
Back in my favorite booth  
I'm getting spanked with cold champagne  
I'd walk on a razor blade  
If you're dressed like a French maid  
I get my pleasure out of pain  
  
I'm in heaven, I'm in hell  
Don't wipe that smile off my face  
Can't you tell  
I see faces in the weirdest places  
Please, won't you take me down  
Underneath you spell  
  
Oh, oh I'm back at midnight (alright)  
I drop my keys, could you get 'em love  
Oh, oh baby I might (he might)  
I got the stuff to keep it goin' on all night  
  
Take me down nightmare avenue  
Goin' down nightmare avenue  
Drive me down nightmare avenue  
Lay me down on nightmare avenue  
Take me down nightmare avenue  
Goin' down nightmare avenue  
Drive me down nightmare avenue  
Lay me down on nightmare avenue  
  
And I've gonna take you too
