I wind you up  
Then I wait for the melancholy  
I give you up  
While you sit here in all your glory  
I never thought you would  
I never knew you could  
But now you're gone  
And I don't think I care  
I sold your love  
  
Down the river for a bow and arrow  
Euphoria has just been here  
And she's looking terrible  
I never sung this low  
It's better if you go  
I know you're mine  
I sit here and want you to try  
To love me like a monster  
One last time  
Control me like a father  
  
One last time, stay with  
Me till I'm stronger, one last  
Bound to kick me when I'm down  
Don't kick me when I'm down  
I never thought you would  
I never understood  
And that's why I'm weak and I want  
You to try to make me an  
Example one last time  
  
To drag me through the cycle  
One last time to make  
Me a disciple, one last  
Round, will get me to the ground  
You'll get me on the ground, oh yeah  
I'll see you around  
Yeah, I'll see you around  
One last time  
And I'll see you around  
Yeah, I'll see you around  
Na na na na na na na
