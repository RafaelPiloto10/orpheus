When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased, dear  
One day science will re-animate me  
Oh I heard about the rich who when they die  
Get themselves frozen cryogenic-wise  
I know we can't afford to hire no company  
When my heart don't beat no more and I lay rigourmortisously  
But we got that freezer up on top our fridge  
Can't squeeze in my whole body, baby, I'm just way too big  
How I wish we had afforded that fancy Frigidaire  
So you'd just have to chop off my legs and my derriere  
When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased, dear  
One day science will re-animate me  
Oh I know baby, you're up for the task  
You'll wrap me up with more than just string and plastic wrap  
Using Tupperware, 'cause you care, and out of concern  
That I'd come back to life with a case of freezer burn  
When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased, dear  
One day science will re-animate me  
Oh when I thaw, when I thaw  
Hope my new body's six feet tall or more  
And if you can't find a man in time  
Get a horse, I might make a nice centaur  
Oh you'll see my face each night in your dreams  
And when you go to the kitchen to fetch some ice cream  
But don't worry honey, soon I'll be back on earth  
When they cure death and get bodies for the rich guys first  
When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
You can dispose of my body at your leisure  
You know, I don't think that it ever suited me  
When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased, dear  
One day science will re-animate me
