Did you hear that?  
It sounds like I'm losing my faith did you feel that?  
It feels like I'm so far away  
But if I knew what I know now  
  
This wouldn't be so wrong  
Now I'm back to where I started from  
And if I was sure then I'd be right  
But I guess I've lost this fight  
  
Wait until the next time  
I can feel it  
It feels like my luck's going to change  
I can see it  
  
It seems like this time it's ok  
And if I was sure then I'd be right  
But I guess I've lost this fight  
Wait until the next time  
  
I know I was close that time  
Before there's still a need for something more  
Wait until the next time
