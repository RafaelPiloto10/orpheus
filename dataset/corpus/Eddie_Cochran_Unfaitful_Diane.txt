Diane, Diane, unfaithful Diane  
With golden hair and lips like wine  
And blue eyes, as blue as the sky  
A dream I once knew knew that can never come true  
And only in dreams is she mine  
Oh Diane, Diane, unfaithful Diane  
My heart is at your command  
Why should my heart so true, love, all be for you  
Why I can't understand  
So heartsick I'll be, 'cause you'll never love me  
You'll never love any one man  
Oh Diane, Diane, unfaithful Diane  
  
Oh, not so long ago, this angel I know  
She got hold in my arms so tight  
I knew she were true, but just like a fool  
I lin-gered, now I cry each night  
For Diane, Diane, unfaithful Diane  
Oh, my heart is at your command  
Why should my heart so true, love, all be for you  
Why I can't understand  
So heartsick I'll be, 'cause you'll never love me  
But I still love you, Diane
