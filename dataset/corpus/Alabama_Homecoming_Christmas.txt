A glowin' fire and fallin' snow, they spark a memory  
Stockings hangin', mistletoe, presents beneath a tree  
A happy boy wakin' up to toys, lookin' so surprised  
And wondering how Santa knew just when I closed my eyes  
Chorus:  
It's a Homecoming Christmas, goin' back to where it all began  
Homecoming Christmas, I wanna be there once again  
Memories do sweet and strong and I've been done too long  
It's Christmas time and I'm comin' home  
I can see the Christmas tree and feel the warm fireplace  
Handmade decorations, homemade pies and cakes  
Family all together with so much love to share  
A special time and I can't wait, can't wait to be there  
Chorus
