What is the meaning of life?  
I've asked myself so many times  
Is there a reason I'm here?  
I wish someone would make it clear  
'Cause I'm living from day to day, feeling so far away  
Maybe I'm not as sane as I thought  
Keeping my eyes on You is something I've gotta do  
Even when I don't feel like it  
  
I won't give up, I won't give in  
I'm ready for my life to start again  
I won't back down, I'll stand my ground  
The time is now to show the love I've found  
I've got a reason to breathe, I've got the freedom to stand  
The future is mine, I'll give it all I can  
To break down the walls that hold me in  
It's my reason to live  
  
My reason to wake up every day and bless Your name  
In the crush of this crazy messed up world  
Only You have stayed the same  
I know I have a place here in amazing grace  
Forever safe, forever sound  
Time after time I see You are the best in me  
You're everything I'm chasing after  
  
Listen as the walls fall down  
Hear the nations calling out
