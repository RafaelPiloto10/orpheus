Who the hell are you to tell me  
What I am and what's my master plan  
What makes you think that it includes you  
Self-righteous wealth  
Stop flattering yourself  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject all-Canadian  
Sucking up to your social sect  
Making you a nervous wreck  
To hell and back and hell again I've gone  
You're not my type  
Not my type  
  
What's the difference between you and me  
I do what I want, and you do what you're told  
So listen up shut the hell up  
It's no big deal  
And I'll see you in hell  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject all-Canadian  
Sucking up to your social sect  
Making you a nervous wreck  
To hell and back and hell again I've gone  
You're not my type  
Not my type  
Not my type  
Your not my type  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject all-American  
  
Falling from grace, right on my face  
To hell and back and hell again I've gone
