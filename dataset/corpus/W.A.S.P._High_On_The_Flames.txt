Guess I've been bad all my life  
Yeah I've sinned - bad all the time  
I should have never learned  
To play with fire - Oh, no, no  
  
I got my front seat in hell  
That my momma said I would get  
And all us dirty devils there  
Are high tonight  
  
Yeah I know that I should have learned  
If ya play with fire ya burn  
No deposit, no return  
On my life  
  
Oh but there's a party down in flames  
And I got no time to waste  
No I ain't feeling no pain  
Too high to die  
  
Oh, I'm getting - high on the flames  
Oh, I'm gonna - ride on the flames  
Oh, I'm getting - high on the flames  
Oh, tonight  
Too high to die
