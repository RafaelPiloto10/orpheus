Tell me something I could say  
To make you feel the power  
Of my love for you  
Just help me find the way  
And every moment, every hour  
I'll keep trying to...  
  
Oh I swear I couldn't take it  
If I thought you didn't know  
Just how sweet you really made it  
Music to my soul...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Far beyond all space and time  
You'll live within this heart of mine  
And forever with you  
I will be  
Take my heart and take my hand  
I'll love you with all I am  
When forever's through  
I'll be loving you  
Eternally...  
  
Within my dreams I knew you'd come  
I knew you long before I ever saw your face  
You are the only one  
And no one in this world could ever take your place  
Oh, for as long as I am breathing  
Till the stars fall from the sky  
You're the one thing I believe in  
My every reason why...  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll love you all my life  
Like there was no time before you  
And this fire burning for you  
Will go on, on, on  
  
[Chorus]  
From now on  
Endlessly  
Loving You  
Eternally...
