Break Up The Concrete  
  
There was a red brick road where I grew up on  
And a pretty stone wall round a fragrant lawn  
Fish in the pond that sparkled in the dawn  
But it ain't no more it's all gone gone gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa!  
Ram it! Cram it! Grand Slam it!  
Break up the concrete, Break up the concrete  
Prod it! Sod it! Metal Rod it!  
Break up the concrete,  
Thwak it! Crack it! Line back it!  
Break up the concrete,  
Shake it! Bake it! Earthquake it!  
Break up the concrete  
  
And the depot over there right next to the tracks  
That the slaves put down, while breaking their backs  
But those Texas zoo no would ever get into a carriage  
Or anything that might lead to an interracial marriage  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now don't tell me its progress cause that's just a lie  
And don't even try to come with an excuse why!  
We we're so busy worrying about them dropping the bomb  
We didn't notice where our enemy was really coming from!  
  
Hey boys c'mon let's do it!  
  
Ram it! Cram it! Grand Slam it!!  
Break up the concrete,  
Prod it! Sod it! Metal Rod it!  
Break up the concrete  
Shake it! Bake it! Earthquake it!  
Break up the concrete  
  
Ram it! Slam it! Just cram it!  
One more time!  
Break up the concrete  
Break up the concrete  
  
Now he who laid it, come back here and raid it!
