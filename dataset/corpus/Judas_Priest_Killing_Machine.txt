I never give no answers, I never tell no lies  
I never walk a straight line so I never get surprised  
I don't ask no favors so I won't get abused  
I learned to win when I was young  
So I'm never ever gonna lose  
  
They pay me the money and I'll do the job  
I got a contract on you  
I got a contract, on you  
  
I never ask no questions, I never speak my mind  
I always found that silence helps to keep me and my kind alive  
I take care of business, It takes care of me  
I look after myself and do it well  
'cause somebody's always looking for me  
  
They pay me the money and I'll do the job  
I got a contract on you  
I got a contract on you  
  
What manner of man am I?  
A gun, lump sum and then I move on  
What manner of man are you?  
Stab a friend's back to jump a queue  
  
I do what I do 'cause I can't do nothing better  
You do what you do, just defendin' yourself  
  
'cause you ain't got nothin' better to do  
  
I got no place, no name, I'm just a killing machine  
I kept the population down, if you know what I mean  
I never stop in one place, I move about the cities  
Got expensive tastes, but I hasten to add that  
I'm the best that there is  
  
They pay me the money and I'll do the job  
I got a contract on you  
I got a contract on you  
  
I got a contract on you  
I got a contract on you
