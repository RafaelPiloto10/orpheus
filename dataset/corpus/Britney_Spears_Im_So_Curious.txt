So curious  
So curious  
  
I'm so curious  
About our love  
I don't understand  
Why you don't take my hand  
And tell me you care (You care)  
I see all the signs  
But if you want to be mine, don't leave me up in the air (Oh baby)  
  
[Bridge]  
You better let your love show  
Here's what I'm telling you:  
Let me know  
Let me go  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm so curious  
Do you love me?  
Do you wonder the way that I do (I do)  
I'm so curious  
What do you think of me?  
Boy am I just a game  
Or do you feel the same as I do  
  
So curious  
So curious  
  
I'm so curious  
About our love  
If it's make believe  
Why don't you set my heart free  
  
And tell me goodbye (goodbye)  
But if it's for real  
Tell me you feel for me way deep down inside (oh baby)  
  
[Bridge]  
Is this goodbye or hello?  
Here's what I'm telling you:  
Let me know  
Let me go  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm so curious  
Do you love me?  
Do you wonder the way that I do (I do)  
I'm so curious  
What do you think of me?  
Boy am I just a game  
Or do you feel the same as I do  
  
So Curious  
Yeah, yeah  
  
All day and night I just dream of you (of you)  
I think about all the things that we could do  
I'm dying for and I'm feeling for the day  
When you could open up and say you feel the same  
You feel like I do (yeah)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm so curious  
Do you love me? (me)  
Do you wonder the way that I do? (I do)  
I'm so curious (so curious)  
What do you think of me?  
Boy, am I just a game  
Or do you feel the same?  
  
Do you love me?  
Do you wonder the way that I do? (I do)  
I'm so curious  
What do you think of me?  
Boy, am I just a game
