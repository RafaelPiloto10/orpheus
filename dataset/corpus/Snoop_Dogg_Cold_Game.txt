It's a cold game  
I ain't been one to  
Jump in and out of the range  
Maybe an old school cynical  
Spinning the vision from which I paint  
You got to do it you can  
Gotta keep rhyming  
East side high enjoying life  
Hair blowing in the wind  
Distinctive of me is gangster bliss  
  
This is what you're calling a cyst  
Pass the morph quick  
Memories missed  
I made a lot of friends  
A whole lot of money  
Been down a couple times  
But it never stopped my rhyming  
In fact I got better  
Clutching on Berettas, blowing their sticky  
Turn it to weather  
Award shows, endo, free load bodes  
This is how a player roll  
  
And I will never be questioned  
By some new young chump popping their tongue  
Snoopy D made the way for you to walk  
O in to The Almighty  
Without you it couldn't be done  
You praise with the rise of the sun, you did  
Hold close in my hands from my throne  
And I never be crucified  
Within my own zone  
Here for a very good reason to show love  
But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug  
From almost going down for murder in '93  
To kids all over the city bowling the Snoop's league  
  
I changed, a lot smarter, I got a daughter  
Two sons, beautiful wife, for starters  
I did it all Jack  
Popping these P's even in the national cuisine overseas yeah  
Don't judge me you only knew Snoopy  
You never tried to know Calvin you tried to group me, yo  
Like some loco I earned my respect  
Yeah so much for the coast I should get a check  
But all in all I did it B  
Cool as a blind with a C  
Loving my life as I push away the groupies  
Snooping in a coup and you can call uncle Snoopy  
  
Don't worry about your circumstances  
Take your chances  
Still from the L B C  
For you are the C  
Holler at your uncle Snoopy  
Holler at your uncle Snoopy  
I paid my dues and now it's time to make a change  
Gotta make that move  
There is a time and place for everything  
I paid my dues and now it's time to make a change  
  
Gotta make that move  
There is a time and place for everything  
I paid my dues and now it's time to make a change  
Gotta make that move  
There is a time and place for everything  
I paid my dues and now it's time to make a change  
Gotta make that move  
There is a time and place for everything  
  
Don't worry about your circumstances  
Take your chances  
Still from the L B C  
You are the C  
Holler at your uncle Snoopy  
Holler at your uncle Snoopy
