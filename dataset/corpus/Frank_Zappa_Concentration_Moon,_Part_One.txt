Concentration Moon  
(Over the camp in the valley)  
Over the camp in the valley  
(Concentration Moon)  
(Oh what A)  
Concentration Moon  
(I wish I was back in the alley)  
Wish I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends,  
Still running free:  
(Running free!)  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
(That's right, you heard right:  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me!)  
American way  
How did it start?  
Thousands of creeps  
Killed in the park  
American way  
Try and explain  
Scab of a nation  
Driven insane  
Don't cry  
Gotta go bye bye  
Suddenly: die die  
Cop kill A creep! Pow pow pow  
  
Fz: And speaking of creeps, here they are, ladies and gentlemen. ..
