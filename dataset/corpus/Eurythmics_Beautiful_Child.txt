Something that I said  
Made you wear a frown  
The way you hang your head  
Has made the tears come down  
  
But don't you wear a sigh  
My beautiful child  
  
You know it doesn't burn  
When you touch the sun  
So don't be concerned  
My golden one  
You're gonna reach the sky  
Fly  
Beautiful child  
  
There is no other place  
The human race  
Is running out of space  
There is no better love  
And human love  
Is what it takes  
  
And I'll be at your side  
When you're falling down  
You'll be feeling fine  
When you hit the ground  
So don't slip away  
Stay  
Beautiful child
