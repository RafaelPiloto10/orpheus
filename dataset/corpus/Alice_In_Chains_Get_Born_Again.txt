Sat Sufferin  
I knew him when  
Fair weather friends of mine  
  
Try not to think  
I merely blink  
Hope to wish away the lies... Lies Can you protect me  
When I'm a wrecked  
I pretend you're still alive  
Yeeeaahh  
  
(2x... Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies...)  
  
I choose to day  
One deepen grave  
Thick fog that hide our smiles  
  
Clear all your sins  
Get born again  
Just repeat a couple lies  
Yeaheyeeeah  
  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies...)  
  
Can you protect me  
When I'm a wrecked  
I pretend your still alive  
  
I choose to day  
One deepen grave, thick fog that hide our smiles  
  
Sat Suffferin  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Get born again  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Sat Sufferin  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Get born again  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Sat Sufferin  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Get born again  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Sat Sufferin  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)
