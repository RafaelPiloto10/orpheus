Its Pitbull, Lil Jon  
Its my way of paying you back dog  
For all the love that you gave me  
  
(Pitbull)  
I'll be more than happy  
To show you how I rap  
Who I am, where Im from  
And what's coming up next  
Fuck the glitter and gold  
And all the glamour and glits  
I'm here for 1 reason  
And survey says! To get rich  
So give me the loot (loot)  
Show me the cash  
Open the safe  
Show me the stash  
I suggest that you show ?? Operation  
Or end up in the hospital  
Getting emergency operations  
Family asking doctor doctor  
Will he make it through  
But there's nothing that doctor doctor can do  
When the chi-chi-chi-choppers  
Are chi-chi-chi-chopping at you  
That's it, your done  
Your finished, your through  
There's no coming back  
What you think were cooking crack  
Just one question dog  
What the fuck are you looking at  
I know it's hard  
Its hard to understand  
But Pitbull will serve you anyway  
Even underhand  
Don't fuck around  
Because you just might end up  
Under land  
Im not the coward motherfucka  
I'm the man  
I'm the killer on tracks  
Call me the son of sam  
I don't know if yall ready  
But bet ya ass I am  
  
(Lil Jon)  
Who run this shit!  
Bitch we run this shit! (What!)
