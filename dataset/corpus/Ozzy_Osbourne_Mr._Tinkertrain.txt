Would you like some sweeties little girl?  
Come a little closer  
I'm gonna show you a brand new world tonight  
I've got a palace full of fantasy  
Ready made just for you and me  
Once you're there I'm gonna take you for a ride  
I got a one way ticket  
To take you to the other side  
I got a one way ticket  
So come along and don't be shy  
They call Mr. Tinker Train  
That's how I got to get my name  
They call me Mr. Tinker Train  
So come along and play my game  
You'll never be the same  
Close the curtains and turn out the lights  
Beneath my wing it's gonna be alright  
A little secret just for you and me  
I've got the kind of toys you've never seen  
Manmade and a bit obscene  
Little angel come and sit upon my knee  
  
Mr. Tinker Train  
Nevr be the same  
Mr. Tinker Train  
Can you say Mr. Tinker Train?  
No use crying 'cause you can't go back  
Now you're here to stay  
You can't run, you can't hide  
You can't tell me what I feel inside  
Mr. Tinker Train  
What's how I go to get my name  
They call me Mr. Tinker Train  
So come along and play my game  
That's why they call me Mr. Tinker Train
