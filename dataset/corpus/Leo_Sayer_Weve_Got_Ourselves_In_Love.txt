We were just friend's babe  
But love came on too strong  
We could not stop  
What we knew was wrong  
We meet in this hotel  
To hide from prying eyes  
Nobody knows  
About out secret life  
  
We've got ourselves in love babe  
We've got ourselves in love  
What are we going to do about us  
We're so much in love  
We got ourselves in love girl  
We've got ourselves in love  
Nothin' we can do about us  
Being in love  
Oh we're so much in love  
  
Don't talk in my sleep babe  
I don't repeat your name  
But somehow she knows  
That we're playing games  
So we talk in whispers  
And plan out getaway  
We've got to make our move  
Before it's too late  
  
We've got ourselves in love girl  
We got ourselves in love  
What are we going to do about us  
We're so much in love  
We've got ourselves in love babe  
We've got ourselves in love  
Nothin' they can do  
My conscience says  
That you and I should stay as friends  
My heart pretends, oh baby  
With you my life can start again  
Got ourselves in love babe  
We've got ourselves in love  
There's nothin' they can do about us  
Being in love  
  
We got ourselves in love  
We've got ourselves in love  
And I know we'll pull through  
Just being in love
