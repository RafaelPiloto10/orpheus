If I died. would you notice?  
Would you even care?  
Take everything that  
you want from me  
Strip me till you get your fill  
spilled the pill to kill the pain  
I cannot fight the you taking over me  
Ride the tide wide and slide tight right inside my vein  
Sign me up a 12'step recovery  
Keep me high by and by  
scream a lullaby to stay  
I need a shot of something to set me free  
Pound a round  
drown your sound sleep  
the day away  
And it really don't take that much to bleed  
It really don't take that much  
  
[Chorus]  
She is my bad habit  
feels like my own disease  
Sleeping with the enemy  
She is my bad habit  
Consuming all of me  
Sleeping with the enemy  
  
So throw me on the wagon.  
I'm going to break  
Adore me more on the floor and  
score the pain you inflict  
I'm running out of my pills that I can take  
Forsake my fake bellyache  
I think I'm going to be sick  
Anticipate the rush coming over me  
Control my roll, stole my soul  
and I took two to the head  
I got to have what you keep giving to me  
  
Call your bluff tough enough and  
I'm better off dead  
It don't lake that much to bleed  
It really don't take that much  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Taking over. infecting me  
My veins are filled with her  
She's slowly killing  
Taking over, infecting me  
My veins are filled with her  
She's slowly killing me  
It really don't lake that much to bleed  
and She keeps my ring upon her finger and a knife up her sleeve  
When her lips are always loaded and she's gunning for me  
It really don't take that much!  
  
[Chorus]
