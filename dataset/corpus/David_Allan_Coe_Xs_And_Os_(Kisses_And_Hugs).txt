Deliver de letter de sooner de better  
The upside down stamp meant the kisses were wetter  
I.S.Y.I.M.D., I'll see you in my dreams, honey  
  
T.S., T.S., T.S.A., S.W.A.K  
X's and O's who knows what all of that means?  
  
P.P.D.S.P.E.M.R.M.F.O.B.T. must have took  
Lots of hours for you to see  
What I was saying back then when we were still green  
  
P.M.P.M.D.S.O.F.'s not hard at all  
Please Mr. Post Man don't stumble or fall  
I still remember what M.B.D.D.F.C. means  
  
S.W.P.A.P. was a twister  
Sprinkled with powder and perfume, my sister took  
Two days to figure out sweet dreams forever sweet dreams  
  
S.D.F.S.D. had her seeing double  
The envelope looked like a good Chinese puzzle  
Yes I got those letters you wrote me when we were fifteen  
By younger son and the oldest son
