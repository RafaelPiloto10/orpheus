Falling and spinning  
Losing and winning  
Keeping my head  
Watching for signals  
Wearisome vigil  
Was I misled  
I remember you said  
That you don't want to forget me  
It doesn't matter  
Which of our fantasies fled.  
  
Every tomorrow  
Looking to borrow  
A piece of today  
Run a bit faster  
Here comes the catcher  
Making his play  
You had better not stay  
You will soon be surrounded  
It doesn't matter  
Which of our fantasies stay.  
  
Lonely and winsome  
Calling for someone  
Living right now  
Something is shallow  
Ugly and hollow  
Doesn't even allow you  
To want to know how  
You might  
  
Live for the living  
Give for the giving  
Moment by moment  
One day at a time  
It doesn't matter  
It's nothing but dreaming  
Anyhow.
