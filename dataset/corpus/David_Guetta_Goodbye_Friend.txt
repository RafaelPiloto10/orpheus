Colours will change  
I love every shade of you  
Don't lose your faith  
Keep walking out you do  
Don't you say that wasn't worth  
All the pain and all the hurt you're going through  
(And) I'll always be with you  
  
Goodbye friend  
No, this is not the end  
Just go your way  
Somewhere we'll meet again  
Hold on to the moments we shared  
Those are the chances that once you'll be back  
Goodbye friend  
  
The world's just a place  
That we're only passing through  
Heaven awaits  
Those that keep marching through  
Don't you say that loving lost  
Wasn't worth the pain it cost you're going through  
Cause I'd take it all for you  
  
Goodbye friend  
No, this is not the end  
Lift up your head  
Somewhere with me again  
Or until the moments be shared  
Those are the treasures that won't disappear  
Goodbye friend  
Friend, friend, friend, friend
