A little baby's born, daddy's up and gone  
You see his mama cry  
Don't you turn away, she's needing you today  
To help her dry her eyes  
  
All God's lovely children  
Sometimes lose their ways  
All God's lovely children  
Need your love today  
  
Met a little man, reaching out his hand  
He's reaching out for you  
Won't you take his hand? Help him understand  
And try to see him through  
  
All God's lovely children  
Sometimes lose their ways  
All God's lovely children  
Need your love today

Love my people, it's right in the steeple  
It's in your heart and in your hands  
Open up your heart, reach out your hands  
And then you'll begin to understand  
  
Why all God's lovely children  
Sometimes lose their ways  
All God's lovely children  
Need your love today
