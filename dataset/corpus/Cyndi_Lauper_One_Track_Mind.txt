Ah, ah  
Ah, ah  
(Got a one track mind)  
  
Somethings happening  
I want everything  
What does the moment bring  
I want it now  
(Got a one track mind)  
I want it, I need it  
(Got a one track mind)  
I really think so  
  
Ah, ah  
I want everything  
And I want it now  
  
(Got a one track mind)  
  
People say to me  
Mind my Q's and P's  
Why do they bother me  
Something inside  
(Got a one track mind)  
Comes over me,  
I want it, I need it  
(Got a one track mind)  
I really think so  
  
Ah, ah  
(Got a)  
  
I climb up the stairs  
I sit up and stare  
But nobody's there  
I walk ahead  
(Got a one track mind)  
You fall behind  
Another victim  
Got a one track mind  
  
Ah, ah  
I want everything  
And I want it now
