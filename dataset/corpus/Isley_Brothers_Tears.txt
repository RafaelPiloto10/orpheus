Thank you, baby  
For the years you've given me  
For each beat of my heart  
For every breath I breathe  
Thank you, sweetie  
For the best times of my life  
Through the good, through the bad  
You were always by my side  
I never thought I meet someone  
Who loves unselfishly  
But I appreciate the way you loved  
And sacrificed for me  
  
Chorus  
I can't hold back these tears  
Let me cry  
(although a man's not suppose to cry)  
If I hold back my tears  
I'll just die  
(you've given so much to my life)  
  
Thank you, lady  
For the joy you bring to life  
When I thought all was lost and gone  
You brought hope back in sight  
Thank you, honey  
For being my best friend  
When I thought no one understood  
You would always understand  
I used to think that I knew love  
And what true love should mean  
Now I know that I did not know much  
'Cause you taught me everything  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
God so loved the world  
That he blessed us all with you  
And then he gave me a heart  
Now I'm giving it to you  
And these tears I cry are tears of joy  
My happiness, I do rejoice  
In the love you give unselfishly  
Your constant sacrifice for me  
  
[Chorus:]
