Shine for me  
I'll shine for you  
Each waking dawn  
Each day  
Let these words  
Please, let this song  
Take you so  
Completely  
You have the gift of love  
You have the gift of life  
Take whatever you need  
Be the light  
For once, be sure  
Be the light you are  
You are the sound of love  
You are the sound of life  
Take whatever you need  
More will come as you reopen  
All your senses changing  
Once you have seen  
Be awake to this life song  
Shine for me  
I'll shine for you  
Each waking dawn  
Each day  
You are the gift of love  
You are the gift of life  
Take whatever you need
