Yo pretty ladies around the world  
Got a weird thing to show you  
So tell all the boys and girls  
Tell your brother, your sister and your mamma too  
We're about to go down  
And you know just what to do  
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care  
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare  
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick mama  
Come on baby tell me what's the word  
  
Word up (up up) everybody say  
When you hear the call you've got to get it on the way  
Word up (up up) it's the code word  
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard  
  
Now all you sucker DJ's who think you're fly  
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why  
You try to put on those airs and act real cool  
But you got to realize that you're acting like fools  
If there's music we can use it  
Be free to dance  
We don't have the time for psychological romance  
No romance, no romance, no romance for me mama  
Come on baby tell me what's the word  
  
Word up (up up) everybody say  
When you hear the call you've got to get it on the way  
Word up (up up) it's the code word  
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard  
  
Word up (up up) everybody say  
When you hear the call you've got to get it on the way  
Word up (up up) it's the code word  
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard  
  
Word up (up up) everybody say  
When you hear the call you've got to get it on the way  
Word up (up up) it's the code word  
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard
