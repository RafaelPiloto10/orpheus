I used to see you on the avenue  
You were the girl that let me follow you  
You used to hang out in the alleyway  
You sewed a button on my shirt one day  
I asked around until I found your name  
Then underneath the arches in the pouring rain  
I said you (yeah, you) I want you  
Every step of the way  
  
I know that things are gettin' better  
I know it's gonna be OK  
So baby don't go I ain't gonna let ya  
I want to be with you every step of the way  
Every step of the way  
  
Do ya want to, do ya want to, do ya want to dance?  
Take a chance, baby, take a chance  
I'll be with you every of the way  
I'll even show you how to strut one day  
Ain't got a girl and it's a crying shame  
'Cause I can't figure out who's to blame  
I want you (yeah, you) I want you  
Every step of the way  
  
I know that things are gettin' better  
I know things will be OK  
So baby don't go I ain't gonna let ya  
I want to be with you every step of the way  
Yeah, every step of the way  
  
I know that things are gettin' better  
I know things will be OK  
So baby don't go I ain't gonna let ya  
I want to be with you every step of the way  
Every step of the way  
Every step of the way  
Every step of the way
