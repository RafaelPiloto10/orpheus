Went down to the local gypsy  
And I handed her the same line  
You know what I want from you  
So honey won't ya gimme number nine  
'Cause you know lately I ain't feelin' so great  
Last time she gave me love potion number eight  
And you know pretty baby how I think you're pretty smart  
But one sip from this bottle and I'll tear you all apart  
  
The gypsy told me that the first thing  
That would happen you'd get dizzy  
Second thing you better make sure  
That your boyfriend isn't busy  
'Cause you won't want to eat  
And you won't want to drink  
You won't want to talk  
And you won't want to think  
My mother used to tell me not to kiss on this first date  
This time when I see you, you know I ain't gonna wait!  
  
I'll kiss you  
Gonna corner you and not let you go  
I'll kiss you  
Don't tell me nothing I don't want to know  
Twidely dee and twidely dumb  
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you  
  
Hopped into a taxi, told the driver  
Got to get me cross town  
Killed the bottle, started seeing double  
When the driver turned around  
And though I was a failure with love potion number eight  
Number nine was different and the hour's getting late  
Now I'm standing on the corner  
Everyone looks great to me  
And if you come and get me take me where I want to be  
  
I'll kiss you  
Gonna corner you and not let you go  
I'll kiss you  
Don't tell me nothing I don't want to know  
Twidely dee and twidely dumb  
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you  
  
'Cause you know lately I ain't feelin' so great  
Last time she gave me love potion number eight  
And you know pretty baby how I think you're pretty smart  
But one sip from this bottle and I'll tear you all apart  
  
I'll kiss you  
Gonna corner you and not let you go  
I'll kiss you  
Don't tell me nothing I don't want to know  
Twidely dee and twidely dumb  
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you  
  
Oh you know lately I ain't feelin' so great  
Last time she gave me love potion number eight  
And you know pretty baby oh  
I don't want to talk and I don't want to think  
I kiss you, I kiss you, I kiss you  
Oh twidely dee and twidely dumb  
I kiss you, I kiss you, I kiss you  
Oh I don't want to talk and I don't want to think  
I was a failure with love potion number eight  
But number nine was different and the hour's getting late  
I kiss you, I kiss you  
I don't want to talk and I don't want to sleep  
I kiss you, I kiss you
