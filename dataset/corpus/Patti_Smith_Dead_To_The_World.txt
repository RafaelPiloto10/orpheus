Dead to the world my body was sleeping  
On my mind was nothing at all  
Come a mist an aire so appealing  
I'm here a whispering you summoned I called  
  
I formed me a presence whose aspect was changing  
Oh he would shift he would not shift at all  
We sat for a while he was very engaging  
And when he was gone I was gone on a smile  
  
With a strange way of walking  
And a strange way of breathing  
More lives than a cat  
That led me astray  
All in all he captured my heart  
Dead to the world and just  
Slipped away  
  
I heard me a music that drew me to dancing  
Lo I turned under his spell  
I opened my coat but he never came closer  
I bolted the door and whispered oh well  
  
With a strange way of walking  
And a strange way of breathing  
More lives than a cat  
That let me astray  
All in all he captured my heart  
Dead to the world and just  
Slipped away  
  
I laid in the rushes the air was upon me  
Wondering well I just couldn't discern  
Will he come back come back to me  
Oh I whispered will you ever return  
  
I was feeling sensations in no dictionary  
He was less than a breath of shimmer and smoke  
The life in his fingers unwound my existence  
Dead to the world alive I awoke  
  
With a strange way of walking  
And a strange way of breathing  
Less than a breath of shimmer and smoke  
The life in his fingers unwound my existence  
Dead to the world alive I awoke  
Alive I awoke  
Alive alive I awoke  
Alive I awoke  
Alive I awoke  
Alive  
I awoke  
I awoke  
Alive I awoke  
Alive alive-o  
Alive alive-o
