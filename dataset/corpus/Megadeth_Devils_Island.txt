The light that fill my lonely cell,  
Is blocked out by the key,  
That locks the door to this hell,  
The place they wanted me.  
Time's racing like the wind,  
Execution's near.  
Oh Lord, I wait for death,  
And yes, I have no fear.  
I recall that night, my every breath,  
And step along the way.  
Closed my eyes, walking,  
As danger paved the way.  
The devil and the darkness  
Let her evil wander free.  
And here on Devil's Island,  
The final stop for me.  
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!  
Oh there's no escape,  
The sea is full of sharks.  
The tides take you way  
And smash you on the rocks.  
The sun is shining,  
But feel not today,  
Its warmth, it's dying,  
And fading away.  
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!  
Oh hear the call,  
From the grave beyond  
Oh so pernicious,  
Her soul could, it creates song.  
As there is no man that is  
Here upon the earth,  
Able to terminate our  
Noisome will since birth.  
The priest that reads the sermons,  
Is walking next to me,  
To the stake, my last request,  
To have her burn with me.  
But so it did, the heavens opened,  
Rain began to fall.  
The final judgment came.  
And was spread before you all.  
Final Judgment!  
Old, weak, and feeble,  
But the lesson taught to me,  
To stay away from evil,  
She doesn't care for me.  
She haunts me in my sleep,  
Though I tore that page away.  
And here on Devil's Island,  
I'll always have to stay.  
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!  
Here I am  
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!
