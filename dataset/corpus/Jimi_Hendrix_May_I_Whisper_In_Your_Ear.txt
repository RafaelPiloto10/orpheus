May I whisper in your ear  
From my heart so you'll clearly hear...  
There are people so dear...  
They're like children...  
Naked in a cold world...  
Beautiful children  
In an old world...  
  
May I take you away  
From the evils of today  
To the dreams of tomorrow.  
You know that heaven...  
Has no sorrow.  
You know that heaven...  
Has no tomorrow.  
  
Hear the sound of the magic drums...  
Hearts are beating for the sun...  
Sending evil on the run...  
Now watch the wind...  
  
Look over yonder...  
Here comes some news...  
Coming down like lightning...  
Straight for me and you.  
People of destruction  
Your time is out of date...  
People who's living crooked,  
Better start getting straight.  
  
I've been through some changes,  
A whole lot of re-arranges...  
Been through some ups and downs,  
And whole lot of turn arounds.  
I been on the shelf and even killed myself...  
1, 000 times ago and maybe 1, 000  
Times more.  
  
She said she comes from ice land...  
I told her I was from the west.  
She took me to the snow capped mountains...  
And then she put me through the test...  
We walked across the glacier,  
The horses stayed behind...  
And as we laid between the  
Frozen vallies we kissed  
For the very first time.  
And now we're stuck together.  
  
It was too long ago.  
But it seems like... Years ago...  
Since I felt the warm hello of the sun.  
Lately things seem a little colder...  
The wind, it seems to get a little bolder.  
  
Forget of my name  
Remember it only as a hand shake,  
Introduction to my belief which is god.  
Ride instead the waves of my interpreture,  
Music, sound  
Hynotic if you choose  
But truth and life  
Regardless of your questionable timid compromises  
Which I intend to erase.  
Which I will erase without hint of reward  
As I am only a messenger  
And you a sheep in process of evolution  
Almost at death with yourself  
And on the staircase of birth.  
Soon you may almost forget the smell of your family...
