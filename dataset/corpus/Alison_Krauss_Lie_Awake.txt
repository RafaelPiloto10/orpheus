I wanna run away  
Don't come out looking 'round  
Too busy dealing with it on my own  
He's right behind me  
Please God I can't be found  
Don't cast another stone  
Feel out the night, until the sunrise  
The city tells me not to go 'til dawn  
And if he wakes that's when my heart breaks  
And I'm as good as gone  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know I've got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong  
  
And in the end  
Will we make our amends  
Just like we're face to face another dawn  
And in the light, or when the moon shines  
Will you take me on home?  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know I've got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know I've got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong
