boot party on your head, kick and stomp, until your dead, you just  
messed with the wrong bunch of punx, thought we were just a  
bunch of stupid drunx, now your face down in a pool of blood  
drive your face down into the mudd, you just made your last  
mistake, listen to your rib cage break, well our boots got  
steel toes, crack your skull, break your nose, kick your teeth  
right down your throat, stand around laugh and gloat HAHAHA  
boot party on your head kick n stomp till your dead  
boot party on your head kick n stomp till your fuckin' dead dead dead
