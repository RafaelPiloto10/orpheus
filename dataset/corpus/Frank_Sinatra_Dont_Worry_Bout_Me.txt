Don't worry 'bout me  
I'll get along  
Just you forget about me  
Be happy my love  
  
Just say that our little show is over  
And so the story ends  
Why not call it a day in a sensible way  
And we'll remain friends  
  
Look out, look out for yourself  
Should be the rule  
You just give your heart and your love  
To whomever you love  
Don't you be a fool  
  
Baby why stop and cling to some fading thing  
That used to be  
So if you can forget  
Don't worry 'bout me  
  
Baby why stop and cling to some losing thing  
That used to be  
Well if you can forget  
Don't you worry 'bout me
