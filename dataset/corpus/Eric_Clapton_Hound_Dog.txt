[Chorus:]  
You ain't nothing but a hound dog  
Been snoopin' round my door  
You ain't nothing but a hound dog  
Been snoopin' round my door  
You can wag your tail  
But I ain't gonna feed you no more  
  
You told me you was high class  
I could see through that  
You told me you was high class  
I could see through that  
And baby I know  
You ain't no real cool cat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You made me feel so blue  
You made me weep and moan  
You made me feel so blue  
You made me weep and moan  
'Cause I'm looking for a woman  
All your lookin' for is a home  
  
[Chorus]
