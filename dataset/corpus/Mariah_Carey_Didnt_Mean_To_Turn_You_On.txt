When you took me out  
I knew what you were all about  
But when I did  
I guess I turned you on  
  
Now I bring you home  
You told me goodnight's not enough for you  
I'm sorry baby  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
No, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
You read me wrong  
I wasn't trying to lead you on  
Not like you think  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I know you  
Were expecting a one night stand  
When I refused  
I knew you wouldn't understand  
  
I told you twice  
I was only trying to be nice  
Only trying to be nice  
Ooh, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
Babe now why should I  
Feel guilty 'cause I won't give  
Guilty 'cause I won't give in  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
Ooh, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
When I took you out  
Iknew what you were all about  
But when I did  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
No, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I didn't mean to turn you on...  
I didn't mean to turn you on...
