Tell her you care  
Each time you speak  
Make it her birthday  
Each day of the week  
Bring her nice things  
Sugar and spice things  
Roses and lollipops  
And lollipops and roses  
  
One day shell smile  
Next day shell cry  
Minute to minute  
You'll never know why  
Coax her, pet her  
Better yet get her  
Roses and lollipops  
And lollipops and roses  
  
We try acting grown up  
But as a rule  
Were all little children  
Fresh from school  
  
So, carry her books  
That's how it starts  
Fourteen to forty  
They're kids  
In their hearts  
Keep them handy  
Flowers and candy  
Roses and Lollipops  
And lollipops and roses
