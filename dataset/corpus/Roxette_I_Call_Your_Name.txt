It's a madman's situation,  
Reminiscing in the rain,  
And I've lost your love again,  
I call your name.  
  
And I don't want to think about it  
When I go to sleep at night,  
Can you hear it in the wind?  
I call your name.  
  
I call your name...  
And I close the door behind me,  
I turn the lights all down,  
There's no-one there beside me,  
  
I call your name.  
And I don't want to think about it  
But I wind up all the same,  
Nothing'll ever change,  
  
I call your name.  
I call your name...  
Lie awake under the stars,  
Lie awake under the stars.  
  
I call your name...
