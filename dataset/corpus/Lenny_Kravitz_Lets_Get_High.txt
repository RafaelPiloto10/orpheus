Let's go out  
On an ocean ride  
Leave all your cares  
And the past behind  
  
Let's venture out  
To a deserted isle  
Let's get in touch  
With what is alive  
  
Ohhh I love you  
Ohhh it's wonderful  
Ohhh it's magical  
  
Let's get high  
Let's get high  
Let's get high  
High on this feeling of love  
  
Let's go out  
On an ocean ride  
We'll tell no one  
We'll just go and hide  
Just spread your wings  
And go with the tide  
Let our love be our one desire  
  
Ohhh I love you  
Ohhh it's wonderful  
Ohhh it's magical  
  
Let's get high  
Let's get high  
Let's get high  
High on this feeling of love  
  
Ohhh I love you  
Ohhh it's wonderful  
Ohhh it's magical  
  
Let's get high  
Let's get high  
Let's get high  
High on this feeling of love
