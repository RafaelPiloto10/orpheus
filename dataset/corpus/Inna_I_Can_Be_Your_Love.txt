(I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the London's rain)  
  
Slow down, slow down, slow down  
You broken my heart again  
Broken my soul again  
Move on, move on, move on  
I feel like I'm going down  
Tell me what's going on  
  
I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the London's rain  
I can be your love again  
  
I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the London's rain  
I can be your love again  
  
Take control, take control  
Take me everything I got inside my empty soul  
Walk with me, stay with me  
And I show how I'll be  
  
I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the London's rain  
I can be your love again  
  
I can be your love again...  
  
(I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the London's rain)  
  
I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the London's rain  
I can be your love again  
I can be your love again)
