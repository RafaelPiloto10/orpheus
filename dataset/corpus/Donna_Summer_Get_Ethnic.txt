(Rap:)  
Lying here in the sun just trying to get a tan  
Trying to find a look to go with the plan  
  
Everyone's different  
Everyone's go their thing  
Spin man give me a rhythm...swing, swing  
  
You don't have to dance alone  
You get on the floor and make yourself at home  
Do anything you want to do  
It's alright... it's all up to you  
  
(Ethnic chorus):  
It doesn't matter what skin you're in  
Baby let the groove begin  
Get ethnic...all day  
Get ethnic...all night  
'gonna chill and ride the day out  
People let me tell you what it's all about  
Get ethnic...all day  
Get ethnic...all night long  
  
(Talk):  
Walk my way!!!  
Talk my way!!!  
  
This is a new direction  
We're gonna take it to the street  
Spinman throw down a funky beat  
Ooh sweet  
Don't really care where you come from  
You may move to a different drum  
Jump right in and take you place  
We're all part of the human race  
  
(Ethnic chorus):  
Like you mama do  
And your daddy too  
It's an attitude  
  
(Ethnic chorus x 2):  
Everybody's different  
And we all have a song to sing  
Spin man do your rhythm thing...swing...swing  
Spin man do your rhythm thing...swing...swing  
  
(Ethnic chorus):  
See'mon see'mon baby  
Smooth me out  
Smooth me out  
(chant fade).
