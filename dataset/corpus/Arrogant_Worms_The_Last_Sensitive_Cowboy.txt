When you hear that I'm a cowboy  
And I work the cattle trail  
You probably assume I'm big and tough (big and tough)  
But the trail's worn me down  
I don't wanna hang around  
I've just about had enough (had enough)  
Ya see, I like a nice cup of Espresso  
And I like to read my People magazine  
I co-ordinate my chaps  
But everybody laughs  
And say they don't like that shade of green  
Oh no, it's true  
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do  
Oh no, it's kinda strange  
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range  
Well I try to eat a healthy balanced diet  
But they all eat their brown beans from the can  
They all have to smoke about 6 packs a day  
You'd think they was the Marlboro man  
And they don't like to go to see the opera  
On Friday nights when they get paid  
And they don't help me bring in the hanging plants  
Every time there's a Native American raid  
Oh no, it's true  
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do  
Oh no, it's kinda strange  
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range  
Cowboy life sure is different these days..  
Why brand your cattle when you can just use bovine psychology?  
Why have a gunfight when there are so many good paralegals out there?  
Nobody drinks in bushwhacks anymore. Besides, we're all switching  
Over to equal-salt produced tofu jerkey. And if you're gonna ride off  
Into the sunset, make sure you're using an effective sunblock.  
Oh no, it's true  
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do  
Oh no, it's kinda strange  
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on  
Oh no, it's true  
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do  
Oh no, it's kinda strange  
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range
