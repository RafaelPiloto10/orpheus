Ah, ah, you're beautiful  
(Yeah)  
Ah, ah, you're beautiful  
  
Hop on the back of my bike  
Let the good wind blow through your hair  
With an ass like that and a smile so bright  
Oh, you're killing me, you know it ain't fair, yeah  
Ride on through the middle of the night  
Let the moonlight kiss your skin  
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight  
Oh, you're killing me, baby do it again  
  
You're beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful  
And I can't pretend that that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah  
You're beautiful, good lord, you're fucking beautiful  
And I can't pretend that that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah  
  
I like when you run red lights  
Don't stop 'til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me  
Always in control, how you do it, I don't know  
But I don't care, take me anywhere  
'Cause it's beautiful, ooh you make me feel undressable  
And I can't pretend that that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah  
  
You're beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful  
And I can't pretend that that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah  
You're beautiful, good lord, you're fucking beautiful  
And I can't pretend that that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Yeah yeah  
You don't know what you're doing darling  
Hop on back my bike darling  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
Don't you worry darling
