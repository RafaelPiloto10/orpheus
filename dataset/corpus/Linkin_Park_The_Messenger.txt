When you feel you're alone  
Cut off from this cruel world  
Your instincts telling you to run  
  
Listen to your heart  
Those angel voices  
They'll see you to you  
They'll be your guide  
Back home where life leaves us blind  
Love keeps us kind  
It keeps us kind !  
  
When you suffered it all  
And your spirit is breaking  
You're growing desperate from the fight  
Remember your love  
And you always will be  
This melody will always bring  
You right back home  
  
When life leaves us blind  
Love, keeps us kind!  
When life leaves us blind  
Love keeps us kind!  
  
Oh oh!  
Oh oh!  
Oh oh!
