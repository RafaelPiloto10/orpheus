The streets are lined with camera crews  
Everywhere he goes is news  
Today is different  
Today is not the same  
Today I make the action  
Take snapshot into the light, snapshot into the light  
I'm shooting into the light  
  
Four miles down the cavalcade moves on  
Driving into the sun  
If I worked it out right  
They won't see me or the gun  
  
Two miles to go, they're clearing the road  
The cheering has really begun  
I've got my radio  
I can hear what's going on  
  
I've been waiting for this  
I have been waiting for this  
All you people in TV land  
I will wake up your empty shells  
Peak-time viewing blown in a flash  
As I burn into your memory cells  
'cause I'm alive  
  
They're coming 'round the corner with the bikers at the front  
I'm wiping the sweat from my eyes  
It's a matter of time  
It's a matter of will  
And the governor's car is not far behind  
He's not the one I've got in mind  
'cause there he is-the man of the hour, standing in the limousine  
"I don't really hate you  
I don't care what you do  
We were made for each other  
Me and you  
I want to be somebody  
You were like that too  
If you don't get given you learn to take  
And I will take you."  
  
Holding my breath  
Release the catch  
And I let the bullet fly  
  
All turned quiet I have been here before  
Lonely boy hiding behind the front door  
Friends have all gone home  
There's my toy gun on the floor  
Come back Mum and Dad  
You're growing apart  
You know that I'm growing up sad  
I need some attention  
I shoot into the light
