All turns around  
All together we stumbled  
In there, a million pounds  
Everyone with a raise around  
  
And the smoke lies  
On the valley floor  
And the blood dries  
While we spill some more  
  
Once we were at the end  
The end of a long road  
Living to the skies  
All the other remained crowns  
  
And the smoke lies  
On the valley floor  
And the blood dries  
  
In the summer these days  
Children are alone  
All alone with the point  
  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
  
Mountains are around  
All together we tumbled down  
  
And the smoke lies  
On the valley floor  
And the blood dries  
While we spill
