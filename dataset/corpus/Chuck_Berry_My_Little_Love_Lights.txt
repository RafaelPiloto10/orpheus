This little love-light of mine are you gonna let it shine  
This little love-light of mine are you gonna let it shine  
This little love-light of mine are you gonna let it shine  
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine  
  
With your arms wrapped around me my little love-light will shine  
With your arms wrapped around me my little love-light will shine  
With your arms wrapped around me my little love-light will shine  
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine  
  
Someday soon you promised me you'd make my love-light shine  
Someday soon you promised me you'd make my love-light shine  
Someday soon you promised me you'd make my love-light shine  
With a kiss, your arms around me, make it shine  
  
Wee, wee hours come and let my love-light shine  
In the wee, wee hours let my lil' love-light shine  
In the wee, wee hours let my lil' love-light shine  
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
