Hear me speak what's on my mind  
Let me give this testimony  
Reaffirm that you will find  
That you are my one and only.  
  
No exception to this rule  
I'm simple but I'm no fool  
I've got a witness happy to say  
Every hour, every day.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim  
My red blood runs true blue  
And every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Classic case of boy meets girl  
Moving in the same direction  
You're not asking for the world  
I'm not asking for perfection.  
  
Just a love that's well designed  
For passing the test of time  
I'm here to tell you  
I'm here to stay  
Every hour, every day.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim  
Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's true  
Every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim, yeah  
My red blood runs true blue  
And every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
Yeah sure maybe I'm on the edge  
But I love you baby and like I said  
I'm here to tell you  
I'm here to stay  
Every hour, every day.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim  
Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's true  
Every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name (every)  
Loud and clear they stake my claim, yeah  
My red blood runs true blue  
And every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name (every)  
Loud and clear they stake my claim, yeah  
(Every heartbeat)  
And every heartbeat belongs to you.  
  
Every heartbeat bears your name  
Loud and clear they stake my claim  
Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's true  
Every heartbeat belongs to you.
