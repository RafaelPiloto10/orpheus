Got the one room suite in the downtown motel,  
Got a lovely view.  
Classic shot of the parking lot,  
An off ramp of route 72.  
Half flat six pack of lukewarm beer,  
So lay down by my side.  
Like to whisper sweet nothings  
In my filthy ear till I'm satisfied.  
  
Baby-bootie, juicy-fruity,  
Truck-stop cutie, roadside-beauty,  
I'm in love with you.  
Hope it don't last too long.  
  
You got the mackerel eyes,  
Brought the side of fries.  
You got me hypnotized,  
I'm in love again.  
Now baby when I told you  
That I love you,  
I was only telling a lie.  
I'll be long gone  
Come the crack of dawn  
And I believe the word is  
Good-bye, bye baby, bye, bye.  
  
I was only telling a lie,  
There ain't no need to act  
Like I shot your dog, no.  
I was only telling a lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
