In that big big house there are fifty doors  
and one of them leads to your heart.  
In the time of spring I passed your gate  
and tried to make a start.  
All I knew was the scent of sea and dew  
but I've been in love before,  
how about you?  
  
There's a time for the good in life,  
a time to kill the pain in life,  
dream about the sun you queen of rain  
  
In that big house there are fifty beds  
and one of them leads to your soul.  
It's a bed of fear, a bed of threats,  
regrets and sheets so cold.  
All I knew your eyes so velvet blue,  
I've been in love before, how about you?  
  
There's a time for the good in life,  
a time to kill the pain in life,  
dream about the sun you queen of rain  
  
It's time to place your bets in life,  
I've played the loser's game of life,  
dream about the sun you queen of rain  
  
Time went by as I wrote your name in the sky,  
fly fly away, bye bye.
