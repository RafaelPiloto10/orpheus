Forty detectives this week  
Forty detectives strong  
Takin' a stroll down love street  
Strollin', is that so wrong?  
Can I get my co-dependant?  
  
Hump de bump doop bodu  
Bump de hump doop bop  
Hump de bump doop bodu  
  
Oh no!  
  
Bump de hump doop bodu  
Hump de bump doop bop  
Bump de hump doop bodu  
  
Bump, bump  
  
It must have been a hundred miles  
Or any of a hundred styles  
It's not about the smile you wear but  
The way we make out!  
  
When I was an all-aloner  
Nothing but a two-beach comber  
Anybody seen the sky? I'm  
I'm wide awake now!  
  
Workin' the beat as we speak  
Workin' the belle du monde  
Believe in the havoc we wreak  
Believin', is that so wrong?  
Can I get my co-dependant?  
  
Hump de bump doop bodu  
Bump de hump doop bop  
Hump de bump doop bodu  
  
Bump de hump doop bodu  
Hump de bump doop bop  
Bump de hump doop bodu  
  
Bump, bump  
  
C'mon!  
  
It must have been a hundred miles  
Any of a hundred styles  
It's not about the smile you wear but  
The way we make out!  
  
When I was an all-aloner  
Nothing but a two-beach comber  
Anybody seen the sky, I'm  
I'm wide awake now

Oh no!  
  
Bump de hump doop bodu  
Hump de bump doop bop

Bump, bump  
  
Listenin' to what I said  
And try to get it through your head  
A little bit of circumstance and  
A chance to make out!  
  
Livin' in a citadel  
It's hard enough to be yourself!  
Waiting for the bell to toll and  
I'm wide awake now!  
  
It must have been a hundred miles  
Or any of a hundred styles  
It's not about the smile you wear but  
The way we make out!  
  
When I was an all-aloner!  
Nothing but a two-beach comber!  
Anybody seen the sky? I'm  
I'm wide awake now
