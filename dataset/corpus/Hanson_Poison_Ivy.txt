Poison Ivy  
Whoa But everybody knows, don't ya know, don't ya know?  
She'll get you in love, OW!  
You can look but you'd better not touch  
Poison Ivy, poison ivy  
Late at night while you're sleeping  
Poison ivy comes a-creepin around  
She's pretty as a daisy

You can look but you'd better not touch  
Poison Ivy, poison ivy  
Measles make ya' mumpy,  
And mumps'll make ya' lumpy  
And chicken pox will make you jump and twitch  
A common cold will fool ya'  
And whooping coughs will cool ya'  
But Poison Ivy,  
Lord will make you itch  
You're gonna need an ocean  
Of calamine lotion,

The minute you start to mess around
