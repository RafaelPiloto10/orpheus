Hello and goodbye  
I just unemployed you  
You can go back to school  
You've had a good run  
I'm sure he enjoyed you  
Don't act sad or surprised  
Let's be friends, civilized  
  
Come on little one  
Don't sit there like a dummy  
The day you knew would arrive  
Is here, you'll survive  
So move, funny face  
  
I like your conversation  
You've a catchy turn of phrase  
You're obviously going through  
Some adolescent phase  
  
So what happens now  
So what happens now  
Where am I going to  
  
You'll get by  
You always have before  
  
Where am I going to  
  
Don't ask anymore
