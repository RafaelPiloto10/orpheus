All the world knows  
Yet none too well  
To shun the heaven  
That lead men to this hell  
If all the stars  
Disappear and die  
And I'm looking at an empty sky  
Oh I'll be damned  
Back behind the sun  
This kind of love  
Can't be bought or won girl  
And when every second counts  
When the minutes  
Turn a night into a day  
Because the closer you get  
The further you slip away  
Because the closer you get  
The further you slip away  
When the summer rain came  
Well it kissed our feet  
And a magic moon lay down on our street  
Love and death  
It's like war and peace  
One single outreach  
On this empty beach  
'Cause you're damned if you do  
And you're damned if you don't  
Want her to stay away hey  
Because the closer you get  
The further you slip away  
'Cause the closer you get  
The further love slipped away,  
Slipped away  
Ooh  
Na na na na na na,  
Na na na na na na  
Slipping away,  
Slipping away  
These plastic bags and  
These crushed up cans  
This twisted wreck  
On some foreign land  
Better hold close  
What you hold so dear  
'Cause the vanishing point  
Is coming oh so near  
All this world knows  
Yet none too well  
To shun the heaven  
That lead men to this hell  
He closer you get  
The further you slip away  
'Cause the closer you get  
The further love slipped away,  
Slipped away  
He closer you get  
The further you slip away  
'Cause the closer you get  
The further love slipped away,  
Slipped away
