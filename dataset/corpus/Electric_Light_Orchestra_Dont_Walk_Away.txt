Why do I say, don't walk away  
You'll be the way your were before  
When you don't want me anymore  
  
Don't turn around, don't ever leave  
A lonely room where empty days  
Are gathering to meet me when you're gone-  
Gone- how in the world will I go on  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away)  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't walk away, don't say goodbye  
Don't turn around, don't let it die  
When shadows fall, when day is done  
All through the night, all of my life  
Don't walk away  
  
Is it a dream, when will it end  
When everything we've ever known  
Has ended and I'm all alone  
  
Where will I go, where will I be  
The feelings that I've never shown  
Maybe I'll find the answer when you're gone-  
Gone- how in the world will I go on  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away)  
  
[Chorus]
