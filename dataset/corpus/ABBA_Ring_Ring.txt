I was sitting by the phone  
I was waiting all alone  
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you  
It's a dark and dreary night  
Seems like nothing's going right  
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?  
  
Yes I'm down and feeling blue  
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh  
  
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all  
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall  
And I sit all alone impatiently  
Won't you please understand the need in me  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
  
You were here and now you're gone  
Hey did I do something wrong?  
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken  
Was it me or was it you?  
Tell me, are we really through?  
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking  
  
Please forgive and then forget  
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh  
  
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all  
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall  
And I sit all alone impatiently  
Won't you please understand the need in me  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
