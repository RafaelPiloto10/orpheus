All we've ever owed each other for the time we spent together  
Was the right to know it's over when it's gone  
What it wasn't doesn't matter, and it still don't feel no better  
Just to know who done who, righteously or wrong  
  
Lord I wish that I could say I could see a single way  
That we could take it back to where it used to be  
Before the daylight broke to pieces everything I used to make believe  
  
And it's never gonna be the same again I'm sorry we can't even still be
friends  
Trusting you has left some wounds that time ain't gonna mend  
And it's a never gonna be the same again  
  
It's a shame to know it's over and you're nothing but another  
Pretty thing that I don't do before I die  
But the saddest part of all is never knowin' if you'll ever even wonder why  
And it's never gonna be the same...  
Oh you can't never gonna be the same again
