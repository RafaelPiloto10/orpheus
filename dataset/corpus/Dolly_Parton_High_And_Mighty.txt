He is high and mighty  
He is high and mighty  
He is there and ever waiting  
Reaching out to you and me  
  
He is high and mighty  
Oh, mighty is His power  
Mighty is His love  
He is high and mighty  
He is there with the answers  
Let us lift Him up  
  
God loves you, did you know that?  
Ain't it good to know he cares  
If you're burdened down with troubles  
Just go to Him in prayer  
Say God, I'm just a seeker  
I'm empty, scared and lost  
Then lay your burdens down  
At the foot of the cross  
  
He said ye shall know the truth  
And the truth shall set you free  
He will guide and lead you  
And fulfill every need  
Nothing is impossible  
If you have faith enough  
So if you've lost direction  
Stop and just look up  
  
'Cause He is high and mighty  
Ooh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love  
He is high and mighty  
He is life everlasting  
Let us lift Him up  
  
High and mighty  
He is high and mighty  
I believe, I do believe  
That His love has set me free  
I believe, I believe, I believe  
  
He is high and mighty  
Oh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love  
He is high and He's mighty  
It's a wonderful feeling  
Let us lift Him up  
He said if I be lifted up  
He said if I be lifted up  
What did He say?  
He said if I be lifted up  
I'll draw all the men unto me  
Let's lift him higher, higher  
Higher and higher each day  
Let's lift Him up  
'Cause He is high and He's mighty  
And He has washed my sins away  
'Cause He's high and He's mighty
