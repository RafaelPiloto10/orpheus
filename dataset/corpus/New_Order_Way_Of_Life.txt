You told me about yourself,  
How you once lived with someone else  
The way of life that you had tried  
The way they hurt you deep inside  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
When I look at you I know you're lying  
All you say and do  
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying  
  
But I thought I could've seen you here today  
But you leave me standing each and every way  
You told me a pack of lies  
That I can't even reason with  
Failure of your moral code  
The kind of things that I can't give  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
When I look at you I know you're lying  
All you say and do  
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying  
  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
When I look at you I know you're lying  
All you say and do  
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying
