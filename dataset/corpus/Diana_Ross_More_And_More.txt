Have I ever been here before  
I remember hearing your name, sir  
If my conversation lacks discretion  
It's the same old foolish game  
  
Did I ever give you my key  
Did you ever walk through my door, sir  
You may not be one of my possessions  
But I need you more and more  
  
I finally acquired what other people live on  
I always took what I could find  
But on that lucky night  
I found me loving you  
And the best thing you can do  
is to fall in love with  
  
I can feel the glow when we kiss  
I don't have the strength to resist you  
You must have lit a fire in my heart  
'Cause I need you more and more  
  
I'm resting in your arms  
And dancing in the moonlight  
My emotions are on display  
And if I don't see your face  
Or feel you in my fingers  
I would have to try  
To get by with someone like  
  
You relax while I make you warm  
And into your trap I will fall, sir  
I gave my last position  
On the chance to see you more  
To love you more and more  
And more...
