The white stuff, The white stuff  
  
The first one was a sweet one  
Second one was a blast  
Soon I finished off the bag, ate 'em up real fast  
You can see 'em in my teeth  
Tell it when I talk  
Had so many my pancreas just went into shock  
  
I love the white stuff, baby  
In the middle of an Oreo  
I love the white stuff, baby  
It's the most delicious thing I know  
  
I've had a zillion or two  
In my life, they're so right  
My teeth are all rotted clear through  
But who cares? What else am I supposed to do?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh Oreo  
The white stuff  
Oh Oreo  
What's in the middle? The white stuff  
  
The first time that I tried it  
Got a big sugar buzz  
Nothing gets me high as that sandwich cookie does  
But I love the filling most  
I rub it on my roast  
Mix it in with my coffee and spread it on my toast  
  
I love the white stuff, baby  
In the middle of an Oreo  
I love the white stuff, baby  
Take some with me everywhere I go  
  
Might get a pimple or two  
Well, so what? It's all right  
Now Twinkies and Ding Dongs won't do  
All I need... You know what it is  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh Oreo, the white stuff [Repeat: x1]  
Oh Oreo  
What's in the middle? The white stuff
