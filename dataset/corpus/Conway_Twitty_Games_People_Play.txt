Oh the games people now every night and every day now  
Never meanin' what they say now never sayin' what they mean  
So they wile away the hours in their ivory towers  
Till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine  
Lotten da la da da da lotten da la a dee de dee  
Talkin' bout you and me and the games people play  
  
Oh we make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye  
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame  
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten  
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame  
Lotten da la da da da  
  
People walkin' up to ya singing glory hallelujah  
And they're tryin' to sock it to ya in the name of the Lord  
They're gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your
fate  
And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board  
Lotten da la da da da  
  
Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me  
God grand me the serenity to just remember who I am  
Cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity  
Turn your back on humanity and you don't give a lot  
Lotten da la da da da
