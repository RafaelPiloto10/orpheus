I'm always looking for a minute that we can steal  
Cause I need more of how you make me feel  
I used to be the king of wasted time  
Cause it made no difference till I made you mine  
  
Now I wake up in the morning with a smile on my face  
Can't get enough of the human race  
Ain't loved like this since I can't remember when  
Baby you made life good again oh yeah darlin you made life good again  
  
I like the way you talk and the way you look when it comes to loving you wrote
the book  
Cause when you kiss me . . . tell me what part of heaven did you come from  
  
Now I wake up in the morning with a smile on my face  
Ain't loved like this since I can't remember when  
Baby you made life good again oh yeah darlin you made life good again I was
lonely, oh so lonely won't Be lonely again I wake up in the morning with a
smile on my face can't get enough of the human race Ain't loved like this
since I can't remember when baby oh yeah darlin you made life good again you
ade life good again
