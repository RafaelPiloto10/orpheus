Up and down the stairs  
In and out the door  
Walked every inch of the floor  
You think you know a place  
But there locked in an empty room  
Out of the dark comes you  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
A flood of light fall on my face  
I see, I see, I see  
For the first time  
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt  
So good inside I swear I could die  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
What is this fallin'  
No dancin' down my cheek  
Why's it hard for me to speak?  
You think you know a heart  
But then it suddenly starts to pound  
It literally knocks you down  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
A flood of light fall on my face  
I see, I see, I see  
For the first time  
(For the first time)  
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt  
So good inside I swear I could die  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
Yeah, for the first time  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
A flood of light  
I see, I see, I see  
For the first time  
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt  
So good inside I swear I could die  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
For the first time  
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt  
So good inside I swear I could die  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
Oh, for the first time  
For the first time  
For the first time  
Ooh
