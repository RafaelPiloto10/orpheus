Ain't no use baby  
I'm leaving the scene  
Ain't no use baby  
You're too doggone mean  
  
Yes I'm tired of paying dues  
Having the blues  
Hitting bad news  
Ain't no use baby  
  
Ain't no use baby  
I'm leaving town  
Ain't no use daddy  
I'm putting you down  
  
I'm gonna change my name  
Things won't be the same  
'Cause I'm tired of playing your game  
Ain't no use baby I tell you ain't no use  
  
I tried all these years Lord knows I've tried  
Yes and I cried deep down inside  
But daddy why complain  
It's all over and you're to blame yeah yeah  
  
Ain't no use baby  
Shed them tears  
Ain't no use baby  
I cried for years for too many years  
  
You done had your fan  
  
Ain't no use  
Ain't no use  
Ain't no use daddy  
Ain't no use
