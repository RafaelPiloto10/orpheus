[Chorus: x2]  
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more  
  
I keep forgetting that you told me that you  
Didn't want me around any more  
But these stupid old feet  
Just head for your street  
Like they've done so many times before  
And this stubborn old fist  
On the end of my wrist  
Keeps a knocking on your front door  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more  
  
I keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights  
And those heartbreaking things  
That you said  
Though I know in my heart  
We're drifting apart  
I can't believe that our love is dead  
Though it's plain as can be  
That you're finished with me  
I just can't get it through my head  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Though I know in my heart  
We're drifting apart  
I can't believe that our love is dead  
Though it's plain as can be  
That you're finished with me  
I just can't get it through my head  
  
[Chorus: x5]
