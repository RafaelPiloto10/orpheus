Schooldays over, come on then john  
Time to be getting your pit boots on  
On with your sack and your moleskin trousers  
Time you were on your way  
Time you were learning the pitman's job  
And earning a pitman's pay.  
Come on then jim, it's time to go  
Time you were working down below  
Time to be handling a pick and shovel  
You start at the pits today  
Time to be learning the collier's job  
And earning a collier's pay.  
Come on then dai, it's nearly light  
Time you were off to the anthracite  
The morning mist is on the valley  
It's time you were on your way  
Time you were learning the miner's job  
And earning a miner's pay  
Repeat first verse
