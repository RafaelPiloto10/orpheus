Used to be that I could see  
A reason to be happy 'cause I was free  
But then recently it seems  
I've been lettin' your mem'ry get to me  
  
Used to be that I could pretend  
That I wasn't really hurt back then  
But then recently it seems  
I've been lettin' your mem'ry get to me  
  
'Cause mem'ries can be friends  
Or they can take you to a place  
The you never thought you'd be again  
And take you to a place  
That you never ever thought  
That you would see again  
  
'Cause mem'ries can be friends  
Or they can take you to a place  
The you never thought you'd be again  
And take you to a place  
That you never ever thought  
That you would see again  
  
Doesn't matter now who was wrong  
The future is tomorrow 'cause the past is gone  
And I'm findin' that I'm not as strong  
As I thought that I used to be  
'Cause recently it seems  
I've been lettin' your mem'ry get to me
