The more we get together,  
Together, together,  
The more we get together,  
The happier we'll be.  
  
Cause your friends are my friends,  
And my friends are your friends.  
The more we get together,  
The happier we'll be.  
Oh, the more we get together,  
Together, together,  
The more we get together,  
The happier we'll be.  
Theres Chris and Tanya  
And Jason and Jusitn.  
The more we get together,  
The happier we'll be.  
  
(Ok, are you ready to sing now?)  
  
The more we get together,  
Together, together,  
The more we get together,  
The happier we'll be.  
  
Cause your friends are my friends,  
And my friends are your friends.  
The more we get together,  
The happier we'll be.
