How long was I sleeping? did you wake me? didn't feel like all that long.  
Do I see the morning? no it can't be happen to me.  
  
I've been stuck in the quicksand, more the pavement colours black and white
too long  
I could black out completely, but I made me, make my way back slowly.  
  
It's my time to shine, do it my way cuz it's my time baby  
It's my time to burn, start a fire, be the one and only  
I said it  
I meant it  
I never will forget it  
Change never happens by itself  
It's my time to burn, my time to shine.  
Time to make it for myself.  
  
How long was I buried? couldn't find me, laid to rest, my heart beats on.  
Kept track of the symptoms, could've killed me but you will see  
I'm not broken, I could be. yeah you would be but my heart is much too strong  
Never thought it was easy, but I made me, I made me slowly  
  
It's my time to shine, do it my way cuz it's my time baby  
It's my time to burn, start a fire, be the one and only  
I said it  
I meant it  
I never will forget it  
Change never happens by itself  
It's my time to burn, my time to shine.  
Time to make it for myself.  
  
Don't be sad, I know you well. it's just the way it has to be.  
I could never stay the same.  
It's always high, always low, and almost never in between.  
There is no one left to blame.  
I can't stay.  
I have to change.  
  
It's my time to shine, do it my way. it's my time baby  
It's my time to burn, start a fire, be the one and only  
I said it  
I meant it  
I never will forget it  
Change never happens by itself  
It's my time to burn, my time to shine.  
Time to make it for myself.  
  
Make a choice, shut up shut up.  
Do it your way, shut up shut up.
