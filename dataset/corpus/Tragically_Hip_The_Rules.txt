Legs scream at bikes and bikes scream at trucks  
And motorists curse their lousy luck  
Crossing guard's not doing his job  
And traffic's not about to stop for the first causality  
Of though it's the rules, it's the rules  
Super farmer's bent on the cover of Time  
The moralist screams he's all mine  
So the bard isn't doing her job the vacuum night  
The darkest rites the small quarantined thoughts  
It's the rules, it's the rules  
Salesman says this vacuum's guaranteed it  
Could suck an ancient virus from the sea  
It could put the dog out of a job  
Could make the traffic stop so little thoughts can safely get across  
It's the rules, it's the rules  
Guaranteed or not it's the rules
