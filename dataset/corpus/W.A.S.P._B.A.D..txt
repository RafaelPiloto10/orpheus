You hear the cries of love, a sad tune  
And feel the salt-lick stingin' loves wound  
Those tears that you cry leave a blood stain  
They fall to the ground like a sweet rain  
'Cause bad girls they do  
B.A.D.  
Bad, make your mom and daddy sad  
B.A.D.  
Bad, It's the bloody fix you do, oh, Look out  
You see what's in you head: fantasy  
And need, but you can't have B.A.D.  
Call a spade a spade only if you want to  
'Cause by any other name it's taboo  
'Cause bad boys they do  
B.A.D.  
Bad, make your mom and daddy sad  
B.A.D.  
Bad, It's the bloody fix you do, the bloody fix you do  
B.A.D.  
Bad, make your mom and daddy sad  
B.A.D.  
Bad, gonna drive you raving mad  
B.A.D.  
Bad, make your mom and daddy sad  
B.A.D.  
Bad It's the bloody fix you do
