This is something new to me when you, ooh, coo to me.  
Ooh what you do to me, bop! Goes my heart.  
Lips as sweet as muscatel make me jingle like a bell,  
Then comes that dizzy spell, oh bop! Goes my heart.  
Jumping with rhythm and romance, lit up like a Christmas tree,  
Going around in circles, I ain't a square that I used to be.  
Something new to shout about, must be love without a doubt.  
Baby, you just knocked me out, bop, bop! Goes my heart.  
(instrumental)  
Got the gonest feeling all on account of you,  
When I get this feeling, don't know what to do, what to do.  
This is something new to me when you ooh, you coo to me.  
Odelibop, ooh what you do to me, bop! Goes my heart.  
Lips as sweet as muscatel make me jingle like a bell,  
Then comes that dizzy spell, oh bop! Goes my heart.  
Jumping with rhythm and romance, lit up like a Christmas tree,  
Going around in circles, I ain't a square that I used to be.  
Something new to shout about, must be love without a doubt.  
Baby, you just knocked me out, bop, bop! Goes my heart.
