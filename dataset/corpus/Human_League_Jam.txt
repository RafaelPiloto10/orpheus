Starting over  
To feel the way I do  
A sudden stranger  
To everything I knew  
All the years together  
Now the days we are apart  
New experiences  
New sensation for the heart  
  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
  
Jam  
Got to get some jam  
Jam  
Got to get some  
  
To be alone was frightening  
But I knew I had to stay  
'Til all the dreamers came  
To take my loneliness away  
  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
  
Jam  
Got to get some jam  
Jam  
You've got to get some  
  
If all our life is dancing  
Then let's just let the music play  
What good is crying?  
I'm going to jam my life away  
  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
Jam  
Where you used to  
  
Jam  
Jam  
Jam  
Jam  
  
Starting over  
To feel the way I do  
A sudden stranger  
To everything I knew  
  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
  
Jam  
Got to get some jam  
  
Jam  
Got to get some  
  
Jam  
Got to get some jam  
Jam  
Got to get some  
  
Jam  
Jam  
Jam  
Jam
