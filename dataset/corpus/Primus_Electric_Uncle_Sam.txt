I am the plan, I am the man who tells you what and when you can.  
I'm the old one that torments you. I am the voice that tells you to:  
Don't get caught with your fingers in my pie.  
Mess with me and boy you're surely gonna' die.  
  
If ever you're in doubt about who or where I am.  
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere.  
I am your Uncle Sam.  
Electric Uncle Sam  
  
You beg me please on bended knees not to sit among these enemies.  
If you feel like you want to dance then step aside and take a chance.  
Don't get caught with your fingers in my pie.  
Mess with me and boy you're surely gonna' die.  
  
If ever you're in doubt about who or where I am. I'm here, I'm there, I'm
everywhere.  
I am your Uncle Sam.  
Electric Uncle Sam
