Imagine Humanity's decline  
Step inside my stain of mind  
Infesting superiority  
Infectious immorality oh yea  
Come worship the place no truths are told  
Praise the land where sins are sold  
No passion no love your faith evades  
Never see yourself again that way  
  
Death becomes your bride  
Lifelessness invades your eyes  
in fire baptized  
All pain sifts through my soul  
You'll never feel greater misery  
Master of my enemy  
Let the purest stain of mind  
  
Wash the virtue from your eyes  
As one the collective unifies  
Emanate a faithless shine  
Forever creation has conceived  
  
Birth of destruction spreads its wings oh yea  
Chaotic rebirth a new domain  
  
Re-live the sight the sound the pain  
Erotic the taste of agony  
  
Adorn the scars of inhumanity  
This is what you see  
Deep inside of me  
Agony is life  
Lechery is life  
Godlessness is life  
Purgatory magnified  
In fire baptized  
All pain sifts through my soul  
You'll never feel greater misery  
Master of my enemy  
Let the purest satin of mind  
  
Wash the virtue from your eyes  
Enticing malevolence allures  
Bastardize the clean and pure  
Salvation forever crucified  
I choose the other side oh yea  
Entire, complete serenity  
Injected intravenously  
Transgression euphoric bliss divine  
Initiate a timeless stain of mind  
  
Blood will sterilize  
In fire I baptized  
All pain sifts through my soul  
  
You'll never feel greater misery  
Master of my enemy  
  
Let the purest stain of mind  
Wash the virtue from your eyes
