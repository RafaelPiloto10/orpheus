You've got it made, you've got real love  
Something you don't find every day  
Someone to trust, someone to lean on  
Something I would hold onto if I were you  
  
You've got it made, you've got no one  
You don't have those strings to tie you down  
You come and go free as the wind blows  
I wouldn't settle down too soon if I were you  
  
If I were you, I'd be satisfied  
Oh, I'm sure the grass is greener on the other side  
If I were you, I'd stay by her side (I'd be running wild)  
I would never leave her  
That's what I would do  
If I were you  
  
If I were you, I'd be satisfied  
Oh, I'm sure the grass is greener on the other side  
If I were you, would I rather be (would I rather be)  
Someone just like me?  
I wouldn't change a single thing  
If I were you
