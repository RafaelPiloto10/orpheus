You, the hero  
So many times  
You've loved  
And didn't linger  
Now my finger  
Points at you  
Another loser  
You, an island  
On your own  
  
Complete  
In every detail  
Monumental  
A precious jewel  
Or just a fool  
Innovator  
It's in your mind  
And blood  
I watch it simmer  
I see you're courting  
More despair  
No hope?  
  
Not a glimmer  
Now you're nothing  
But second hand  
In glove  
With second rate now  
Now you're flirting  
With heroin  
Or is it cocaine?  
Casanova  
  
Is that your name  
Or do you live there?  
I know my place  
Is here with you  
Tonight  
But not together
