If they made me a king, I'd be but a slave to you  
If I had everything, I'd still be a slave to you  
If I ruled the night, stars and moon so bright  
Still, I'd turn for light to you  
  
If the world to me bowed yet humbly, I'd flee to you  
If my friends were a crowd, I'd turn in my need to you  
If I ruled the earth, what would life be worth  
If I hadn't the right to you  
  
If I ruled the night, stars and moon so bright  
Still, I'd turn for light to you  
  
If the world to me bowed yet humbly, I'd flee to you  
If my friends were a crowd, I'd turn in my need to you  
If I ruled the earth, what would life be worth  
If I hadn't the right to you
