I was living in a fantasy,  
Waiting for somebody to rescue me,  
But I've found a way to light the dark.  
It was always here inside my heart.  
No more fairy tale pretending  
I'll make my own happy ending.  
  
If I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.  
I wouldn't reach up to the sky,  
Every night, in my dreams.  
There's a voice inside of me  
Saying I can do anything,  
'Cause if I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.  
  
There's a star that's shining down on me.  
Reflecting everything that I can be.  
Every journey starts inside the heart,  
And there's no mountain that's too far.  
If I set my mind to it,  
Whatever it is, I can do it.  
  
If I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.  
I wouldn't reach up to the sky,  
Every night, in my dreams.  
There's a voice inside of me  
Saying I can do anything,  
'Cause if I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings...  
  
To take me farther  
Than I ever thought I'd go.  
Higher than the heavens,  
'Cause deep inside I know...  
  
If I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.  
I wouldn't reach up to the sky,  
Every night, in my dreams.  
There's a voice inside of me  
Saying I can do anything,  
'Cause if I wasn't meant to fly,  
I wouldn't have these wings.
