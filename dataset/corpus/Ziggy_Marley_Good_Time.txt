Get those problems out your head, put  
Your mama to bed  
But don't stray too far from reality or  
You will live  
In a dream world  
Dreaming of things that there ain't no possibility, who  
Wee, believe me  
Let's have a nice grooving time, but don't go too far  
From the truth in your mind  
Cause you'll drink and drive, and then  
You'll fly too  
High and so you'll pay the price for justa  
Feeling nice  
  
Though the world is cruel and blind  
Let's have a good time  
Though the world is cruel and blind  
Let's have a good time  
  
So many things to foresee, we were not  
Born to live this way  
We were born having fun in the jungle of grace  
With plenty of food to eat, and plenty drink to drink  
So you know what I mean when I say  
Liberate yourself from the state that you're in  
It stink, it stink, it stink  
Mi sey to dance if y ou have to but don't  
Take no chance  
To be deceived, yea

And your soul  
Don't let material things they must not  
Keep you down

Carried away
