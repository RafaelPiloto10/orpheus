The Altar  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz  
The service is nearing an end  
The choir is singing "Just As I Am"  
And now as the old song is played  
People at the altar  
Are kneeling down to pray  
Some are finding mercy  
Forgiveness for their sin  
Some are fighting battles  
And they're struggling to win  
The time has come  
To give them to the Lord  
That's what the altar is for  
Chorus:  
That's what this altar is for  
You don't have to carry  
Those burdens anymore  
There's a light in the darkness  
There's a love that's true  
And Jesus is waiting  
He is waiting here for you  
Go quickly now  
Before they close the door  
That's what the altar is for  
A father is praying with his son  
A mother kneels beside them  
Thanking God they've come  
An old man  
Is standing there in tears  
Giving up a part of him  
That he's held back for years  
Hearts are being broken  
Lives are being changed  
And those who call upon Him  
Will never be the same  
The time has come  
To give in to the Lord  
That's what this altar is for  
Chorus (repeat)  
Go quickly now  
Before they close the door  
And you can give your burdens  
To the Lord  
That's what this altar is for
