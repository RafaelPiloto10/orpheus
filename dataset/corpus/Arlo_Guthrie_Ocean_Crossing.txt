Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Looked into your eyes this morning  
You were far away  
You must have known I was looking for you  
You knew you couldn't stay  
All these winds blowin' on me  
Blowing in the nighttime lonely  
Blew on over the ocean to you  
Blew my words away  
Put on your heavenly shoes babe  
Walk around the clouds  
You know that's where I'm bound to be now  
I'm coming with the crowds  
All these faces looking at me  
Looking through me I don't mind  
I just seen your face a-worrying  
I loved you when you cried  
Take my hand across the water  
You won't leave no tracks behind  
Step all over the moon lit ocean  
It's only in your mind  
All these thoughts just rip me  
Who can heal a heart that's broken  
Like the winds that blow unspoken  
Blow my love away
