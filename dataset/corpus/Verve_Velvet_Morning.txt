Yes  
It's been long  
And yes  
I still feel strong  
Into the half light  
Another velvet morning for me, yeah  
  
Time  
Stands still  
As you take  
Your last pill  
Into the half light  
Another velvet morning for me  
  
And now I'm trying to tell you  
About my life  
And my tongue is twisted  
And more dead than alive  
And my feelings  
They've always been betrayed  
And I was born a little damaged man  
And look what they made  
  
I said, don't you find  
That it's lonely  
The corridor  
You walk there alone  
And life is a game  
You've tried  
And life is a game  
You're tired  
  
Yes  
I'm coming down  
Your beauty is  
A color surround  
Into the half light  
Another velvet morning for me  
  
And now I'm trying to tell you  
About my life  
And my tongue is twisted  
And more dead than alive  
And my feelings  
My feelings, they've been betrayed  
And I was born a little damaged man  
And look what they made  
  
He said, don't you find  
That it's lonely  
The corridor  
You walk there alone  
And life is a game  
You've tried  
And life is a game  
You're tired  
And life is a game  
You've tried
