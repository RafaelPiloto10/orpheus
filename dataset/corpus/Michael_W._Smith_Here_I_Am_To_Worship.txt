Light of the World  
You stepped down into darkness  
Open my eyes  
Let me see  
Beauty that made  
This heart adore You  
Hope of a life  
Spent with You  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that You're my God  
You're altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  
  
King of all days  
Oh, so highly exalted  
Glorious in Heaven above  
Humbly You came  
To the earth You created  
All for love's sake became poor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross  
  
[Chorus X2]
