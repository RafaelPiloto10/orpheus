Met'em in a hotel  
Met'em in a hotel beneath ground  
Tell me that he's missing  
Tell me this is one for Lollipop Gestapo  
You were wild where are you now  
You were wild where are you now  
  
Give me more  
Give me more  
Give me more  
  
I have to learn to let you crash down  
I have to learn to let you crash  
  
Met'em in a hotel  
Met'em in a hotel  
You say he's the biggest thing  
There'll be this year  
I guess that what I'm seeking  
I guess that what I'm seeking isn't here  
  
Met him in a hotel  
Met him in a guess world  
Guessed anyone but you  
  
You were wild where are you now  
You were wild where are you now  
  
Give me more  
Give me more  
Give me more  
  
I have to learn to let you crash down  
I have to learn to let you crash  
  
Where are the velvets  
When you're coming down  
  
You were wild where are you now  
You were wild where are you now  
  
King Solomon's Mines  
Exit 75  
I'm still alive  
I'm still alive  
I'm still alive
