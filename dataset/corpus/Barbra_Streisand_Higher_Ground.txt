Walk me over this horizon  
Let the sun's light warm my face  
Once again the times are changin'  
Once again I lost my way  
Well the words of ancient poets  
Fall like dust upon my shoes  
Greed has robbed me of my vision  
Turned my heart from higher truths  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe and honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
I have walked too long in darkness  
I have walked too long alone  
Blindly clutching fists of diamonds  
That I found were only stones  
I would trade the world of ages  
For a warmer hand to hold  
The path of light is narrow  
But it leads to streets of gold  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe and honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
In this world we move through shadows  
Never sure of what we see  
While the truth that lies between us  
Come and share the truth with me  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe and honor bound  
Take my heart to higher higher ground  
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
