[Nick:]  
Stop it, stop it  
Stop it, stop it  
Go, stop and go  
I just hit static  
I used to read you  
Loud and clear  
Not like this  
It's so erratic  
  
[Brian:]  
And I'm not rational  
When I see you around  
Your inconsistency  
And you know it's dragging me down  
You're so conflicted baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're always walking away  
One step and everything's over  
And you're running back to me  
You say I let you down  
Baby take me in or just take me out  
I'm already dead  
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry  
  
[Nick:]  
Stop it  
I've made mistakes  
I've been an addict  
A blind fanatic  
Don't you know  
You're not immune to the panic  
With somebody  
  
[Brian:]  
When the snow hits your skin  
The cold don't last forever  
But you're livin' again  
If you don't let seasons change  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[AJ:]  
How many times do I have to say it  
Before you believe me  
  
[Nick:]  
Stop it, stop it  
Stop and go  
  
[All:] Panic!  
  
[Repeat Chorus]
