We always have a choice,  
At least I we think we do,  
We can always use our voice,  
I thought this to be true.  
We can live in fear.  
Extend ourselves to love,  
We can fall below, or lift ourselves above.  
  
Chorus:  
Fear can stop you loving,  
Love can stop your fear.  
Fear can stop you loving,  
But it's not always that clear.  
  
I always tried so hard  
To share myselve around  
Now I'm closing up again  
Drilling through the ground  
  
Chorus:  
Fear can stop you loving,  
Love can stop your fear.  
Fear can stop you loving,  
But it's not always that clear.  
  
I love to give myself away  
But I find it hard to trust  
I got no map to find my way  
And what's these clouds of dust?  
  
Chorus:  
Fear can stop you loving,  
Love can stop your fear.  
Fear can stop you loving,  
But it's not always that clear.  
  
But it's not always that clear...  
But it's not always that clear...  
But it's not always that clear...  
But it's not always that clear...
