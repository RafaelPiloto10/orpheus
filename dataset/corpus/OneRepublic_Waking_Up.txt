I found variety  
On Nolan's Avenue  
Down where the air is thick  
As L.A. skies are blue  
The water tried to break it down  
But it held through  
It gave a little for the sake of staying true  
  
We cut ties  
We tell lies  
We hate change  
And we wanna claim where we feel  
We take toes  
We rake yours  
Yeah we dig holes  
And we're diggin' right in your fears  
  
We're waking up  
We're waking up  
And right on time  
And right on time  
We'll take these roads  
We'll break them up  
And right on time  
And right on time!  
  
We got cars  
We write laws  
We won't pause  
Don't you know we're wizards working in Oz  
We don't lose  
We might bruise  
Yeah but we'll rain fire on ya till you're playing  
All of your cards  
  
We're waking up  
We're waking up  
And right on time  
And right on time  
We'll take these roads  
We'll break them up  
And right on time  
And right on time!  
On time!  
Right on time!  
Waking up!  
Waking up!  
Yeah  
  
Ooh!  
Oh!  
Ooh!
