It's a long way to heaven  
It's a short way to hell  
Painkillers won't help  
When the weight's not yourself  
  
They're poisoning the air  
For personal wealth  
It's a long way to heaven  
It's a short way to hell  
  
I don't know what I'm breathing for  
'Cause the air around here ain't so good anymore  
The weatherman says "fair"  
But he looks like a lie  
  
Nothing's free in this country  
And there's no place to hide, no more  
Industrial wind  
It blows from the west  
  
It'll burn out your eyes  
And suck out your breath  
It's waiting in the wings  
For damage down the line  
  
Save your tears for the soaps  
Leave your money behind  
I don't know what I'm breathing for  
'Cause the air around here ain't so good anymore  
  
The weatherman says "fair"  
But he looks like a lie  
Nothing's free in this country  
And there's no place to hide no more  
  
No place to hide, no more
