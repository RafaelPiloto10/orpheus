I won't to tell of my love  
To the red, red rose  
Or the running brook  
Where the sweet magnolia grows  
  
I won't tell of my love  
To every little star  
Or the whippoorwill  
On the hill above  
  
I'll tell the man in the street  
And everyone I meet  
That you and I are sweethearts  
I'll shout it out  
From the roof  
  
I'll give the papers proof  
That we two are complete hearts  
I want the world to know  
I'd use the radio  
  
And when I've said all I say  
You may be old and gray  
But you can't get away from me.
