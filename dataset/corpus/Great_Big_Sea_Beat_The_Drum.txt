I still hear the snares in the square  
Colors ablaze in the evening  
The air was still down the stormy hills  
It's good to be young and daring  
  
She was the pride of the summer that year  
She was my sweetheart, my lady  
We walked to Black Rock and stopped by the Loch  
It's good to be young and daring  
  
[Chorus]  
Beat the drum, Beat the drum  
Like a heartbeat, Lonely and Strong  
Beat the Drum  
  
Across the bay I can still hear the strains  
The two step loud and blaring  
We walked hand and hand to the beat of the band  
It's good to be young and daring  
  
I still hear the snares in the square  
Colors ablaze in the evening  
She was the pride of the summer that year  
It's good to be young and daring
