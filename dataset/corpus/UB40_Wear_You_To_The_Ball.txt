I'm gonna wear you to the ball tonight  
Put on your best dress tonight  
  
Did you hear what the man said baby  
Well be your best 'cause this  
gonna be a musical test  
So come to school, and I take up the musical rule  
Give me soul brothers and give me soul sisters

So be wise and be changing, put on your best  
Because I got your musical key
