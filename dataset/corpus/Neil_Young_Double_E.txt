Back in the country, living on the Double E  
In the sunshine of her life  
There's already a young fellow but Mom and Daddy won't let her leave  
Mom and Poppa won't let her go  
  
But when they go out dancin'  
She breaks out on her own  
She's hot enough to burn the house down  
But Mom and Poppa don't know  
  
When Edith and Earl renamed the Double E  
They nearly made history  
The locals rose up, some of them were mad as hell  
Cause it used to be the Double L  
  
Change comes slow in the country  
When you're new there's a lot of distrust  
Years fly by uneventful  
Memories turn to dust  
  
Meanwhile Granny has got her bright colors on  
And the sun's shinin' in her eyes  
Cruisin' by the bars and honky-tonks where she met Grandpa  
And caught that young man's eye  
  
Dusty white El Dorado  
Cruisin' through the trees  
Slippin' through the shadows  
Of what used to be  
  
Back in the days, living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
Grandma's okay, not the same since Grandpa's gone  
She's living in the summer of love  
  
Back in the days, living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love  
  
Back in the days, living in the summer of love  
Living in the summer of love
