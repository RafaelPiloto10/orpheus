This is a thing I've never known before  
It's called easy living  
This is a place I've never seen before  
And I've been forgiven  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
Easy living, and I've been forgiven  
Since you're taking your place in my heart  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road  
I had tried to find you  
Day after day on the winding road  
I have walked behind you  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Waiting, watching, wishing my whole life away  
Feeling, fainting, ready for my happy day  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road  
I had tried to find you  
Day after day on the winding road  
I have walked behind you  
  
[REFRAIN:]
