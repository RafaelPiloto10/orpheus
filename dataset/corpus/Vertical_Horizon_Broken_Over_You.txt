Closer than I've ever been  
With you.  
Trying to get settled in  
After all we went through and  
Just breathing for a moment  
To see what we had  
Before it got stolen  
Can we get back this love?  
Just like we had this love  
Just like we had enough  
Just like we had  
  
Part of me knows that  
Part of you is broken  
'Cause I am broken too  
I'm broken over you and  
Most of me is certain  
That most of you is hurting  
'Cause I am hurting too  
I'm broken over you  
  
Try to make sense of it  
Someday  
The truth is so hesitant  
But there's more than just blame now  
Moving in silence  
Through every regret  
Still vivid inside us  
How can we get this love?  
Just like we had this love  
Just like we had enough  
Just like we had  
  
Part of me knows that  
Part of you is broken  
'Cause I am broken too  
I'm broken over you and  
Most of me is certain  
That most of you is hurting  
'Cause I am hurting too  
I'm broken over you  
  
Broken over you  
How do I get from  
Broken to over you?  
Broken over you  
How do I get from  
Broken to over you?  
Over you  
  
Oh, part of me knows that  
Part of you is broken  
'Cause I am broken too  
I'm broken over you  
Most of me is certain  
That most of you is hurting  
'Cause I am hurting too  
I'm broken over you
