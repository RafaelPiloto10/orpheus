Walking down the street  
You're the center of my universe  
You got the world in your pocket,  
My manhood in your purse  
You ain't a bad girl, honey,  
No matter what the neighbors say,  
It's just that you were those skin-tight dresses  
With your G-string tuned to "A"  
  
Sweet, sweet, child of the street  
  
Heaven sent, you're an angel dressed in black,  
Cool, stiletto strut, you're a drop jaw cardiac  
You're the genuine, feline, prettiest girl I've ever seen,  
With your thief of hearts smile  
You're a certified pleasure machine  
  
Sweet, sweet, child of the street  
  
Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur,  
You get what you want  
With your pussy cat purr  
  
But, the kittens got claws,  
She'll tear your heart out  
The kittens got claws,  
She'll scratch your back  
The kittens got claws  
She'll tease an' please you  
The kittens got claws,  
She's a heart attack  
  
You treat me good,  
Sometimes you treat me bad,  
But, keep it up, honey,  
You're the best time I've ever had  
No matter what you put me through I must confess,  
Oh, you got more style than a brand new XJS  
  
Sweet, sweet, child of the street  
  
Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur,  
You get what you want  
With your pussy cat purr  
  
But, the kittens got claws,  
She'll tear your heart out  
The kittens got claws,  
She'll scratch your back  
The kittens got claws,  
She'll tease an' please you  
The kittens got claws,  
She's a heart attack  
  
Walking down the street  
You're the center of my universe  
You got the world in your pocket,  
My manhood in your purse  
I know you ain't a bad girl, honey,  
No matter what the neighbors say,  
It's just that you were those skin-tight dresses  
With your G-string tuned to "A"  
  
Sweet, sweet, child of the street  
  
Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur,  
You get what you want  
With your pussy cat purr  
  
But, the kittens got claws,  
She'll tear your heart out  
The kittens got claws,  
She'll scratch your back  
The kittens got claws,  
She'll tease an' please you  
The kittens got claws,  
She'll blow your stack  
  
The kittens got claws,  
She'll tear your heart out  
The kittens got claws,  
She'll scratch your back  
The kittens got claws,  
She'll tease an' please you  
The kittens got claws,  
She's a heart attack  
  
You scratch my back, baby,  
An' I'll scratch yours
