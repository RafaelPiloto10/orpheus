No more water in the well, no more.  
No more water in the well, no more.  
  
You take my love for granted like water,  
Water you spill and you wast.  
Though love is thicker than water it spills quicker than water  
And you'll look up one of these days,  
And there'll be no more water in the well.  
  
How long do you think my love can last through sorrow pain and mistrust?  
Today my love is strong,  
But keep doing me wrong and tomorrow it may turn to dust.
