You ain't gotta lie ta kick it  
  
I know ya like to see me doin' bad  
But I'm doin' good, fuck the police that's rollin' through my neighborhood  
Fuckin' peaker wood see me in the five speed  
I don't care if his motherfuckin' eyes bleed (yeah yeah!)  
This is my weed, this is my world  
Don't get mad when you see them hundred smokes squirrel  
Candied out while you spit yo' last on the pearl  
The Don Daada, I'm hotta than holly watta  
Wish I was your baby father, cause I got a fuckin' head on my shoulder  
And lead in my holster, face on the poster  
The kinda nigga that you wanna get close ta'  
But you can't so you start the lyin'  
Just like that nigga that think he dyin'  
Get ta cryin', snitchin' and testifyin'  
To all my people if I'm talkin 'bout your baby mama  
When she meet Ice Cube tell her save the drama

I'm a be as real as I can with this  
Not just the fake analyst on cannabis, who only say that the world is  
Scandalous, without findin' out a way to handle this  
Dismantle this, either with the rhyme or the fist  
How the fuck we get in the belly of this bitch?  
I be rich if it wasn't for the snitch  
Lyin' to the enemies, wild conspiracies  
I'm a say this 'till the day that I die  
Seven thirty fives bring on bitches lies  
While you bullshitin', I'm hard hittin' like  
2pac, I keep spittin' 'till my heart stop  
Young niggas tryin' to tell me that I'm played  
Once they say you played, nigga you must be payed (HA HA! huh ha)  
Pushin' weight since the tenth grade do my thing  
Got more plaques than Jordan got rings, nigga sayin'

I hate to see your ass comin' (yep), with your mouth runnin'  
Talkin' 'bout somethin' (what?), that ain't meanin' nothin'  
'Bout your second cousin (hm), who be always buzzin'  
Where she was or wasn't, who she now fuckin'  
Stories by the dozen Punch you got the sequel (what?)  
To let you tell it Randy Moss is your people  
It's evident, your ass lie like the president  
But stretch marks on your mouth is the evidence (ha ha)  
How the fuck can your friends be the Benjamin's? (punk)  
And your little ass car's full of fender Benz  
There you go on the stand with your hand up (lyin')  
Testifyin' about a man that's in handcuffs  
We should do you like the Mack said  
And if he lie like a crackhead pop 'em like a black head  
Let him ooze, let him loose  
Let him lie by his motherfuckin' ass on the news (yeah yeah)  
  
Yo Cube, check out this ring, 69 karots
