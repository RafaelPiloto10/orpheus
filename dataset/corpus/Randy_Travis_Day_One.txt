Cold house  
Just before dawn  
Oh my God  
This feels so wrong  
Clouds roll in  
And cover the sun  
A new day begins  
Day one  
  
Day one  
And it already feels like forever  
It's over and done  
So what can I do?  
Day one  
Of putting my life back together  
Day one  
Of learning to live without you  
  
Gold ring  
There on the bed  
Oh my God  
She meant what she said  
No place to hide  
No where to run  
Just dying inside  
Day one  
  
Day one  
And it already feels like forever  
It's over and done  
So what can I do?  
Day one  
Of putting my life back together  
Day one  
Of learning to live without you  
  
Day one  
Of learning to live without you
