Gone stray we find ourselves  
Right on the edge of falling apart  
Don't you see it's in our ways  
When something's done wrong, we just go along  
It lights a fire inside of me  
Just show me when this living stops  
  
I am father and son  
I am all that I fear  
I can choose to give up  
We could tear the world apart  
Tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
  
Cut the cord start to breathe  
We're living life at frantic speed  
Don the suit and ride the steed  
With these shackles on you won't come to harm  
I could be the worst of these  
A sinking ship on the open sea  
  
I am father and son  
I am all that I fear  
I can choose to give up  
We could tear the world apart  
Tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
  
All on my own I'm trying  
To change how you see and what you believe  
To fight fire with fire and live eye for eye  
We'll all end up blind and burning  
Burning, burning  
  
Tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart
