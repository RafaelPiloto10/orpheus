When the stiff wind blows  
The flag don't wiggle  
In the party of special things to do  
I met the ace of love  
She took me to her plantation  
For the love without separation  
In the party of special things to do  
It could happen to me  
It could happen to you  
I met the ace of love  
She said I want you to go  
To the party of special things to do  
And when you're through  
I'll be right here waiting for you  
Here take these sparks  
So my distant cousins can get along with you  
Watch out for the mirror man  
And Elixir Sue  
When I got to the party of special things to do  
It wasn't hard to find Elixir Sue  
I met all the cards  
The wild cards  
The one-eye Jill  
The red queen  
She turned her head  
You know what I mean  
She turned it back and said  
"I got a brand new game I want to lay on you"  
I met them all  
At the party of special things to do  
When I was done  
I was far from through  
I returned to the ace of love  
Now wouldn't you?  
I met them all  
The camel wore a nightie  
The camel wore a nightie  
At the party of special things to do  
Elixir Sue  
It wasn't hard to find liquor at the do  
I met all the cards  
The wild cards  
You know what I mean  
Then she turned it back and said  
"I got a brand new game I think I want to lay on you"  
I met elixir Sue  
At the party of special things to do  
It's so special
