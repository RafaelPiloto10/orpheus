I played a wedding for the money,  
And I wished that I could tell the bride and groom  
Just what I thought of marriage  
And what's in store after their honeymoon.  
  
And I was grumblin' to the dancers  
'Bout how men and women ought to live apart  
And how a promise never made can not be broken  
And can never break your heart  
  
When suddenly from out of nowhere,  
A little girl came dancing 'cross the floor,  
And all her crinolines were billowing  
Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore.  
Oh what a joy fell on the honored guests  
As each of them was drawn inside her dream,  
And they laughed and clapped and stomped their feet  
And hollered at her "dance little jean"  
  
Dance, little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people you love, stood up and said "I do"  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had  
Was answered today  
Your mama's marrying your dad  
  
Well, my cynical heart just melted  
'Cause I knew what this get together meant  
How it ended year of tears and sad confusion  
That the little girl had spent.  
Well they told the band to pack it up  
About the time the couple cut the cake,  
But we played as long as they stayed  
For love and laughs and little jeanie's sake.  
  
Dance, little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people you love, stood up and said "I do"  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had  
Was answered today  
Your mama's marrying your dad
