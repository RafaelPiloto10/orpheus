Steel drums still ringing in my head  
Well I feel pain, so I'm not dead  
From the looks of things, it looks like  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Could I get your name again?  
Some situation that we're in  
Woke up by each other's side  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Last thing I remember  
I told the bartender  
Mix rum and whatever you have  
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you  
So I know things can't be all that bad  
But it's still a little hazy  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Are these your shoes that I have on?  
Is this your bed, is this your home?  
All I know is it's not mine  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Last thing I remember  
I told the bartender  
Mix rum and whatever you have  
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you  
So I know things can't be all that bad  
But it's still a little hazy  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
I think I feel a fresh tattoo  
What is it of, I wish I knew  
It couldn't get more out of sight  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Last thing I remember  
I told the bartender  
Mix rum and whatever you have  
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you  
So I know things can't be all that bad  
But it's still a little hazy, sounds a little shady  
I think she might have paid me, but  
It got a little crazy last night  
It got a little crazy last night  
Got a little crazy
