I'd spend my days alone  
I used to stay at home  
Lost in seclusion there  
Like I was in a cell  
A captured heart as well  
Surrounded by despair  
Darkness filled my soul  
Losing all control  
  
Down on the streets below  
Bright city lights would glow  
The energy would rise  
And through the heat I'd gaze  
Still counting empty days  
With fire in my eyes  
Living through this hell  
Can I break this spell  
  
Fever. You set my soul on fire  
Fever. You fill me with desire  
Fever. You always get it right  
Fever. All day and all night  
  
Then one night as I walked  
I heard your body talk  
I saw a shooting star  
In some magnetic trance  
Our beating hearts would dance  
And crash down from afar  
Oh how strange fate is  
Never dreamed of this  
  
Fever. You set my soul on fire  
Fever. You fill me with desire  
Fever. You always get it right  
Fever. All day and all night  
  
So destiny has bought us  
Oh so close together  
We were like angels in the night  
Living the dream  
At last I'll be with you forever  
And all at once it feels so right  
  
Fever. You set my soul on fire  
Fever. You fill me with desire  
Fever. You always get it right  
Fever. All day and all night
