You declared you would be three inches taller  
You only became what we made you.  
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling  
You only earned what we gave you.  
You fell and cried as our people were starving,  
Now you know that we blame you.  
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving,  
Now you know that we framed you.  
  
[G.F.:]  
I'm the guy in the sky  
Flying high Flashing eyes  
No surprise I told lies  
I'm the punk in the gutter  
I'm the new president  
But I grew and I bent  
Don't you know? don't it show?  
I'm the punk with the stutter.  
My my my my my mmmm my my my.  
  
GGGGG-g-g-g-g generation.  
  
[PUNK:]  
We tried to speak between lines of oration  
You could only repeat what we told you.  
Your axe belongs to a dying nation,  
They don't know that we own you.  
You're watching movies trying to find the feelers,  
You only see what we show you.  
We're the slaves of the phony leaders  
Breathe the air we have blown you.  
  
[G.F.:]  
I'm the guy [etc.]  
  
I have to be careful not to preach  
I can't pretend that I can teach,  
And yet I've lived your future out  
By pounding stages like a clown.  
And on the dance floor broken glass,  
The bloody faces slowly pass,  
The numbered seats in empty rows,  
It all belongs to me you know.  
  
[PUNK:]  
You declared [etc.]
