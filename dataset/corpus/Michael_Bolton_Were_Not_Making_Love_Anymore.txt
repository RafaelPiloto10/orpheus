Here we are, just goin' through the motions one more time  
You look into my eyes, but you don't see me  
Here I am, feelin' like a stranger in your arms  
I touch you, I hold you, but lately I don't know you  
  
Something is wrong but we go on from day to day  
And we just pretend it all away  
We act like nothing's changed  
But in our hearts we know, it's not the same  
  
Chorus  
'Cause we're not makin' love anymore  
Baby, we're not makin' love like before  
We may hold each other tight  
Say that everything's alright  
But we're not makin' love  
  
Remember when, you couldn't wait to run into my arms  
When the love inside my heart was all you needed  
Remember when, you made me wish the night would never end  
The fire, the thunder, we lived to love each other  
  
If ever two hearts were one, then it was your and mine  
But that was another place in time  
Now all we have to show  
Are memories of a dream we used to know  
  
Chorus  
  
When did we lose our way, we had it all  
Don't know how it all just slipped away  
But oh, can we get it back again  
Is it too late, can we try, just one time, 'Cause darling....  
  
Chorus  
  
We're not makin' love anymore  
Baby we're not makin' love like before  
Can we find a way to try  
Find the magic one more time  
'Cause we're not makin' love
