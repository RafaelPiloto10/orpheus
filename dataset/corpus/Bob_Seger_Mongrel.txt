Here come the mountain, Here come the hill  
Here come the valley and the Shoreline still  
I know 'em well, know well  
Mongrel, on the hard sell  
With a ?, hot assed, inkwell  
Lord, But I, I can't leave with the blues  
Through endless days, and endless nights  
Spare my creator, scream for my rights  
? in the wishing well  
Mongrel on the Hard sell, with a ?,  
Hot assed, Inkwell  
But I won't leave you with the blues no  
Come down to ? (Wah-doo-day)  
I'll buy you out  
Gonna make you shake it Lord gonna make you shout  
Gonna burn you gonna make you swell  
Mongrel on a hard sell  
With a ? hot assed inkwell Lord  
But I can't leave you with the blues no  
No no
