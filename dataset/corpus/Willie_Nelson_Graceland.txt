The Mississippi Delta was shining like a National guitar  
I am following the river down the highway through the cradle of the Civil War  
I'm going to Graceland Graceland in Memphis Tennessee I'm going to Graceland  
Poorboys and pilgrims with families and we are going to Graceland  
My traveling companion is nine years old the child of my first marriage  
But I've reason to believe we both will be received in Graceland  
  
She comes back to tell me she's gone  
As if I didn't know that as if I didn't know my own bed  
As if I'd never noticed she way she brushed her hair from her forehead  
And she said losing love is like a window in your heart  
Everybody sees you're blown apart everybody feels the wind blow  
I'm going to Graceland Graceland in Memphis Tennessee I'm going to Graceland  
Poorboys and pilgrims with families and we are going to Graceland  
My traveling companions are ghosts and empty sockets ghosts and empties  
But I've reason to believe we both will be received in Graceland  
  
There is a girl in Austin Texas and she calls herself the human trampoline  
Sometimes when I'm falling flying tumbling in turmoil I say this is what she
means  
She means we're bouncing into Graceland  
And I see losing love ss like a window in your heart  
Everybody sees you're blown apart everybody feels the wind blow  
And I'm going to Graceland in Memphis Tennessee I'm going to Graceland  
For reasons I cannot explain some part of me wants to see Graceland  
And I may be obliged to defend every love every ending  
Or maybe there's no obligations now  
Maybe I've a reason to believe we all will be received in Graceland  
Oh oh Graceland I'm going to Graceland
