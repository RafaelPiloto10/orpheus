When a girl meets boy,  
Life can be a joy,  
But the note they end on,  
Will depend on little pleasures they will share,  
So let us compare.  
  
I like New York in June, how about you?  
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?  
I love a fireside when a storm is due.  
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,  
How about you?  
  
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,  
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.  
Holding hands at the movie show,  
When all the lights are low  
May not be new, but I like it,  
How about you?  
  
I like Jack Benny's jokes,  
To a degree.  
I love the common folks,  
That includes me.  
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue,  
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,  
How about you?  
  
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine,  
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.  
I can see we're in harmony,  
Looks like we both agree  
On what to do,  
And I like it, how about you?  
  
I'm so delighted I've ignited the spark within you.  
Let me continue to make it burn.  
With you I will be like a Trilby, so let's not dally.  
Come on Svengali, I've lots to learn.  
When you're arisin', start exercisin' daily.  
For example, just a sample?  
Bend and touch the floor fifty times or more.  
Ha! A fine start to be a Bernhardt!  
  
A dictionary's necessary but not for talking,  
It's used for walking the Ziegfeld way.  
Is this okay?  
That's the trick, you're catching on quickly.  
Should I take a bow?  
A-ho! Let me show you how!  
Just like partners on the stage.  
If you can use a partner,  
I'm the right age.
