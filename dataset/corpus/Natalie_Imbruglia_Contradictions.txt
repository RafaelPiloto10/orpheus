Seventeen years in a dead end job,  
Telling his dreams to a deaf-eared god.  
Hanging on tight by a single thread,  
Praying for a change.  
Everything you could've sacrificed,  
Your flesh and blood had it's own sweet price.  
Baby's all grown up and moved away,  
Where's that leave you now?  
It was your own decision,  
You made my life a mission.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
Working so hard to be understood,  
Doing so much for the common good.  
Sorry if I didn't see the truth  
The sadness in your eyes.  
I wanted to stand on my own two feet,  
Looking at life as a one-way street.  
Thinking that I had all worked out,  
Where's that leave me now?  
We lost communication,  
Too many expectations.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
Everything I have inside,  
I kept it wrapped up tight.  
All I know is,  
All I want to know is,  
Somebody tell me.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
In a world of contradiction.  
Seventeen years in a dead end job,  
Telling his dreams to a deaf-eared god.  
Hanging on tight by a single thread,  
Where's that leave you now?
