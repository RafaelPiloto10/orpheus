I took a drive along the west bank of the shore  
I thought of what you said then I thought some more  
You say your life is all but chiseled out in stone  
And all you want is just a taste of the unknown  
  
Think it was yesterday I called you on the phone  
You say you need a change, I recognize the tone  
Buy me a ticket please, to anywhere I'll go  
I'm not saying what is right or what is wrong  
I'm just thinking you've been hanging here too long  
  
[Chorus:]  
So, why don't we, just up and leave it all behind  
Maybe a change would ease your mind  
For a time, leave it all behind  
  
What I really want to do is see you smile  
Hear you talk and let me listen for a while  
There's too much going on to keep it all inside  
You try to whisper, but you start to scream and shout  
What you need is just a place to let it out  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You try to whisper but you start to scream and shout  
What you need is just a place to let it out  
  
[Chorus:]
