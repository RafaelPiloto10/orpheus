If everyday was Christmas  
If we could make believe  
If everyone would give a little more  
There'd be harmony  
  
The city is covered in snow tonight  
The children are fast asleep  
I'm waiting for him  
But he's no where in sight  
And I wonder if he can hear me.  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I wish with all my might  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
Bring my baby home tonight  
  
Why does it feel like it's colder than winter  
Even by the fire side  
My baby said that he'd be home for Christmas  
And now it's almost midnight  
  
Christmas lights up and down the street  
Are such a sight to see  
But all the presents by the tree  
They don't mean a thing 'til he's with me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I wish with all my might  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
If you hear me wont you hurry bring my baby tonight  
  
I know your sleigh is full inside  
But wont you stop and give my baby a ride  
I'll be waiting by candle light this Christmas  
Ohhh  
  
Christmas lights up and down the street  
Are such a sight to see  
But all the presents by the tree  
They don't mean a thing, Santa, please here me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I wish with all my might  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
If you hear me wont you hurry bring my baby tonight  
  
Christmas lights up and down the street  
Presents by the tree  
I hear a knock  
Oh, can it be  
My wish is staring back at me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I guess you heard me tonight, yeah  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I'm underneath the mistletoe with my baby tonight  
  
(Sleigh ride, sleigh ride (repeat))  
It's Christmas Time  
Hey Santa
