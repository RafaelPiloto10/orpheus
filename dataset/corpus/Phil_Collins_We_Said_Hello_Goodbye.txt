We said goodbye to a dear old friend  
And we packed our bags and left feeling sad  
It's the only way  
We said hello as we turned the key  
A new roof over our heads  
Gave a smile  
It's the only way  
Only way  
  
Turn your head  
And don't look back  
Set your sails for a new horizon  
Don't turn around don't look down  
Oh there's life across the tracks  
And you know it's really not surprising  
It gets better when you get there oh  
  
Well it really don't matter much where you are  
'cause home is in your heart  
It's a feeling that you wake with one day  
Some people key p running all their life  
And still find they haven't gone too far  
They don't see it's the feeling inside - the feeling inside oh  
  
Turn your head and don't look back  
Just set your sails for a new horizon  
Don't turn around don't look down  
Oh there's life across the tracks  
And you know it's really not surprising  
It gets better when you get there  
  
We said hello as we turned the key  
A new roof over our heads  
Gave a smile - it's the only way
