Seems like just yesterday  
You were a part of me  
I used to stand so tall  
I used to be so strong  
Your arms around me tight  
Everything, it felt so right  
Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong  
  
Now I can't breathe  
No, I can't sleep  
I'm barely hanging on  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am  
Once again  
I'm torn into pieces  
Can't deny it  
Can't pretend  
Just thought you were the one  
Broken up deep inside  
But you won't get to see the tears I cry  
Behind these hazel eyes  
  
I told you everything  
Opened up and let you in  
You made me feel alright for once in my life  
Now all that's left of me  
Is what I pretend to be  
So together but so broken up inside  
  
'Cause I can't breathe  
No, I can't sleep  
I'm barely hanging on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Swallow me then spit me out  
For hating you, I blame myself  
Just seeing you, it kills me now  
Now I don't cry  
On the outside, anymore!  
  
[Chorus: x2]
