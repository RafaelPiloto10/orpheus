[One Way Street]  
I let the genie out of the box  
I let the genie out of the box  
I'm scared of everything I am  
I let the genie out of the box  
I'm scared of opening the can  
I let the genie out of the box  
I had this recurring dream  
I was living another life  
In another country  
In another time  
As I got older the dream began to fade away  
Until one day  
There she was.. tapping me on my shoulder  
She says she's got so much to say  
But she's not telling it today  
She said "Come back when you're alone"  
But I'm not sure I want to know  
Cause maybe her road  
Is a one-way street  
Maybe her road..  
I'm scared of everything I am  
I'm scared of opening the can  
I'm scared of losing who I am  
Think I might've taken all I can  
I let the genie out of the box  
She said there's a house in your mind  
An attic of treasure, a forgotten pleasure park  
Waiting inside you in the dark  
Don't leave it behind  
Don't leave it behind  
I'm scared of everything I am  
I'm scared of opening the can  
I'm scared of losin' who I am  
Think I might've taken all I can  
I let the genie out of the box  
I let the genie out of the box  
Out of the box
