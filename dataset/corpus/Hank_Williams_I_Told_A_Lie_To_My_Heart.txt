I told my heart, I didn't love you  
That I'd be happy if we'd part  
But now I know, I was mistaken  
I told a lie to my heart  
I told my heart, I didn't love you  
Now we'll forever be apart  
Lonely years of tears and sorrow  
I told a lie to my heart  
If we sin, somehow we pay  
And now the bitter teardrops start  
I must learn to live without you  
I told a lie to my heart  
I told my heart, I didn't love you  
That I'll be happy if we'll part  
Lonely years of tears and sorrow  
I told a lie to my heart
