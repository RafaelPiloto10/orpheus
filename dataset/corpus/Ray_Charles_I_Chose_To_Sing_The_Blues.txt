I could have been a gambler  
'Cause I'm good with the cards  
I could have been a lover  
Breakin' other's hearts  
And I feel so silly  
Bettin' on the dice  
And a lover seldom sees  
The same girl twice  
And that is why (that is why)  
That's why I chose (that's why I chose)  
I chose to sing the blues, yes I did  
Now, I could have been a doctor  
Helping the sick  
And I could have been a lawyer  
But you know that ain't my stick  
'Cause I feel so bad  
If a patient didn't do well  
And I feel just as bad  
To leave a client in jail  
And that is why (that is why)  
That's why I chose (that's why I chose)  
I chose to sing the blues  
  
[Sax solo]  
  
Now a man has a lot  
That he could present  
Just to think I could have been  
President  
But I can't understand  
What politicians say  
So I want to talk to you  
In my own little way  
And that is why (that is why)  
That's why I chose (that's why I chose)  
I chose to sing the blues  
Yes I did, friends  
Don't you know what I mean  
I like what I'm doin'  
You know, I like the blues  
Everybody understands  
What I mean when I say  
Something like this here  
Unnnnnnn-hoo  
Yeah  
Yeah-hoo  
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout when I sing
