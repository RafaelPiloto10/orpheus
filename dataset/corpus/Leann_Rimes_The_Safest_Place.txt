Daytime, I'm fine  
Everything is back to normal  
Last night, I thought that I would die  
I had nightmares  
I was so scared  
Thank God that you are by my side  
To hold me when I cry  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be strong  
But I don't want to be alone tonight  
I want to believe that I can save the world  
And make it right, but I'm only human  
And you've got a hero's face  
Right here in your arms  
Is the safest place, the safest place  
  
It feels so real  
You showed me I can trust you  
With emotions I had locked away  
It was your touch, your words  
They heal the deepest part of me  
That only you can see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As long as I am with you  
As long as I can feel you  
That's all I need to keep me going  
On and on and on and on  
  
[Chorus]
