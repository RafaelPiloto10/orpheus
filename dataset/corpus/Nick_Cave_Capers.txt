All words that look prounouncable are not typos, any that look unpronouncable
are probably typos. Each set of two lines is one line in the lyric book. (ie.
what has not got....sir names)(one line)  
  
What has not got my heart in it shall we be dubbed sir names  
Wither million blither tongues mounting bristling guilt frames  
In the fake-ache of the gloomloom slippers slap me alive!  
The hours hands down a miracle to spend with ugly types  
So we can catch and thread a minstrel bleed a tower down to it's ankles  
So we can't go up or stay up find the thumb dumb' in your ear brain  
Get unfunny! Such as choirs do why the clocklock bought up this one  
Just when things seem so paperparrent like my toothface? Like my out-do?  
  
  
Oh a streak, O'treacly [not a typo] ink-inks tied my knees all up in elbows  
Erase that lapsing smile tub lose the slip of the small soap-fellows  
Account the addups till Do-nots are we balanced? we're in business!  
Idle tidal, rush in, tried all with a limb's... all legs and armour  
I had a dreadful diehood diehard drunken sunken, Monk-heart  
Oh I had a Wonderful diehood thanks to my fa. fa. family
