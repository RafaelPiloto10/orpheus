All you gotta do is come.  
  
  
(kirk) while listening to these songs, if you relize that you don't have a
personal relationship with christ i will be very honorned to introduce you not
to religion but to a relationship.  
  
Just pray with me: Jesus, i believe you are the son of God. i believe you died
for me, rose for me, and your comming back for me. forgive me for all my sins
i confess with my mouth. i believe in my heart i... am... saved .  
  
Welcome to the family... welcome
