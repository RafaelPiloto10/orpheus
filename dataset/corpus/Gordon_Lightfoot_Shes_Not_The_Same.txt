Ah, the living ain't easy  
With all of these false emotions  
Too little devotion and I'm tired of just  
Being alone, she's not the same  
She's a son of a gun, she's a red hot flame  
She lights the sun and conjures up the rain  
  
Like any good gambler  
I was chained to a wishing well  
I keep wishing in vain, but listen friend  
Don't look now, she's right behind you  
Looking for someone to take her inside  
It thrills her so, it's a rainbow ride  
  
I'm a little uneasy  
And there ain't much pride inside me  
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you  
It's too late now, she's not the same  
She's a red hot kid, she's a crying shame  
  
Anytime is the right time  
To get on with a new tomorrow  
But I could never let yesterday go  
And when the falling rain makes me sad  
She comes to me in the dreams I've had  
In the morning light, in the dead of night  
  
Ah, the loving ain't easy  
I let it get the best of me  
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you  
It's too late now, she don't talk no more  
She don't make me feel like she did before  
There's too much wait and too much give and take  
  
I'm a little uneasy  
And there ain't much pride inside me  
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you  
It's too late now, she's not the same  
It's too late now, she's not the same  
It's too late now, she's not the same
