Come on, come on  
Get on your dress and put on a smile  
Lets lose this place  
and get out awhile, awhile, awhile  
  
You don't need nothin' fancy  
Just a whole lot of attitude  
I'll be your man now baby  
If you're doing what I want you to do  
  
I keep on tellin' ya  
  
[Chorus]  
She's my ball and chain  
My lock and key  
And I'm liking it baby  
She's my ball and chain  
My lock and key  
And I'm liking it good  
  
I'll t-t-t-tell ya  
Momma always said  
There was plenty of fish in the sea  
So I baited my hook but good  
And caught one for me, just for me  
  
She'll set you up with her body  
And then knock you out with charm  
She's just a little too nasty baby  
But that never did me no harm, no  
I keep on telling ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And she'll always be wrapped tight around me  
I t-t-t-tell ya
