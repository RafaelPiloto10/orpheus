The moment I entered the world of your vision  
I swear that I started to shine  
You feel like an angel descending from glory  
To come like a dream into mine  
Trembling and holding your breath at the wonder  
Of hunger so holy and pure  
Wild as the freedom I feel in my spirit  
So tightly entangled in yours.  
Chorus:  
It's a new game now  
I cast my fortunes with you  
I see the dream comin' true  
I've got that feelin' inside  
When it all came down  
Did you think I'd be tried and be true?  
Did you know I was waiting for you  
To love you the rest of my life?  
Standing alone with your soul to the darkness  
Deep as the stars in the sky  
Are you the one they have chosen to lead me?  
To wonder how far we can fly.  
Chorus:  
It's a new game now  
I cast my fortunes with you  
I see the dream comin' true  
I've got that feelin' inside  
When it all came down  
Did you think I'd be tried and be true?  
Did you know I was waiting for you  
To love you the rest of my life?
