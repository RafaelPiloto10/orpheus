featuring Tha Alkaholiks  
  
Xzibit:  
When it comes to shit like this  
I always get it right the first time  
playa haters and snakes  
waitin' for mistakes  
But that's the breaks the highs and lows  
Of the industry  
D.I.T.C. and X to the Z  
Bringin' it live  
Get it crackin' to the third degree  
Xzibit breakin' niggas down like H.I.V.  
We gring rap to your city like B.E.T.  
But still feel California  
Is the place to be, Catashtrophy...  
  
Tash:  
The Alkaholiks is back to fry you  
Xtra crispy  
With the skills that make the plots  
to dis me Xtra risky  
Cause the time it takes to infiltrate  
And stop my forward motion  
California will have broken off  
And fell into the ocean  
Cause i rocked around the world  
With my ill type skill  
Step for real or I'll leave your grill scarred like Seal  
Cause I regulate the sectin where the drinks  
Is gettin blended  
Certifed bartender  
So catch the 40  
When I send it your way  
  
Xzibit:  
Niggas that hustle  
Till the day light break  
Go to county 20 times  
Still can't go straight  
Don't nothin in the mothafuckin'  
World come free  
I'll never see a nine to five  
Cause it just ain't me  
(It's like this)  
Xzibit shall hustle, lift build muscle  
And think like Russell  
Survive and bring it live and direct  
To any crowd through out the world  
Like this come home  
And smoke a spliff in the benz  
With Swift  
  
Chorus(2 Times)  
  
Xzibit:  
I'm fucked up J-Ro  
  
J-Ro:  
Yo i'm fucked up to  
Lookin' at these bitches  
From a birds eye view  
My name is J-Ro from tthe Likwit Crew  
  
Hurricane G:  
So what nigga is it you want to do  
  
J-Ro:  
My flow is metaphorical  
Historicly correct  
What do you expect from a nigga  
With my intellect  
East coast representing West coast gangsta  
New I ain't trippin'  
I call up King Tee we go dippin'  
Through the streets  
Pumpin' hard core Likwit beats  
Flowin' air blowin' loungin'  
Inn them leather seats  
Think gback how we used to rock the house party  
Now we just fuckin' it up for everybody  
  
Xzibit:  
How dare you try to compare  
Yourself to the original  
Professional Xzibit break you down  
Like correctional Facilitys  
Limit all capabilities muthafuck MC's  
Hard to read like Japanese  
I'm spreading like disease  
So I can't be stopped  
By who you run with your click  
Or the Btich ass cops  
Xzibits' first LP  
It hit your black like crack rock  
I'm blowin' up your spot by remote  
Mr. Cut Throat  
  
J-Ro:  
I"m from Cystal-ifornia  
I warned ya I'd be on ya  
The Ro is outer national  
Cold as Henne-sota  
I smoke 12 MC's a day  
Just to fill my quota  
From forty 0-hio  
All the way to Ore-gin  
Buddy my fingers are bloody Now I'm Washing-ten  
I clown from Brew-york  
Down to Mi-ti-ami  
I soak up game like a shammy  
Understand me?  
  
Hook  
  
Tash:  
So Elizabeth it's MC's  
That's comin' to join ya  
Some will be from NYC And some will be from California  
Cause I drop the lyrics on you  
From beneath the Earth's surface  
Where I write rhymes so fresh  
I try to bite my own verses  
Cause the purpose of my flow  
Is to let you know  
My style is badder than the water  
Down in Mexico  
Cause RICO blend styles like juice and gin  
I got the Likwit shit  
That have you seein' double  
Like the Twins
