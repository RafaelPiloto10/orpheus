They pave paradise, they put up a parking lot  
A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.  
  
They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum  
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.  
  
Hey farmer, farmer, put away the D.D.T  
Give me spots on my apples but leave the birds and the bees, please  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.  
  
Late last night I heard my screen door slam  
A big yellow bulldozer took away the house and land  
Don't it always go to show  
You never know what you got till it's gone?  
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
