Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!!  
  
My control  
That's what you take from me  
Damned my soul  
And you won't let me be  
Stop me in my tracks, there's no looking back  
I can't see (no)  
It's much too late  
I feel great  
You take my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless  
You got me helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless  
You got me helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
Inside-out, that's how she turns my head  
All my doubts are never put to bed  
She's got me runnin' blind, never think I'll find sanity (oh)  
Hyperventilate, nothing's a in her place  
She takes my breath away  
  
And leaves me breathless  
Yes I'm so helpless  
She takes my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless  
I'm so helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
You take me if I breath  
And never let me know  
You cast a spell on me, and you don't let me go go go go go  
  
You leave me breathless  
You got me helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless  
I'm so helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless (oh, oh)  
You leave me breathless  
I'm breathless, breathless  
You leave me breathless  
Leave me breathless!
