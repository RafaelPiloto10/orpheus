Just one more chance  
To prove it's you alone I care for  
Each night I say a little prayer for  
Just one more chance  
Just one more night  
To taste the kisses that enchant me  
I'd want no others if you'd grant me  
Just one more chance  
I've learned the meaning of repentance  
Now you're the jury at my trial  
I know that I should serve my sentence  
Still I'll hoping all the while  
You'll give me  
Just one more word  
I said that I was glad to start out  
But now I'm back to cry my heart out  
For just one more chance  
I've learned the meaning of repentance  
Now you're the jury at my trial  
I know that I should serve my sentence  
Still I'll hoping all the while  
You'll give me  
Just one more word  
I said that I was glad to start out  
But now I'm back to cry my heart out  
For just one more chance
