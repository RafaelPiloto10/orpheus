Frida  
He stands  
Towering over me beside my bed  
Losing his head  
  
Tells me  
I must take him seriously  
Droning on the usual way  
He's such a clever guy  
  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
He's dressed  
In the striped pyjamas that I bought  
  
Trousers too short  
Gives me  
On his small philosophy  
Carries on the way he does  
  
And me I get so tired  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
Agnetha, Frida  
  
High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
To grow in size  
  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
And save cocoon  
  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry  
Frida  
Strange how  
  
Dangerously indifferent I have grown  
Cold as a stone  
No more  
Pain as there was pain before  
  
Far away he rambles on  
I feel my throat go dry  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
  
Agnetha,  
Frida High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
  
To grow in size  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
  
And save cocoon  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry
