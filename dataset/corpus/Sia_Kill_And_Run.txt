Watching the sequence of sounds  
Coming out of your mouth  
But the snore is too loud  
Follow the hands as they move  
Try to make out your move  
But my brain doesn't want to  
Silent call for you  
What have I done to you  
  
Kill and run, kill and run  
I'm one of the dirty guns  
Kill and run, kill and run  
A bullet through your heart  
  
Interpret the eyes as they die  
Should i cry should I love  
Your poor lashes blow  
Victim of sensory love  
You cry over my  
An innocent call  
  
Silent call for you  
What have I done to you  
Kill and run, kill and run  
I'm one of the dirty guns  
Kill and run, kill and run  
A bullet through your heart  
  
Kill and run, kill and run  
I'm one of the dirty guns  
Kill and run, kill and run  
A bullet through your heart
