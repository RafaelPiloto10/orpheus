Watch out children there's a wolf out there  
Open up your eyes son  
Cause he's gonna get you  
Lock your door at night  
Cause he's gonna eat you  
Don't try fighting beasts  
Cause he's gonna beat you  
Watch out children there's a wolf out there  
Never run against the wind  
Cause he's gonna win  
If there's any doubt in your mind  
Check and see if it's full moon out tonight  
Check and see if he's got a tail  
Don't forget to check his nails  
Guardian angel  
Guardian angel stay with me  
I'm on my knees...  
Watch out children there's a wolf out there  
He ain't got no sweet mercy  
He's only crazy  
Danger's got you running scared  
Can you tell me why you're going  
Take a good look in his eyes  
Don't shake his hand to tight  
Be aware of Greek gifts  
He's a son of a bitch  
Your taste is in his mouth  
He wants to have you now  
Yeah what are we gonna do  
With this big mean wolf  
What are we gonna do  
We're gonna whack him  
Smack him spank him yeah  
Watch out children there's a wolf out there  
Open up your eyes son...  
Guardian angel...  
Watch out children  
He is somewhere I can see him  
Carry guns and knives tonight  
Save your ass tonight  
Watch out children!!!!
