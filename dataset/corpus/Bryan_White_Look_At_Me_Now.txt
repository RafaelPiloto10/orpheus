Here you are on the back of my mind again  
Don't guess it's gonna get any better  
Is your memory ever gonna end  
Or does it go on forever  
  
I was the one when you left town  
Said I'd get along somehow  
Didn't take long to find out  
That I was wrong  
  
Look at me now  
Nothin' but a whole lot of time on my hands  
Look at me now  
Thought I wouldn't need you  
Now I understand  
You said I was never gonna learn  
Look at me now  
  
I was so busy looking out for myself  
I know I must have took you for granted  
Didn't want to make room for someone else  
Didn't know love when I had it  
You were the one who set me free  
But you can lay the blame on me  
Come my way and you'll see  
I have changed  
  
Calling your name in the quiet of the night  
Seeing your face every time I close my eyes  
It's always the same  
I keep hoping that you might  
  
Look at me now  
Standing here holding my heart in my hands  
Look at me now  
Wishing I'd told you we could still start again  
What I'd give if you'd turn  
And look at me now  
  
Here you are on the back of my mind again
