He saw no tears in her eyes  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
She's telling all of those lies  
She swore she'd never told before  
But I doubt it  
  
So he bit his tongue  
And tried hard to capture his breath  
When she said I waited all my life  
For just a little death  
  
[Chorus:]  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
  
Sometimes he takes himself so seriously  
She makes her movements mysteriously  
Slow fast or furiously  
It's a big responsibility  
With a face full of mixed ability  
Big dreams of elegance  
Singing the leaving of Liverpool  
And turning into Americans  
  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
So what if this is a man's world  
I want to be a kid again about it  
Give me back my sadness  
I couldn't hide it even if I tried girl  
  
We fight so frail  
Making love tooth and nail  
You gave me the kiss of my life  
I might even live to tell the tale  
  
[Chorus:]
