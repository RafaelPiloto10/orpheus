Old friend, here we are,  
After all the years and tears  
And all that we've been through.  
It feels so good to see you.  
Lookin' back in time,  
There've been other friends and other lovers,  
But no other one like you.  
All my life, no one ever has known me better.  
  
I must have traveled down a thousand roads.  
Been so many places, seen so many faces,  
Always on my way to somethin' new.  
Oh, but it doesn't matter,  
Cause no matter where I go,  
Every road leads back,  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you.  
  
Old friend, there were times  
I didn't want to see your face  
Or hear your name again.  
Now those times are far behind me.  
It's so good to see your smile.  
I'd forgotten how nobody else  
Could make me smile the way you do.  
All this time, you're the one I still want beside me.  
  
I must have traveled down a thousand roads.  
Been so many places, seen so many faces,  
Always on my way to somethin' new.  
Oh, but it doesn't matter,  
Cause no matter where I go,  
Every road leads back,  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you.  
  
I must have traveled down a thousand roads.  
Been so many places, seen so many faces,  
Always on my way to somethin' new.  
Oh, but it doesn't matter,  
Cause no matter where I go,  
Every road leads back,  
Every road just seems to lead me back,  
Every road leads back,  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you.  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you.
