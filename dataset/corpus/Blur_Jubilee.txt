Jubilee slouches in the settee  
He's losing all will to move  
He gone divy too much telly  
He watching 24 hours of rubbish  
He got butane he got plastic bags  
His eyes are going square oh yeah  
He no raver just anti social  
He not going to cut his hair  
  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen, he not mean  
Enough  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen,he not keen on  
Being like anyone else  
  
Jubilee's dad billy banker  
He thinks his son is a slob  
He should get out more stop scabbing  
He really should go and get a job  
  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen  
He not mean enough  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him where to go  
But he just don't get out enough  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him talk to girls  
But he's just too spotty  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen  
He not keen on being like anyone else  
So he just plays on his computer games  
  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen  
He not mean enough  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him where to go  
But he just don't get out enough  
  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him talk to girls  
But he's just too spotty  
He dresses incorrectly, no-one told him seventeen  
He not keen on being like  
Anyone he's not being like  
Anyone jubilee's not like  
Anyone else
