You fight for peace, but where's the war what the fuck are doing this for  
You say disarmament that's the key well that's not the way it looks to me  
You wear you leather jacket but you won't eat meat piece punk, get drunk,  
Sake you hair go out, hang out do you really care? there's no easy answers  
Complaining won't do shit if you want some changes, don't be a hypocrite  
Fuck the system that's what they say but they live by it everyday food stamps  
And welfare checks would you rather starve to death you wear your leather  
Jacket but you won't eat meat piece punk, get drunk, sake your hair go out,  
Hang out, do you really care don't you feel ridiculous now! half your  
Wardrobe comes from a cow do you believe in anarchy? who are you  
Really trying to be?
