Throw it, throw it up  
Watch it all fall out  
Pour it up, pour it up  
That's how we ball out  
Throw it, throw it up  
Watch it all fall out  
Pour it up, pour it up  
That's how we ball out  
  
Strip club and dollar bills  
I still got my money  
Patron shots can I get a refill  
I still got my money  
Strippers goin' up and down that pole  
And I still got my money  
Four o'clock and we ain't going home  
'Cause I still got my money  
Money make the world go around  
I still got my money  
Bands make your girl go down  
And I still got my money  
Lot mo' where dat came from  
I still got my money  
The look in your eyes, I know you want some  
I still got my money  
  
Ohh  
All I see is signs  
All I see is dollar signs  
Ohh  
  
Money on my mind  
Money, money on my mind  
Throw it, throw it up  
Watch it fall off from the sky  
  
Throw it up, throw it up  
Watch it all fall out  
Pour it up, pour it up  
That's how we ball out  
Throw it up, throw it up  
Watch it all fall out  
Pour it up, pour it up  
That's how we ball out  
That's how we ball out  
That's how we ball out  
That's how we ball out  
  
Valet cost a hundred bills  
I still got my money  
Gold all up in my grill  
I still got my money  
Who cares how you haters feel  
And I still got my money  
Call Jay up and close the deal  
'Cause I still got my money  
My fragrance on and they love my smell  
I still got my money  
So who cares about what I spend  
I still got my money  
My pocket's deep, and they never end  
I still got my money  
I'm going dumb with all my friends  
I still got my money  
  
Ohh  
All I see is signs  
All I see is dollar signs  
Ohh  
  
Money on my mind  
Money, money on my mind  
Throw it, throw it up  
Watch it fall off from the sky  
  
Throw it up, throw it up  
Watch it all fall out  
Pour it up, pour it up  
That's how we ball out  
Throw it up, throw it up  
Watch it all fall out  
Pour it up, pour it up  
That's how we ball out  
That's how we ball out  
That's how we ball out  
That's how we ball out
