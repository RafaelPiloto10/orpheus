Please release me, let me go,  
For I don't love you anymore  
To live a lie would be a sin  
Release me and let me love again  
  
I have found a new love, dear  
And I will always want her near  
Her lips are warm while yours are cold  
Release me, darling, let me go  
  
For I don't love you anymore  
  
So release me and let me love again  
Please release me can't you see  
You'ed be a fool to clame to me,  
To live a lie would bring us pain  
So release me and let me love again
