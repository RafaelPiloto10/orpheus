See the strange boy keeping to the shadows  
He's a very good friend of mine  
I've seen you running from the ladies  
Don't tell me you're not that kind  
I've got the time if you've got the money  
Mister you'll be pleased you'll see  
We'll meet by the tubeway as the screamer cries eleven  
And you can have your way with me  
You're gonna make me feel so cold  
  
See my one love talking to the pretty boy  
I never did like her taste  
My skin is rubber on a skeletal body  
I'm physically going to waste  
Feel my eyes and the tongue of a killer  
I'm a humanoid logic machine  
Don't touch me with your painted little fingers  
'Cause I know where they've been  
You're not gonna put those scabs on me  
  
I must hide from a thousand grinning faces  
All sucking from my crazy mind  
Take a ride out in my imagery of ages  
And heaven knows what you will find  
I've no time for the chitter-chatter ladies  
I'm so busy trying to break this wall  
Hear my words 'cause emotion now is leaving  
You see I'm really not a human at all  
And I don't think I want to stay
