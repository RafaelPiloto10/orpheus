Have a little sympathy  
Won't you hurry home to me  
Baby baby baby please come back  
Put my little dream train back on the track  
  
I haven't seen a sunny day  
Since the day that you went away  
Tears I cried for you would fill the deep blue sea  
  
Have a little sympathy for me  
Have a little sympathy  
Have a little sympathy  
  
Won't you hurry on home to me  
Baby baby baby please come back  
Put my little dream train back on the track  
Well I haven't seen a sunny day  
  
Since the day that you went away  
Tears I cried for you would fill the deep blue sea  
Have a little sympathy for me  
Baby won't you hurry home  
  
Dino's waiting all alone  
Have a little sympathy
