I've been waiting for this moment secretly,  
Counting every minute, every hour till you're with me.  
'Cause I know just what's in store  
And now I'm in your arms, baby close the door  
  
Why waste another minute, ooh let's get right to it  
Baby turn the lights down, and we don't have to say a word  
Unspoken pleasure there's no way to measure  
How you make me feel when your near me and whisper softly  
So don't stop  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's just the way you love me  
(You know you drive me crazy)  
It's just the way that you love  
(You know you drive me crazy)  
  
And it seems time flies whenever I'm in your arms  
I like to savor every second, you thrill me with your charm.  
Now I'm lost in the passion (moment, feelings, magic) we share  
And when I look into your eyes, I know how much you care.  
  
Don't want to rush the feeling, couse loving you's so real and  
I like the way you set the mood with, a little wine and candlelight  
It's more than emotion, let's keep this fire going  
Now we're lost inside our love (now we're drifting into love)  
Sweet surrender is so tender.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, you know me oh so well,  
You always take your time, and you always get it right (you know just what I
like).  
Ooh, you set my soul on fire, and I know you've got my rhythm,  
Cause then you take me higher,  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Don't you stop, stop the love, you know you've the rhythm  
Don't you stop, stop the love, you know you've the rhythm
