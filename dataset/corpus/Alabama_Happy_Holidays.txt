Smilin' faces on city streets, crowded shoppers, busy feet  
And every smile just seems to say, we're having some happy holidays  
  
Twinklin' lights on Christmas trees, kids up on santa's kneww  
Busy lines on telephones, sending a merry Christmas home  
  
Bells ringing everywhere, season spirit in the air  
Up and down the avenue, holiday dreams comin' true  
  
A choir singing songs of cheer, carols we all love to hear  
Rudolph with his glowin' nose, lovers under mistletoe  
  
Postman bringin' Christmas cards, reindeer out in the yard  
Frosty with his eyes of coal, present wrapped in pretty bows  
  
Sidewalks full of happy eyes, flakes fallin' from the sky  
Boys and girls at the big parade to see st. nick up on his sleigh  
  
The scene is set, it's beautiful, sounds of peace, joy and love  
From all of us we'd like to say, have yourself some happy holidays
