Beautiful, the girl's cooking in the diner today  
Oh, she won't show the bother, even time she gets covered in blues  
I sing kind little songs  
Trying to bait her soul  
And she's like natural music  
Anyway she moves  
  
Oh in time, time, time, I just love to watch her hands move  
A little sugar, pepper, little brother wants to shine my shoes  
Go ahead, shine, shine, shine, I'll sit real still  
And my backbone shivers as she looks this way  
And I try not to move  
  
She's beautiful, natural  
Hangin in the diner basking in the light of Ms. Lee  
  
Given time, Lord I'd build her a mountain for a room.  
Given an hour, an hour, I'd build a rocket to the moon.  
Might take at least a week to find the strongest tool  
Might take the rest of this lifetime to find the strongest fuel  
  
But she natural, she take the moon and put it in her pocket  
She's beautiful, smiling it on me while I build this rocket  
  
Because the tongue tastes so old, can't even load you coffee sweet  
When she serves a bowl of lightning, makes sure you get all you need  
Sometimes come for a menu, some just come in to breathe  
Hanging in the diner sitting in the light of Ms. Lee  
  
She's beautiful, natural  
Hanging in the diner, basking in the light, basking in the light  
  
She's beauty, yeah, the girl's cooking in the diner today  
No, she won't show the bother, even time she gets covered in blues  
I sing comical songs trying to blame myself  
She's all-ready music in a booth, man, if she catch you  
  
Hanging in the diner  
Sitting in the light of Ms. Lee  
Opening up early  
Help a poor boy up  
Open on Sunday, all day  
Little sunshine rising from the park  
Cross the street to the path  
Keeping my teeth long and longer  
And a smile  
  
Hanging in the light  
Hanging in the light  
Sister  
Sister
