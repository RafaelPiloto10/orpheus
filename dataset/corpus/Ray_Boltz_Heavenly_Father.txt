Heavenly Father  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Here we are together  
Start of a new day  
In these precious moments  
I've got so much to say  
When I think about who You are  
And all the things that You do  
I lift my voice  
And start praising You  
Chorus:  
Heavenly Father  
You're such a good father to me  
Heavenly Father  
There's no place that I'd rather be  
Some days are much better  
Than the ones before  
But everyday I spend with You  
I love You that much more  
Even when I fail You  
And I try to turn and run  
You take my hand  
And I know I'm Your son  
Chorus  
The world rushes by  
Day after day  
There's so much to do  
There's no time to pray  
But I've found with You  
A joy that's complete  
Kneeling at Your feet  
Chorus (repeat)
