Look at how she move, look at how she sway  
Standin in her pumps and her lingerie  
Comment allez-vous parlez vous francais  
Don't know how to act, don't know what to say  
Need a genie and a wish in the very worst way  
And this type of ish happens eve-ry-day  
Type love I feel, is so for real  
So gen-uine, and so sublime  
Baby workin and puttin on a show for me  
Standin over me, I smell potpourri  
Take you any place that you wanna go with me  
Just (come talk to me) like Jodeci  
Got a pain in my heart that never goes away  
Baby girl do you really wanna feel it?  
Got a lot at stake, and a promise to make  
And a kiss from your lips could seal it  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there, for you babe  
I'll be the one that you need  
I'll be the man that will love you  
I'll be there, for you babe  
  
Another loose nut, pain in your gut  
Relationship gone down  
In a bottle of booze, you manifest your blues  
Put on your face and hit the town  
Now that skin-tight dress maybe might impress  
The kind of man that you might not like  
First time up with no luck and confusion  
Got you gamblin' with just one strike  
You need more than conversation and introduction calls  
You need someone to catch you when you fall  
And fly like an eagle when you fine  
Cause you on my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at how she sway, look at how she move  
Tryin' to show and prove, don't disturb the groove  
She got - hazel eyes, and hair that's gold  
An amazing heart, and an angel's soul  
She used to be a sinner, but now she's saved  
She's well respected and she's well behaved  
Her fuse is short, her legs are long  
Her temper's mean, her will is strong  
A love so real, a love so deep  
A love so true, it's so hard to keep  
Her center's sweet, her beauty's rare  
When we walk down the street people stop and stare  
She's so damn smart, she's one of a kind  
She's a work of art, she's a priceless wine  
She's a drama queen, she's a friend of mine  
She's every man's dream and she's mine all mine  
  
[Chorus]
