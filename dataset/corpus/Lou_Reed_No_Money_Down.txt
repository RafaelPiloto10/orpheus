I know you're disappointed  
In the way I handled things  
You're thinking I misread the times  
And acted cowardly  
And since what I do affects us both  
And you feel that I let you down  
  
[Chorus]  
You're paying a price when there is no price to pay  
Lovers trust, no money down  
You're paying a price when there is no price to pay  
Lovers trust, no money down  
  
(Hey, lover!)  
(Hey, lover!)  
(Lover)  
  
They say there's someone for everyone  
And for everyone a someone  
And some tattoo roses across their chests  
With a heart that says: "Rollo"  
And some work without a public relations man  
And do their best work, baby, out of sight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Hey, lover!)  
(Hey, lover!)  
(Lover)  
  
Now I have known a hero or two  
And they all learn to swim through mud  
And they all got boots caked with dirty soles  
That they get from squashing bugs  
So when push comes to shove, get the Harley revved up  
The moon can eclipse even the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lovers trust, no money down (Hey, lover!)  
Yes, lovers trust, no money down (Hey, lover!)  
Lovers trust, no money down (Hey, hey, lover!)  
Lovers trust, no money down (Hey, hey, lover!)  
(Hey, hey, lover!)  
(Hey, hey, lover!)
