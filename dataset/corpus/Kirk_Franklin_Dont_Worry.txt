Have you ever been so down down  
That you don't really know what to say  
You tried and tried to do what's right right  
And it seems more stuff comes your way  
So you unplug all the phones, jus want to be left alone  
Praying for a better day.  
  
[Chorus]  
Then I hear you sweet voice (Dont worry)  
Will you be there (In a hurry)  
You know I've been hurt before (I see you)  
Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.  
  
See people always talk about bout  
The things that they've been going through  
But you can't tell how me I feel feel  
Until you walk in my shoes  
See I'm tired of being tired  
Fake people all around  
Want someone to love me for me (me)  
  
Then I hear you sweet voice (Don't worry)  
Will you be there (In a hurry)  
You know I've been hurt before (I see you)  
Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.  
  
[Bridge]  
When the rainbow can not be found  
And so called best friend, you're not around  
I open my eyes and realize  
You were always there  
  
Then I hear you sweet voice (Dont worry)  
Will you be there (In a hurry)  
You know I've been hurt before (I see you)  
Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)  
Then I hear you sweet voice (Dont worry)  
Will you be there (In a hurry)  
You know I've been hurt before (I see you)  
Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.
