You're not alone  
Together we stand  
I'll be by your side  
You know I'll take your hand  
When it gets cold  
  
And it feels like the end  
There's no place to go  
You know I won't give in  
No, I won't give in  
  
[Chorus]  
Keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through  
We'll make it through  
Just stay strong  
'Cause you know I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
There's nothing you could say  
Nothing you could do  
There's no other way when it comes to the truth  
So keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through  
We'll make it through  
  
So far away  
I wish you were here  
Before it's too late  
This could all disappear  
  
Before the doors close  
And it comes to an end  
With you by my side, I will fight and defend  
I'll fight and defend  
Yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hear me when I say, when I say I believe  
Nothing's gonna change  
Nothing's gonna change destiny  
Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
La da da da  
La da da da  
La da da da da da da da da  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep holding on  
  
Keep holding on  
  
There's nothing you could say  
Nothing you could do  
There's no other way when it comes to the truth  
So keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through  
We'll make it through
