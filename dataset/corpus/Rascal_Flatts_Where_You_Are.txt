There you are standing strong  
I'm a leaf holding on  
You believe like a child  
In this fire running wild  
Oh I love how you see right to the heart of me  
  
You're a waterfall washing over me  
I'm a thirsty man let me drink you in  
I am on my way  
You're a mountain top  
  
When I reach for you  
Your love lifts me up  
And all that I want is to be  
Where you are  
  
I'm the frozen ground  
You're the warm sunlight  
Shining down on me  
Baby, just in time  
  
I have never been in love like this  
Oh, you move my soul every time we kiss  
And I love how you heal  
I can't believe how alive I feel  
  
You're a waterfall washing over me  
I'm a thirsty man let me drink you in  
I am on my way  
You're a mountain top  
  
When I reach for you  
Your love lifts me up  
And all that I want is to be  
Where you are
