The means to an end  
The sinful distress  
Writing down meaningless words  
Vaguely off hand  
So the rest of the band  
Can learn from the bees and the birds  
Concentrate business man you,  
You haven't got long  
Planets are ruling your hearts  
Stilletos and thighs may be burning your eyes  
But it keeps you from falling apart  
  
Heavy but generalised  
Sordid and wet  
Someone advised me to die  
Blowing your mind  
'cause you know what you'll find  
When you're looking for things in the sky  
Under the influence  
Rotting our nerves  
Cutting us off at the mains  
Nearing the end with your grandmother's friend  
It's something to do when it rains  
It's something to do when it rains  
It's something to do when it rains
