The mountain is steep  
the ditches are deep  
The task in hand  
is making us weep  
But here's a promise  
(I intend to keep  
  
That I mean to keep)  
Seed it in your mind  
and say it each night  
Before you sleep:  
we will climb higher in time  
(och!)  
  
You've got a head full of trouble  
and a ship to build  
(You think you won't make it  
but you know you will  
You feel you need your  
cup refilled  
Fill it out of mine  
we'll drop the defenses,  
Pool our skill  
  
Your heart you're hiding  
it's making you ill  
You feel like you want to have your  
sporran refilled  
Well, fill it out of mine  
let the soulful water  
Overspill)  
and we will climb higher in time  
  
I've been to the bottom  
I've been on the train  
I've slept in the gutter  
with my head in a drain  
I've been brutally proud  
I've been mortally shamed  
But this is not a crime  
I'm just learning, my friends,  
That it's all in the game  
and we will climb higher in time  
(Och!)  
  
Climb higher in time  
climb higher in time
