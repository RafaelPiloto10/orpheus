I've always wanted what I couldn't have  
I hope and dream that maybe someday  
That I'd find out what love was all about  
I sure grew up tonight the hard way  
Now the candy store's closed, the movie's sold out  
High Plains Drifter isn't what it's all about  
And now were parting ways, I won't say a word  
Let our broken hearts cry in their graves  
Where they'll never be heard  
  
It's more than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
Last night I saw you out with my best friend  
When I'm with you I see him in your eyes  
I want to hold you but I don't understand  
There's something there that's so hard to disguise  
  
Now tears run down your face, as you walk through the night  
Those cold empty streets leave you wondering what's right  
As you walk away with your broken heart  
Don't you try to deny that true love had torn you apart  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
It's more than we bargained for  
It's more than we bargained for  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away
