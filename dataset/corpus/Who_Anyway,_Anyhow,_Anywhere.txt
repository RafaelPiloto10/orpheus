Can go anyway, way I choose  
I can live anyhow, win or lose  
I can go anywhere, for something new  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose  
  
I can do anything, right or wrong  
I can talk anyhow, and get along  
Don't care anyway, I never lose  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose  
  
Nothing gets in my way

That been laid before  
I get along anyway I dare  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere  
  
I can go anyway, way I choose  
I can live anyhow, win or lose  
I can go anywhere, for something new  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Anyway I want to go, I want to go 'n do it myself,  
Do it myself  
Do it myself, yeah
