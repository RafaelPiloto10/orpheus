When someone becomes nothing to anyone  
Whilst feelings have died  
Anyone would know it  
They set out stick and stones  
They say they'd crush my bones  
I say, I don't get mad, I get even  
Before they do  
  
Spoils go to the victor  
I'm dead on time  
Your time is going to come  
  
[Chorus]  
One day I'll dance on your graves  
Even if you're buried at sea  
Till then, till when I exact my revenge  
I'll tell them, "you're dead to me"  
  
We're all just trying to hold on to anything  
You'd think they'd know that's what we're trying to do  
These wounds are invisible  
Underneath the dirt I still see the scars  
But then when things got bad, we spread our wings and fly away  
  
You'll take all of your riches in the back of a hearse  
Your time is going to come  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day I'll dance on your graves  
Even if you're buried at sea  
Till then, till when I exact my revenge  
  
[Chorus]
