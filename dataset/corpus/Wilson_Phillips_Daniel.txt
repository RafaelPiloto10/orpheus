Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane  
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and, I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
God it loks like Daniel  
Must be the clouds in my eyes  
  
They say Spain's pretty  
Though I've never been  
And Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen  
Oh and, he should know 'cause he's been there enough  
Lord I miss Daniel  
Oh I miss him so much  
  
Oh, Daniel my brother  
you are older then me  
Do you still feel the pain  
of the scars that won't heal  
Your eyes have died  
But you see more than I  
Daniel you're a star  
in the face of the sky  
  
I miss Daniel  
Oh I miss him so much  
  
Oh, Daniel my brother  
you are older then me  
Do you still feel the pain  
of the scars that won't heal  
Your eyes have died  
But you see more than I  
Daniel you're a star  
in the face of the sky  
  
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane  
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and, I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
God it loks like Daniel  
Must be the clouds in my eyes  
Oh God,  
It looks like Daniel  
Must be the clouds in my eyes
