He's a light unto my pathway  
He's a lamp unto my feet  
When I was sinkin', sinkin' in sin and sorrow  
He came along and rescued me  
He's a joy, joy of salvation  
He's all the world to me, to me  
He saved me and He raised me  
All my sins, He forgave me  
He's the best thing, best thing to happen to me  
I have a friend above all others  
He's everything to me  
His love is deeper, deeper than any ocean  
His love is wider than the sea  
How can I tell just how much I love Him  
He's all the world to me, to me  
He saved me and He raised me  
All my sins, He forgave me  
He's the best thing, best thing to happen to me
