Bodacious am a whole lotta' bull  
Over nineteen hundred pounds.  
He's born in Galry, Oklahoma  
And he's the baddest sonsabitch around  
If a Burma bull ever were a super star  
Then Bodacious just might be.  
He's a cream colored, beefy brawn,  
Full-fledged, four footed bovine celebrity.  
Who's gonna ride Bodacious?  
Who's gonna tame him down?  
Look out for Bodacious,  
He's bound to hold his ground.  
Here comes Bodacious,  
Ya'll just step aside.  
Big and bad Bodacious  
Takes a toll from those who ride.  
Young Bo met a man named Tuff Hedeman  
At the start of his buckin' spree  
And Tuff became one of the few to make the whistle  
Back in Nineteen Ninety Three.  
Tuff tried to ride Bo again at the finals  
In Nineteen Ninety Five.  
Bodacious had got a little older and wiser  
Tuff barely came out alive.
