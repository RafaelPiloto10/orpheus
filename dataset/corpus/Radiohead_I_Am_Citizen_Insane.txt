I'm Looking at you for a minute 900 people die  
I'm Looking Away because! I did And you can't  
Why? Because I'm looking back  
  
I'm citizen insane  
I'm citizen insane  
I'm a citizen now  
Look out! Danger is coming in  
  
How could I. It is cold what is  
Near? Look out Danger through me  
In the pool no-one in but me  
I'm citizen insane  
I'm citizen insane  
  
I'm a citizen now [Repeat: x 4]  
  
Worry!
