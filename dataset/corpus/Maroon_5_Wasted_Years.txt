Slow is the memory  
I can picture her standing right in front of me  
I said that I'm behaving badly  
Kinda driving her crazy  
But I know she wants me  
  
I remember everything  
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane  
And sit on top of me, yelling out my fucking name  
Until I'm empty  
And I know she wants me  
  
But I have already tried to explain myself  
It's not that I love someone else  
But I can't bear to listen to you cry  
I'm sick of all these wasted years  
Drown in someone else's tears  
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry  
Whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
And I'll see you when I get back  
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track  
You touch me there because you know how much I like that  
I think that we both need to relax  
You know you want me  
  
All the time and everywhere  
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there  
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care  
And the emptiness is too much to bear  
  
But I have already tried to explain myself  
It's not that I love someone else  
But I can't bear to listen to you cry  
I'm sick of all these wasted years  
Drown in someone else's tears  
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry  
  
'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do  
I'm standing, standing right in front of you  
And pray our pain subsides  
Can't bare the stare of your teary eyes  
I know you feel like it's hard to stay  
In fact you may just wanna run away  
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh  
Deep down you know that  
  
I have already tried to explain myself  
It's not that I love someone else  
But I can't bear to listen to you cry  
I'm sick of all these wasted years  
Drown in someone else's tears  
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry  
  
I have already tried to explain myself  
It's not that I love someone else  
But I can't bear to listen to you cry  
Sick of all these wasted years  
Drown in someone else's tears  
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry  
  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
(We tried, yeah)
