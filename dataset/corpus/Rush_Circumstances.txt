A boy alone, and so far from home  
Endless rooftops from my window  
I felt the gloom of empty rooms  
On rainy afternoons  
  
Sometimes, in confusion  
I felt so lost and disillusioned  
Innocence gave me confidence  
To go up against reality  
  
All the same  
We take our chances  
Laughed at by Time  
Tricked by Circumstances  
Plus ca change  
Plus c'est la meme chose  
The more that things change  
The more they stay the same  
  
Now I've gained some understanding  
Of the only world that we see  
Things that I once dreamed of  
Have become reality  
  
These walls that still surround me  
Still contain the same old me  
Just one more who's searching for  
A world that ought to be
