You left me a horse from Texas,  
A house with installments due,  
A letter with lots of x-s  
Everything but you.  
  
You left me some beans from Boston,  
A bicycle built for two,  
A memory to get lost in,  
Everything but you.  
  
Each day was so gay and so daring,  
I loved every breathtaking minute,  
For how could I know I was sharing  
A kiss without a future in it.  
  
You left me a dream to room with,  
A coffee pot from Peru,  
A knife and fork to spoon with,  
Everything but you.
