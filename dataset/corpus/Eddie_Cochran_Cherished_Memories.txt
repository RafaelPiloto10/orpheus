You're goin' away, away from me  
But here in my heart is a memory  
The way we met, the way we kissed  
The way we fell in love  
Oh, the little secrets that we shared  
When I was sad, the way you cared  
To let me know you'd understand  
The way you'd hold my hand  
Cherished memories, the things that a fellow can't forget  
Cherished memories, you're leaving but I love you yet  
And now you say that we must part  
And even though it breaks my heart  
There's one thing you can't take from me  
That's my cherished memories
