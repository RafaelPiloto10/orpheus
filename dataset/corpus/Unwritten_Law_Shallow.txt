Well sometimes  
It seems you just don't understand  
The way I think and who I am  
And when I'm  
I'm told what I'm supposed to be  
You think you know what's best for me  
  
Well I want to see you standing next to me now  
Seems you've got nothing much to say  
And when you're dying lying next to me now  
I'll turn my head and walk away  
  
Sometimes  
It seems I might be losing touch  
Or maybe I just try to much  
Now I  
Now I get told I'm crazy  
Nothing you could say would phase me now  
  
I want to see you standing next to me now  
Seems you've got nothing much to say  
And when you're dying lying next to me now  
I'll turn my head and walk away  
  
Hey  
  
I walk alone  
My thought's aren't always carved in stone  
My life revolves according to me  
And what you think don't mean a fucking thing to me  
Yeah you'll see  
I'll make it farther on my own  
  
Well I want to see you standing next to me now  
Seems you've got nothing much to say  
And when you're dying lying next to me now  
I'll turn my head and walk away  
I want to see you standing next to me now  
Seems you've got nothing much to say  
And when you're dying lying next to me now  
I'll turn my head and walk away
