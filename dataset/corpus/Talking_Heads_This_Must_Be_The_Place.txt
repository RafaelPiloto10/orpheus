Home is where I want to be  
Pick me up and turn me around  
I feel numb, born with a weak heart  
Guess I must be having fun  
  
The less we say about it the better  
Make it up as we go along  
Feet on the ground, head in the sky  
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing  
  
I got plenty of time  
You got light in your eyes  
And you're standing here beside me  
I love the passing of time  
Never for money, always for love  
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight  
  
Home, is where I want to be  
But I guess I'm already there  
I come home, she lifted up her wings  
I guess that this must be the place  
  
I can't tell one from the other  
I find you, or you find me?  
There was a time before we were born  
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be  
  
We drift in and out  
Sing into my mouth  
Out of all those kinds of people  
You got a face with a view  
  
I'm just an animal looking for a home  
And share the same space for a minute or two  
And you love me till my heart stops  
Love me till I'm dead  
  
Eyes that light up  
Eyes look through you  
Cover up the blank spots  
Hit me on the head
