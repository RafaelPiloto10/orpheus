Once upon a long time ago  
In the home of the big maker  
And some often die, and some as he tried  
To sell his soul ever after  
  
I have the power  
You have the nerve  
You will be mine, I request your service  
A flash of his crown and the spread of his wings  
  
I hold the power the devil has seen  
Inside the blood of the dying light by the silence  
Is the soul of your born, like I promised it is torn  
Pull the strings and hear my laughter  
  
No use in trying, the damage is done  
What have I done to my beautiful son?  
The deal has been ceased, sucked inward to hell  
I keep locked these secrets so no one can tell  
  
Once upon a long time ago  
The evil!  
Awaken and find your looking through the eyes of a man-made evil monster  
  
Devil Doll!  
Devil Doll!  
Evil be thy master!  
  
Devil Doll!  
Devil Doll!  
Evil be thy master!  
  
No use in trying, the damage is done  
What have I done, oh, my beautiful son  
  
The deal has bead sealed, sucked inward to hell  
I keep locked these secrets so no one can tell  
Awake and you'll find that you're looking through the eyes  
Of a man-made evil monster  
  
Ooh oh oh Evil be thy master  
Ooh oh oh The man has evil monsters  
Ooh oh oh Evil be thy master  
  
Whoah oh oh ooh!
