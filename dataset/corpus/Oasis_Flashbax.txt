I spend my time sittin' on the fence with a mate of mine  
I'm tryin' to write the line of a story  
  
We believe that everything said is a waste of time  
'Cause life is well tried and it bores me  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
In my well paid opinion  
These things they really don't matter  
But from my crystal gazing eye  
There shines a light, like dynamite  
  
Sittin' on a throne will give a bad back to you  
Livin' on my own was like a Flashback  
To the days when I was lost and lonely  
Saying what I said was just a different story  
All your lies man they still bore me  
There's nothin' wrong with my world  
And these things they really don't matter now
