You can't be still  
You're such a nervous fellow  
Like a yo-yo  
Up and down  
  
Take this little pill  
And life will be so mellow  
You'll feel the world  
Start slowing down around  
  
Who's that rushing out the door  
Who's not taking any more  
Who's been down this road before  
Without you  
  
You tell me who's number one  
Who's not here  
Who's having fun  
Who's the one who cares this much  
About you  
  
You won't feel the pain  
You won't mind the rain  
You can be happy all the time  
All the time  
One dose twice a day  
The world will go away  
You'll be smiling through  
The worst of times  
Who's that rushing out the door  
Who's not taking any more  
Who's been down this road before  
Without you  
  
You tell me who's number one  
Who's not here  
Who's having fun  
Who's the one  
Who knows so much about you  
  
I believe I belive  
There's something more  
I believe it's just beyond the door  
I believe there's something more  
I believe it's just  
Beyond the door  
I believe there's something  
Better out there  
  
Want to leave this world  
So far behind  
I can see your face there  
In my mind  
I believe there's something  
Better our there  
  
Who's that rushing  
Who's not taking  
Who's been down this  
You tell me who's  
Who's not here who's  
Who's the one who  
  
Something better  
Something better  
Something better  
Something better  
Something better
