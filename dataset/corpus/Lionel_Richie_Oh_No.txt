I want you to want me  
I'm goin' crazy knowin' he will be your lover tonight  
And when he come I'll let you go  
I'll just pretend that you walked out the door  
  
Oh no ...  
I can't sleep  
Oh no ...  
I'm goin' crazy with love, over you  
  
I need you to need me  
I want to hold ya but you're holdin' someone else in  
Your arms  
When I close my eyes, I see your face  
I'm just not sure how much my heart can break  
  
Oh no ...  
I can't think  
Oh no ...  
I'm goin' crazy with love over you  
  
Oh honey ....  
Oh sugar ....  
  
Oh no .. I can't sleep anymore baby  
Oh no .. I can't think anymore baby  
Oh no .. I'm goin' crazy with love over you
