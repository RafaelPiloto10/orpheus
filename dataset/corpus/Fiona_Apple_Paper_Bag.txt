I was staring at the sky  
Just looking for a star  
To pray on or wish on or something like that  
I was having a sweet fix  
Of a daydream of a boy  
Whose reality I knew was a hopeless to be had  
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope  
And I believed for a moment  
That my chances were approaching to be grabbed  
But as it came down near  
So did a weary tear  
I thought it was a bird but it was just a paper bag  
  
Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh it kills  
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up  
I've gotta fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold  
Hunger hurts, starving works when it costs too much to love  
  
And I went crazy again today  
Looking for a strand to climb  
Looking for a little hope  
Baby said he couldn't stay  
Wouldn't put his lips to mine  
And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope  
I said honey I don't feel so good  
Don't feel justified  
Come on put a little love here in my void  
He said it's all in your head  
I said so's everything but he didn't get it  
I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy  
  
Hunger hurts  
  
Hunger hurts  
  
Hunger hurts
