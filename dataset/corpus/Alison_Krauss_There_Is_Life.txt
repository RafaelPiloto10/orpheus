Under the snow  
Beneath the frozen streams  
There is life  
  
You'll have to know  
When nature sleeps she dreams  
There is life  
  
And the colder the winter  
The warmer the spring  
The deeper the sorrow  
The more our hearts sing  
  
Even when you can't see it  
Inside everything  
There is Life...  
  
Oh....  
  
After the Rain  
The sun will reappear  
There is life  
  
After the pain  
The joy will still be here  
There is life  
  
For it's out of the darkness  
That we learn to see  
And out of the silence  
That songs come to be  
  
And all that we dream of  
Awaits patently  
There is life  
  
There is life
