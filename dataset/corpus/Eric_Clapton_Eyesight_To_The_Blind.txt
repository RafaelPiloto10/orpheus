You talk about your woman,  
I wish you could see mine.  
You talk about your woman,  
I wish you could see mine.  
Every time she starts to loving  
She brings eyesight to the blind.  
  
Her daddy gave her magic,  
I can tell by the way she walks.  
Daddy gave her lots of magic,  
I can tell by the way she walks.  
Every time she starts a-shakin',  
The dumb begin to talk.  
  
She has got the power to heal you,  
Never fear.  
She has got the power to heal you,  
Never fear.  
Just one word from her lips  
And the deaf can hear.
