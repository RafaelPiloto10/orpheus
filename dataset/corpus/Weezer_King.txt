One night at the disco I wanted to dance slow  
I saw a sweet baby, such a fine lady  
I walked up to ask her, but some dude just grabbed her  
I told him to back off, cut me some slack off  
I see you come here, drinkin' that cheap beer  
Act like you own it, I can't condone it  
You show me now respect, you got to get off it  
You got to get with it. Time for a swift kick  
You see, I own this town. You best not come around  
If you wanna get by, then cool it down  
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king.  
If you wanna mess around like that, that's just how it is  
If you wanna get by, then mind your biz.  
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king  
  
You wanted attention and did I mention:  
Nobody likes you, except for the losers  
You made a whole army, an army of babies  
Some of them stupid, some of them crazy  
Pick up your action, act like a grown man  
Look at the winners, you can be like them  
Life is so easy, pleasant, and dreamy  
If you get off me, if you get with me  
You see I own this town. You best not come around  
If you wanna get by, then cool it down.  
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king  
If you wanna mess around like that, that's just how it is  
If you wanna get by, then mind your biz  
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king  
  
You can't break me  
Never take me  
That's just how it is  
You can't break me  
Never shake me  
Clear out of my biz
