Looking back I try to understand  
As I'm listening to the pouring rain  
Had it all somehow it slipped away  
It's a story that I can't explain  
All the love we shared and all the moments we had  
You and me are worth much more  
I can't let it go 'cause I miss you  
  
No matter if I'm wrong or if I'm right  
Would you take me in your arms and give your heart to me again  
No matter where we've been - I wanna try  
I am ready to forgive and give my heart to you again  
This time  
  
Since the day I left you walk away  
Missing you my world is not the same  
I know I've been a fool  
I've made mistakes  
But in love there's always two to blame  
All the love we shared and all the mountains we had  
You and me are worth much more  
I can't let it go 'cause I miss you  
  
We shared a night to remember  
And we reached the sky  
Just a night to remember  
I've got you and you changed all my life  
You changed all my life  
  
I won't let it end this way  
The only thing I know for sure  
I don't wanna let us drift apart
