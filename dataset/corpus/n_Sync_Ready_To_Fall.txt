I can't feel it  
I can't explain  
Whenever your eyes meet mine  
My heart spins in circles  
And I feel so spaced in time  
And now that were standing face to face  
Something tells me it's gunna be okay  
  
Chorus  
And I'm ready to fall in love tonight  
Ready to hold my heart open wide  
Can't promise forever but baby I'll try  
'cause I'm ready to fall  
In love tonight  
  
I know youve been watching  
Choosing your moment  
But I've been dreaming of that day  
No one before you has gotten to me this way  
And now that were standing face to face  
There's something I need to say  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge- nothing is certain  
This I know  
Wherever were heading  
I'm ready to go  
  
Can't promise forever but baby I'll try  
'cause I'm ready to fall in love tonight x3  
  
In love tonight  
In love tonight
