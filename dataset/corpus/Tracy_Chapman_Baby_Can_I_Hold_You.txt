Sorry  
Is all that you can't say  
Years gone by and still  
Words don't come easily  
Like sorry like sorry  
  
Forgive me  
Is all that you can't say  
Years gone by and still  
Words don't come easily  
Like forgive me forgive me  
  
But you can say baby  
Baby can I hold you tonight  
Maybe if I told you the right words  
At the right time you'd be mine  
  
I love you  
Is all that you can't say  
Years gone by and still  
Words don't come easily  
Like I love you I love you
