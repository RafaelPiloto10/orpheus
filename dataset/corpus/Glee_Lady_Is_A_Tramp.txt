She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight  
She loves the theater, but doesn't come late  
She'd never bother, with people she'd hate  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
Doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls  
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls  
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those girls  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
She loves the free, fresh wind in her hair  
Life without care  
She's broke, but it's o'k  
She hates California, it's cold and it's damp  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
Doesn't like dice games, with sharpies and frauds  
Won't go to Harlem, in Lincolns or Fords  
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those broads  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I've wined and dined on mulligan stew  
And never wished for turkey  
As I hitched and hiked and grifted, too  
From Maine to Albuquerque  
Alas, I missed the Beaux-Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad  
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca'ad  
But social circles spin too fast for me  
My Hobohemia is the place to be  
  
I get too hungry for dinner at eight  
I like the theatre but never come late  
I never bother with people I hate  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I don't like crap games with Barons and Earls  
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls  
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like the free fresh wind in my hair, life without care  
I'm broke, it's okey  
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I go to Coney - the beach is divine  
I go to ball games - the bleachers are fine  
I follow Winchell and read every line  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like a prize fight that isn't a fake  
I love the rowing on Central park lake  
I go to opera and stay wide awake  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like the green grass under my shoes, what can I lose?  
I'm flat! That's that!  
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
Don't know the reason for cocktails at five  
I don't like flying - I'm glad I'm alive  
I crave affection but not when I drive  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
Folks went to London and left me behind.  
I missed the crowning - Queen Mary didn't mind.  
Won't play Scarlett in "Gone With the Wind"  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like to hang my hat where I please, sail with the breeze  
No dough - Heigh - Ho! I still like Roosevelt  
And think he's a champ  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
Girls get massages, they cry and they moan  
Tell Lizzie Arden to leave me alone  
I'm not so hot but my shape is my own  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
The food at Rector's is perfect, no doubt  
I wouldn't know what the Ritz is about  
I drop a nickel and coffee comes out  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I like the sweet fresh rain in my face  
Diamonds and lace - no got, so what?  
For Robert Taylor I whistle and stamp  
That's why the lady is a tramp
