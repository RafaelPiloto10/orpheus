There is no easy love  
The one I'm thinking of  
I miss you every day  
  
Please just stay around  
You are my beat, my sound  
My light, my destiny  
  
You rang the door one of a Sunday morning  
Said that I was always on your mind  
Smiled and said it's meaningless without me  
Girl, you're really one of a kind  
  
There was never anyone  
Until you just came around  
So afraid to be abandoned  
Can't afford to lose again  
  
There is no easy love  
The one I'm thinking of  
I miss you night and day  
  
Please just stay around  
You are my beat, my sound  
My light, my destiny  
  
All I want to do  
Is to be with you  
Have some fun with you, yeah  
  
Tired of the past  
It was not a blast  
I don't want to do the same mistake again  
  
I called you up to say that I am sorry  
For all the things I said and I had done  
You told me to relax and not to worry  
You said to me that I was the one  
  
I had been working day and night  
Try to forget your smile so bright  
Didn't know what I should do  
So afraid to choose again  
  
The foolish things we do  
We wish for something new  
Like me when I had you  
  
It doesn't matter to me  
Whatever you choose to be  
My great velocity  
  
Would you talk to me?  
Come along with me  
Curiosity, yeah  
  
Would you talk to me?  
Come along with me  
Leave the past and now this time you'll see (won't you see?)  
  
There is no easy love (easy love)  
The one I'm thinking of (thinking of)  
I miss you everyday (everyday)  
(no no easy love)  
  
If you call this romance (this romance)  
I haven't got a chance (ain't got a chance)  
You're my destiny (destiny)  
(My great velocity)
