I can chop wood from dusk till dawn  
I can swing a hammer till the daylight's gone  
I can build a barn, I can make a home with these two hands  
But if I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
I can fly a plane up in the big blue sky  
Blaze a trail through the woods in my four-wheel drive  
With a team of horses or an old John Deere, I can plow this land  
But if I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon  
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots  
I can run a train till it runs out of track  
With the weight of the world laid across my back  
My life still wouldn't be worth a damn  
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
I can build a fire with nothin' but a stick  
If I put my mind to it, there ain't much I can't fix  
I can read an' count, I can figure things out if you give me a chance  
But if I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon  
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots  
I can run a train till it runs out of track  
With the weight of the world laid across my back  
An' my life still wouldn't be worth a damn  
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
Whoa, I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon  
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots  
I can run a train till it runs out of track  
With the weight of the world laid across my back  
But my life still wouldn't be worth a damn  
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
Ah ha, whoa, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm
