I went all the way to Paris to forget your face  
Captured in stained glass, young lives long since passed  
Statues of lovers every place  
I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love  
I walked through the ruins, icons of glory  
Smashed by the bombs from above  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.  
  
Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife  
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil  
There's just no medium for life  
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth  
In a dusty cathedral the living God called  
And I prayed for my life here in earth  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.  
  
There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand  
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon  
Bleeding its light like a lamb  
And the town is illuminated, its tiny figures are fast asleep  
And it dawns on me the time is upon me  
To return to the flock I must keep.  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.
