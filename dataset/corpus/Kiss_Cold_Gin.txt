Whoo, alright  
My heater's broke and I'm so tired  
I need some fuel to build a fire  
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeah  
The landlord's gone, I'm down and out  
  
Ooh, it's cold gin time again  
You know it'll always win  
Cold gin time again  
You know it's the only thing  
That keeps us together, ow  
  
It's time to leave and get another quart  
Around the corner at the liquor store  
Haha, the cheapest stuff is all I need  
To get me back on my feet again  
  
Ooh, it's cold gin time again  
You know it'll always win  
It's cold gin time again  
You know it's the only thing  
That keeps us together, ow  
  
Whoa yeah  
Ooh, it's cold gin time again  
You know it'll always win  
It's cold gin time again  
You know it's the only thing  
That keeps us together, ow
