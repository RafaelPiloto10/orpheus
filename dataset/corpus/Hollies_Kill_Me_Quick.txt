Life is good looking through the eyes of love  
beautiful looking through the eyes of love  
  
But you know I'm telling you girl  
life ain't all the same  
Take a look take a look around you now  
You'll find that  
though it seems great life is just a crazy scene  
  
You and me seem to see right through a haze  
People laugh but we both know that it pays  
  
[Chorus]  
I want you to know how I feel  
When you go the world ain't real  
I want you to know how I feel  
When you go the world ain't real  
  
It's all balanced on the keen edge of a knife  
Let's all laugh at the craziness of life  
  
[Chorus]
