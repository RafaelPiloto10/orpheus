Three men is all they were.  
Three men out at sea.  
Three men came aboard my ship and took my true love from me.  
I couldn't believe  
She wanted to leave  
She wanted to leave.  
  
I loved you so long.  
Since you were a child.  
I've cared for your every need.  
I've tried to make you smile.  
And all the while  
You wanted to leave  
You wanted to leave.  
  
Go gather the guns.  
We'll blast them at sea.  
She begged for me not to shoot,  
"For my true love is here with me."  
I've never loved thee  
Now I must leave  
Now I must leave.  
  
So go fetch a bottle of rum dear friends and fill up my glass to the rim.  
For I'm not the man I used to be  
Now I'm one of them.
