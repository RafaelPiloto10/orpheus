Here, I am  
And beyond the reach of my hands  
She's sound asleep  
And she's sweet another know why  
These dreams could've seen her  
And I watched her slipping away  
And I know I'll be hunting high and low  
High...  
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to  
High and low  
High...  
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to  
Find her again  
Upon this my dreams are depending  
Through the dark  
I can hear the pounding of her heart  
Next to mine  
She's the sweetest love I could find  
So I know I'll be hunting high and low  
High...  
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to  
High and low  
High...  
Do you know how it feels to love you?  
Do you know how it feels to love you?  
High and Low
