Something I need from you  
I really want to know  
Like the way you do  
I've been burned before  
But not this way by you  
  
And I need to know I can trust you with my life  
On the Golden Gate bridge  
Or a fire in the night  
Or the edge of the night  
And I really hope I can have you all my life  
A fifty second anniversary  
Of the whole of time  
  
Something I need to know  
Is any of this true  
All the things they say  
Or are they only cruel  
But I fear only pain  
  
And I need to know I can trust you with my life  
On the Golden Gate bridge  
Or a fire in the night  
Or the edge of the night  
And I really hope I can have you all my life  
A fifty second anniversary  
Of the whole of time  
  
And I need to know can I trust you with my life  
On the Golden Gate bridge  
Or a fire in the night  
Or the edge of the night  
And I really hope I can have you all my life  
A fifty second anniversary  
Of the whole of time  
  
Something I need from you  
Something I need from you  
Something I need from you  
Something I need from you
