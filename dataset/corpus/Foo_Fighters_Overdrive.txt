Every now I'm running out  
This time I think I'm breaking up  
Come on down, we'll take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Every now I'm drifting out  
This time it keeps on sinking us  
Come on down, we'll take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Keep hanging by a thread  
  
There's a lie, I think you'll find  
It's locked inside of everyone  
You and I get on with life  
Pray we'll find a better one  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Keep hanging by a thread  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Every now I'm drifting out  
This time I think it's sinking us  
Come on down, we'll take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Keep hanging  
Keep hanging  
You keep hanging  
By a thread
