Love me now while we're alive  
It's the best thing we can do  
We'll have no time upon Cloud Nine  
So Heaven on Earth will have to do  
I can sing like a bird  
And dance like a demon  
And I do it all so well  
'Cause I made a deal with the Devil  
And when I die  
I'm going Straight to Hell  
Oh Yeah  
I'm going Straight to Hell  
Standing at the Crossroads  
He offered wine women and song  
Riches, Fame and Fortune  
In my hands from that day on  
I was granted there and then  
A life of Rock and Roll  
It seemed like such a bargain  
For just one eternal soul  
I know I'll curse this damned decision  
And I'll regret it the moment I fall  
But I'll be making the most  
Of a bad situation  
Till my number is called  
Sometimes I swear I've come out on top  
In this ill conceived contract  
There's nights I say  
It's a small price to pay  
For the life and times I've had  
I think "Here's to the Gents and Ladies  
And the foolish times we spent  
They cost me Afterlife in Paradise  
And they were worth every single cent"  
So have a dance  
With the walking damned  
Before my time is done  
A deal is a deal and I really doubt  
Fire and Brimstone will be much fun  
I have every expectation  
That my final prayers will go unheard  
And my veiled death bed confession  
Will not move the Mighty Lord  
I'm sure that I'll be sorry  
When he slams St. Peter's Gate  
But I'll dive right into damnation  
With a smile across my face
