Since I'm putting down all of the true things around, but I like it  
I handed down the crown, given the jewels and the answers of may  
The thought of being ousted comes and goes  
When I think about it the wind blows  
I hate it  
  
Run me out of town, somewhere a move might intended a gown at  
Pissed at all the bowels, always the blues and a delicate smile  
Missed all of the sideways, gull and noun  
Chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around  
I hate it  
  
Good grief
