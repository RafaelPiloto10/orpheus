Did you cry when they dragged you home  
Put a lock on the door and the telephone  
Was a runaway girl all they could see  
  
Have the nights and the days that you've come through  
Made the right seem wrong and the false seem true  
Was a runaway girl all they could see  
A teenage extra from the satellite TV  
  
Runaway girl  
Too bad, too bad  
Runaway girl  
Too wild, too wild  
  
Were they deaf to the prayer behind your lies  
Maybe they didn't dare to ask you why  
Was a runaway girl all they chose to see  
All they were prepared to admit to  
  
Runaway girl  
Too bad, too bad  
Runaway girl  
A real wild child  
  
So you cower in the towns forgotten places  
And you make your bed with unfamiliar faces  
And at last you've got your freedom but that's all you've got  
You're tryin' to make your mind up if you're better off  
  
You pretend to wait for washing in some laundromat  
But you're damned if you'll give them the satisfaction of you going back  
You'd freeze to death before you'd share a roof with them  
And you'd starve before you'd let him get his hands on you again  
  
Did you cry when they dragged you home  
Did you cry when they dragged you home  
Poor little runaway, poor little runaway
