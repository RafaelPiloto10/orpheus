Wait a minute honey  
I don't think the joke's too funny  
No I stayed up all night  
Checking out the doctor's guide  
  
Wait a minute honey  
Stop pretending you're a bunny  
Well I might've guessed  
You been to see a specialist  
  
I remember you said  
That we gotta keep a breast of time  
But obviously you don't know  
Where to draw the line, well  
  
Don't try to tell me it's a-what you been eating  
Since when have you been forty-four around  
Get on with the song, yeah  
  
Dig this, at the Moulin Rouge tell you baby  
We could knock'em dead  
Just sign right here, all I need is ten percent  
  
Well, now you make me feel like a pimp in the White House  
For a senator's daughter you're stealing all the headline news  
All the headline news  
  
Oh shake me, shake me, shake me up all night long  
We all need a laugh and I guess you're just the one  
Well you got more front than Haig Museum  
Oh home grown silicone  
You really got the best of me  
  
You really got the best of me
