Good night, sweethearts  
It's time to go now  
Arrivederci, tally-ho, au revoir, adio  
You've been so wonderful, I don't wish to go  
But this completes my show  
  
Bonsoir, chrie, Je vous partir  
Bonsoir, chrie, Je vous partir  
Je vous aime, beaucoup chrie  
Bonsoir, chrie, bonsoir  
  
Be strong, Pierre, hang on chrie  
Avec plaisir, as you know  
It's been beautiful, it's been mellow  
That is why I don't want to go, oh no!  
  
Good night, sweetheart, I got to go now  
Time won't permit me to play no more now  
But I'll be back to do another show now  
So good night, so long, bye, bye
