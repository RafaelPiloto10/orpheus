I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme  
I've acted out my love in stages  
With ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you  
  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be  
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see  
There's no one more important to me  
Darlin' can't you please see through me  
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front and I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding  
  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine  
And when my life is over remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing this song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front and I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding  
  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine  
And when my life is over remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing this song for you  
  
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
