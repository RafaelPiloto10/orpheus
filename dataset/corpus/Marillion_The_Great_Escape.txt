Heading for the great escape  
Heading for the rave  
Heading for the permanent holiday  
  
Heading for the winter trip  
Heading for the slide  
Heading for the dignified walk away  
  
Heading for the open road  
Goodbye to all that  
Heading for the automatic overload  
  
Standing in the open boat  
Standing in the swing  
Waiting for the ringing and the bright light  
  
Waiting to be recognised  
Quiet applause will do  
They shower you with flowers when they bury you  
  
You're holding on, you're holding on ...  
  
I. The Last of You  
Just when I thought I'd seen the last of you  
You come here scratchin' at my door  
Your pain and anger's in the howling dark  
Of every corridor I walk  
  
So tell me more about the love that you rejected  
Tell me more about the trust you disrespected  
I still don't know, why did you hurt the very one  
Why did you hurt the very one  
That you should have protected?  
  
II. Falling from the Moon  
Don't ask me why I'm doing this  
You wouldn't understand  
You're asking the wrong questions  
You couldn't understand  
  
A bridge is not a high place  
The fifty-second floor  
Icarus would know  
A mountain isn't far to fall  
  
When you've fallen  
When you've fallen from the moon  
  
There's murder on the street  
I'm ashes on the water now, somewhere far away  
I have fallen, fallen from the moon
