Oh, remember the mocking bird, my baby bought  
He used to sing for his supper, baby  
Yes he used to sing for his supper, babe  
He used to sing so sweet  
But uh since my baby left me he ain't sang a tune all day  
Oh, remember the blue-birds and the honey bees,  
They used to sing for sunshine  
They used to sing for the flowers  
They used to sing so sweet  
But since my baby left me they ain't sang a tune all day  
Hey pretty baby, come on back to me  
Make ev'ry body as happy as can be  
So, baby, if you'll please come home again you know I'll  
Kiss you for my supper,  
You know I'll kiss you for my dinner, yeah!  
But, ah, if you don't come back you know I'll have to  
Starve to death  
'Cus I ain't had one kiss all day now  
Please remember  
You've got to remember  
You've got to remember our love  
Come on back, baby, come on back in my arms,  
I'll make ev'rything that better  
Come on, baby, hurry up now  
Can you hear me calling you back again now?  
Come on, baby, stop jiving around, hurry home, hurry home
