Marie, Marie, La, Voo-doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo-doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo-doo Yeady  
She's the witch queen oh, of New Orleans  
Of New Orleans  
  
I'm gonna tell you a story  
Strange as it now seems  
Of zombie voo-doo gris gris and  
The witch queen of New Orleans  
She lived in a world of magic  
Possessed by the devil's skew  
From a shack near the swamp lands  
Of mud pie brick  
Marie stirred her witches brew  
  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She's the witch queen oh, of New Orleans  
Of New Orleans  
  
Dime or a nickel any one could buy  
Voo-doo of any kind  
She had potions and lotions, herbs and tanna leaves  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
Early one mornin' into mucky swamp dew  
Vanished Marie with hate in her eyes  
Though she'll never return all the Cajuns knew  
A witch queen never dies  
  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She's the witch queen oh  
Of New Orleans, of New Orleans
