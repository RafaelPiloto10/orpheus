I'm growing tired of the big city lights  
Tired of the glamor, tired of the sights  
In all my dreams, I am roaming once more  
Back to my home on the old river shore  
I am sad and weary far away from home  
Miss the Mississippi and you dear  
Days are dark and dreary everywhere I roam  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always along and blue, so blue  
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Memories are bringing happy days of yore  
Miss the Mississippi and you dear  
Mocking birds are singing 'round the cabin door  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always alone and blue  
Longing form my homeland, muddy water shore  
Miss the Mississippi and you
