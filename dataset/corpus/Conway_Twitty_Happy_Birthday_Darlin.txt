Hello darlin' happy birthday  
I've decided not to give you a present this year  
In fack I think it's about time I took some things away  
I'd like to take away this suspicion that I know clouds your world at times  
By giving you some faith to hold on to honey whenever your hand is not in mine  
Happy birthday darlin' I've no presents no fancy cake  
But I hope I'll make you happy with everything I take  
I'd like to take away some of your lonely moments by spendin' more of mine
with you  
And I'd like to take away some of those so-so kisses  
And replace them with ones that really say I love you  
And I wanna take away the doubt you sometimes have about my love  
By showin' more much more that I've shown lately  
And then if someone said asked you what I've got you for your birthday  
Well you can say why he didn't give me anything but he sure took a lotta
things away  
Happy birthday darlin'...  
Happy birthday darlin'...  
Happy birthday darlin'
