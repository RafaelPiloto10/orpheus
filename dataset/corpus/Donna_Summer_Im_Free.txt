I was stranded in the dark  
Trying to find an open door, so alone  
Chains were wrapped around my heart  
Didn't know what love was for, no more  
Heard these voices in my head  
Telling me "you'll never escape"  
No you can't get away  
When the spirit in me said  
Your love could show me the way  
My whole life changed on that day  
Now I'm walking in the light all aglow  
All I see is sunshine in my eyes  
Skies of blue, it's true, I'm free  
  
[Chorus]  
Out from under shadows  
The only thing that matters  
Is that you've worked a miracle in me  
I'm free  
Now when clouds surround me  
They have no place around me  
All because your love has set me free  
I'm free  
  
From the time that I knew  
That I could find love in you  
My heart's been renewed  
Now all my dreams are coming true  
I was frightened in the cold  
Desperate when you found me in time  
You saved me from the world  
Got my life back in control  
Chased away the madness in my mind  
You saved me right in time  
Now the future's looking up  
Skies are blue, all because of you  
Got the sunshine in my life  
All aglow, baby, don't you know, I'm free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the time that I knew  
That I could find love in you  
My heart's been renewed  
Now all my dreams are coming true, I' m free  
  
[Chorus]
