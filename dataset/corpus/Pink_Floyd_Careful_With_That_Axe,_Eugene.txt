Beneath the lies. Lie, lie. Tschay, tschay, tschay.  
[sound of Waters blowing into the microphone]  
[light screaming from Waters]  
Careful, careful, careful with that axe, Eugene.  
[very loud and prolonged scream]  
[another very loud and prolonged scream]  
[Waters blowing into the microphone]  
[light screaming from Waters]  
The stars are screaming loud.  
Tsch.  
Tsch.  
Tsch.  
[low groaning sound from Waters]
