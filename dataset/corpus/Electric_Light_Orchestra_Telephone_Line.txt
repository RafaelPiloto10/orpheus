"Hello, how are you?  
Have you been alright through all those lonely,  
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights?"  
That's what I'd say, I'd tell you everything  
If you pick up that telephone, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
Hey, How you feelin'?  
Are you still the same, don't you realize the things we did,  
We did were all for real, not a dream.  
I just can't believe they've all faded out of view, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
oo.  
  
Doo da wop, doo bee doo da wop, do wah doo lang.  
Blue days, black nights, doo wah doo lang.  
I look into the sky, the love you need ain't gonna see you through,  
And I wonder why, the little things you planned ain't comin' true.  
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight.  
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight.  
  
O. K. so no one's answering,  
Well, can't you just let it ring a little longer,  
Longer, longer oh, I'll just sit tight,  
Through shadows of the night let it ring forever more, oh, hoh hoh hoh.  
  
Doo da wop, doo bee doo da wop, do wah doo lang.  
Blue days, black nights, doo wah doo lang.  
I look into the sky, the love you need ain't gonna see you through,  
And I wonder why, the little things you planned ain't comin' true.  
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight.  
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight.
