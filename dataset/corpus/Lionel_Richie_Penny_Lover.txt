Penny lover, don't walk on by  
Penny lover, don't you make me cry  
Can't you see girl, who my heart's beating for  
You're the only girl that I adore  
  
The first time I saw you  
Oh, you looked so fine  
And I had a feeling  
One day you'd be mine  
Honey you came along and captured my heart  
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss  
When I'm all alone it's you that I miss  
Girl a love like yours is hard to resist  
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh  
  
Penny lover, my love's on fire  
Penny lover, you're my one desire  
Tell me baby could this be true  
That I could need someone, like I need you  
  
Nights warm and tender  
Lying next to you  
Girl I surrender  
Oh, what more can I do  
I've spent all of my life in search of your love  
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say  
Don't you ever take your sweet love away  
Girl I'll do anything, just please stay  
Oh, Oh  
  
I don't understand it, Oh what's come over me  
But I'm not gonna worry, no not anymore  
'Cause when a man's in love, he's only got one story  
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss  
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss  
With a love like yours, it's hard to resist  
Oh, Oh, Oh  
  
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)  
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (don't you make me cry baby)  
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)  
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (Oh penny baby)  
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)  
I remember the first time I saw you baby  
Penny lover, don't you make me cry  
You had the look in your eye, you had the look in your eye, Yeah, Yeah  
Ooh pretty baby  
I just wanted to reach out and touch you baby  
I just want to reach out and hold ya, I want to reach out and say Ooh, Ooh  
Don't make me cry  
I want to talk about you everyday (Penny lover)  
Need you, need you baby
