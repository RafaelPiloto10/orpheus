[Spoken:]  
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea  
During the time of king Herod  
Wise men from de east came to Jerusalem and asked  
"where is the one who is born king of the Jews?  
We saw his star in the east and we have come to worship him"  
  
Lord we have traveled far  
Torn and weary guided by your star  
There before us the living king  
Hallelujah his praises sing  
  
Herod with a evil plan  
Kill the babies  
Came his bold command  
He tried to alter god's holy plan  
God has saved him  
The son of man  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god  
  
Three kings from a distance come  
Bearing gifts for the only one  
Shout to heaven sound the drum  
Tell the nations  
The lord has come  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god  
  
He came to bring us his peace  
He came to bring us his joy  
To bring us love  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The precious lamb of god  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
  
[Spoken:]  
And so the wise men the shepherds  
The ox and the lamb  
The angels above  
All rejoiced at god's command  
As a star shine from heaven  
This new king to adorn  
On that very first christmas  
When Jesus Christ was born
