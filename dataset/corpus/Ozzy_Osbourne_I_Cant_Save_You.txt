You think you're special  
You think you're cool  
You're so invincible  
You're nobody's fool  
  
Dead man walking  
Your ego's high  
No matter who you are  
We're all gonna die  
  
Your time is coming  
Your soul is burning  
Your future's fading  
I Can't Save You  
  
Your demon's waking  
Your will is breaking  
Your body's shaking  
I Can't Save You now, now, now, now...  
  
(You've got to save yourself)  
I can't save you now, now, now, now...  
(You've got to save yourself)  
I can't save you now, now, now, now...  
  
The years are passing  
The time goes fast  
You're in denial  
With your head up your ass  
  
Can't take it with you  
Leave it behind  
So many ways to live  
There's one way to die  
  
Your god is calling  
Your tears are falling  
You're head's exploding  
I can't save you  
  
No use in trying  
You can't stop crying  
You feel like dying  
I can't save you now, now, now, now...  
  
(You've got to save yourself)  
I can't save you now, now, now, now...  
(You've got to save yourself)  
I can't save you  
  
Tempted by your twisted mind  
You destroyed your self-control  
For fame and fortune you gave it all  
No one said you had to sell your soul  
  
[Solo]  
  
Your time is coming  
Your soul is burning  
Your future's fading  
I can't save you  
  
Your demon's waking  
Your will is breaking  
Your body's shaking  
I can't save you  
  
Your god is calling  
Your tears are falling  
Your head's exploding  
I can't save you  
  
No use in trying  
You can't stop crying  
You feel like dying  
I can't save you now
