I'm not gonna choke on your hard sell media dope  
I'm not going out like that  
I don't want to hear about the summer of love  
I'm not going back in time  
I don't want to even let love rule  
I want to break the back of brotherly love  
I don't want to go back in time  
I wanna kill jerry garcia!  
  
I wanna take the past and throw it away  
I want to burn the bridge between then and now  
I'm not going back in time  
I wanna kill jerry garcia!  
I don't want to sew the seeds of love  
I want to punch marty balin in his eye  
I don't wanna go back in time  
I wanna kill jerry garcia!  
  
(man, I don't have a quarter, leave me alone)  
  
Don't want no dead blood on my hands  
I wanna shake the flesh and bone  
I don't wanna kill the myth  
I wanna kill jerry garcia!  
  
I wanna kick that skeleton in his teeth  
I'd wanna kick pigpen if he were alive  
I don't want to go back in time  
I want to kill jerry garcia!  
  
Kill jerry
