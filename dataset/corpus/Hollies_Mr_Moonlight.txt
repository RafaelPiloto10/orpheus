You came to me one summer night  
And from your beam you made my dream  
Woah let me tell you now  
And from the world you sent my girl  
And from above you sent love  
  
Now she is mine  
I think you'll find  
Because she loves you  
Mr Moonlight  
  
Mr Moonlight  
Come and again please  
Here I am on my knees  
Begging you to please  
  
The night you don't come my way  
I pray each day  
Because she loves you  
Mr Moonlight  
  
Break  
The night you don't come my way,  
I pray each day  
Because she loves you  
Mr Moonlight  
  
Mr Moonlight  
Come and again please  
Here I am on my knees  
Begging you to please  
  
The night you don't come my way,  
I pray each day  
Because she loves you  
Mr Moonlight
