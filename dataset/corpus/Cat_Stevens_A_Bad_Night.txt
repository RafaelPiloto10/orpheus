Baby, you're cool  
And even though you've never been to school  
I know you're fine  
But then you change your mind  
Then you start on driftin'  
And fall on behind  
  
You've been my girl  
You've been mine  
All of the time  
  
A bad night  
Its gonna be  
A bad night  
I guarantee  
Tonight I'll have  
A bad night  
I know I shall  
  
Ah, 'cause you left me waiting in the corner  
And I know you're never gonna come back for me  
And though you said you loved me  
And said you needed all of my love  
A bad, bad, bad, bad, bad night  
Its gonna be  
  
A bad night  
It's gonna be  
A bad night  
I guarantee  
Tonight I'll have  
A bad night  
I know I shall  
  
Maybe if the weather was just a little better  
It might not have happened that way  
But the situation was gettin' pretty bad, bad  
A bad bad bad bad bad night it's gonna be  
  
A bad night  
It's gonna be  
A bad night  
I guarantee  
Tonight I'll have  
A bad night  
I know I shall  
I know I shall
