I've been scared to make a move,  
So much left for me to prove.  
I guess it's time for me to show what I've got.  
Things will never be the same,  
I may snuff the burning flame.  
Or I may prove to be much more than I thought.  
  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'll figure it out, yeah.  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
No more hesitating, it's too late to turn back now, yeah.  
  
You can come along with me.  
Or if that's not your destiny,  
You can choose to go your way if you want.  
I will send my best to you,  
There are things I have to do.  
I can't wait no more, I've got to move on.  
  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'll figure it out, yeah.  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
No more hesitating, it's too late to turn back now, yeah.  
  
It does not take this action,  
To see a chain reaction.  
Everyone, blossoming in the sun.  
  
(Ooh) We'd hate to leave our shelter,  
But there's so much waiting out there.  
If only we'd open our eyes and see.  
Woah woah woah woah  
  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'll figure it out, yeah.  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
No more hesitating, it's too late to turn our backs now, yeah.
