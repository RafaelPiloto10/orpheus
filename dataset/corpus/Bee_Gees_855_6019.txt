I've discovered for myself this time  
The start of everything to me  
Is to know our love is older than the sea  
But don't let another flame inside  
Your fire-proof heart  
'Cause I'm not your full-time lover  
And it's tearing me apart  
I've been hangin' on this line too long  
  
855-7019  
Don't you ever answer  
855-7019  
Don't you hear the word  
Search for a sign , baby  
She was the past and the future  
I just got burned  
855-7019  
Is a private number  
I know in your mind that you think  
It's a crime, but I had to call  
First and last , there will  
Never be a past or a future  
If you kill my phone  
  
Baby lifts her eyes  
And I'm a slave to all the lies  
And I'm forever lost  
I believe in you and me  
Together and it keeps this love alive  
  
855-7019  
Don't you ever answer  
855-7019  
Don't you hear the word  
Search for the sign , baby  
She was the past and the future  
I just got burned  
  
I have suffered for my sins today  
With the pain of love  
Before the dawning comes  
The darker is the night  
I'm born to be the one to share your life  
That shows I don't need no operator  
I don't want no one to know  
How much I need you  
  
855-7019  
Don't you ever answer  
I know in your mind that you think  
It's a crime , but I had to call  
First and the last , there will  
Never be a past or a future  
If you kill my phone  
  
Baby lifts her eyes and I'm a slave to all the lies  
And I'm forever lost  
I believe in you and me together  
And it keeps this love alive
