The silent fall of evening snow  
Another thing you can't control  
Does it chill or warm you soul tonight  
You've become a mystery  
Will I earn your honesty  
I'll never know if we agree  
If you're not here  
And we travel separate roads  
And we carry different loads  
And in the end we stay or go  
The long goodbye continues on  
Through fog and rain and far beyond  
You stay awhile and then you're gone again  
I look into your restless eyes  
You turn away it's no surprise  
I wonder if it's even wise but I'm still here
