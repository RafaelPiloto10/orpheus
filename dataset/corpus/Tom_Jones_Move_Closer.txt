Hey' baby  
You go your way  
And I'll go mine  
But in the meantime  
  
Move closer  
When we're together  
Touching each other  
And our bodies  
Do what we feel  
  
When we're dancing  
Smooching and swaying  
Tender love song  
Softly playing  
  
Move closer (move closer)  
Move your body' real close until we  
Feel like we're making love  
  
Get closer  
So when I say sugar  
And I whisper I love you (I love you)  
Well I know you're gonna answer  
In the sweetest voice yeah my sexy baby  
I love you too  
  
There's much room for passion, oh no, no  
There no room for fears  
When the love flows smoothly between us  
My dear  
  
Oh move closer baby  
Come here girl  
Let me hold you  
You feel so good to me woman  
  
(Move closer) Let's get closer  
(Let's get closer) Gonna make sweet love to you  
Honey get beside me  
And let me love you  
My baby, baby, baby  
I love you  
  
So baby won't you  
Move closer (move closer)  
Why don't you move your body real close  
Until we feel like we're really' making sweet, sweet  
Sweet, sweet, sweet love  
Move closer (move closer)  
So why don't you take me to heaven  
Oh baby, to heaven, yeah  
Let's take our time and do it right  
Be going all night, yeah  
It's gonna be a long night
