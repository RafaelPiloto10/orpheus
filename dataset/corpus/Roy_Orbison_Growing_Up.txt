Your life begins when teardrops start, a broken toy, a broken heart  
All of these things are just a part of growing up  
From kiddie cars to walking shoes from lullabyes to lonely blues  
Somehow you never quite get used to growing up  
Yeah Yeah you're growing up, yeah Yeah you're growing up  
It's good to know you're growing up.  
  
The wheel of fortune takes a spin  
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win  
But you must play the game again  
Drink another cup,You're growing up.  
Yeah Yeah you're growing up, yeah yeah you're growing up  
It's good to know you're growing up.  
  
Heeeeey eeeeey now little one you're growing up  
Heeeeey eeeeey now little one you're growing up.  
To be a man, to be a woman to understand, takes a lot of growing, growing up  
You'll live to learn, you'll learn to live, you'll give to love your love to
give  
And when you're wise enough you'll know, you're growing up
