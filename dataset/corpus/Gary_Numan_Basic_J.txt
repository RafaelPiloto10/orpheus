Jo the waiter spilling wine  
Over some ex-friends of mine  
In zero cafe number 9  
What you gonna say this time  
  
Basic J, say, are you new here  
  
New ones walking down the stairs  
Pretty young thing but no-one cares  
Jo the waiter drops the tray  
Do you always know your name  
  
Jo the waiter smiled at me  
Jo the waiter's company  
I keep him in a book by my fireside  
A drama is my perfect bride
