Thought you'd relate every will  
Perish it  
Your chocolate soul  
Help us wrong  
Deny your past  
  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind  
  
Circumvent your Tiki doll  
When in fights  
They're on the go  
  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind  
  
When the present can be sealed  
Away  
Cold rust  
For the mighty conquered meal  
  
Fair ways  
For us  
When the present can be sealed  
  
Away  
Cold rust  
For the mighty conquered meal  
  
Can't you look at my shamed ass?  
Now she's gone and got us once  
You can't see me Saturday  
  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind  
I've got pictures on my mind
