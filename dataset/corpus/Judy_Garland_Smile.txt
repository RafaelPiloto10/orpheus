Smile though your heart is aching  
Smile, even though it's breaking  
When there are clouds, in the sky, you'll get by  
If you smile, through your fear and sorrow  
Smile, and there'll be tomorrow  
You'll see the sun come shining through  
If you'll....  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear, may be ever so near,  
That's the time, you must keep on trying  
Smile, what's the use of crying?  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile,  
If you'll just....  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear, may be ever so near,  
That's the time, you must keep on trying  
Smile, what's the use of crying?  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile,  
If you'll just....  
Smile
