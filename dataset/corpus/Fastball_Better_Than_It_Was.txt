Once I had it all planned out  
My dirty fingers moved about  
to make a mess of everything around me  
Now I don't claim to know my way  
I still run in circles every day,runnin' around half blind  
Life can be unkind  
But it's better than it was  
It's better than it was  
Oh, I complain very little because  
it's better than it was  
I get to remembering we  
had a lot more money then  
to make a mess of everything around us  
Now that money comes and goes  
a bit faster than my confidence grows  
Everybody knows  
there ain't nothin' new about money woes  
But it's better than it was  
It's better than it was  
It's better than it was  
It's better than we ever could have wished it to before  
It was bad awhile ago,better this I know  
It's better than it was,  
Better than it was  
I complain very little because it's better than it was  
Better than it was  
Better than it was  
Better than it was
