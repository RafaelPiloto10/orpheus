Here I sit and watch the crowds go by  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
But there's only one face I can see  
If only they would understand  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
I'd open the door and let him in  
  
Chorus:  
How long can I hide, what I'm feeling inside  
My love is a river, that's got to make its way into sea  
This feeling can't hide, Lord knows I've tried  
Beneath the surface  
Beneath the surface  
  
I try, though I know I'm hanging on a string  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
You're the only one thing on my mind  
Keeps floating to a distant shore  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
As I go on denying myself  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, keeps turning round in my mind  
Oh, round and round in my mind  
  
Here I sit and watch the crowds go by  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
But there's only one face I can see  
  
Chorus x 2
