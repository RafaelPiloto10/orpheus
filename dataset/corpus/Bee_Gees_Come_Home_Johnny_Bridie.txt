I'm full of pride and my heart feels good  
Got news from my family up in the woods  
At last I can go back where I belong  
Sweated it all out for nine long years  
  
Couldn't believe the voice in my ears  
When the man saying "no hiding ,son"  
So I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then, hardly grown  
  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a ma and pa  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everybody said the kid's no good  
Come home johnny bride come home  
Johnny bride come home  
We're all wrong without you  
How did we ever doubt you  
He confessed to the killing  
It's his role we had you filling  
We didn't really mean to make you sad  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad  
  
I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then , hardly grown  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
  
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a ma and pa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad [Repeats]
