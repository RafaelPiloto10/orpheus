There's a lie that runs  
Across the human race  
There's a truth that draws  
A tear upon your face  
A child is crying and it echoes  
All over the world  
If we try to find some  
Deep communication  
Bring an end to war  
And start a new creation  
From the truth inside  
It's waiting, it's waiting  
Suddenly then  
The clearest voice will call  
Feeling the air  
You have no choice at all  
Can I ask the question to you  
Do you know who you are  
Do you know what we're doing here  
Try to see the way from within  
'Cause it isn't outside  
Let your honesty see it clear  
Why does anger fit our hearts  
With missconception  
Turn us inside out in every direction  
From the truth inside  
That's waiting, it's waiting  
Follow the voice  
That lives inside your heart  
Never the choice  
That tears your world apart  
Take a walk and be  
A wave upon the oceanTouch the sky and  
Feel our spirit in motion  
This is the love inside that's waiting  
Just waiting  
Suddenly everything is there to see  
You can be everything you want to be  
Are you ready to go my love  
Are you ready to be my love  
Are you ready to die for love
