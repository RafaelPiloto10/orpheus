I'm a little boy  
In the world today  
Trying to live his life  
In a grown up way  
Sometimes I get so scared  
That I can hardly move  
But I'm a little boy  
With a lot to prove  
Some days go by so fast  
Sometimes I wonder  
How long will this young boy last?  
Now I'm an ancient train  
Going down the track  
I always make my way  
Never turning back  
Because my wheels are old  
Sometimes I ride real slow  
But I'm an ancient train  
With a place to go  
I used to ride so fast  
Sometimes I wonder  
How long will this old train last?  
Sometimes the song goes fast  
Sometimes I wonder  
How long will this old song last?
