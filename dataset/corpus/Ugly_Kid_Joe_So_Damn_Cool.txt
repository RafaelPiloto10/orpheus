I want to know, why the people are everywhere, and  
I want to know, where to go if I get scared, and  
I want to be, in a place where no one cares, and  
  
I, I, I want to know you!  
'Cause you're so damn cool!  
Yeah, you're so damn cool!  
  
I want to feel like I'm floatin' in the air, and  
I want to know if the sun'ss gonna bleach my hair, and  
I want to know why life's so unfair and  
  
I want to know you!  
Because you're so damn cool!  
Yeah, you're so damn cool!  
  
Who knows what I'm feelin' inside of me!  
And who knows if I'm feelin' all right!  
Who knows what I'm feelin' inside of me  
Who knows what is runnin' around in my brain  
  
Now that I'm done and I seen it  
And don't think that I'm tryin' to complain  
Don't think I'm lyin' 'cause I mean it  
N' all you people out there don't look at me to lay  
All of your blame 'cause you need me  
And you want me to go down  
In flames with the rest  
But I'm so sick of denyin'  
What is runnin' around in my brain
