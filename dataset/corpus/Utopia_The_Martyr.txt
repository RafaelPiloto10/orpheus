Why, why was I born to know what I must know  
I can see the sky, but I can't see the ground below  
Where do I go  
Falling in a trap where traitors wait  
Lost love is the bait  
But the martyr never knows  
He is caught in a dream of his own  
When it's over where does he go  
Who really knows  
Time stands between me and my home  
So long ago  
I can't stand to wait  
But I can't force my body to go  
Where do I go  
Crying, he is blind to everyone  
And that's how it's done  
And the martyr never knows  
Who really knows  
I know in my heart  
I could change the world  
With just this guitar  
Who really knows
