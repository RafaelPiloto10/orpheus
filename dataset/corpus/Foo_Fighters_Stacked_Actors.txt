Oh mirror mirror  
You're coming in clear  
I'm finally somewhere in between  
I'm impressed  
What a beautiful chest  
I never meant to make a big scene  
  
Will you resign to the latest design  
You look so messy when you dress up in dreams  
One more for hire  
Or wonderful liar?  
I think its time we all should come clean  
  
Stack dead actors  
Stacked to the rafters  
Line up the bastards  
All I want is the truth  
  
Hey hey now, can you fake it?  
Can you make it look like we want?  
Hey hey now, can you take it?  
And we cry when they all die blond?  
  
God bless, what a sensitive mess  
Yeah but things aren't always what they seem  
Your teary eyes  
Your famous disguise  
Never knowing who to believe  
  
See through  
Yeah, but what do you do?  
When you're just another aging drag queen?  
  
Stack dead actors  
Stacked to the rafters  
Line up the bastards  
All I want is the truth  
  
Hey hey now, can you fake it?  
Can you make it look like we want?  
Hey hey now, can you take it?  
And we cry when they all die blond?
