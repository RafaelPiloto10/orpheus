[1st verse:]  
Once I got stuck on a sweet little German  
And oh what a German was she  
The best that was walking, well what's the use talking  
Was just made to order for me  
So lovely, and witty, more yet she was pretty  
You don't know until you have tried  
She had such a figure, it couldn't be bigger  
And there was some more yet beside  
  
[chorus:]  
Oh how that German could love  
With a feeling that came from the heart  
She called me her honey, her angel, her money  
She pushed ev'ry word out so smart  
She spoke like a speaker, and oh what a speech  
Like no other speaker could speak  
Ach my what a German when she kissed her Herman  
It stayed on my cheek for a week  
  
[2nd verse:]  
This girl could squeeze, and it never would hurt  
For that lady knew just how to squeeze  
Her loving was killing, more yet she was willing  
You never would have to say please  
I just couldn't stop her, for dinner and supper  
Some kisses and hugs was the food  
When she wasn't nice it was more better twice  
When she's bad she was better than good  
  
[2nd chorus]  
Oh how that German could love  
With a sweetness that's sweeter than sweet  
Just say what you please, you would hug and you'd squeeze  
Just the shoes that she wore on her feet  
Her smile was like money that somebody owed you  
That somebody wanted to give  
When you felt like dying and she started sighing  
Ach my it was worthwhile to live  
  
[3rd verse:]  
Sometimes we'd love for a week at a time  
And it only would seem like a day  
How well I remember, one night in December  
I felt like the middle of May  
I'll bet all I'm worth that when she came on earth  
All the angels went out on parade  
No other one turned up, I think that they burned up  
The pattern from which she was made  
  
[3rd chorus:]  
Oh how that German could love  
With a love like you see in a play  
When she said, "My dear," it would ring in my ear  
For a year, and a week and a day  
Her no was like yes, and her yes was like no  
It was something like yes, it was, well  
When we got together ach donner und vetter  
'Twas love with a capital "L"
