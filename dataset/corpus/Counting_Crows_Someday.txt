Something going on around here  
I could not crawl back if I tried  
Couldn't wait around  
Couldn't wait another second  
There's something going on around here  
I left my baby on the side of hte highway  
She just couldn't see things my way  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
Someday  
I will treat you fine  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
I know I should  
Everything that's amazed me  
Has decayed  
Like shrinking bones in the sun  
Can't you tell me why it is  
That the beautiful ones are crazy  
She's whispering like a mortician now  
I left my baby by the side of the road  
I left her with a heavy load  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
Someday  
I will treat you fine  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
I know I should  
Something going on around here  
I couldn't crawl back if I tried

I left her with a heavy load  
Oh  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
Someday  
I will treat you fine  
Someday  
I will you treat you good  
I know I should
