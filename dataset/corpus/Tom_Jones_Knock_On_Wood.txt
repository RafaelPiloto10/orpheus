I don't wanna lose this good thing, oh, that I got  
'Cause if I do I will surely, I'll surely lose a lot  
'Cause your love is better than any love I know  
  
It's like thunder  
(Thunder)  
Lightnin'  
(Lightnin')  
The way you love is frightenin'  
You had better knock  
(Knock, knock, knock, knock)  
On wood, baby  
  
And I'm not superstitious about you but I can't take no chance  
You got me spinnin', baby, ooh, you know that I'm in your trance  
I feel your touch all over, ooh, you know it means so much  
  
It's like thunder  
(Thunder)  
Lightnin'  
(Lightnin')  
The way you love is frightenin'  
You had better knock  
(Knock, knock, knock, knock)  
On wood, baby  
  
It's no secret about it 'cause with your loving touch  
Ooh, she sees to it that I get enough  
'Cause your love is better than any love I know  
  
It's like thunder  
(Thunder)  
Lightnin'  
(Lightnin')  
The way you love is frightenin'  
You had better knock  
(Knock, knock, knock, knock)  
On wood, baby, ooh
