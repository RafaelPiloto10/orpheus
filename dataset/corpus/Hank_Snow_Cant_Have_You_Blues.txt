Hey, pretty mama, I'm as blue as the skies above  
Hey, pretty mama, you're the only woman I love  
And your daddy's gonna love you  
But I just can't have you blues (honey, ease my mind)  
  
You told me if I called you on the phone tonight you'd be in  
What makes you tell me them lies when you know it's a dog gone sin  
I guess I'll have to settle for  
Them lovin' can't have you blues (she just wasn't there, that's all)  
  
You may be havin' your fun you may be out on the run, that's fine  
But a love like yours, baby, someday is bound to go blind  
So come home because your daddy's got  
Them love you can't have you blues (you gotta change your mind)  
  
I've reached my verdict that you women are all the same  
You run away and leave me then you say I got myself to blame  
So come on back, daddy's got them  
Love you can't have you blues (I'll never change my mind)  
  
If I look at the wall that old wall looks back at me  
Everywhere that I look it's the same old colour to me (blue)  
So hurry home, daddy's got  
Them love you can't have you blues
