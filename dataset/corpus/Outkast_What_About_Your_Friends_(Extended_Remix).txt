What about your friends  
What about  
What about your friends  
What about what about  
  
Every now and then I get a little crazy  
That's not the way it's supposed to be  
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy  
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me (yeah)  
  
People try to say I act a little funny  
But that's just a figure of speech to me  
They tell me I changed because I got money  
But if you were there before then you're still down with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
What about your friends will they stand their ground  
Will they let you down again  
What about your friends are they gonna be low down  
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you  
  
Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too  
Friendly so to speak hypothetically  
Say I supply creativity to what others  
Must take as a form of self-hate  
Only to make an enemy  
Which results in unfortunate destiny  
They dog me out then be next to me  
Just cause I am what some choose to envy  
  
Every now and then I get a little easy  
I let a lot of people depend on me  
I never though they would ever deceive me  
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own  
I'll never let another get that close to me  
You see I've grown a lot smarter now  
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see  
If your friend is true they'll be there with you  
Through the thick and thin  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Friends...  
Let you down again....  
Be low down...  
  
Forget giggly boogly  
I'm attack it like a seizure  
I got rhymes at my leisure  
Time when I need ta  
With T to the L to the C  
What I be sayin'  
Gettin' loose on this track  
But underground is where I'm stayin'  
So hip hip hooray organizers comin' in  
On a friend like the oj  
But what about your friends to the end  
Will they run on out like a jeeble  
Or you'll find 'em stickin' close to your side  
Like a big bunch of fiends  
Six now the groupies drinkin' water  
I get real funny so you'd better hide your daughter  
Oh buddy oh pal oh chump friend of mine  
Stayin' close like ketchup  
A virgin that's right you call me Bruce Lee right  
For the styles that me kick  
And give me enough respect for this funky remix  
One one thousand two one thousand three one thousand blitz  
Now the rabbit felt blue so I gave the nigga Trix  
Cuz I was his friend wasn't down for the beggin'  
You called me a friend we're seven about to takin'  
Take a tickin' keep on lickin' why you dippin' for the border  
You said you'd be down for richer for poorer but  
O-you-T-K-A-S-T ain't no change so tlc go head and sang baby  
  
Yo is it me  
L to the E-F-T-E-Y-E (a ha ha)  
Or can it be I am a little too  
Friendly so to speak hypothetically  
Say I supply creativity to what others  
Must take as a form of self-hate  
Only to make an enemy  
Which results in unfortunate destiny  
They dog me out then be next to me  
Just cause I am what some choose to envy  
  
Brrrrr..... Ba ba ba  
Back up  
This ya wicked remix  
Come down wicked sing  
Rewind with em aya  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
People say I act a little funny  
I wouldn't change not for no money  
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me (yeah, yeah)  
Even though I might seem easy  
It don't give you no cause to deceive me...
