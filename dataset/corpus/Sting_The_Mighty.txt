Walking this high road are warriors from an olden time  
Curse on this land and the days far behind us  
Dragons we've slain, rescued many maiden?s fair  
And no man ever dared break our stride  
Or the brotherhood that binds us.  
  
Brothers are we, marching on the roads of time  
From this broken land and the days that defined us  
All men are free, justice is a sword we hold  
Trusting in the knights noble vow  
In the brotherhood that binds us.  
  
When the broken are strong  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
When the beaten are proud  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
When the twisted can stand  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
When the silenced can laugh  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
When the hunted have turned  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
When the tortured are sane  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
When the blinded still stare  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
When the poisoned remain  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
When the voiceless can sing  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
And the shackled can run  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
And this downtrodden man holds his face to the sun  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
We?ll be walking high above the world.  
(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)  
Our legend will say  
  
Freak the mighty  
Freak the mighty  
Freak the mighty  
Freak the mighty...
