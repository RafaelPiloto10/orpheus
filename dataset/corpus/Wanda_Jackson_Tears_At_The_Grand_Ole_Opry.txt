Ask the Grand Ole Opry here in Nashville Tennessee  
Everyone will be happy everybody but me  
Tonight I'll be there by myself I won't be with somebody else  
Cause the one that I love has been stolen away  
Cause there'll be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight  
And every Saturday night bitter tears I will fight  
All the songs that I will hear will just bring sadness to my ear  
Cause there'll be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight  
[ fiddle - guitar ]  
Cause there'll be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight  
This old heart can't believe that you're gone from sight  
There'll be no more joy and songs for me you were the only one  
And there'll be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight
