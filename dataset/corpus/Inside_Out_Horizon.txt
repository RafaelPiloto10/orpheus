Another day burns away into darkness  
Another blink of the eye of time  
I am straining through the blackness  
Ever searching for a sign  
The days grow long and the days grow dark  
And the days grow ever colder  
The trust that I started with fades as I get older  
Though the road is hard  
It seems to me there is no way around this  
From all you've done for me  
I know you'll never break your promise  
So here at the end of this day  
Where the world is shaded in gray  
I will look to blue horizons and watch for you to come  
When my hope is tattered and torn  
When my faith is weathered and worn  
I'll look to the blue horizons  
I am still walking, evading the shadows  
I am still running that narrow line  
I would go wherever you would have me go  
Ever searching for a sign
