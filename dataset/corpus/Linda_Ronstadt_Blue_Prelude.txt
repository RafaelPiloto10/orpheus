Let me cry, let me sigh when I'm blue,  
Let me go away from this lonesome town,  
Won't be long till my song here is through,  
And I know I'm on my last go round.  
All the love I could steal, beg or borrow  
Couldn't heal all this pain in my soul.  
What is love but a prelude to sorrow  
With a heartbreak ahead as your goal.  
Here I go  
Now you know why I'm leaving.  
I got the blues.  
What can I lose?  
Goodbye!  
All the love I could steal, beg or borrow  
Couldn't heal all this pain in my soul.  
What is love but a prelude to sorrow  
With a heartbreak ahead as your goal.  
Here I go  
Now you know why I'm leaving.  
I got the blues.  
What can I lose?  
Goodbye!  
Adieu! to you  
Goodbye!
