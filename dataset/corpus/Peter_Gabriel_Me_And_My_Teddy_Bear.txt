Me and my teddy bear  
Have no trouble have no care  
Me and my teddy bear  
Just play and play all day.  
  
I love my teddy bear  
He has one eye and has no hair  
I love my teddy bear  
We play and play all day.  
  
Every night he's with me  
When I climb up the stairs  
And by my bed he listens  
Until I say my prayers.  
  
Oh, me and my teddy bear  
Have no trouble have no care  
Me and my teddy bear  
We play (blp blp) and play (blp blp)  
All day!
