Rock-a-bye baby if you want to dance  
Grab yourself a body and take a chance  
They say one time around is all you get  
But I'm still dancin' so you lost your bet  
I got a hardcore mama with a hot hoochie coo  
Make my wheels start spinnin' like a formula two  
I got one for the money  
Two for the show  
Three for my honey  
And four to let you know that I  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Cheesecake maybe if I take another bite  
I'm a real fat city I'm an aero delight  
Threw out my pipe and my alcoline  
Got a squeaky clean body and a dirty mind  
I'm a real fine dancer I'll be cutting rug  
Got my brand new baby she's my brand new drug
