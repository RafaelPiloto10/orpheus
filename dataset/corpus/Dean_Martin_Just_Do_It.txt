In the movie "Bells Are Ringing"  
You gotta do you gotta do it gotta do it all alone  
No one else will do it for you you're on your own  
Do it  
It may be love or war or mopping up the floor but just do it  
Don't send a friend who's true to pitch your woo for you or you'll rue it  
Do it yourself  
Don't fake it  
If you're a fake you won't make it  
Wait for your break and then take it  
For time and tide they wait for no man go go go man  
Do it  
To prove a point at hand just look at old Miles Standish who blew it  
He said John Alden will you go ask Priscilla to do it  
Miles got the heave ho  
Man  
Priscilla said that Miles is gone speak for yourself John  
He blew it so do it do it do it yourself
