Rainbow country, rainbow country  
Rainbow country, rainbow country  
Rainbow country, rainbow country  
Hey lovely people you sure look good to me  
I won't abuse you, what to be got to be  
A feel like dancing, feel like jumping  
Feel like dancing, a feel like jumping  
Rainbow country, rainbow country  
Rainbow country, rainbow country  
Na nan-na na nan-na na  
Na nan-na na nan-na na  
Through the road is rocky it sure feels good to me  
Yes if I'm lucky together we'll always be  
The zion is a...., the zion is arising  
The zion is arising, the zion is arising  
The zion is arising, the zion is arising  
The zion is arising, the zion is arising  
The zion is arising  
Hey Mr. Music you sure feel good to me  
I can't refuse it, what to be have to be  
Hey Mr. Music, you sure feel good to me  
Hey I'll never refuse it, love, love it badly  
Rainbow country, rainbow country  
Rainbow country, rainbow country  
Na nan-na na nan-na na  
Na nan-na na nan-na na  
We got our home, where? The promised land  
Feel like home, can you overstand  
We got our home, the promise land  
Feel like home, you ----
