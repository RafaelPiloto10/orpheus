There's no need to find a reason for your dreams  
for there is always more to dreaming than there seems to be.  
And I'll be thankful if through out my life you dream of me.  
It's all that I could ask for while I live.  
A dream is such a lovely gift to give.  
Ah, da, da.  
  
Your fragile beauty caught me in its web.  
And I am held by every silver strand of love you spin.  
Here in a swirl of sleeping circles all my dreams begin.  
Dreams that somehow always end with you.  
You're the one that makes my dreams come true.  
  
Sleep is lovely when you sleep next to me.  
And while you're dreaming let your thoughts all run free.  
  
But if I could understand what makes you free,  
then I would capture you and hold you for eternity.  
But I'm afraid that would destroy the love you feel for me.  
And loving you is how it has to be.  
Reasons don't mean anything to me.  
Loving you is how it has to be.  
Reasons don't mean anything to me....
