I'll tell you from the start  
He's gonna break your heart  
You can't stop the lover boy  
You can't stop the lover boy  
  
He's gonna tell you lies  
But you won't realize  
Because you can't stop the lover boy  
You can't stop the lover boy  
  
He's got a thing in his head  
It's from a book he's read  
It's got a funny title,  
It tells you how to be vital  
  
He took a lot of time  
Over every line  
Because it's guaranteed  
To satisfy  
  
He's gonna knock 'em dead  
The boy's got that book read  
You can't stop the lover boy  
You can't stop the lover boy  
  
Right from the clothes he wears  
The way he combs his hair  
You can't stop him now, because he knows all the tricks  
He used to have a problem but he got it fixed  
  
He took a small apartment  
Above a shoe department  
And he could see from his window  
All the lights in the street glow  
  
There's a club on the corner  
And tonight he will go there  
To find a new affair  
So all you ladies beware  
  
He's got to have a good time in the city  
He's got to have a good time every night  
He's gonna love 'em and leave 'em, cheat and decieve 'em  
He's gonna show 'em who's wrong and who's right
