He looks up from second base  
Dad's up in the stands  
He saw the hit, the run, the slide  
There ain't no bigger fan  
  
In the parking lot after the game  
He said "Dad I thought you had a plane to catch?"  
He smiled and said "Yeah son I did"  
  
But life's not the breath you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Ain't what its all about  
You just might miss the point  
Trying to win the race  
Life's not the breaths you take  
But the moments that take your breath away  
  
Fast forward fifteen years  
And a thousand miles away  
Boys built a life, he's got a wife  
And a baby due today  
He hears a voice saying "I made it son"  
Says "I told you Dad, you didn't have to come"  
He smiles and says "Yeah I know you did"  
  
But life's not the breath you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Ain't what its all about  
You just might miss the point  
Trying to win the race  
Life's not the breathes you take  
But the moments that take your breath away  
  
Just like it took my breath away when she was born  
Just like it took my breath away when Dad took his last that morn  
  
Life's not the breathes you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Ain't what it's all about  
You just might miss the point  
If you don't slow down the pace  
Life's not the breathes you take  
But the moments that take your breath away
