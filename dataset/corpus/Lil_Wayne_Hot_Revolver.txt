Young Mullah, baby  
Hmm, Young Mullah, baby  
  
She's askin' do you have the time  
To listen to me whine  
She's askin' who's on the other line?  
You diss' me every time  
  
I tell her, baby I'm a star  
Shit, I'm above the stars  
And now I done got so high  
I did forgotten who you are  
  
Uh huh, oh wow oh wow  
Uh huh, oh wow oh wow  
Uh huh, oh wow oh wow  
Uh huh, oh wow oh wow  
  
I tell her I'm in love with you  
But I can't be with you  
Tomorrow I'll be back  
Up on the first flight  
Right up out of town  
  
Hop back in my spaceship  
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off  
'Cause I just come to take it  
Then you know I gotta take off  
But I'mma be here next week  
So call your company and take off  
  
And she say "Wayne you ain't shit,  
You got me all impatient"  
Cry me a river  
I can hear my conscience while I sail off  
  
Boy you got a problem  
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself  
You're like a hot revolver  
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself  
And Tunechi's gon' find someone to love  
And you go by yourself, so all alone  
  
One minute she love me,  
The next minute she hate me  
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted  
She say she, pray she, have Weezy F's baby  
And I be having seizures  
But she say she can't shake me  
And my homies say she's cuter than my other bitches  
And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom-fitted  
I swear I like her more than she think I do  
Girl, when I think of you  
My dick just start to jumpin' like a fucking kangaroo  
I suck and fuck and finger you  
But you want me to cling to you  
And I ain't asking you to change  
Cause I know I can't jingle you  
I got my ways  
And you have your days  
And we gave it our best shot  
But I just got grazed  
I'm sorry  
  
Boy you got a problem  
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself  
You're like a hot revolver  
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself  
And Tunechi's gon' find someone to love  
And you go by yourself, so all alone
