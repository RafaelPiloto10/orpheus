First you meet her on the street and then you see her in your sleep  
Well, it's so easy to fall in love  
You'll find her love is good and true that she's the only girl for you  
Well, it's so easy to fall in love.  
  
But don't forget it takes both, two to make love that's good and true  
And then you'll find she loves you too and there's nothing left to do  
Buy diamond rings and make some plans to go and see the preacher man  
Well, it's so easy to fall in love.
