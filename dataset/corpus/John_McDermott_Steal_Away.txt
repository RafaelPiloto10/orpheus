Steal away let's steal away  
No reason left to stay  
For me and you  
Let's start a-new  
And darling steal away  
  
Steal away and chase some dreams  
And hope they never find us  
The dreary days  
The empty nights  
We'll leave them all behind us  
  
(Chorus)  
We'll leave behind the city streets  
The gloom and desolation  
The rain the cold  
Just growing old  
God knows it's a hard old station  
  
(Chorus)  
We'll leave with just a memory  
And make a new beginning  
We have to choose  
To win or lose  
And it's time we started winning  
  
(Chorus Repeat)
