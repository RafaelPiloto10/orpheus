anti choice  
anti girl  
I am the anti flag unfurled  
anti white and anti man  
I got the anti future plan  
anti fascist  
anti mod  
I am the anti music god  
anti sober  
anti whore  
there will never be enough of anti more  
I can't believe in the things  
that don't believe in me  
now it's your turn to see misanthropy  
anti people now you've gone too far  
here's your antichrist superstar  
anti money  
anti hate  
anti things I fucked and ate  
anti cop  
anti fun  
here is my anti-president gun  
anti Satan  
anti black  
anti world is on my back  
anti gay and anti dope  
I am the faggot anti-pope  
anti peace  
anti life  
anti husband, anti wife  
anti song and anti me  
I don't deserve a chance to be
