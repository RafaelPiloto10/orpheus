Deep within my heart lies a melody,  
A song of old San Antone.  
Where in dreams I live with a memory,  
Beneath the stars, all alone.  
  
Well it was there I found, beside the Alamo,  
Enchantments strange as the blue up above.  
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know,  
Still hears my broken song of love.  
  
Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart,  
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone.  
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart,  
Speak once again of my love, my own.  
  
Broken song, empty words I know,  
Still live in my heart all alone.  
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo,  
And rose, my rose of San Antone.  
  
Broken song, empty words I know,  
Still live in my heart all alone.  
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo.  
And rose, my rose of San Antone.  
  
And rose, my rose of San Antone.  
And rose, my rose of San Antone.
