People need their reasons  
Reasons to live and reasons to die  
Just something to believe in  
Whatever it takes to get through the night  
When the road just leads to nowhere  
And your faith can't follow through  
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you  
  
Black is black and white is white  
And the blues are sometimes gray  
When you hurt and you don't know why  
And your tears won't go away  
There's a rainbow out there somewhere  
And one thing is always true  
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, when hope seems thin and your chances are few  
I'll be there for you, I'll share the pain and be someone to hold  
And there's so much more I can do, I'll be there for you  
  
We could talk forever  
There's reasons to stay and reasons to go  
But while we're here together  
I might as well make my intentions known  
There's a light that shines in my window  
It's a place you can run back to  
And I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you  
  
I'll be there for you, when hope seems thin and your chances are few  
I'll be there for you, when the outside world turns your inside cold  
And no one will tell you the truth, I'll be there for you  
  
And if the day should come in this lifetime (I will be there)  
I hope one mornin' you'll wake up to find  
Anyone with half a heart could see, we might cross this great divide  
  
When the road just leads to nowhere  
And faith can't follow through  
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you  
  
I'll be there for you, when hope seems thin and your chances are few  
I'll be there for you, I'll share the pain and be someone to hold  
There's so much more I can do, so much more  
Baby I'll be there for you, yes I will, you know that  
I will be there for you, yes I will, I will be there (I'll be there for you)  
I will be there (I'll be there for you)  
(I'll be there for you) Don't you worry baby  
(I'll be there for you) I will, I will
