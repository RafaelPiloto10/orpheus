Come on baby let's kiss and make up  
I don't know why we had to break up  
The way you act is just not right  
I can't sleep a wink at night  
Each time I think of you I, I wake up  
Say you forgive me, let's kiss and make up  
I never thought I'd miss you honey  
Well I was wrong, that's not funny  
If I could only tell you so  
You'd be mine again, I know  
Can't we start again and take up  
Say you forgive me, let's kiss and make up  
  
I can't stand the game we're playin'  
Because of you everyone's sayin'  
I oughta give up and start forgettin'  
But I'm a fool, I'm still regrettin'  
Since the night we had our break-up  
Say you forgive me, let's kiss and make up
