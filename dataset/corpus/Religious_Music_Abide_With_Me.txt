Abide with me, fast falls the eventide  
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide  
When other helpers fail and comfort flee  
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.  
  
Swift to it's close ebbs out life's little day  
Earth's joys grow dim, it's glories pass away  
Change and decay in all around I see  
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.  
  
I need Thy prescence every passing hour  
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power  
Who like Thy Self my guide and stay can be  
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.  
  
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless  
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness  
Where is death's sting? Where grave, Thy victory  
I triumph still if Thou abide with me.  
  
Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes  
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies  
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee  
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
