Reach into your heart when you are near me  
The answer lies at hand  
Throw away all your fears of getting nowhere  
For all your moves are planned  
So don't spend too much time waiting by the door  
For you will never see right thru'  
Just walk right inside and I'll be there  
The answer lies there for you  
  
Come, oh won't you come, someone is calling and no one else will do  
Wake, from the dream in which you are falling  
The answer lies there for you  
So don't spend too much time waiting by the door  
For you will never see right thru'  
Just walk right inside and I am sure the answer lies there for you  
So don't spend too much time waiting by the door  
For you will never see right thru'  
Just walk right inside and I am sure  
The answer lies, the answer lies  
The answer lies, there for you
