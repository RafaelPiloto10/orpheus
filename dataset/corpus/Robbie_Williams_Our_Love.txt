Why Don't You Come And Join Us  
  
You Don't Need Anyone To Know  
That You Exist  
You Don't Want Anyone To Know  
You Can't Resist  
  
All This Time  
All Those Breath  
All This Hanging Around  
All This Hopes  
All This Fears  
All This All This  
  
Our Love Is Better Then Their Love  
We Could Give You More Love  
Just Not Enough Of  
This Thing Called Love, Love  
  
Do You Believe Their Love Will Make  
Everything All Right?  
Do You Believe Stars Disappear  
When It Gets Light?  
  
All This Dreams  
All This Lies  
All That Sleeping Around  
More Receptions  
Empty Rooms  
All This  
All This  
  
Our Love Is Better Then Their Love  
We Can Make You Famous

Aren't We Cruel  
Isn't It All So Cruel  
The Things We Do With Love  
And The Things We Do Without Love  
  
You Don't Need Anyone To Know  
That You Exist  
You Don't Want Anyone To Know  
You Can't Resist  
  
Just Like We Told Ya  
Our Love Is Better Then Their Love  
We Can Make You Famous
