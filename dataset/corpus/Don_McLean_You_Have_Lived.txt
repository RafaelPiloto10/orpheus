You have lived such a gentle life upon this earth  
that I am stunned by your sight.  
If I could give but a token of the love you have,  
then I might not be this lonely tonight.  
  
Let them have their smug and their cool, confined by fashion and peer.  
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere.  
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere.  
  
Oh, there are so few brave one's like you. Need I explain?  
Never wondering what to do, what to venture, what to gain.  
  
And, you have loved, in a total way, from flesh to soul.  
You speak, without coy without pose.  
Your eyes can see that the emperor has lost his clothes.  
And what's more, you'll tell the whole world what he stole.  
  
Let them have their fad and their fix, confined by fashion and peer.  
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere.  
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere.
