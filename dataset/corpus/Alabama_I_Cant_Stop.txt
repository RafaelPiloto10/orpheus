My love is like an automobile  
Out of control, ramming down a hill  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
My love is like a runaway train  
Running over anything in my way  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
Once I get started making love to you  
That's the only thing that I want to do  
Oh, oh, I can't stop  
  
My love is like a house on fire  
You keep me burning with your sweet desire  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop, yeah  
  
I'm gonna love all over and then  
I'm gonna love you all over again  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
Once I get started making love to you  
That's the only thing that I want to do  
Oh, oh, I can't stop  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
I'm gonna love you all over again  
I'm gonna love you all over and then  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you  
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you  
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
