She is benediction  
She is addicted to thee  
She is the root connection  
She is connecting with he  
  
Here I go and I don't know why  
I flow so ceaselessly  
Could it be he's taking over me  
  
I'm dancing barefoot  
Headin' for a spin  
Some strange music draws me in  
It makes me come up like some heroine  
  
She is sublimation  
She is the essence of thee  
She is concentrating on  
He who is chosen by she  
  
Here I go when I don't know why  
I spin so ceaselessly  
Could it be he's taking over me  
  
I'm dancing barefoot  
Headin' for a spin  
Some strange music drags me in  
Makes me come up like some heroine  
  
She is recreation  
She intoxicated by thee  
She has the slow sensation that  
He is levitating with she  
  
Here I go when I don't know why  
I spin so ceaselessly  
'Til I lose my sense of gravity  
  
I'm dancing barefoot  
Heading for a spin  
Some strange music draws me in  
Makes me come up like some heroine  
  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you  
Oh God I fell for you
