[Intro]  
Ayy! This shit  
This shit, this shit  
My life, my life  
Nigga this shit brazy  
Nigga this shit brazy  
This shit, this shit  
This shit brazy  
This shit, this shit  
This shit brazy  
Nigga this shit brazy, oh Lord!  
Nigga this shit brazy  
  
[Verse 1]  
Look at my life  
Been through it all, got bullet wounds twice  
Still don't know where it came from, yikes  
Why everybody want a piece of my pie?  
I, I, gotta keep guns with me  
Shit real, I ain't tryna be pretty  
Paranoia got this Henny in my kidney  
Cause I don't know if they're with me or against me  
They always said this was how it's gon' be  
But me... I ain't wanna believe  
They don't wanna see a nigga with the green  
The reason for the 40 cal with the beam  
The devil's on me, got me trippin'  
I used to party out with Scotty like Pippen  
Now I don't trust niggas, and I stopped invitin' bitches  
Over to the crib, they can't know where I'm livin'  
  
[Hook]  
Shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
This shit, nigga, this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
Oh this shit, this shit  
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
Oh Lord, nigga this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
Oh shit, this shit, this shit  
This shit brazy  
  
[Verse 2]  
Verse two, verse two  
I got too much to spit for verse two  
Just be careful on how you approach dude  
Cause he done already heard about what you wanna do  
Paranoia, paranoia  
Paranoia down in killer California  
What's their motive? What's their motive?  
Shit, I'm the closest with some money that they know of  
Lady problems, family problems  
Homies problems, all this drama  
On my mama, this the type of shit you sweat out in the suana  
Grandma pray for me, devil keep away from me  
Fell out with my day one, that was my ace to me  
Mind blown, somethin' different when I'm on  
All this shit got me in another rhyme zone  
Lately, I've been at home  
I grab the pistol when I answer the door  
  
[Hook]  
Cause this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
This shit, nigga, this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
Oh this shit, this shit  
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
Oh Lord, nigga this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
Oh shit, this shit, this shit  
This shit brazy  
  
[Verse 3]  
I ain't F with this, but I F with this  
Can't complain about it, gotta find out where he gonna master it  
Gotta put cameras all around the crib  
Gotta, gotta wear the vest like a bib  
Got some, got some problems, a whole lot 'em  
So I stay dangerous, Osama  
Nigga say they heard about a million dollars  
So I gotta bulletproof the Impala  
Man I'm 'bout to lose it  
Homies I'm confused with  
Money get involved, it's all bad, they switch too quick  
It's too sick, thought you was realer, my nigga  
Got popped, you ain't do shit  
Thought you was my killer, my nigga  
Oh! Shit get realer, my nigga  
When niggas know you gettin' skrilla, my nigga  
I don't know what's gotten into my nigga  
Close from day one, I was with him, my nigga  
  
[Hook]  
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
This shit, nigga, this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
Oh this shit, this shit  
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
Oh Lord, nigga this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy  
Oh shit, this shit, this shit  
This shit brazy
