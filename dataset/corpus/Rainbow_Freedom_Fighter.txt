You can't control me tell me what to do  
Chained in mediocrity so I can be like you  
I'm not a statue not part of a machine  
I'm sick and tired of the whole routine  
Calculate your future, computerize your past  
Instant replay if it's gone too fast  
Take away my freedom, take away my home  
I'm only human but it might no show  
I'm not made of stone  
  
I'm a freedom fighter I got something to say  
I'm a freedom fighter get out of my way  
Hide behind your politics, hide behind your rules  
Tell me I'm a man but you treat me like a fool  
It's the same old story with a different name  
You give us all a number and nothing changes  
Out in the winter of a world upon it's knees  
Everyone is watching but no-one sees  
You can't take my freedom you know it is my right  
If you try and stop me I'm gonna fight  
With all of my might  
  
I'm a freedom fighter and I'm taking command  
I'm a freedom fighter and I'm making a stand  
  
Fighting for breath as the world gathers speed  
Time's running out for the things that I need  
  
I'm a freedom fighter I gotta make a stand  
I'm a freedom fighter, yeah That's what I am  
I'm a freedom fighter I can't take it no more  
I'm a freedom fighter no no more  
I'm a freedom fighter but I'm not afraid  
I'm a freedom fighter get out of my way
