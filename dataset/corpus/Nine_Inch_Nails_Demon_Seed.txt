It keeps growing  
And I can feel it breathe  
I have been trying  
To behave myself  
It keeps growing  
And I can feel it breathe  
I have been trying  
To tolerate you  
  
Well I am reaching the point  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I thought maybe  
I thought this would go away  
But it continues  
The only constant  
Every day  
Stronger  
  
I will use my voice  
And I will use my fist  
To destroy  
Everything I can  
  
Now I know  
What this is all about  
Now I know  
Exactly what I am  
  
These is a seed  
Inside of me  
That makes me
