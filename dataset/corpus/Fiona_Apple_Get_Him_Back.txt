One man, he'd disappoint me  
He'd give me the gouge and he take my glee  
Now every other man I see  
Remind me of the  
One man who disappointed me  
  
Wait 'til I get him back  
He won't have a back to scratch  
Yeah, keep turning that chin  
And you will see my face  
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch  
  
So I say "and on I go"  
To another one who disappoint me so, oh oh  
  
The next one up  
A contemptible snob  
He lived to put things in their place  
He did a commendable job  
He put himself so low  
He can hardly even look me in the face  
  
Wait 'til I get him back  
He won't have a back to scratch  
Yeah, keep turning that chin  
And you will see my face  
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch  
  
Oh, he made my blood just burn  
I flipped so far  
I thought that I would not return  
  
But the last one I had  
Who was getting my hopes up  
I might have been a little fast to dismiss  
I think he let me down when he didn't disappoint me  
He didn't always guess right but he usually got my gist  
  
So wait til I get him back  
I'm gonna bring him home  
And I'll watch him unpack  
He keep turning that chin  
And you will see my face  
Is fixed on the one  
I'm gonna get back  
  
I'm gonna get him back  
I am  
I'm gonna get him back  
I really am  
  
I'm gonna get him back  
I...  
I'm gonna get him back  
I...  
  
I'm gonna get him back  
Gonna get him back...
