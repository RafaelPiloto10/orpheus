From this moment on,  
You for me dear,  
Only two for tea dear,  
From this moment on,  
  
From this happy day,  
No more blue songs,  
Only hoop-de-doo songs,  
From this moment on  
  
You've got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
  
From this moment on  
You and I babe  
We'll be ridin' high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment on.  
  
You've got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
  
From this moment on  
You and I babe  
We'll be ridin' high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment,  
From this moment,  
This very moment,  
This moment on.
