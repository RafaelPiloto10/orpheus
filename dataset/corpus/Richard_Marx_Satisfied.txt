We work our bodies weary to stay alive  
There must be more to living than nine to five  
  
Why should we wait for some better time  
There may not even be a tomorrow  
Ain't no sense in losing your mind  
I'm gonna make it worth the ride  
  
Don't you know, I won't give up until I'm satisfied  
Don't you know, why should I stop until I'm satisfied  
  
Ignore the hesitation, that ties your hands  
Use your imagination, and take a chance  
  
I won't let my moment of truth pass me by  
I've gotta make my move now or never  
And if they turn me loose on this town  
They're gonna have to hold me down  
  
Don't you know, I won't give up until I'm satisfied  
Don't you know, why should I stop until I'm satisfied Yeah  
  
Oh, don't you know, ain't gonna stop until we're satisfied  
Don't you know, we shouldn't stop until we're satisfied  
  
Don't you know, ain't gonna stop until I'm satisfied  
Don't you know, we won't give up until we're satisfied
