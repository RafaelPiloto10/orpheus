I know where you go when you want to fall  
Why do you want to be broken?  
I know where you go when you want to fall  
Yes your friends they tell me everything  
  
Yes I know where you go  
Yes I know what you do  
Yes I know the awful things you say and who you say them to  
Yes I know where you go  
Yes I know what you do  
  
I know how you feel, you get crazy inside  
They say it runs in the family  
I know just how you feel when you get crazy inside  
Your mom she said that you are just like me  
  
I can see it in your eyes  
I can see your shaky hands  
Yes I think you think I'm stupid  
You don't think I understand  
Yes I see you and I see myself when I was a younger man  
  
When you were a child  
You were happy and free  
You were my reason to live  
I would die when you smiled at me  
  
I can still see you  
I remember you painting  
Sunflowers in your room  
  
I know where you go when you want to fall  
Hey don't you want to be happy?  
I know where you go when you want to fall  
Your useless friends, they tell me everything  
  
Everything  
I see you run around in circles  
I see you digging your own hole  
I see you fight the fights you just can't win  
I see you losing self control  
What it does to me deep down inside I hope you will never know  
  
When you were a child  
You were happy and free  
You were my reason to live  
I would die when you smiled at me  
  
I can still see you  
Painting flowers on the wall  
I remember you happy  
I remember it all  
All I want to remember  
Pretty pictures on the wall  
I remember you happy  
I remember it all  
All I want to remember  
Sunflowers in your room
