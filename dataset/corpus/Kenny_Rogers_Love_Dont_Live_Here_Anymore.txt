This is the house that love built  
Memories of you, built in each wall  
One tender seed still haunt my dreams  
Thought I just heard your voice in the hall  
The mirrors reflect all the heartache I feel  
Smiling photographs, don't seem real  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Nothing's been moved, but everything's changed  
Each chair is in place, just my life's rearranged  
The wind cries your name through each window and door  
Love don't live here, love don't live here anymore  
  
The fire alight still glows a pale blue  
The mantle is cruel holding pictures of you  
Your scent lingers there, in the bed that we shared  
The last plant I sent is in bloom  
These rooms are unkind to play tricks on my mind  
I can see how you've lived without me  
  
[Chorus: ]
