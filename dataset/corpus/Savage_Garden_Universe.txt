Well I'd like to take you as I find you  
Imagine our clothes are on the floor  
Feel my caress so soft and gentle  
So delicate you cry for more  
But you know baby  
You know baby does it right  
And you know baby does it right  
  
Universe inside of your heart  
You gotta let me know  
So you can be free baby  
You wanted it so much  
And now that it's over  
You don't know what you want  
  
Put time in a capsule  
Two minds consensual  
Entwined to perfection  
If we could  
  
Cuddle up close  
Lay on my chest now  
Listen my heart beats coming down  
If you get tired, you close your eyes now  
When you wake up I won't be found  
Cause I know baby  
I know you're the nervous kind  
With so much going on in your mind  
  
Universe inside of your heart  
You gotta let me know  
So you can be free baby  
You wanted it so much,  
And now that it's over  
You don't know what you want  
  
But let me tell you that, this time,  
I'm gonna make you mine  
(I won't let you go)  
Cause I know, this time  
I'm gonna make sure I look out for me  
  
Cause you know baby  
Well you know baby does it right  
And you know baby does it right  
You will only end up lost in loneliness  
And wake up with the words already  
On your lips  
So I'll let you go, baby, oh baby  
So I'll let you go  
  
Universe inside of your heart  
You gotta let me know  
So you can be free baby  
You wanted it so much,  
And now that it's over  
You don't know what you want
