Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
The wildest short around is my cherry, cherry coupe  
It's the sharpest thing in town and the envy of my group  
It's one of its kind and it really looks good  
Chopped nose and deck with louvers on the hood  
  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
(my cherry coupe beats 'em up coming off the line)  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
(and she really gets sparks when she starts to whine)  
  
Chrome reversed rims with whitewall slicks  
And it turns a quarter mile in one oh six  
Door handles are off but you know i'll never miss 'em  
They open when i want with the "cellunoid" system

Go cherry, cherry coupe now

Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
(and she really gets sparks when she starts to whine)  
  
My coupe's tuck and roll underneath the hood  
And the rugs, seats, and panels now are looking good  
When i go looking for something to do  
She's got enough room now to barely seat two  
  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now  
Go cherry, cherry coupe now
