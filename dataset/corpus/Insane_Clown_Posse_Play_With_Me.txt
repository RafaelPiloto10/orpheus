(Children laughing, Toy cranks up)  
  
Hey (x54)  
  
(1st Verse- Violent J)  
Every year it's more of us and all we do is fill the box  
You might play with me at first, a couple days, a week at tops  
Just like your Atomic Supersonic Retro Plasma Car  
We will all get tossed inside just like the piece of shit we are  
I will be your fantasy imaginary special friend  
I can fill you ?? with you no need to talk to them  
But instead you toss me in the box, leave me to rott away  
Hoping you'll pick me again someday...hey, hey  
  
(Chorus- Violent J)  
Why don't you come play with me and take me to the other side[take me to the  
other side]  
Lost under Ann Raggedy it's lonely when your locked in side [It can be so  
lonley] (x2)  
  
(2nd Verse- Violent J)  
I will sit and listen to your bibble babble jibber talk  
But when you go in tonight you'll leave me out here on the walk  
You'll ignore your little friend or trade me for something instead  
Please come get your doggie, don't let him chew up my fucking leg  
All your mom and daddy do is work and fight, that's all they do!  
I can understand the way you feel because I feel it to  
But you'll leave me in the box and I can barley hear you play  
Lost umong the toys of yesterday, hey[hey]hey[hey]hey  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Shaggy2Dope)  
Boys and girls, fuck that old crusty shit  
Come down and get your brand new, ha, shiny  
slimy, atomic shithead  
  
[Super, duper!]  
[Right]  
[S-s-s-s-sonic, sonic]  
[Right]  
  
(3rd Verse- Violent J)  
I can see you near the bed when I look through this tiny crack  
You become much older now and I don't see you turning back  
Seven years in darkness I can only hope my wish comes true  
That one day I'll get you in my hands...AND I'LL PLAY WITH YOU!!  
  
(Chorus)
