There he was that little man, sitting by the altar... Black Devil  
Carved in stone so dark and could... Black Devil  
Help me, Help me, cause I don't know what's going on  
It was the early morning of the seventh day  
  
I had been making love to Angel in every single way  
The sun was peeking through a window high above  
That's when I saw her kiss the little devil on his head  
Black Devil... if you could only speak... Black Devil  
  
What do you see when you're looking at me?  
There he was that little man, fingers spread like claws... Black Devil  
I wonder what it is he knows... Black Devil  
Help me, help me, cause I don't know what's going on  
  
Black Devil... if you could only speak...  
Black Devil What do you see when you're looking at me?  
When I look around, this church on holy ground  
There are things within, that should have never been  
  
Why two pulpits in a place like this?  
One facing to the East, the other to the West  
One of th guilded canopies have gargoyles in the sun  
And on the other canopy I see demons having fun  
  
Black Devil... if you could only speak... Black Devil  
What do you see when you're looking at me?  
Black Devil always near, why don't you want me here?  
I can feel your hate in my soul, I wonder what it is you know  
  
Black Devil... what's going on?
