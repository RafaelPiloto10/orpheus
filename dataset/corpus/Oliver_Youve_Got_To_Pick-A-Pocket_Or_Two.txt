[Fagin (spoken)]  
You see, Oliver...  
  
[sung] In this life, one thing counts  
In the bank, large amounts  
I'm afraid these don't grow on trees,  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys,  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Large amounts don't grow on trees.  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin (spoken)]  
Let's show Oliver how it's done, shall we, my dears?  
  
[sung] Why should we break our backs  
Stupidly paying tax?  
Better get some untaxed income  
Better to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Why should we all break our backs?  
Better pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin (spoken)]  
Who says crime doesn't pay?  
  
[sung] Robin Hood, what a crook!  
Gave away, what he took.  
Charity's fine, subscribe to mine.  
Get out and pick-a-pocket or two  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Robin Hood was far too good  
He had to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin]  
Take a tip from Bill Sikes  
He can whip what he likes.  
I recall, he started small  
He had to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
We can be like old Bill Sikes  
If we pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin (spoken)]  
Stop thief!  
  
Dear old gent passing by  
Something nice takes his eye  
Everything's clear, attack the rear  
Get in and pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Have no fear, attack the rear  
Get in and pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin]  
When I see someone rich,  
Both my thumbs start to itch  
Only to find some peace of mind  
We have to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Just to find some peace of mind  
  
[Fagin and boys]  
We have to pick-a-pocket or two!
