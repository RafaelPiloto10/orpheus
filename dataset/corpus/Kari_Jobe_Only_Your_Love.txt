Your love is strong and mighty  
Its jealousy unyielding  
It burns for me like a fire untamed  
Your love is all consuming  
You never stop pursuing  
Nothing I could face could take it away  
  
Oh, oh, oh Your love  
Oh, oh oh  
  
Your love is like no other  
Nothing else satisfies  
It flows through the deepest parts  
It rests on the mountain high  
Your love is overwhelming  
Brought me to life again  
Your love, it lasts forever  
In You there'll be no end  
  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
  
Nothing can separate us  
Many trials can't hide Your love  
No sorrow can wash it away  
  
Oh, oh, oh Your love  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Your love is like no other  
Nothing else satisfies  
It flows through the deepest parts  
It rests on the mountains high  
Your love is overwhelming  
Brought me to life again  
Your love, it lasts forever  
In You there'll be no end  
  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
  
How deep  
How wide  
How long  
How high (repeat)  
  
Your love is like no other  
Nothing else satisfies  
It flows through the deepest parts  
It rests on the mountains high  
Your love is overwhelming  
Brought me to life again  
Your love, it lasts forever  
In You there'll be no end (repeat)  
  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love
