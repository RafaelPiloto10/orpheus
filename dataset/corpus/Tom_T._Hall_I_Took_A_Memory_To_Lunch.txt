Today the weather was so pretty  
At noon I went out for a stroll  
I walked and did some window shopping  
And met someone I used to know  
  
The years had been kind to her beauty  
When I first saw her my heart jumped  
Tonight if I seem disenchanted  
I took a memory to lunch  
  
We sat and talked about the old days  
With misty teardrops in our eyes  
And reconfirmed an old suspicion  
The past grows old but never dies  
  
The charm that draws two hearts together  
By four o' clock was just too much  
The days and years we had between us  
Were down to just two coffee cups  
  
You can't relive life in an hour  
The afternoon kept wearing on  
I'm sorry that I'm late for dinner  
I took a memory to lunch
