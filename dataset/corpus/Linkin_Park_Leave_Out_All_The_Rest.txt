I dreamed I was missing  
You were so scared  
But no one would listen  
Cause no one else cared  
After my dreaming  
I woke with this fear  
What am I leaving  
When I'm done here?  
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
When my time comes  
Forget the wrong that I've done  
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed  
And don't resent me  
And when you're feeling empty  
Keep me in your memory  
Leave out all the rest  
Leave out all the rest  
  
Don't be afraid  
I've taken my beating  
I've shed but I'm me  
I'm strong on the surface  
Not all the way through  
I've never been perfect  
But neither have you  
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Forgetting  
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well  
Pretending  
Someone else can come and save me from myself  
I can't be who you are  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Forgetting  
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well  
Pretending  
Someone else can come and save me from myself  
I can't be who you are  
I can't be who you are
