One, two, three  
If you close the door  
The night could last forever  
Leave the sunshine out  
And say hello to never  
  
All the people are dancing  
And they're having such fun  
I wish it could happen to me  
  
But if you close the door  
I'd never have to see the day again  
  
If you close the door  
The night could last forever  
Leave the wine-glass out  
And drink a toast to never  
  
Oh, someday I know  
Someone will look into my eyes  
And say hello  
You're my very special one  
  
But if you close the door  
I'd never have to see the day again  
  
Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars  
And the people on subways and trains  
Looking gray in the rain,  
As they stand disarrayed  
Oh, but people look well in the dark  
  
And if you close the door  
The night could last forever  
Leave the sunshine out  
And say hello to never  
  
All the people are dancing  
And they're having such fun  
I wish it could happen to me  
  
Cause if you close the door  
I'd never have to see the day again  
I'd never have to see the day again,  
Once more  
I'd never have to see the day again
