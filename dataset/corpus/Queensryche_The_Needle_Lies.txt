"I've had enough and I want out!"  
"You can't walk away now."  
  
I looked back once  
And all I saw was his face  
Smiling, the needle crying  
Walking out of his room  
With mirrors, afraid I heard him scream  
You'll never get away  
  
Cold and shaking  
I crawled down alleys to try  
And scrape away the tracks that marked me  
Slammed my face into walls of concrete  
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall  
  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries  
Cries your name  
  
Wet and raving  
The needle keeps calling me back  
To bloody my hands forever  
Carved my cure with the blade  
That left me in scars  
Now every time I'm weak  
Words scream from my arm  
  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries,  
Cries your name  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries,  
Cries your name
