Seems to me that you're always nere  
Close enough so I know when you're here  
Just when I think I got to know you-you disappear  
And so I walk along building all my dreams  
I've every hope as I plan all my schemes  
And just when I think I've found the right one you disappear  
  
But still I'm (here) here waiting for you  
I'm (here) here still holding on  
I'm (here) here waiting for you baby  
(here) but it won't be too long  
Cause I'm planning a song that will tell you  
Oh why I'm here  
  
I've even wished on a falling star  
I've carried moonbeams home in a jar  
Only one thing wrong  
You're where you belong  
And that's too far  
If only there was some way of reaching you  
Holding you cause I'm so doggone blue  
Only one thing I really want to do  
Is sing to you  
That's why I'm (here) here waiting for you  
I'm (here) here still holding on  
I'm (here) here waiting-baby I'm  
(here) but it won't be too long  
Cause I'm planning a song that will tell you  
Oh why I'm (here) here I'm waiting for you baby  
(here) here and I'm still holding on  
I'm planning a song that will tell you  
Oh why I'm here  
  
(oh wanna tell you now)  
-oh wanna tell you, tell you tell you oh  
-gotta tell you tell you it's true that I'm blue doggone it  
-ah I'm here and I'm blue  
-gotta tell you now gotta tell you now  
That I'm here and it's true and I'm blue oh oh  
-gotta tell you now gotta keep on telling you I'm blue  
-keep on keep on keep on telling you I'm here and I'm blue
