  
Darlin' don't you know I've had enough  
Wasting all my time  
Darlin' put it on the line  
Cos I heard you lying time and time again  
Ooh and I don't want to any more  
This is where our loving has to end  
Darlin' now you know the score  
So goodbye Baby  
  
Hey Mr Heartache how much can you fake  
How many hearts break before you get enough  
Hey Mr Heartache you don't give you just take  
I hope for your sake you don't turn your back on love  
  
Darlin' don't know what you're looking for  
But I'm not waiting around to see  
Darlin' can't take any more  
I still love you but I'm gonna set you free  
Ooh that's the way it's got to be  
Cos I know I can't change you anyway  
Darlin' there's nothing left to say  
But goodbye baby  
  
Hey Mr Heartache how much can you fake  
How many hearts break before you get enough  
Hey Mr Heartache you don't give you just take  
I hope for your sake you don't turn your back on love  
  
Listen to me, so listen to me  
Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Cos I was stupid to believe  
You could give me what I need  
You use anyone you can  
Yet you call yourself a man  
We'll seen through your disguise  
And it's all that I despise  
Now you've just run out of time  
Go before I change my mind  
  
Hey Mr Heartache, cos I love you baby  
Hey Mr Heartache I still love you baby  
  
I still love you but I'm gonna set you free  
Ooh that's the way it's got to be  
Cos I know I can't change you anyway  
Darlin' there's nothing left to say  
But goodbye baby  
  
Junior:You don't know what I'm going through  
You got me wrong, oh so wrong  
Think you've sown me up  
But you're so wrong  
I want you girl, all the time  
Come on now  
You don't know what I'm going through, baby
