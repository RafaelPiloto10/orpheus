Verse 1  
There were times in my life  
That I let you down  
Times in my life  
I thought you couldn't be found  
I needed to feel you again  
You came touched me  
And gave me peace within  
  
Chorus  
I love you  
I praise You  
I thank you for all that you've done in my life  
I'm here today  
Out of mercy and grace  
I love You  
With all of my life  
  
Verse 2  
Oh, I look back and I see  
Your blessings on me (Your blessings on me)  
How time after time  
You keep anointing me  
I still need to know that you care  
I know there's nothing that can quite compare  
  
Bridge  
Where would I be  
Without grace and mercy  
Each and every day
