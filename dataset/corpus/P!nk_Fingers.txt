I'm alone now  
Staring at the cieling  
(uh, uh)  
I'm kina bored now  
I can't sleep  
(I can't sleep, uh, uh)  
  
And you only can make my life complete  
(uh, uh. Ah, i)  
And when you come you slip into a dream  
(uh, uh. Ah, i)  
  
When it's late at night and you're fast asleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
I press record, I become a fiend  
While no one else is watching  
I let my fingers do the walking  
  
(sth, mmm)  
  
I'm starving (sth)  
For some attention  
I'm begging, pleading, bleeding  
For a suggestion  
(uh, uh, uh)  
  
I bite my tongue because I wanna scream  
(uh, uh. Ah, i)  
I'm almost there then you turn and look at me  
(uh, uh. Ah, ie)  
  
When it's late at night and you're fast asleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
I press record I become a fiend  
  
While no one else is watching  
(I let my fingers do the walking)  
  
Rewind and you will see  
(You will see)  
While in the morning i'm happy  
(I'm happy)  
Right there on the tv screen  
(On the tv)  
(Me vengo, me vengo)  
  
I'm restless  
You need some caffeine  
(ah, ha, ha, ha)  
I'm wasted  
If you could only see  
(Only see)  
  
Cuz I need more than you are gonna give  
(uh, uh. Ah, i)  
  
When it's late at night and you're fast a sleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
(ahhhhhh)!  
I press record, I become a fiend  
While no one else is watching  
(no, no, no no)  
  
When it's late at night and you're fast asleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
(My fingers do the walking)  
I press record I become a fiend  
While no one else is watching  
(No one else is watching)  
(I let my fingers do the walking)  
  
(ah, ah, ah, ah, ah uh, uh, uh huh
