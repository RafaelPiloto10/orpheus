I ain't superstitious,  
When a black cat crosses my path.  
And, I ain't superstitious,  
As I break the looking glass.  
Ain't afraid of no demons,  
Don't make me laugh!  
I ain't superstitious,  
Under the ladder I go.  
I ain't superstitious,  
It's all bullshit, don't you know!  
Ain't afraid of the shadows,  
I like the dark anyway, and that's a fact!  
Superstitious  
  
I ain't superstitious,  
No such thing as bad luck.  
I ain't superstitious,  
I couldn't really give a fuck.  
Take your stupid superstitions,  
And find some other paranoidal,  
Chickenshit, sissy, worm, and, tell it to him.  
Superstitious
