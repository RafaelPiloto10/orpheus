It's not the right time to be sober now the idiots have taken over  
Spreading like a social cancer is there an answer  
  
Mensa membership conceding, tell me why (and how) are all the stupid people
breeding  
Watson, it's really elementary, the Industrial Revolution has flipped a bitch
on evolution  
The benevolent and wise are being thwarted, ostracized, what a bummer  
The world keeps getting dumber insensitivity is standard, and faith is being
fancied over reason  
  
Darwin's rolling over in his coffin, 'cause the fittest are surviving much
less often  
Now everything seems to be reversing, and it's worsening  
Someone flopped a steamer in the gene pool  
Now angry mob mentality is no longer the exception it's the rule  
  
And I'm starting to feel a lot like Charlton Heston, stranded on a primate
planet  
Apes and orangutans that ran it to the ground, were generals and the armies
who obeyed them  
Followers following fables, philosophies that enable them to rule without
regard  
It sounds all too familiar.  
  
There's no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated  
Political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred  
Majority rule don't work in mental institutions  
Sometimes the smallest softest voice carries the grand biggest solutions  
  
What are we left with, a nation of god fearing pregnant nationalists  
Who feel it's their duty to populate the homeland  
Pass on traditions, how to get ahead religions, and prosperity via simpleton
culture  
  
The idiots are taking over
