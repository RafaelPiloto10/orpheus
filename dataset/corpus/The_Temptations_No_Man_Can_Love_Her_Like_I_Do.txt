No man can love her like I do!  
Ah, he can buy her diamonds, he can buy her pearls,  
He can send her on a trip, all around this world.  
  
He can buy her anything her little heart desires  
But he don't know how to set that little girl's soul on fire  
Even though he drives a big fine cadillac car,  
And he keeps her dressed up (ah!) like a movie star.  
  
Anything she asks of him, his money can buy  
But when it comes down to love, she gives me a try!  
No man can love her like I do  
Tell the truth, no man can love her like I do,  
No man can love her like I do  
Even though I don't have one thin dime,  
Every time I call her, you know she's right on time.  
  
No man can love her like I do  
Ain't no man in this land who can love her like I do!  
No man can love her like I do!
