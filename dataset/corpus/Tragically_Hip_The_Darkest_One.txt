Come in, come in, come in, come in  
From under these darling skies come in  
It's warm and it's safe here and almost harkening  
Off to a time and place now lost on our imagination  
  
Where you don't complain, but you still do  
And you don't explain if you want to explain  
What you believe you say without shame, 'I just do'  
To say what you mean you don't mean what you say  
Or you do  
  
Where the wild are strong (Wild are strong)  
And the strong are the darkest ones (The strong are the darkest ones)  
And you're the darkest one  
  
Come in, come in, come in, come in  
From thin and wicked prairie winds, come in  
It's warm and it's safe here and almost heartening  
Here in a time and place not lost on our imagination  
  
Where you don't explain, but you still do  
And you can complain if you want to complain  
Where you're real instrumental or supple  
Or sexy as hell  
Where you say 'I believe' or say without shame  
'I can't tell'  
  
Where the wild are strong (Wild are strong)  
And the strong are the darkest ones (The strong are the darkest ones)  
And you're the darkest one  
And you're the darkest one  
And if that's what you want  
Oh then you're the darkest one
