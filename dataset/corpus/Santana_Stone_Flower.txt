What's that sound I hear coming from the ground  
That' going 'round and 'round I can feel it pull me down  
On my knees tears of joy have come to me  
As the flower sounds made it plain to see  
  
That this world is a perfect place to live  
There is a warm soft wind blowing 'round me just to give  
All the leaves such a haunting melody  
That forever will be a part of me  
  
Just like a ship out on the sea  
Floating alone no one around me or beyond me  
The sun is on me  
  
Then suddenly I felt a kiss out of the breeze  
That did caress me and possess me  
Oh it astounds me  
  
All around there's a feeling in the air  
That with the grace of time we'll be getting closer there  
But day by day I can see they walk away  
And I wonder, Lord will they ever know  
  
That this world is a perfect place to live?  
Just look into your heart, find the love that's there to give  
Realize that the secret is to share
