Some boys with warm beds and cold, cold hearts  
Can make you feel nothing at all  
They'll never remember and they'll never mind  
If you're counting the cracks in the wall  
They're quick and they're greedy  
They never feel guilty  
They don't know the meaning of hurt  
The boots just go back on  
The socks that had stayed on  
The next time they see you  
They treat you like dirt  
The next time they treat you like dirt  
Now don't come the cowboy with me sonny jim  
I know lots of those and you're not one of them  
There's a light in your eyes tells me somebody's in  
And you won't come the cowboy with me  
Don't be too rough on my cold, cold heart  
It's all I've got left to me now  
I fell out of favour with heaven somewhere  
And I'm here for the hell of it now  
Some girls play cowboys  
And some boys play harder to get  
But they're got just the same  
They smile and say cheese  
They're so eager to please  
But they'll never remember your name  
The names and the places all change  
But don't come the cowboy with me sonny jim  
I know lots of those and you're not one of them  
There's a light in your eyes tells me somebody's in  
And you won't come the cowboy with me  
Did somebody tell you I'm lonely as hell?  
I didn't expect you to know me so well  
If I learned a lesson it's how to bounce back again  
Sometimes I bounce off the wall  
And sometimes my head hits the floor  
So don't come the cowboy with me sonny jim  
I know lots of those and you're not one of them  
There's a light in your eyes tells me somebody's in  
And you won't come the cowboy, oh  
Don't come the cowboy with me sonny jim  
I know lots of those and you're not one of them  
There's a light in your eyes tells me somebody's in  
And you won't come the cowboy with me
