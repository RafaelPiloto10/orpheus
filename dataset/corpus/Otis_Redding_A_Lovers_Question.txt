Does she love me, with all her heart  
Should I worry, when we're apart  
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know.  
Does she need me, as she pretends  
Is this a game, well then will I win  
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know  
I'd like to know when she's not with me  
If she's still true to me  
I'd like to know when we're kissing  
Does she feel just what I feel,  
And how am I to know it's really real.  
Oh, tell me where, the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
It's a lover's question I'd like to know.  
I'd like to know when she's not with me  
If she's still true to me  
I'd like to know when we're kissing  
Does she feel just what I feel,  
And how am I to know it's really real.  
Oh, tell me where, the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
It's a lover's question I'd like to know.
