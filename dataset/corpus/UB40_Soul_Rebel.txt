I'm a rebel, soul rebel  
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer  
See the morning sun, on the hillside  
Not living good, yeah  
You better travel wide  
You better travel wide  
Said I'm a living man  
I've got work to do  
If you're not happy, children  
Then you must be blue  
I said, you must be blue  
I'm a rebel, soul rebel  
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer  
I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning time  
soul rebel  
I'm a capturer  
Soul adventurer  
See the morning sun, on the hillside  
Not living good, yeah  
You better travel wide  
You better travel wide  
Said I'm a living man  
I've got work to do  
If you're not happy, children  
Then you must be blue  
I said, you must be blue  
I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning time  
soul rebel  
I'm a capturer  
Soul adventurer  
I'm a rebel, soul rebel  
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
