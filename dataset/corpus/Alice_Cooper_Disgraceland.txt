I want to tell you a story, happened long ago  
About a redneck boy down from Tupelo  
I got the slick black hair, I played a rock guitar  
I liked to shake my hips, man, then i went too far  
  
He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
I had a lot of girls, yeah, I had a lot of guns  
When they found me dead, ow, the whole world was stunned  
Went to the pearly gates, said, "I'm the hippest thing"  
And Peter said "Well son, we already got ourselves a king"  
  
He lived on southern deep-fried spam,  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
He finished his short life sweaty and bloated and stoned  
(A-Hey-Hey)  
He ruled his domain and he died on the throne  
No "Yes-Men", no colonel, he went all alone...  
  
(Hey, man, that looks like me down there on the floor)  
  
I heard the devil cry real loud and clear  
"You were the big man, there, hejust a sideman here  
Well, I know your face, and I've heard your name  
Looks like heaven's loss, gonna be my gain"  
(I've got plans for you, man)  
  
He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
Well, I woke up, right here in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland, thank you, thank you very much
