Someone told me you got to be free  
Someone told me to stand in the rear  
Keep on searchin' for kings in the street  
Keep on cryin' for something that's clear  
You are one more posse to pass in the night  
One more con to conceal  
One more tiger to paint on a stripe  
One more player to deal  
Political poachers push plump packages  
Past pacified places  
Concerned citizens cry crude conduct  
'Cause Captain Command  
Don't do dreams  
Do dreary drivel drive  
Doctor, daddy divine  
Prize shipment tonight, tomorrow tame tempers  
To touch tender time  
You are one more posse to pass in the night  
One more con to conceal  
One more tiger to paint on a stripe  
One more player to deal  
You are one more posse to pass in the night  
One more con to conceal  
One more tiger to paint on a stripe  
One more player to deal  
It takes one more moment of time in your life  
One more light to reveal  
One more place in the sun to turn ripe  
One more kingdom to feel  
You are one more posse to pass in the night  
One more con to conceal  
One more tiger to paint on a stripe  
One more player to deal  
It takes one more moment of time in your life  
One more light to reveal  
One more place in the sun to turn ripe  
One more kingdom to feel
