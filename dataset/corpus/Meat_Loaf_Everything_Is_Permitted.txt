Everything is permitted, everything is allowed  
And all our gods we have outwitted  
We are running with the crowd  
And all the clocks are showing zero  
And all our parents must have fled  
And we just never had no heroes  
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead  
Everything is permitted, there is nothing out of bounds  
There are no limits or no fences  
There is always some way 'round  
And all the compass points are zero  
And all the navigators fled  
And we just never had no heroes  
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead  
  
If everything is permitted, if nothing ever is taboo  
Then there is always something shattered  
When there is something breaking through  
  
And all the clocks are showing zero  
And all our parents must have fled  
And we just never had no heroes  
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead  
  
If everything is permitted, if nothing ever is taboo  
Then there is always something shattered  
When there is something breaking through  
Then there is always something shattered  
When there is something breaking through  
Everything is permitted
