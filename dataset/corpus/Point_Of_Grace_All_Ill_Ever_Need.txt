Some days I'm fragile  
Some days I'm stronger  
Sometimes I just want to run  
But Your tender mercies gently pursue me  
When all is said and done  
  
[Chorus]  
Where else would I go  
Who else could there be  
No one but You, Lord, can see  
Can see all of me, oh  
You opened my eyes  
Oh, how I believe  
In everything You are 'cause You are  
All I'll ever need  
  
My heart's full of questions  
The future's uncertain  
But I'm gonna stand on what's true  
'Cause I have discovered  
A love like no other  
The love I've found in You  
  
[Chorus]
