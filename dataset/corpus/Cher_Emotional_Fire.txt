I can't wait 'til I see you baby  
I can't wait 'til the night comes fallin' down  
I gotta see you again  
And ever if it couldn't be forever  
I'd trade a lifetime for this night together  
Hold on, hold on  
  
My heart is burning with the heat of this  
Emotional fire  
Every time I see you  
I'm on fire, every time we touch  
Can't you feel me burnin' with desire  
Baby feel warm, give me some  
Emotional fire  
Emotional fire  
  
There's a feelin' when I'm here beside you  
Couldn't leave you and I wouldn't try to  
Baby, I'd only need you again  
There ain't nothin' that can break this fever  
The love gets stronger and the passion deeper  
Hold on, hold on  
  
I can't let go 'cause there's no stoppin' this  
Emotional fire  
Every time I see you  
I'm on fire, every time we touch  
Can't you feel me burnin' with desire  
Baby feel warm, give me some  
Emotional fire  
Emotional fire  
  
I can't wait until I see you baby  
I can't wait 'til the night comes fallin'  
Hold on, hold on  
  
My heart is burning with the heat of this  
Emotional fire  
Every time I see you  
I'm on fire, every time we touch  
Can't you feel me burnin' with desire  
Baby feel warm, give me some  
Emotional fire  
Emotional fire  
Emotional fire
