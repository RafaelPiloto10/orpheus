They were married in the old Church yard  
And they promised to be true to each other  
No matter how hard their lives might be  
But like meteors that fell through moments parallel  
They were soon to cross  
And on different plots of earth they both did fall  
Though their lives had really not been hard at all  
  
Chorus:  
  
Oh my what a shame  
No one's to blame  
It just happened that way  
And there's nothing you can say  
When two people say goodbye  
Oh my...  
  
Two brothers, promised they'd return  
When the war that they were fighting was over  
But only one lived to keep his vow  
And the story I was told said he lived to be quite old  
Before time won out  
Someone asked if he knew what they both fought for  
But he could not recall he had ever been to war  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bridge:  
  
For there's nothing you can say when it's over  
And there's nothing you can do when it's done  
There's no battle you can win  
And there's nothing to begin  
That's not begun  
  
On this moment, I recall your face  
And I wonder if you still think about me  
Occasionally I still think of you  
And I watch the river flow and I know I must let go  
But it's oh so hard  
For the waves are all around my small canoe  
I had always hoped this boat could carry two  
  
[Chorus:]
