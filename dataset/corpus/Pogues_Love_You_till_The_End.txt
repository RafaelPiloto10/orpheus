I just want to see you  
When you're all alone  
I just want to catch you if I can  
I just want to be there  
When the morning light explodes  
On your face it radiates  
I can't escape  
I love you 'till the end  
  
I just want to tell you nothing  
You don't want to hear  
All I want is for you to say  
Oh why don't you just take me  
Where I've never been before  
I know you want to hear me  
Catch my breath  
I love you 'till the end  
I love you 'till the end  
  
I just want to be there  
When we're caught in the rain  
I just want to see you laugh, not cry  
I just want to feel you  
When the night puts on it's cloak  
I'm lost for words, don't tell me  
'Cause all I can say  
I love you 'till the end  
  
All I can say  
I love you 'till the end
