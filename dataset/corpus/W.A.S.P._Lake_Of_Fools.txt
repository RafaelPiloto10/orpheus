Fifty million miles below my feet  
There's a lot of people  
I'd like to meet  
There's theives and killers  
Harlots and whores  
All were misguided  
But not any more...  
  
So I see their fate  
In the black of the doom  
Waves of fire in the storm  
Creatures howl at the moon  
They're screaming intensly  
Their cries are heard for miles  
A prince resides there  
Lake of fools, burning wild
