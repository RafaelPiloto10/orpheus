Lately we're acting like two kids in school,  
Spelling out things so he wont know we're through.  
We know it's over and we don't want to say,  
But letter by letter, he showed me today.  
And he really turned my head,  
As he turned around, with a tear in his eye, and said:  
Hey d-a-d-d-y,  
I saw m-a-m-a cry.  
Say your not going away.  
Is it because of me,  
Have I been b-a-d.  
Please, daddy, please won't you stay.  
Cause if you leave,  
What will you do with m-e.  
  
So I picked him up, sat him down on my knee,  
I thought I'd explain but, again, he showed me.  
We've been too busy avoiding the blame,  
We forgot the real heart who will lose in this game.  
And I still love you, I just did'nt see,  
'Til he opened my eye's, and he spelled it out to me.  
  
Hey d-a-d-d-y,  
I saw m-a-m-a cry.  
Say your not going away.  
Is it because of me,  
Have I been b-a-d.  
Please, daddy, please won't you stay.  
Cause if you leave,  
What will you do with m-e.  
  
Instrumental Break.  
  
Hey d-a-d-d-y,  
I saw m-a-m-a cry.  
Say your not going away.  
Is it because of me,  
Have I been b-a-d.  
Please, daddy, please won't you stay.  
Cause if you leave,  
What will you do with m-e.  
  
Oh, daddy if you leave, what will you do  
With me?
