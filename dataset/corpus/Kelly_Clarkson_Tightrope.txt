I'm on a tightrope  
You've got your reasons  
When did it get so hard to breathe  
Hide in the spotlight  
I'm feeling so tired  
Your hands are burned from holding me  
And maybe you and I will fall in time  
Eventually  
Maybe we'll both die trying  
But I can't bring myself to leave  
'Cause I blew it  
  
And I ain't seen nothing like you  
The way you light up every room tonight so easily  
And I have moved mountains babe just a stumble into your good grace,  
And I, I still can't compete  
  
You're on a tightrope  
I've got my reasons  
How did we get so tangled?  
You turn, I stay straight  
I bend as you break,  
We're so messed up, but I know,  
That you and I will fall in time  
Eventually  
Or maybe we'll both die trying  
  
'Cause I ain't seen nothing like you  
The way you light up every room tonight so easily  
And I have moved mountains babe just a stumble into your good grace  
And I, I still can't compete  
  
You and I will fall in time  
Eventually  
Or maybe we'll both die trying  
  
'Cause I ain't seen nothing like you  
The way you light up every room tonight so easily  
And I have moved mountains babe just a stumble into your good grace  
And I, I still can't compete
