Ah we can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind  
Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance  
Well they're are no friends of mine  
I say, we can go where we want to, A place where they will never find  
And we can act like we come from out of this world  
Leave the real one far behind,  
And we can dance
