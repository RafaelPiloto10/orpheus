I'm stupidly happy  
Everything's fine  
I'm stupidly happy  
My heart pumping wine  
I'm stupidly happy  
With idiot grin  
I'm stupidly happy  
You won't catch me in  
  
All the birds of the air call your name as they land on my kitchen roof  
All the fish in the sea do the same if you need extra proof  
  
I'm stupidly happy  
My vision is skewed  
I'm stupidly happy  
I'm coming unscrewed  
  
And if the Devil walks up dressed in any disguise  
I take him by the collars look him in the eye  
I'm stupidly happy  
Now you're my defense  
I'm stupidly happy  
It's all making sense  
  
I'm stupidly happy  
I roll like a train  
I'm stupidly happy  
With you in my brain  
  
All the lights of the cars in the town form the strings of a big guitar  
I'm a giant to play you a tune for wherever you are  
I'm stupidly happy  
Are the words to that song,  
I'm stupidly happy  
And nothing is wrong  
And should the Devil walk up with his business card out  
I'll tear it to confetti with a grin and shout,  
"I'm stupidly happy"  
All of the time  
I'm stupidly happy  
Now you're mine
