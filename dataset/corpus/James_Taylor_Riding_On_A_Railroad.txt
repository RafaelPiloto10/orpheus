We are riding on a railroad, singing some else's song  
Forever standing by the cross road.  
Take a side and step along.  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea.  
Maybe you an me can meet again.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing someone else's song  
Sing along.  
Time to time I tire of the life that I've been leading  
Town to town, day by day  
There's a man up here who claims to have his hands upon the reins.  
There are chains upon his hands and he's riding upon a train.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing some else's song  
Forever standing by the cross road.  
Take a side and step along.  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea.  
Maybe you an me can meet again.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing someone else's song.
