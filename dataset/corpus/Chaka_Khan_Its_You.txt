It's you, no one else will do  
I knew one day  
Another true love would come my way  
Only time will tell  
If it's right, it just can't fail  
And there you were  
And my quest for love is over  
Now my only lover...is you  
  
No one else will do  
It's true  
I'm the only one for you  
  
Love ain't so bad  
If you have an understanding  
You know it's everlasting  
You let it show with the test of time  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
Without a doubt  
Now my quest for love is over  
Now my only lover  
  
It's you....i'll never love another  
Nobody can take your place  
Without a doubt  
My quest for love is over  
My only lover  
It's you
