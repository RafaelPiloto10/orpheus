My faithful companion, I've lost my way once again  
A prisoner of darkness, I let you down my friend  
  
A heart left abandoned takes so long to heal its wounds  
Your touch not forgotten, the end of the dream  
It comes too soon, in this lonely room  
Till I leave this world, always know that  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I will surrender my heart to the sky  
Oh our love doesn't end here, it lives forever on the wings of time  
  
The road that I travel, don't know which way I should turn  
Till I find the answer, know that the fire within me will always burn  
  
Angel of mercy, please, why so much pain?  
I cry for forgiveness, I'm the destitute man  
Who still remains, it's so hard to explain  
Till I leave this world, always know that  
  
Sometimes I feel just like crying  
I can't turn my back, all these years I've been trying  
A vision of you keeps reappearing to me  
You can't blame yourself, just reach out your hand and believe  
  
We sail in dark waters, Lord give me some peace of mind  
Temptation before me, ahead lies the tower of truth that I must find  
To you I will climb  
Till I leave this cruel world far behind, always know that
