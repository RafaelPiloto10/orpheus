Come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on  
I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas, head bustas, and sharks  
niggas that's 'bout beefin' - lettin' them K's spark  
Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas  
niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas  
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it  
niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head  
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin  
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin  
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat  
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks  
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust  
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck  
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out  
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth  
Get erased, my nigga (my nigga)  
Look here: I leave no trace, my nigga (my nigga)  
No witnesses so can you see my face, my nigga (my nigga)  
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga  
Look here: you can play if you wanna get down  
Get your stupid ass left where you can't be found  
(Hook [B. G.])  
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)  
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)  
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)  
We done popped you up, chopped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)  
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)  
We done popped you up, chopped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)  
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Whaa?)  
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up
