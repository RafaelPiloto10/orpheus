All of my life  
Needed a reason  
to find out who I am  
  
I've had my share  
Acts of treason  
Slipping right through my hands  
What am I waiting for...  
  
Sometimes I feel  
Like I live in a dream  
Alone in my Paradise Lost  
  
So many years  
Is there an answer?  
In this castle made of sand  
  
As time passes by  
I'm running out of chances  
Who will understand  
What I am waiting for..
