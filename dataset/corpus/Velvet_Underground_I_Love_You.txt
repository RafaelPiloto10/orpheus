When I think of all the things I've done  
And I know that it's only just begun  
Those smiling faces  
You know, I just can't forget them  
But I love you  
  
When I think of all the things I've seen  
And I know that it's only the beginning  
You know, those smiling faces  
I just can't forget them  
But for now I love you  
  
Just for a little while  
Oh baby, just to see you smile  
Just for a little while  
  
When I think of all the things I've done  
And I know, that it's only just begun  
Oh, smiling faces, Jesus  
You know, I can't forget them  
But for now, I love you  
Watch this minute, baby  
Now I love you  
At least for now  
I love you
