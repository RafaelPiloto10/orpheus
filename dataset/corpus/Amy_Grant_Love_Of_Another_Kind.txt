They say love is cruel, they say love is rather fragile  
But I've found in You a love of another kind  
They say love brings hurt I say love brings healing  
Understanding first it's a love of another kind  
The love I know is a love so few discover  
They need to know Jesus' love is like no other  
They save love won't last I say love is never ending  
'Cause in You I have a love of another kind  
They would change their tune they would add another measure  
If they only knew this love of another kind  
The love I know is a love so few discover  
They need to know Jesus' love is like no other  
They say love is cruel, they say love is rather fragile  
But I've found in You a love of another kind  
They say love brings hurt I say love brings healing  
Understanding first it's a love of another kind  
They save love won't last I say love is never ending  
'Cause in You I have a love of another kind  
They would change their tune they would add another measure  
If they only knew this love of another kind  
Love of another kind  
The love of another kind  
The love of another kind  
The love of another, the love of another kind  
Give me love this is love  
(This is love)  
Another kind, another kind of love  
This is love  
(This is love)  
You need another kind of love  
Another kind, another kind of love  
Another kind of love  
This is love  
(Give me love)  
Another kind, another kind of love
