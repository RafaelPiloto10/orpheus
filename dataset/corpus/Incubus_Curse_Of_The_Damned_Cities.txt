Hades on the earth  
Condemned cities  
From evil populations  
Violence, fatal crimes  
Chaos will lead us to destruction  
The streets lost it's freedom to be crossed  
Imprisonment at any time  
When darkness takes it's proper place  
Fear closing in  
When the scenes terrorize honest citizens  
Disgust multiplies  
Serious acts are committed every day  
Fighting to survive in this labirinth  
Of stone and steel  
Always unware when and where  
The assault can actually occur  
CHORUS  
Curse of the damned cities  
Crucial habitats  
Following the way of criminal instincts  
Curse of the damned cities  
Unrighteous dwelling  
Decaying towards it's uncontrollable destiny  
Dreams of civilization  
Of peace and harmony, lies far away  
Are you alone in this fight  
To correct those corrupted societies  
Justice is a word that is fading real fast  
Guilty running free as the victims are suffering  
From the fact that there is no escape  
Feeling that their security is not strong enough yet  
Thefts, rapes, murders growing to a numerous rate  
We never seem to learn that this is an endless war  
Is the economy provoking it  
Or is it just the ignorant side of a human being  
Evil suppress intermittently every line  
Haunting frequently  
The streets are the battlefield  
To those individual warriors  
Where each man is like a country  
Fighting each other in a conventional war  
Mandatory action of survival  
CHORUS  
Curse of the damned cities  
Crucial habitats  
Following the way of criminal instincts  
Curse of the damned cities  
Unrighteous dwellings  
Decaying towards it's uncontrolled destiny  
Brutality growing, it never stops  
For centuries it seems to be getting worse  
Harshly tumultuous mobs  
Is home a safe place  
If now the danger is spreading across the land  
Like an epidemic without any curse  
We will never learn from our mistakes  
The more we stop, the more will emerge  
The experience are the lesson to make us fear  
CHORUS  
Curse of the damned cities  
Crucial habitats  
Following the way of criminal instincts  
Curse of the damned cities  
Unrighteous dwelling  
Decaying towards it's uncontrollable destiny
