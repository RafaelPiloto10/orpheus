Somethin' special about you, babe  
Maybe it's your smile  
But when I see you  
You hear the dial  
Oh, girl  
  
[Chorus]  
Big bang it hit me like a boomerang  
Light turns green, blood starts flowin'  
Big bang it hit me like a boomerang  
Light turns green and my heart starts pumpin'  
  
Maybe somehow in my make-believe world  
Maybe somehow you will be my girl  
And I understand there are other guys  
But when I see you my blood pressure starts to rise  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big Bang  
Big Bang  
  
I see girls in all shapes and sizes  
But, baby, since I met you, you're the only one for me  
  
[Chorus: x4]
