Someday, some way, you'll realize that you've been blind  
Yes, darling, you're going to need me again  
It's just a matter of time  
Go on, go on, until you reach the end of the line  
But I know you'll pass my way again  
It's just a matter of time  
After I gave you everything I had You laughed and called me a clown  
Remember, in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know, I know that one day you'll wake up and find  
That my love was a true love  
It's just a matter of time
