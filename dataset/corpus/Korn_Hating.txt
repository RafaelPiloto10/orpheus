My life is such a waste  
Begging on something to work this time  
But why can't I relate?  
Feeling all I do is get what's mine  
Holding on to faith  
Never gave me nothing but despair  
So why do I create just to be swallowed?  
I can't take  
We have a star  
I can't take  
We got a fantasy  
Come what may  
We are the stars  
I can't wait  
I'll take what's mine  
  
Been hating all this time, before a crowd inside  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
Been hating all this time, too far to cross the line  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
  
I cannot leave this place  
Burning up inside this space of mine  
But why can't I replace feelings I find hard to really find?  
I try but I can't taste  
Memories they always fuck with me  
So why do I create just to be swallowed?  
  
I can't take  
We have a star  
I can't take  
We got a fantasy  
Come what may  
We are the stars  
I can't wait  
I'll take what's mine  
  
Been hating all this time, before a crowd inside  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
Been hating all this time, too far to cross the line  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
  
All my feelings have been eating all of me  
Feed inside  
Is there something wrong with me?  
  
I can't take  
We have a star  
I can't take  
We got a fantasy  
Come what may  
We are the stars  
I can't wait  
I'll take what's mine  
  
Been hating all this time, before a crowd inside  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
Been hating all this time, too far to cross the line  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find
