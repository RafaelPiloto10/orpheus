This ones for you Curtis, I love you.  
(do do do dooooo . . .)  
If you look into your heart  
With a positive mind  
Take some inventory of your woman and your glory  
Leave the bad things behind (ooh)  
Everybodys got a story (yes they do)  
About love and the good things  
But all the spices of your life  
You just got to pay the price  
If you know what I mean (ooh yeah)  
I'm telling everybody  
I know how a girl becomes some pride  
When I finally found there was nothing left  
I said I do believe I found myself  
And I want to give it to you baby oh yes I do (yeah yeah)  
So if you look into your heart  
With a positive mind  
You can take some inventory of your woman and your glory  
Leave the bad things behind  
And your woman really loves me we don't have that everyday (oh no no no)  
I know my man really needs me I say it  
What ever he want to do I want to do it with you baby (yeah yeah)  
(do do do doooo . . .)  
Jump on the night  
Love's not an easy game  
And he's strong and he's straight  
Now that I see  
What he's givin' me  
I say what ever he want to do  
I want to do it with you baby  
I'm loving you more and more and more and more  
And giving you all and all of me
