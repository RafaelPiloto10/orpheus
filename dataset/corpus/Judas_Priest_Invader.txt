I came across a smoking field, pulsating afterglow  
I saw a seering flash of light erupt and skyward go  
I staggered back in dazed surprise  
What was it I had seen?  
And as I stood there mesmerized I heard my spirit scream  
  
Invader invader nearby  
Invader, invader is nigh  
  
This is the first of more to come in carefully planned attacks  
If it is so we must prepare defenses to fight back  
The call is out throughout the world  
United we must stand  
To build a line, strategic force, they will not take a man  
  
Invader invader nearby  
Invader, invader is nigh  
  
When they come to take control every man must play his role  
They won't take our world away when the children we leave  
Will have to believe in today  
  
We warn you now you things out there  
Whatever you may send  
We won't give in without a fight, a fight until the end  
With vigilance by day and night our scanners trace the sky  
A shield is sealed upon this earth, a shield you won't get by  
  
Invader invader nearby  
Invader, invader is nigh
