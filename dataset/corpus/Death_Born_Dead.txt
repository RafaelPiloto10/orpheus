Brought to this world to wither again  
Naive about the ways of life is what they say  
Millions live millions die, more are yet to come  
Living skeletons  
Where they come from  
  
Born dead into this world  
To starve and rot in agony  
Born dead into this world  
It's their choice, why can't you see  
  
Life of misery, soon a corpse you be  
As bones show through, nothing you can do  
  
Relief does not exist  
When you are born to die  
  
Disease spreads fast across their dying world  
Many cemeteries they will have to build  
As process goes on for many years to come  
A human waste land created when they are done  
  
Born dead into this world  
To starve and rot in agony  
Born dead into this world  
It's their choice, why can't you see
