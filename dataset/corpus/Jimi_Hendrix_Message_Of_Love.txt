Well we're,  
I said we're traveling at a speed of a reborn man  
We got a lot of love to give  
You better come on if you can  
So I talk about love  
They try to run away  
Check yourself out baby  
And then come with me today  
Mmm mmm good lover  
Over here  
Hey  
Dooooo yeah!  
Dooooo yeah!  
  
Mmm so good  
Yeah, oh so tasty  
Here comes a woman  
Wrapped up in chain  
You're foolin' with that fool baby  
You put your life in pain  
If you want to be free  
Come on along with me  
And leave the hard headed man  
He'll never understand  
I said a find yourself first  
And then your talent  
Work hard in your mind  
For it could come alive  
Then prove to the man  
That understands  
The eyes are god  
  
Whoo  
Come one baby  
  
Doodoo doodoo...  
  
Everybody memorize  
Everybody love a lot  
Everybody here today  
  
Hey  
Yeah, yeah  
Hey  
Come on baby  
Come on  
Come on  
Fly with me baby
