Hands Up  
  
Rollin' to the club  
Stop to get my grub on  
Nothin' like those Krispy Kremes  
Soon as I was done  
It was time to get my groove on  
Find a place that's happenin'  
And I knew that it was on  
  
From the moment that I walked into the spot  
It was bangin'  
It was swangin' oh  
Till somethin' turned me off  
I wasn't sure  
Coulda swore I saw you with someone  
And at much to my surprise (whoa)  
  
Chorus:  
You were right there with your hands up in the air  
You had hoochies everywhere  
All on you  
It's like I almost didn't know you  
Tryin' to shake that ass  
Playa you don't even dance  
Sup wit' you  
It's like I don't even know you  
  
Left you at the crib  
Cause I know you get your game on  
Happens every Tuesday night  
You said that you was cool  
Your boys was comin' by  
(Go baby have yourself a real good time)  
So I knew I could be wrong  
  
I was thinkin' there's no way it could be you  
Not my baby  
He ain't crazy no  
Then my girlfriends tipped me off  
When I got closer I could tell that it was you  
You was bangin'  
You was swangin' oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
Mindin' my own business  
My pager's goin' off  
My girlfriends tryin' to tell me  
You're doin' wrong  
I needed confirmation  
I knew you was a dog  
I just can't believe what I saw  
  
Chorus
