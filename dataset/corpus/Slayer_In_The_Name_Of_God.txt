I want to, invite you, welcome you  
To my hate, to my scorn, to myself  
Saturate you, infest you, betray you  
Stimulate you, so eager for my lies  
For my lies, lies  
Lies in the name of god  
  
[lead: king]  
  
I take you, I play you, invade you  
Lacerate you, I scar you, innocence  
Masticate you, ingest you, become you  
Defenseless, I fill your emptiness  
With my lies, lies  
Lies in the name of god  
  
In this world of shit I exist  
Perfect world conforms I resist  
Disconnect the nerves from the spine  
Desecrate the walls of the mind  
Through these eyes no love is alive  
Through these eyes unrest never dies  
Through these lies compassion is lost  
Through these lies await the ungod  
Antichrist is the name of god [repeat: x4]
