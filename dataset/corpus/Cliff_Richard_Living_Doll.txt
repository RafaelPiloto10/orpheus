Got myself a cryin', talkin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll  
Gonna do my best to please her just 'cause she's a livin' doll  
Got a roamin' eye and that is why she satisfies my soul  
Got myself a cryin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll  
  
BRIDGE:  
  
Take a look at her hair, it's real  
If you don't believe what I say, just feel  
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk so no big hunk  
Can steal her away from me  
  
REPEAT VERSE
