You know as a child, he heard tell of the seven mile bridge  
That connected on marathon shore  
Yes and it was the gateway key west his grandpa  
Had told him ten times or more  
The stories of some sailors curse on the bridge  
Where it opens to let the boats through  
But the natives all laugh at grandpas old stories  
And swear that it just isn't true  
Now most of them sail across to Miami  
From the edge of the blue water line  
With craw fish and snappers to sell at the market  
For money to spend on some wine  
They always cross through at the seven mile bridge  
Except when the moon comes out full  
They're not superstitious they tell you as they are  
Repeating that old seaman's rule  
Watch out for those outlaws and pirates  
Lord knows that they'll steal you blind  
Don't mess around with those cutthroats and thieves  
They're robbers and killers of time  
And there's nothing worse than an old sailors curse  
On the seven mile bridge where you find  
They're stealing the future and making believe  
The past is still somewhere behind  
The seven mile bridge, the seven mile bridge  
And he found a woman who'd come here from Cuba  
She gave him a son and a dream  
They lived in a conch house somewhere on stock island  
With the seven mile bridge in between  
She'd spent her nights on the window walk wondering  
If he'd safely pull through the storm  
While he spent his money on painted up women  
And whiskey to keep his blood warm  
Then he'd gamble on crab races till he was broke  
While she sat up waiting all night  
Then felling too guilty to face her and tell her  
He'd look for some bully to fight  
At the end of the rainbow where the sun always shines  
Just south of the seven mile bridge  
She waits at the window for signs of his sailboat  
And tries not to worried the kids  
She sneaks a few drinks from the bottle she hides  
From a husband that's to tired to think  
With feelings of guilt she picks up the bottle  
And pours the remains in the sink  
Now she thinks of the men that stare at her boldly  
They know she's a woman alone  
With fingers that tremble she touches her body  
And wishes her man would come home  
Now the years pass so quickly for time is a thief  
His skin looks like leather by now  
His woman's got fat and lost all he  
But, Lord, she's lived up to her vow  
She looks at her son that's going on twenty  
He's ready to live his own life  
She hopes he can find a sea worthy woman  
A sailor sure needs a good wife  
Why he's just like his daddy  
She thinks as she watches  
Him weaving those fish nets all day  
Knowing that some time the seven mile bridge  
Will take him and lead him astray  
He might return his woman would learn  
Broke like his daddy and drunk  
She wrote down some words on an old piece of sail cloth  
Nailed it over his bunk  
Why then, she packed his sea bag and filled up his trunk  
His new wife would want it that way  
Just before the old man shook the younger lads hand  
These are the words he did say
