[Verse 1]  
Flicker, yes flicker  
There it is, a little less faint  
A little more of your flame  
Feel it warm your skin  
Part of you trapped within  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Shed a little light on this  
Help me see  
Shed a little light on this  
Underneath the scarring from his defiling  
Underneath the pain  
[Chorus]  
Heroines  
They are not born, they are made  
A phoenix forms, her ashes rise  
Expose their hell  
Break Satan's spell  
Fire purifies  
It's redemption time  
  
[Verse 2]  
Flicker, yes, flicker  
When neighbours and friends  
Only give you their burning silence  
Even with torches raised  
Part of you can't feel safe  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Shed a little light on this  
Help me see  
Shed a little light on this, please  
Shed a little light on this  
And on those who excuse this act of violence  
Choosing you to play  
  
[Chorus]  
Heroines  
They are not born, they are made  
A phoenix forms, her ashes rise  
Expose their hell  
Break Satan's spell  
Fire purifies  
It's redemption time  
  
[Outro]  
Shed a little light on this  
Shed a little light on this
