[Chorus]  
Have you ever loved somebody so much  
It makes you cry?  
Have you ever needed something so bad  
You can't sleep at night?  
Have you ever tried to find the words  
But they don't come out right?  
Have you ever?  
  
Have you ever?  
  
Have you ever been in love  
Been in love so bad  
You'd do anything  
To make them understand?  
Have you ever had someone  
Steal your heart away?  
You'd give anything  
To make them feel the same?  
Have you ever searched for words  
To get you in their heart  
But you don't know what to say  
And you don't know where to start?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have you ever found the one  
You've dreamed of all your life?  
You'd do just about anything  
To look into their eyes?  
Have you finally found the one  
  
You've given your heart to  
Only to find that one  
Won't give their heart to you?  
Have you ever closed your eyes and  
Dreamed that they were there  
  
And all you can do is wait  
For that day when they will care?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
What do I gotta do to get you in my arms, baby?  
What do I gotta say to get to your heart  
To make you understand  
How I need you next to me?  
Gotta get you in my world  
Cause, baby, I can't sleep  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Have you ever?
