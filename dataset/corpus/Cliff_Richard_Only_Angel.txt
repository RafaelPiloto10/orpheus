A man's supposed to be a mountain  
With the rivers runnin' to the sea  
But ever since I lost my baby  
I'm not sure that's how it's supposed to be  
No need to try and hide this empty feelin'  
It's hard to smile when I'm so sad  
God's got so many angels up in heaven  
Why'd he take the only angel  
The only angel I've ever had  
I ever had  
Now I know you don't hear me darlin'  
Still I want to take this time to say  
How much I truly loved you  
And how sorry I am, sorry I am you went away  
No need to try and hide it  
Yeah I'm broken hearted and sad  
'cause god's got so many angels up in heaven  
Why'd he take the only angel  
The only angel I've ever had  
I ever had  
I just can't hide this empty feelin'  
When everybody knows that I'm sad  
God's got so many angels up in heaven  
Why'd he take the only angel  
The only angel I've ever had  
I ever had  
(he took the only angel) I ever had  
(the only angel) I've ever had  
(he took the only angel) I ever had
