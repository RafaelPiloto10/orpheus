Maybe it's the things I say  
Maybe I should think before I speak  
But I thought that I knew enough  
To know myself and do what's right for me  
  
And these walls I'm building now  
You used to bring 'em down  
And these tears I'm cyin' out  
You used to wipe away  
  
I thought you said it was easy  
Listening to your heart  
I thought you said I'd be okay  
So why am I breakin' apart?  
  
Don't wanna be torn(x5)  
  
Don't make me have to choose between  
What I want and what you think I need  
Cause I'll always be your little girl  
But even little girls have got to dream  
  
Now it all feels like a fight  
You were always on my side  
And the lonely I feel now  
You used to make it go way  
  
I thought you said it was easy  
Listening to your heart  
I thought you said I'd be okay  
So why am I breakin' apart?  
  
Don't wanna be torn (x5)  
  
Why is all this so confusing,  
Complicated and consuming?  
Why does all this make me angry?  
I wanna go back to being happy  
  
The tears I'm cryin now  
You used to wipe away  
And these walls I'm building now  
You used to bring 'em down  
  
I thought you said it was easy (hold for 10 seconds)  
Listening to your heart (listening to your heart)  
I thought you said I'd be okay  
So why am I breaking apart?  
  
Don't wanna be torn! (x10)
