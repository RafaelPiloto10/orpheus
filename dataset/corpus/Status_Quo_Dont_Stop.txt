If you wake up and don't wanna smile  
If it takes just a little while  
Open your eyes, look at the day  
You'll see things in a different way  
  
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here  
It'll be here better than before  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone  
  
Why not think about the times to come  
And not about the things that you've done  
If your life was bad to you  
Just think what tomorrow will do  
  
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here  
It'll be here better than before  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone  
  
All I want is to see you smile  
If it takes just a luttle while  
I know you don't beieve that it's true  
I didn't mean any harm to you  
  
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here  
It'll be here better than before  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone  
  
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here  
It'll be here better than before  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone  
  
Oooh, don't you look back  
Oooh, don't you look back  
Oooh, don't you look back  
Oooh, don't you look back
