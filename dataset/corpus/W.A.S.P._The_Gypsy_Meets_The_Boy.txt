The tarot is fate, said the Gypsy Queen  
And she beckoned me, to glimpse my future she'd seen  
  
She said, do you see what I see?, be careful to choose  
Be careful what you wish for, cause it may come true  
When I lay the card down will it turn up the fool?  
Will it turn up sorrow? If it does then you lose  
  
I'm the lost boy can you help me  
Yeah, I'm the lost boy can you help me  
  
Then the illusion was real, a crimson idol I saw  
But the higher he'd fly, then the further he'd fall  
  
I'm the lost boy can you help me  
Yeah, I'm the lost boy can you help me  
  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be  
The crimson Idol of a million  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be  
The crimson Idol of a million eyes  
Of a million
