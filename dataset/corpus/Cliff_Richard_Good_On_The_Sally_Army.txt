Sunday finds me curled in bed  
I can hear the Sally Army in the old town square  
I can hear their brass and chorus's, they fill the air  
And I wonder why they do it when there's no-one ever there  
Moments later, out of bed goes me and I'm gazing out the window in the morning
light  
And the lasses in their bonnets makes a pretty sight  
And I thought if that's an army, it's a funny way to fight  
But its an empty life if you've got no purpose  
And your lost and feel your on your own  
And if I told my work mates, they'd have said I'd gone barmy  
When I ran down the stair to join the Salvation Army  
Oh it was love that I could depend upon  
And all of my emptiness had gone  
Babababbababababa  
Oh it's an empty life if you've got no purpose  
And your lost and feel your on your own  
If I told my work mates, they'd have said I'd gone barmy  
When I ran down the stair to join the Salvation Army  
Oh it was love that I could depend upon  
And all of my emptiness had gone  
Some years later, looking back at me  
I believe I've found the answer and I'd like to say  
You've need never be alone when God's a prayer away  
And He'll fill you with his sunshine if your life is cold and grey
