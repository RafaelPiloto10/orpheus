I was a young man when I died  
I was a flash, I was full of pride  
I gave it all, I gave my soul, I was so strong  
I felt the truth, I felt the pain in every song  
  
How well you know me  
You've seen me cry  
I'm just a shadow  
In a rock and roll sky  
  
I was living in a rock and roll sky  
I was a king, heavy on the style  
Super trouper, yes I know you well, making me shine  
I couldn't see what you did to me.  
I was so blind  
  
How well you know me  
You've seen me cry  
I'm just a shadow  
In a rock and roll sky  
  
I wanna be like I was before  
But this time I'm gonna know the score  
I need a home I can leave behind knowing you're there  
Super trouper, I can see you now, return your stare  
  
How well you know me  
You've seen me cry  
I'm just a shadow  
In a rock and roll sky
