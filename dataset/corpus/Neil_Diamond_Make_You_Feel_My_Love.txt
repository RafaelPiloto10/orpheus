When the rain  
Is blowing in your face  
And the whole world  
Is on your case  
I could offer you  
A warm embrace  
To make you feel my love  
  
When the evening shadows  
And the stars appear  
And there is no one there  
To dry your tears  
I could hold you  
For a million years  
To make you feel my love  
  
I know you haven't made  
Your mind up yet  
But I would never  
Do you wrong  
I've known it from  
The moment that we met  
No doubt in my mind  
Where you belong  
  
I'd go hungry,  
I'd go black and blue  
I'd go crawling down  
The avenue  
There's nothing  
That I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love  
  
The storms are raging  
On the rollin' sea  
And on the highway of regret  
The winds of change  
Are blowing wild and free  
You ain't seen nothing  
Like me yet  
  
I could make you happy,  
Make your dreams come true  
Nothing that I wouldn't do  
Go to the ends of the earth  
For you  
To make you feel my love
