I'm a lucky girl  
I found my friend  
I've been all around the world  
Mission Impossible  
Chasing the rainbow's end  
Wise guys  
Shy guys  
And sly lover boys  
With big bad bedroom eyes  
I never loved a man I trusted  
As far as I could pitch my shoe  
'Til I loved you  
  
You're my lucky star  
You're my magician  
You make the night prowling disappear  
Vanished from the star-war-bars  
Empty repetition  
I get my heart full here  
Playboys  
Stray boys  
And "Say, hey, hey" boys'll treat you like a toy  
I never loved a man I trusted  
As far as I could pitch my shoe  
'Til I loved you  
  
Cheaters  
Woman beaters  
And Huck Finn shucksters hopping parking meters  
I never loved a man  
I trusted  
As far as I could pitch my shoe  
'til I loved you  
  
I'm a lucky girl  
I found my friend  
I been all around the world  
Mission Impossible  
Chasing the rainbow's end  
Wise guys  
Booby-prize guys  
And sly lover boys  
With big bad bedroom eyes  
I never loved a man I trusted  
As far as I could throw my shoe  
'Til I loved you
