Needing you, wanting you  
I just don't know what I'm gonna do  
To tell the truth, it just ain't no use  
My mind ain't strong enough  
To forget about you, oh baby, hey  
Here I am trying to be proud  
Trying to fool myself with this unreal smile  
Telling everyone that I no longer cling to you  
But I know myself that can't be true  
Oh, how can I forget a love I've known for so long?  
The heart may not remember, but the mind goes on and on  
And the more I think about it the worse off I get  
Something keeps telling me  
You ain't seen nothing yet  
I'm needing you, wanting you  
I just don't know what I'm gonna do  
Now that you're gone, how can I go on  
The same love that made me smile  
Right now it makes me blue  
Oh, how can I get you back, I need you here so bad  
The neighbors say, since you've been away  
I seem to be so sad, you know they're right  
I can't stand to be out of your site  
You need to be here close to me to lift these lonely nights  
I'm needing you, wanting you  
Oh, I just don't know what I'm gonna do, ooh, no  
To tell the truth, it just ain't no use  
My mind ain't strong enough to forget about you  
Baby, baby, I'm sure needing you  
Yes, I'm wanting you, you know I just can't stand it  
It just ain't no use, ain't no use
