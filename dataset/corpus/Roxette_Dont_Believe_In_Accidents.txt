Anything can happen  
When I wind up alone with you  
Put your finger on the things I like to do  
Well anything can happen  
There's a feel in the air around you  
Commanding parts of me  
I never ever knew  
  
I want your love  
Of flesh and blood  
Hey you!  
This was really meant to be  
It's for sure our destiny  
Making lovers out of friends  
I don't believe in accidents  
  
Anything can happen  
When you hit that electric room in me  
I lose the time, the place and everything I see  
Well anything can happen  
There's nothin' else in the world I'd rather do  
Than to feed the secret dreams  
Hidden in you  
  
You want the love  
Of flesh and blood  
Hey you!  
This was really meant to be  
It's for sure our destiny  
Making lovers out of friends  
I don't believe in accidents  
I don't believe in accidents  
  
Hey you!  
This was really meant to be  
It's for sure our destiny  
Making lovers out of friends  
Don't believe in accidents  
  
This was really meant to be  
It's for sure our destiny  
Making lovers out friends  
I don't believe in accidents  
I don't believe in accidents  
Don't believe in accidents  
Don't believe in accidents...
