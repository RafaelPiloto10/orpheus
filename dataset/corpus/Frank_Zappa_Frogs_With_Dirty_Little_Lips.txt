Frogs with dirty little lips  
Dirty little warts on their finger-tips  
Dirty 'n green  
Tiny 'n mean  
Floppin' around  
By the edge of the stream  
Frogs with dirty little eyes  
Dirty little tongues all covered with flies  
Dirty brown  
Floppin' around  
Puffed up 'n bloated  
When the sun goes down  
Frogs with dirty little nose  
Dirty little spots all over their clothes  
Dirty legs  
Dirty feet  
Dirty little frogs is what you eat
