I wake up every morning and that's my first mistake  
From thereon in it's downhill all the way  
I used to have a problem but now you want to leave  
My new problem's getting through the day  
  
Going down for the first time  
Guess I've yet to learn loves ain't blind  
I could use a little help, I can't stay here by myself  
And I can't work you out of my mind  
  
Now I don't mind admitting that maybe you were right  
The more we try the less it seems to work  
We get so used to banging our heads against the wall  
It's only when we stop it starts to hurt  
  
Going down for the first time  
Guess I've yet to learn loves ain't blind  
I could use a little help, I can't stay here by myself  
I'll step right out of line, I'll go clean out of time  
Yes I could use a little help, know I'd lose it by myself  
If you fall out of sight, you know you'll turn out the light.  
  
Going down for the first time

Yes I could use a little help, know I'd lose it by myself  
If you fall out of sight, you know you'll turn out the light.  
And I'll quietly go out of my mind
