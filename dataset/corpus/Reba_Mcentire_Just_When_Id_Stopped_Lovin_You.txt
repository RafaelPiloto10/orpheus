3 o'clock in the mornin' when the telephone started ringin  
I had a feelin' it wouldd be you  
I'd didn't want to take it but I let my imagination think  
Of some kind of trouble you gotten into  
And I just had to answer n you had to stop cryin  
And I, I tried to fight it  
But I thought if I didn't listen to you  
That I wouldn''t be much of a friend  
I let you come over n cry on my shoulder  
For the hundredth time over again  
And all those old emotions came rainin out of the room  
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin' you  
  
You got a way of knowin when I'm on the edge of givin in  
And how to use those beautiful eyes  
So if one day you're askin' me, if I ever thought that maybe  
We outta give it one more try?  
And I just had to answer n you, you had to start smilin  
And I thought about lyin'  
But I thought if I wasn't honest with you  
That I wouldn't be much of a friend  
I let you come over n cry on my shoulder  
For the hundredth time over again  
And all those old emotions came rainin' out of the room  
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin' you  
  
Oh I hate you for makin' me crazy  
So why is it that I...  
I keep on takin' you right back baby?  
But I thought if I didn't listen to you  
That I wouldn't be much of a friend  
I let you come over n cry on my shoulder  
For the hundredth time over again  
And all those old emotions came rainin' out of the room  
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin' you  
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin' you  
  
You take two steps down the highway  
But you come runnin' back  
What am I supposed to do?  
What am I supposed to do?  
What am I supposed to do with that?  
Wrap my arms around you!  
Yeah eh yeah
