Well you and I  
We're buddies  
And we've been since we first met  
Me any you  
Well we've sure been through  
Our share of laughter and regret  
Lord knows we've had our bad days  
And more than once we've disagreed  
But you've always been a friend to me  
You can be so stubborn  
There's times I think you just like to fight  
And I hope and pray  
I live to see a day  
When you say I might be right  
And there's times I'd rather kill you  
Than listen to your honesty  
But you've always been a friend to me  
You've always been  
Time and again  
The one to take my hand  
And show to me it's okay to be  
Just the way I am  
With no apology  
Oh you've always been  
And you will 'till God knows when  
Yes you've always been a friend to me
