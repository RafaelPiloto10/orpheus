All my life I've been a manual man  
I like the floor all the power in my hand  
Driving up and down the road all day  
Overtaking anything in the way  
Alongside us came a man in a grin  
Winding down the window clever again  
You know manual is far too old  
To keep pace then he left us cold  
  
It's automatic, it's automatic  
It's automatic, it goes by itself  
  
  
Quick thinking and a mutual aim  
So on finding out the name of the game  
A different unit was ordered that day  
Who wants to go thru' the gears anyway  
The same color the same design  
The same car with a different mind  
Knowing now we wouldn't take second place  
Both saying with a smile on our face.
