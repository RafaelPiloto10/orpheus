Of all the love I have won or have lost  
There is one love I should never have crossed.  
He was a boy in a million, my friend,  
I should have known he would win in the end.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a loser  
And I lost someone who's near to me.  
I'm a loser  
And I'm not what I appear to be.  
  
Although I laugh and I act like a clown,  
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown.  
My tears are falling like rain from the sky,  
Is it for him or myself that I cry ?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What have I done to deserve such a fate ?  
I realize I have left it too late  
And so it's true pride comes before a fall,  
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a loser.
