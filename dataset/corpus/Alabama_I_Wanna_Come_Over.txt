Is that what time it is  
I'm sorry if I woke you with this call  
But all this wine is in my head  
And I'm so lonely from it all  
Don't hang up  
Baby hear what I gotta say  
We started out such a beautiful story  
We just can't end this way  
  
I want to come over I want to love you tonight  
I don't care about the time or who's wrong or who's right  
Just say it's OK and I'll be on my way  
I want to come over could you get outta bed  
I'll try to unsay all the things I've said  
Please say its OK and I'll be on my way  
  
Is that what time it is  
I'm sorry if I'm keeping you from your sleep  
But all these feelings are running through me  
You know I never knew they ran so deep  
What's that you're sayin'  
That just before I phoned  
You were gettin' ready to give me call  
'Cause you were feelin' so alone  
  
I want to come over I want to love you tonight  
I don't care about the time or who's wrong or who's right  
Just say it's OK and I'll be on my way  
I want to come over could you get outta bed  
I'll try to unsay all the things I've said  
Please say its OK and I'll be on my way  
I want to come over  
I comin' over  
I want to come over  
Just let me come over tonight
