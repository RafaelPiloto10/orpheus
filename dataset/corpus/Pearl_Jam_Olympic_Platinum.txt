If I could reach to the sky and touch it for my country  
Get some on my finger and take in its smell  
The smell of victory land of the free Olympic dream  
My Olympic dream  
My promotion scheme  
How hard can it be  
How high can I jump  
How high can I throw  
How high can I run  
How high can I hold my breath and stay underwater  
And wave my legs around in perfect unison with my partner who really doesn't
understand me  
For my Olympic dream  
I'll be like Dwight Stone  
I'll be like Bruce Jenner  
I'll be like that girl who trained all her life as a distance runner and then
tripped with a quarter mile to go  
But I I will get up and I will run  
I will run with the Georgia peach breeze and I will win  
I will win my Olympic dream  
The gold's just not good enough  
And I don't even think of the bronze  
I've????? My life for Olympic Platinum  
Olympic dream  
I'll sing like Whitney  
My Olympic dream
