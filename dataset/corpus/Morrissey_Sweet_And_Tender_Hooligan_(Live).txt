And he said that he'd never, never do it again  
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)  
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan  
And he swore that he'll never, never do it again  
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)  
Poor old man  
He had an accident with a three-bar fire  
But that's ok  
Because he wasn't very happy anyway  
Poor woman  
Strangled in her very own bed as she read  
But that's ok  
Because she was old and she would have died anyway  
Don't blame  
The sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan  
Because he'll never, never, never, never, never, never do it again  
(not until the next time)  
Jury, you've heard every word  
So before you decide  
Would you look into those Mother-me eyes  
I love you for you, my love, you my love  
You my love, you my love  
Jury, you've heard every word  
But before you decide  
Would you look into those Mother-me eyes  
I love you for you my love, you my love  
I love you just for you, my love  
Don't blame  
The sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan  
Because he'll never, never do it again  
And...  
In the midst of life we are in death etc.  
Forget the hooligan, hooligan  
Because he'll never, never do it again  
And...  
In the midst of life we are in debt etc.  
Etc! Etc! Etc! Etc!  
In the midst of life we are in death etc!  
Etc! Etc! Etc! Etc!  
In the midst of life we are in debt etc!  
Just...  
Just...  
Etc! Etc! Etc! Etc! Etc! Etc!
