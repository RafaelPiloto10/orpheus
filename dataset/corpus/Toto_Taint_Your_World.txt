Screaming at the sun I t have spilled a little moonshine on my head  
Didn't have to run, but there was no one left behind accept for the dead  
  
I didn't see it coming, but that rummy-stilted crackpot knew my game  
Left my head a humming, like a ball peen hammer drives a nail to shame  
  
I suggest you listen up to what I have to say  
Witnessed many crooked things, I smell your DNA  
Stab me, take me down, you know you'll never get your way  
  
Taint your world  
You're so far away from where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
Cause you don't want to fuck with me  
  
Didn't anybody get the cipher from the flying rat machine  
Gnarly, little, scrunched up, tiny fingers, and its disposition mean  
  
Anybody out of line will soon be on the list  
My back's against the wall and yet I know I must resist  
Time to tell the truth, I think somebody's getting pissed  
  
Taint your world  
You're not even close to where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
You got another guess coming if you think you're fooling me  
  
Taint your world  
So far away from where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
Where I belong just like an oyster and a pearl  
Taint your world  
You're not even close to where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
Taint your world
