It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
The Johnny Comelateleys are comin' in early  
The early birds showin' up late  
The straightmen all wanna be funny  
The funny men all wanna get straight  
The villains have turned into heroes  
The heroes have turned into heels  
The dealers all wanna be lovers  
And the lovers all wanna make deals  
[unverified] they ain't inherited nothin'  
The leaders are fallin' behind  
So I'm singin' my songs to the deaf men  
Dancing my dance to the blind  
It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
It's the world's gone crazy  
And ladies are dancin' and the sidemen  
And the frontmen, we'chome  
It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
...
