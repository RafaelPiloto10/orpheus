I can't give you anything but love, baby.  
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.  
Dream a while. Scheme a while.  
I'm sure you'll find  
Happiness, and I guess  
all those things you've always pined for.  
  
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth's doesn't sell, baby.  
till that lucky day you know darn well, baby.  
I can't give you anything but love.  
  
(repeat the whole thing)
