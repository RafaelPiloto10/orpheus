I sit in my living room thinking of you  
And the feelings I fear are coming true  
And everything about you is wrong I know it  
But I still taste you on my tongue  
And I still breath you in my lungs  
And I wish I could stop breaking down  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
  
Don't make a sound  
Don't tell a soul  
  
It's 7:00am and I just want to call you  
And tell you I'm falling in love  
But, there's somebody else inside these four walls  
If she smells you on my skin  
I can't let her know where I've been  
I wish I could be with you now  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Because I'm under your spell  
Wish I could tell the whole world  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
  
Don't make a sound  
Don't tell a soul  
Don't tell them anything  
And I won't let you go  
  
Don't say a word  
Don't tell a soul  
And I shiver at the thought of you  
I can't believe that you love me too  
And we quiver when we touch  
I can't believe I love you so much  
And I hate it when you walk away  
I know we can't go on this way  
But there's magic when we touch  
I can't believe I love you so much  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Because I'm under your spell  
Wish I could tell the whole world  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
  
Don't make a sound  
Don't tell a soul  
Don't tell them anything  
And I won't let you go  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
To be with you and no one else  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Because I'm under your spell  
Wish I could tell the whole world  
But I'll just keep it to myself  
  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud  
Wish I could hear how it sounds  
Wish I could love you out loud
