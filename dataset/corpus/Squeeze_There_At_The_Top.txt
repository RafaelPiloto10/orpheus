She's independent  
She's a modern woman  
She needs no prompting  
On her should 'n' shouldn't  
It's always bosses  
Who wish that she wouldn't  
Files in the cabinet so neatly numerical  
Makes all the clients so neatly alphabetical  
Turn of twenty one  
She's looking at the map  
Looking at her watch  
Bags on the rack  
It seems like she's there at the top  
  
There for her service  
Comfy red Granada  
Up to the midlands  
  
With a taped Sinatra  
Plans all the hotels  
And the airplane charters  
Found under covers with some representative  
The deal is effected but still only tentative  
  
Shorthands a letter  
Heading on the paper  
Slimline her lunch break  
Will it ever make her  
Slender and modern  
So all the men will take her  
Back to the mirror in the empress hotel  
Where the businessman smiles and the object is sell
