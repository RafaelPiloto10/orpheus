I turn my 15 minutes into 10 long years  
I made a million from drinkin' beers  
I got a jet, just some touch in these frets  
So if my ego gets outta check  
  
I guess I'm guilty  
I said I'm guilty  
  
I might do a little yack, might of rub my trab  
Now and then, get into a scrap  
That's alright, I got lawyers for that  
And then motherfuckers, they even know  
  
That I'm guilty  
I said I'm guilty  
  
I never sweat, really feel regret  
Well cameras roll when you least expect  
Some other times ended up online  
And motherfucker, if that's a crime  
  
I guess I'm guilty  
  
I know agreement, a shit ain't findin'  
You catch me on your charts, still climbin'  
A big, big Nascar reshinin'  
I said I'm goin' platinum, bitch I went diamond  
I've been rhymin' solid check it out  
I've been climbin', flamin' all about  
Where you at, I've been here for years  
Come on, every little body listen  
  
You know I'm guilty  
I'm guilty  
You know I'm guilty  
I'm guilty, guilty
