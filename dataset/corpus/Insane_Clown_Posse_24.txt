[Verse - Violent J]  
ALL NIGHT - find me, robbin' your jewels  
Settin' fires, damagin' and breakin' into schools  
IN THE DARKNESS - it's much easier to be heartless  
Break the window out the Lincoln, and screwdriver-start this  
Muggin' people, droppin' on 'em from street lights  
Stab 'em with garden tools or beat 'em with pipes  
So don't come out, stay inside cozy and tucked  
And if I'm breakin' in, your old lady's gettin..FUCKED!  
[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
ALL DAY - car jacks, get out the van  
As soon as they step out I pop 'em anyway, BLAAM!  
I rob liqour stores with a little 22 hold  
I know it's nothing but it's something when it's bustin' at your nose  
SUNNY DAYS - I hit up the beach with cleats on  
And stomp bitches in they ass tryin' to tan in they thongs  
ALL DAY - see me fuckin' hookers at truck stops  
And then I kill em, 'cause that's where my buck stops  
[Verse - Violent J]  
ALL NIGHT - I'm wicked and I got the power  
Blood sheds on the wall during the witching hour  
IN THE DARKNESS - see me ride by in an Impala  
Draggin' some fuck ass by the foot and hear him holla  
IN THE NIGHT TIME - I'll take what's rightfully mine  
I'll run through emergency rooms and sever life-lines  
Fuck the limelight, I'm the one I need to impress  
With a double dip swingin' ax chop to your chest!  
[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
ALL DAY - I'm sellin' coke laced joints to little kids  
I'm a clown in a milk truck handlin' biz  
IN THE SUNSHINE - I been known to take shots at the po  
I'm in the bushes with the camoflouge on and rifle scope  
ALL DAY - I'm wicked, I keep it horrifying  
Axe murdered some kid and his dad kite-flying  
I knocked the fuckin' mailman out on the grass  
And burned holes in his face with the magnifying glass  
[Verse - Violent J]  
ALL NIGHT - I fly like a vampire bat  
Murder people tellin' stories where the campfire's at  
BLAME IT ON THE MOONLIGHT OR BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE  
I shot the motherfuckin' sheriff and his deputy rookie  
WHEN IT'S DARK OUT - I hit the streets in the shadows and grab yo's  
And boogie the woogie and stab hoes  
Don't even gimme a pound when you see this clown  
You gettin' cut the FUCK up and chopped the FUCK down!  
[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
ALL DAY - catch me picknickin' with bitches in the park  
Right before I icepick 'em in the heart  
24-7, if it ain't us, it's somebody gettin' bloody  
Wicked clowns ain't the only ones nutty buddy  
CATCH ME..TONGUE KISSING - a severed head  
Catch me burying another bitch dead behind the shed  
It doesn't matter, night or day, all around the clock  
Violent J and Shaggy CHOP! CHOP!! CHOP!!! CHOP!!!!  
YOU'RE GONNA DIE!
