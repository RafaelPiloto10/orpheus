Kiss me at midnight  
5...4...3...2...1  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)  
  
I've been waiting for this special night  
To be with you  
The colors of Christmas are still shining bright  
And I know what we're gonna do  
  
Anticipating  
Music is playing  
The magic is in the air  
All through the season  
You've been the reason  
I have so much love to share  
  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)  
  
We've been making promises in the dark  
Our resolutions  
As a brand new year is about to start  
And we're together  
Celebrating  
No more waiting  
Our time has arrived  
Feel the beat of my heart  
As the countdown starts  
Just look into my eyes  
  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)  
  
Baby it's New Years Eve  
A time we can believe  
In making wishes  
Dreams come true  
Just for me and you  
  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)
