I cry the whole night, just for you  
My tears will dry, that is true  
But I can't live without you one more day  
You're always in my heart, I swear  
And if you call, I'll be there  
But I can't live without you one more night  
And I promise I will touch the sky  
If you ask me baby I will die  
Oh babe I saved my life only for you  
  
It's your smile, what makes my heartbeat fast  
It's your smile, and it will last  
I know, that you the one for me  
It's your smile, I can never let you go  
It's your smile, it always shows  
I know, that you're the one for me  
  
You mean everything to me  
Day in day out you're a mystery  
And I can't live without you one more day  
And everyday is a new day  
And I can't sleep, to see you stay  
Before my eyes my love can't let you go  
And I promise I will catch a star  
Move a mountain, even I know so far  
Oh babe I saved my life only for you
