Many too many have stood where I stand  
Many more will stand here too,  
I think what I find strange is the way you built me up  
Then knocked me down again.  
  
The part was fun but now it's over,  
Why can't I just leave the stage?  
Maybe that's because you securely locked me up  
Then threw away the key.  
  
Oh mama,  
Please would you find the key.  
Oh pretty mama,  
Please won't you let me go free.  
I thought I was lucky  
I thought that I'd got it made.  
How could I be so blind?  
  
You said good-bye on a corner  
That I thought led to the straight.  
You set me on a firmly laid and simple course  
Then removed the road.  
  
Oh mama,  
Please help me find my way.  
Oh pretty mama,  
Please lead me through the next day.  
I thought I was lucky  
Oh I thought that I'd got it made.  
How could I be so blind? Oh no
