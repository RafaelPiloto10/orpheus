Every night before I go to sleep  
Find a ticket, win a lottery  
Scoop the pearls up from the sea  
Cash them in and buy you all the things you need  
Every night before I rest my head  
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed  
I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad  
I take that money, buy you things you never had  
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me  
Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free  
I'll buy you a jet plane, baby get you on a higher plane to a jet stream  
And take you through the stratosphere  
And check out the planets there and then take you down deep  
Where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia, then cool, cold fields of snow  
And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream  
When we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it  
We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money  
Free money, free money, free money, free money, free money  
Free money  
Every night before I go to sleep  
Find a ticket, win a lottery  
Every night before I rest my head  
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed  
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me  
Baby, I know our troubles will be gone  
Oh, I know our troubles will be gone, goin', gone  
If we dream, dream, dream for free  
And when we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it  
Let's dream it, we'll dream it for free, free money  
Free money, free money, free money  
Free money, free money, money  
Free money, free money, free money  
Free money, free money, free money  
Free money, free money, free money  
Free money, free money, free money  
Free money, free money, free money  
Free money, free money, free money, free
