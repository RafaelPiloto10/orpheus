It's not like I wouldn't dream  
If you had not shown the way  
It's not like I wouldn't fight  
Not knowing 'bout your life  
It's not like I wouldn't stand  
Right here with my friends  
  
You threw us all alive  
When our days slipped away  
You gave us of your time  
  
'Cause you are my hero  
My Friday night  
You wrote the soundtrack to my life  
And gave me something  
To hold on to  
When i was growing up  
You were the rock  
In my life  
  
It's not like I live my days  
By every word you spoke  
Like I'm up every night  
Drinking with your ghost  
It's not like I can't look back  
Without movin' on  
  
You threw us all alive  
When our days slipped away  
You gave us of your time  
  
You are my hero  
My Friday night  
You wrote the soundtrack to my life  
And gave us kiss  
A chance to dream  
Days when I had enough  
You were the rock  
In my life  
  
You still throw me that like  
As my days slip away  
You give me of your time  
  
You're still my hero  
My Friday night  
You wrote the soundtrack to my life  
You give me something  
To hold on to  
As I'm still growing up  
You are the rock  
In my life
