Oh, it's been a long, long time  
Looks like to get you off my mind but I can't  
Just the thought of you, ooh, oh babe, just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
Just the mention, just the mention of your name, yeah  
Turns a flicker to a flame, listen to me good  
I think of the things, oh, I think of the things we used to do  
And that's when my whole world  
Oh, my whole world turns misty blue, yeah  
  
I should forget you, heaven knows I've tried  
But when I say I'm glad we're through  
My heart, my heart knows I've lied, I've lied  
Oh, I'm glad we're through  
Yes, but my heart knows, my heart knows I've lied, yes  
  
Just the mention, just the mention of, of your name, yeah  
Turns a flicker to a flame, listen to me good  
I think of the things, I think of the things we used to do, yeah  
That's when my whole world, my whole world turns misty blue  
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah  
And I, I should forget you, heaven knows, heaven knows I've tried  
But when I say I'm glad we're through  
That's when my heart knows  
That's when my heart knows that I've lied and I've lied and I lied  
  
Oh, oh, it's been such a long, long, long, long time, babe  
Looks like I can't get you  
I'm gonna get you off my mind but I can't, oh no  
Just the thought of you, just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world, it turns my whole world  
Just the thought of you, just to think of you  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world misty, misty blue
