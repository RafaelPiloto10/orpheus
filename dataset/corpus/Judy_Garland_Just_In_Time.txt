Just in time  
I found you just in time  
Before you came my time was running low  
I was lost  
  
The losing dice were tossed  
My bridges all were crossed  
No where to go  
Now you're here  
  
And now I know just where I'm going  
No more doubt or fear  
I've found my way  
For love came just in time  
  
You found me just in time  
And changed my lonely life that lucky day  
Just in time  
I found you just in time  
  
Before you came my time was running low  
I was lost  
The losing dice were tossed  
My bridges all were crossed  
  
No where to go  
Now you're here  
And now I know just where I'm going  
No more doubt or fear  
  
I've found my way  
For love came just in time  
You found me just in time  
And changed my lonely life that lovely day  
  
Hey, you came along  
I mean you came along  
And changed my life that lucky day
