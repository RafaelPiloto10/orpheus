Can't hear you baby  
Hey hey what you say?  
Say I am a... Vision  
Every time something plays  
Our system go switch  
Tone I am an over grad  
I ain't thinking of listening no  
You think you are saying a spot  
But it's all in your brain  
I think I'm... Our hearts straight to the dj  
Now record is flowing going round round  
Like a machine  
  
Chorus  
  
Music is got me on my love this night  
All I can do is keep on dancing  
He got me good now it controls me  
Like a machine  
(Repeat)  
  
... About the dollar bills bills in your pocket  
I ain't tripping it down till the sun is out  
And I am gonna go hard till the floor breaks  
I am coming through I am the...  
You think you are saying a spot  
But it's all in your brain  
I think I'm... Our hearts straight to the dj  
Now record is flowing going round round  
Like a machine  
  
Chorus  
  
Feel it taking over me  
The music is all I see  
I can't stop  
What it does to me  
Gonna keep on dancing  
Dancing dancing (repeat)  
  
Chorus
