The feelin' was clear  
Clear as a blue sky on a Sunday day  
Everything was you  
'Cause no one made me feel  
The way I felt with you  
Call on me 'cause  
I love you  
You know I do  
You love me too  
  
Then came a change  
When I said I would soon be leavin' you  
Nothin' else to do  
Please remember I never lose the thought of you  
Call on me 'cause  
I love you  
You know I do  
You love me too  
  
You've got to find  
Someone else to somehow take my place  
Share his life with you  
But if you need a friend  
You can always count on me  
Count on me 'cause  
I love you  
You know I do  
You love me too  
  
You can count on me oh  
You can count on me  
You can count on me baby  
You can count on me  
You can count on me oh  
You can count on me  
You can count on me baby  
You can count on me  
You can count on me oh  
You can count on me  
You can count on me baby  
You can count on me  
You can count on me oh  
You can count on me
