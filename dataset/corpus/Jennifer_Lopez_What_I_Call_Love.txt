[Verse:]  
Whatever you don't know  
Baby, I will teach you  
Anywhere you go  
Know my love can reach you  
Not a wall too high  
Or a mountainside  
Could keep me from seeing you  
  
[Verse:]  
Whenever you're too tired  
I could give you power  
Go the extra mile  
In your darkest hour  
Any day or night  
Call my name and I  
I'll come running to be with you  
  
[Verse:]  
And I'll be fierce as a tiger  
If anyone tries to fight ya  
But I'll be soft as a lamb  
When you're in my hands  
I can bend  
However I need to  
  
[Chorus:]  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
That's what I call love  
  
[Verse:]  
I will understand  
When you need space  
I will hold your hand  
When you're in pain  
I'll be patient and pause  
Most relationships  
Require a give and take  
  
[Verse:]  
And I will never let my ego  
Nor the words of other people  
Get in the way  
Or stop from saying  
How much I care and I need you  
  
[Chorus:]  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
That's what I call love  
  
[Bridge:]  
For better or for worse  
That's what I call love... Baby  
It's more than just a word  
Let me show you my love... Baby  
  
(Chorus 2)  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
That's what I call love  
  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love
