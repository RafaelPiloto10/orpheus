It's time to say goodbye  
So what are you waiting for  
Well my feelings are disguised  
So won't you walk out that door  
Hurry babe  
Before I cry  
Hurry babe  
Before I die  
A few more steps  
  
Well you say you love me babe  
So why are you leaving for  
You even say you're sorry  
Did you think I'd believe you more  
You say you wish  
To still see me  
Seemed silly  
It's you who set me free  
A few more steps  
  
Look at you crying  
Look at you shaking  
Why are you doing that for  
Whe where already gone through this  
No need to go out for more  
And I know that you're hurt  
But I'm hurt too  
Please don't ask me to comfort you  
It's you who said that we were through  
Ooh Baby  
Ooh baby  
  
Ooh Look at you crying  
Look at you shaking  
Why are you doing that for  
Whe where already gone through this  
No need to go out for more  
And I know that you're hurt  
But I'm hurt too  
Please don't ask me to comfort you  
It's you who said that we were through  
Ooh Baby  
Ooh baby  
  
You said you need your freedom  
So what are you staying for  
You know it's your decision  
You needn't explain no more  
If I'm strong enough  
To stand here tall  
Than why can't you be strong at all  
It's time to say goodbye  
Come on before I cry  
Oh baby before I die
