Here comes the weekend, sure could use  
Some relaxation to shake these blues  
Fill up the cooler with a little good cheer  
Hand me my sun shades, I'm checkin' out of here  
  
I'm workin' on a big chill  
(Workin', workin' on a big chill)  
Lord, I'm workin' on a big chill  
(Workin', workin' on a big chill)  
(Workin' on a big chill)  
  
Hook up the camper, head for the lake  
Sit on my tail bone, them fish can wait  
Pick up my baby, she's going too  
A little skinny dippin', Lord is good for you  
  
I'm workin' on a big chill  
(Workin', workin' on a big chill)  
I'm workin' on a big chill  
(Workin', workin' on a big chill)  
(Workin' on a big chill)  
  
Workin' on a  
  
Now we ain't leavin' till the suds are gone  
Call everybody, there's a party goin' on  
Come Monday mornin', it's back to the grind  
Come on baby, let's have a good time  
  
We'll be workin' on a big chill  
(Workin', workin' on a big chill)  
And we'll be workin', Lord, on a big chill  
(Workin', workin' on a big chill)  
  
We'll be workin' on a big chill  
(Workin', workin' on a big chill)  
And we'll be workin', baby, on a big chill  
  
Workin' on a  
Workin' on a  
Workin' on a
