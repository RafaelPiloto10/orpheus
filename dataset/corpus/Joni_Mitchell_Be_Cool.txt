If there's one rule to this game  
Everybody's gonna name  
It's, be cool!  
If you're worried or uncertain  
If your feelings are hurtin'  
You're a fool if you can't keep cool  
Charm 'em  
Don't alarm 'em  
Keep things light  
Keep your worries out of sight  
And play it cool  
Play it cool  
Fifty-fifty  
Fire and ice  
  
If your heart is on the floor  
Cause you've just seen your lover  
Comin' through the door with a new fool,  
Be cool  
Don't get riled  
Smile-keep it light  
Be your own best friend tonight  
And play it cool  
Play it cool  
Fifty-fifty  
Fire and ice  
  
Don't get jealous  
Don't get over-zealous  
Keep your cool  
Don't whine  
Kiss of that flaky valentine  
You're nobody's fool  
Be cool fool  
Be cool  
(Lots of other fish in the sea)  
  
Play it cool  
Play it cool  
Fifty-fifty  
Fire and ice  
  
So if there's one rule to this game  
Everybody's gonna name
