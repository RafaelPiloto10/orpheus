Oh, tell me 'bout the car I saw,  
Parked outside your door,  
Tell me what you left me waiting,  
Two or three hours for.  
  
Tell me why when the phone rings baby,  
You're up and across the floor,  
Please don't keep me wonderin' no longer.  
I think about the bad times,  
  
Lord I think about yours and mine,  
You were lost in the silver spoon,  
Thought I pulled you out in time.  
And I hope that you got reasons,  
  
For the way that you've been lyin',  
Please don't keep me wonderin' no longer.  
I think I'm gonna go now,  
But you know that I'll be back.  
  
Now you can think it over Baby,  
Tell me how you're gonna act.  
I'm gonna keep on holding on,  
But I don't get no stronger,  
  
Please don't keep me wonderin' no longer.
