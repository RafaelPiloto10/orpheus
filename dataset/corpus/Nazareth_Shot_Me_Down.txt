I was feelin' good, kinda high and cruisin'  
I was tryin' to forget someone I had been losin'  
Then you came along, surprise, surprise  
You shot me down  
I was lyin' crashed out on the ground  
You shot me down  
  
I was feelin' fine, mellowed out and easy  
I was comin' back down kinda slow and lazy  
Then you came along and fired the flame  
You shot me down  
I was lyin' burned out on the ground  
You shot me down, you shot me down  
You shot me down  
  
I was feelin' good, kinda high and cruisin'  
I was tryin' to forget someone I had been losin'  
Then you came along, surprise, surprise  
You shot me down  
I was lyin' crashed out on the ground  
You shot me down, you shot me down  
You shot me down.
