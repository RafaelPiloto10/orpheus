The world is an oyster, the bitter refrain  
The Lord is my shepherd, I cannot stay  
This blessed earth, this beautiful land  
A new day that breaks the dawn  
  
I am the tide, the oceans sing  
I am the anchor, I hold the brass ring  
I am the action, the deed of our king  
I am the static goodnight  
  
You make me to stand in the square on scene  
And make my choice, decision sing  
And bring my Lord, what this may bring  
I stand before you alone  
  
I rallied and sang and shouted refrains  
I'm blessed, turn the radio on  
The air was calm  
I held the bomb and the radio, the radio  
  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah  
  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah
