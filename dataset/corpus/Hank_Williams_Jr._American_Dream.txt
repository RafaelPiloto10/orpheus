If you fly in from Birmingham you'll get the last gate,  
If you blew in from Boston, no, you sure won't have to wait,  
And I'm learning, a little more every day,  
About the power of the dollar, and the people with white collars,  
And the good old American way.  
  
I've noticed I don't get much help when they see my blue jeans,  
Some slick with a suit walks up, "Oh, can I help you please?"  
Yes, I'm learning, as I gain a little age,  
About the power of the dollar, and the people with white collars,  
And the good old American way.  
  
Some high society lady says, " Is your horse outside?"  
"No, ma'am he's between my legs, but you're too fat to ride!"  
And you're learning, a little more about my ways,  
And what I think about your dollar and your white collar,  
And your good old American way.  
  
If you don't like my Nudie boots, I'm sorry about that,  
Don't make fun of my hat, too, or you might get knocked flat,  
And you'll learn some more, if you ever pass down our way,  
About the folks without the dollars, and without white collars,  
Hell, they are the American way.
