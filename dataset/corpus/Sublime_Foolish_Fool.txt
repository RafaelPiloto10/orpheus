Crazy, crazy  
Crazy fool  
Cra--zy fool  
  
If she thinks that she  
Gonna dispose my world  
Gotta-be-a crazy, crazy, crazy,  
Crazy fool  
Cra--zy fool  
  
My love for you,  
Was oh, so strong  
We went together,  
For oh, so long  
  
I might have complained about this misery, yeah  
Is this the way,  
Love's supposed to be? ('Spossed to be now)  
  
Foolish, foolish  
Oh you're just a...  
Foolish... girl  
  
Oh foolish, foolish, foolish  
Oh you're just a...  
Cra--zy girl  
  
If she thinks that she  
Is gonna take you from me  
Gotta be a...  
Crazy, crazy, crazy,  
Cra--zy fool  
  
Cra----zy fool
