It is safe to sleep alone  
In a place no one knows  
And to seek life under stones  
In a place water flows.  
  
It is best to find in sleep  
The missing pieces that you lost  
Best that you refuse to weep  
Ash to ash, dust to dust.  
  
It is strange to sleep alone  
In a place no one knows  
Strange to shelter under stones  
In a place water flows.  
  
It is safe to walk with me  
Where you can read the sky and stars,  
Safe to walk upon the sea  
In my sleep we can go far.  
  
It is safe to sleep alone  
In a place no one knows  
And to shelter under stones  
In a place water flows.  
  
It is strange to sleep alone  
In a place no one goes,  
Strange to seek life under stones.  
In my sleep no one knows.
