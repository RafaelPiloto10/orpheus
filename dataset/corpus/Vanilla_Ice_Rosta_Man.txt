[Intro]  
Strictly from the islands, vanilla ice  
The man jam down reggae music  
Mash it up ice, mash it  
[Verse 1]  
I got the rhyme to keep the body pumpin'  
Turn the party out while the people are jumpin'  
Reggae style at the top of my list  
Is hitting real hard like mike tyson's fist  
It is so good that the girlies goin' crazy  
Vanilla's on the mic and you know I'm not lazy  
I'm pumpin' up the lyrics in a smooth way  
I drop 'em like a bum rush much as what we say  
The other mc's try to duplicate  
But with the rosta man they just mediate  
[Chorus]  
Rosta man you be jammin' so smooth  
You rockin' on the mic and you can only improve  
Rosta man you know you sound so sweet  
I like the way you put the lyrics to the funky beat  
Ah rae rue, re rae rah  
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away  
Ah rae rue, re rae rah  
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away  
[Verse 2]  
Me and i, myself and you  
The rosta man, deshay and the rest of my crew  
Reggae music's been around for a while  
Vanilla ice is doin' it the hip hop style  
Because this is the one that we call the rae rue  
Everybody out there you know just what to do  
Just clap your hands and stomp your feet  
Move around to the sound of the reggae beat  
No push, no fall, no shove, no trip  
The rosta man wants you to get with it  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Well the people out there let me hear you scream  
If you want to get down and you want to be seen  
Then jump up my man, do the rosta man  
Move your head up and down to the reggae jam  
Just shake your arms and move your hips  
All you females out there let me shake your  
And just get down like you're makin' love  
All you people who believe in god above  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 4]  
From the ah rae rue, the re rae rah  
The jack tar village in jamaica  
Ocho rios or the way to kingston  
If we go back to the homeland again  
Back on tour from city to city  
Rollin' with the girls with the big, big ahhh..  
Pity the fool who step it to me  
I drop 'em like a fly, I better get the flea  
[Chorus]
