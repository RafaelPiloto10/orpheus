The blues are in the air tonight  
Love has gone and passed me by without a warning  
I light up another cigarette  
The pain hasn't hit me yet but I know it's comin'  
  
And your perfume lingers still upon my pillow case  
The tears just started fallin' down upon my face  
I lie here in the loneliness with this memory of you  
  
I don't know where you are tonight  
I'm starin' at the candlelight and I miss you, babe  
In the darkness here all by myself  
I imagine you with someone else, I'm gong crazy  
  
And with everything about you dancing in my head  
Girl, I sure am lonely in this empty bed  
I lie here in the loneliness with this memory of you  
  
And your perfume lingers still upon my pillow case  
And the tears just keep fallin' down upon my face  
I lie here in the loneliness with this memory of you  
  
The blues are in the air tonight  
Love has gone and passed me by
