Girls were made to take care of boys  
To be kind and dutiful  
Hmm  
Girls were made to take care of boys  
Made to share their sorrows  
Made to share their joys  
Made to help and guide them  
With ever a patient hand  
  
Made to give affection  
In the right direction  
(Always understand)  
  
Now boys may think they take care of girls  
Just because they pass on their fashions and their curls  
But I've always found  
It's just the other way around  
(Other way around)  
  
If you need the girl  
And declare you do  
(Tell her that you need her)  
She'll be there  
To take care of you  
(She'll be there)  
(Now boys may think they take care of girls  
Just because they're clever with their fashions and their curls)  
But I've always found  
It's just the other way around
