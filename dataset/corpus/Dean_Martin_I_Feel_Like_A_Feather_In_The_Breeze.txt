I feel like a feather in the breeze  
Riding on high, high in the sky  
Honey and I walking on air  
Since the moment that she told me she cared  
Feel like a feather in the breeze  
Floating through space in your embrace  
Dancing on clouds way up above  
Since the second that you beckoned my love  
I'm happy  
So happy when you're near  
My troubles just disappear  
As soon as you're by my side well I'm satisfied  
I feel like a feather in the breeze  
Having my fun, kissing the sun  
And it's because you are the one  
So I'm singing like the birdies in the trees  
And feeling like a feather in a breeze  
I'm happy  
So happy when you're near  
My troubles just disappear  
As soon as you're by my side well I'm satisfied  
I feel like a feather in the breeze  
Having my fun, kissing the sun  
And it's because you are the one  
So I'm singing like the birdies in the trees  
And feeling like a feather  
Feeling like a feather  
Feeling like a feather  
Feeling like a feather in the breeze
