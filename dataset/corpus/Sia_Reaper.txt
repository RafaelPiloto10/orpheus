[Verse 1]  
Broke down, thought that I would drown  
Hope that I've been found, 'fore I hit the ground  
Sun rays out the corner of my eye, hey  
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping  
Saw you sneaking in the shadow's dawn  
I feel so strong  
Saw you out the corner of my eye  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Don't come for me today  
I'm feeling good  
I'mma savor it  
Don't come for me today  
I'm feeling good  
I remember when  
(Reaper)  
  
[Chorus]  
You came to take me away  
So close I was to heaven's gates  
But no baby, no baby, not today  
Oh, you tried to track me down  
You followed me like the darkest cloud  
But no baby, no baby, not today  
(Reaper) Oh reaper  
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today  
(Reaper) Oh reaper  
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today  
  
[Verse 2]  
So come back when I'm good to go  
I got drinks to drink, and men to hold  
I got good things to do with my life, yeah  
Oh, I wanna dance in the open breeze  
Feel the wind in my hair, hear the ocean sing  
I got good things to feel in my life, yeah  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Don't come for me today  
I'm feeling good  
I'mma savor it  
Don't come for me today  
I'm feeling good  
I remember when  
(Reaper)  
  
[Chorus]  
You came to take me away  
So close I was to heaven's gates  
But no baby, no baby, not today  
Oh, you tried to track me down  
You followed me like the darkest cloud  
But no baby, no baby, not today  
(Reaper) Oh reaper  
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today  
(Reaper) Oh reaper  
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today  
  
[Outro]  
Reaper  
Reaper  
Reaper  
Reaper
