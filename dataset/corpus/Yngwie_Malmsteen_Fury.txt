I now will tell you all a story  
That no one ever heard before  
It is the tale about the fury  
Remember wisdom is your strength  
  
It said you're such a fool  
Just let my evil rule  
  
No, it's burning like a flame  
Now nothing seems the same  
I've lost control of mind and body  
My soul is in its hand  
It's wish is my command  
Enslaved forever by the fury  
By the fury, no!  
  
At first it came to me in visions  
And that was filling me with pain  
And when my fear became desire  
To let the demon burn my soul  
  
It said "Don't fight in vain,"  
"I'll make you love the pain."  
  
No, it's burning like a flame  
Now nothing seems the same  
I've lost control of mind and body  
My soul is in its hand  
It's wish is my command  
Enslaved forever by the fury  
By the fury, no!  
  
I now have told you all my story  
And still for you its not too late  
Don't draw your sword  
Just use your wisdom  
And never let this be your fate  
  
Oh, no it's here again  
This demon loves the pain  
  
No, it's burning like a flame  
Now nothing seems the same  
I've lost control of mind and body  
My soul is in its hand  
It's wish is my command  
Enslaved forever by the fury  
By the fury, no!
