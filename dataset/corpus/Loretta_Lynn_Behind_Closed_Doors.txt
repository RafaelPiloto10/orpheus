My baby makes me proud Lord don't he makes me proud  
He never makes a scene by hanging onto me in a crowd  
'Cause people like to talk Lord don't they love to talk  
But when they turn out the lights I know he'll be leavin' with me  
  
And when we get behind closed doors and I let my hair hang down  
And he makes me glad that I'm a woman  
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
  
My baby makes me smile Lord don't he make me smile  
He's never far away or too tired to say ah honey I want you  
I'm always a lady just like a lady should be  
But when they turn out the lights I show 'em what a woman I can be  
  
And when we get behind closed doors...  
Behind closed doors
