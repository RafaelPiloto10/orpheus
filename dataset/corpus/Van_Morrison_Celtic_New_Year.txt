If I don't see you through the week  
See you through the window  
See you next time that we're talking on the telephone  
And if I don't see you in that Indian summer  
Then I want to see you further on up the road  
  
I said, oh won't you come back?  
I have to see you my dear  
Want you come back in the Celtic New Year?  
In the Celtic New Year  
  
If I don't see you when I'm going down Louisiana  
If I don't see you when I'm down on Bourbon Street  
If you don't see me when I'm singing Jack of Diamonds  
If you don't see me when I'm on my lucky streak  
  
Woa, I want you, want you to come on back  
I've made it very clear  
I want you to come back home in the Celtic New Year  
Celtic New Year  
  
If I don't see you when the bonfires are burning, burning  
If I don't see you when we're singing the Gloriana tune  
If I've got to see you when it's raining deep inside the forest  
I got to see you at the waning of the moon  
  
Said oh, won't you come on back?  
Want you to be of good cheer  
Come back home on the Celtic New Year  
  
Celtic New Year, Celtic New Year  
Celtic New Year  
In the Celtic New Year  
In the Celtic New Year  
  
Come on home, come on home, come on home, come on home  
In the Celtic New Year
