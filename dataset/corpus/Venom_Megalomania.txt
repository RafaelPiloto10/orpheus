Well I feel something's taking me,I don't know where?  
It's like a trip inside a separate mind!  
The ghost of tomorrow,of my favorite dream,  
Is telling me to leave it all behind!  
Feel it slipping away,  
Slipping in tomorrow.  
Gotta get to happiness,  
From the depths of sorrow.  
I'm alright,am I right?  
As I try to get away from you now!  
Am I right?I'm alright,  
As I try to get away from you now!  
Sting Me!  
Well I feel something's giving me the chance to return,  
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul.  
A big bad demigod,fading away,  
I'm going back to where I'm in control!  
Feel it slipping away,  
Slipping in tomorrow.  
Getting back to Sanity,  
From the depths of sorrow.  
Was it wise,to disguise,  
As I try to get away from you now?  
Is there a way,I can pay,  
Or is it true I have to stay with you now?  
Was I right,Am I right,  
As I try to get away from you now?  
Was it wise,to disguise,  
As I try to get away from you now?  
Suck Me!  
I'm the King of schizophrenia,the pest of the Earth,  
I singed my soul in the fires of Hell!  
I feel someone eluding me,  
But now it's all mine!  
I set the trap and it was me who fell!  
Feel it slipping away,  
Slipping in tomorrow.  
Getting back to sanity,  
From the depths of sorrow.  
No more lies,I got wise,I despise the way I worship you, Yeah!  
Now your free,can't you see?yeah this time I won't be led by you, Yeah!  
Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
