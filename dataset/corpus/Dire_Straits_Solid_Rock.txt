Well take a look at that  
I made a castle in the sand  
Saying this is where it's at you know  
Couldn't understand now  
If I realised that the chances were slim  
How come I'm so surprised when the tide rolled in  
  
I want to live on solid rock  
I'm gonna live on solid rock  
I want to give I don't want to be blocked  
I'm gonna live on solid rock  
Well I'm sick of potential  
  
I'm sick of vanity now  
I'm sticking to essential reality now  
I don't know what's worse  
Try to make a silk purse  
Living an illusion living in confusion  
Well a house of cards  
Was never built for shock  
  
You could blow it down in any kind of weather  
Now two solid rocks two solid blocks  
You know they're gonna stick  
Yeah they're gonna stick together  
Because the heart that you break  
That's the one that you rely on  
The bed that you make  
That's the one you gotta lie on  
  
When you point your finger 'cause your plan fell through  
You got three more fingers pointing back at you  
I want to live on solid rock  
I'm gonna live on solid rock  
I want to give I don't want to be blocked  
I'm gonna live on solid rock
