Lyrics:  
Oh yeah  
Light it up  
There's no love where  
There's no life  
Where it's dark  
And we fuss and fight  
We've gotta lighten up  
We've gotta open up  
Everybody  
Gotta light the world up  
Any man  
Ain't that bad  
Neither is  
Being sad  
We gotta let it out  
Scream and shout  
Letting go is  
What it's all about  
Well it's time to give  
Be positive  
Open up  
Then you can live  
Just check your motive  
Make sure it's positive  
In everything you do  
There must be love  
Gotta light it up  
Light that world  
Oh yeah  
Here's the score  
No more war  
Just lots of love with  
Open doors  
To a higher realm  
Where hate is sensitive  
Remember open up and  
Love one and all  
You know what I'm talkin' about  
Just gotta lighten up
