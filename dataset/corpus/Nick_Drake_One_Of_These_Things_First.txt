I could have been a sailor, could have been a cook  
A real live lover, could have been a book.  
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock  
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock.  
I could be  
Here and now  
I would be, I should be  
But how?  
I could have been  
One of these things first  
I could have been  
One of these things first.  
  
I could have been your pillar, could have been your door  
I could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more.  
Could have been your statue, could have been your friend,  
A whole long lifetime could have been the end.  
I could be yours so true  
I would be, I should be through and through  
I could have been  
One of these things first  
I could have been  
One of these things first.  
  
I could have been a whistle, could have been a flute  
A real live giver, could have been a boot.  
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock  
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock.  
I could be even here  
I would be, I should be so near  
I could have been  
One of these things first  
I could have been  
One of these things first.
