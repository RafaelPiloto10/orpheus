This love has two stories  
One yours and one sublime  
This love has two beginnings  
One mine and one unkind  
This love has one pretender  
This love is to remember  
This love had two stories  
Must end with once upon a time  
There were two strangers  
And in time, the strangers met  
And fell in love with time  
In oh such danger  
And time, does not forget  
In the meantime,  
That's the way it goes.  
Meanwhile, once upon a time  
In the meantime, meanwhile  
This love has two meanings  
One sure and one to find  
This love has true feelings  
One yearning, one is blind  
This love should not surrender  
This love is to remember  
This love with two meanings  
Must end with once upon a time  
There were two strangers  
And in time, the strangers met  
And fell in love with time  
In oh such danger  
And time, does not forget  
In the meantime,  
that's the way it goes.  
Meanwhile, once upon a time  
In the meantime, meanwhile,  
That's the way it goes.  
Once upon a time  
In the meantime  
This love has one pretender  
This love will always remember  
This love with two stories  
Must end with once upon a time  
There were two strangers  
And in time, the strangers met  
And fell in love with time  
In oh such danger  
And time, does not forget  
In the meantime,  
That's the way it goes.  
Meanwhile, once upon a time  
This love had one pretender  
That's the way it goes  
This love will always be mine  
This love was once upon a time  
This love had one pretender  
That's the way it goes  
That's the way it has to be  
This love will always be mine  
Always you, always me  
This love had one pretender  
That's the way it goes  
The way its gotta be
