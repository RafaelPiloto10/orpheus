Driftin' in the streetlight  
Dancin' in the twilight zone  
Dreamin' of a spotlight  
Don't want to go back home  
  
Joe and his buddies are hangin' around  
  
Bad reputation all over the town  
All they ever gonna do  
Is talk, talk, talk, talk  
  
Lucy and Debbie and Donna and Joyce  
Bad reputation the same as the boys  
All they ever want to do  
Is walk, walk, walk, walk  
  
Standin' on the sidwalk  
Starin' at the storefront signs  
Waitin' at the bus stop, truck stop  
The hurry up and wait stop  
They don't mind  
  
Tony and Billy and Johnny and Sam  
Struttin' and showin' they don't give a damn  
All they ever gonna do  
Is talk, talk, talk, talk  
  
Cindy and Sunny and Sally and Sue  
Thinkin' they're somethin', they're better than you  
All they ever want to do  
Is walk, walk, walk, walk  
  
They're lookin' forward and movin' backwards fast  
They gotta have a future  
'Cause sure as hell ain't got no past  
But in the meantime  
  
They're lookin' forward and movin' backwards fast  
They gotta have a future  
'Cause sure as hell they got no past  
  
They always have a good time  
They never get a wake up call  
They're hangin' out at maisies and daisies  
They always love the crazies  
That ain't all  
  
Tony and Billy and Johnny and Sam  
Struttin' and showin' they don't give a damn  
But all they ever gonna do  
Is talk, talk, talk, talk  
  
Cindy and Sunny and Sally and Sue  
Thinkin' they're somethin', they're better than you  
All they ever want to do  
Is walk, walk, walk, walk
