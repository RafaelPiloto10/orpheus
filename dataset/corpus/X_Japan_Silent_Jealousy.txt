I'M LOOKING FOR YOU  
TRYING TO REACH YOUR ROSES  
CARRIED AWAY BY THE TIME  
seijaku no kyouki ni katame wo  
tsubusaseta mama  
  
YOU'VE GONE AWAY  
FROM THE STAGE LEAVING NO WORDS  
THERE'S JUST FAKE TEARS LEFT  
isuwari no shinju de kazatta  
bara no hanataba wo sagasu  
  
I'M BLIND INSANE  
IN THE RED OF SILENCE  
NOW I'VE LOST YOUR LOVE  
genkaku no ai ni kawareta  
ayatsuri ningyo  
  
GET ME ON MY FEET  
GET ME BACK TO MYSELF  
PRETEND YOU LOVE ME  
yubisaki made shinku ni somatta  
ore wo mitsumete  
  
moe taekirenai kodoku no SERENADE  
kyozou no umi ni nagashite  
yume kara sameta chimamire no tenshi wo  
mune ni daitemo  
I CAN NOT STOP  
  
SILENT JEALOUSY  
DON'T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE  
kanashimi ni midarete  
modorenai ai wo kazaru  
kurikaesu kodoku no naka ni  
  
TELL ME TRUE doko ni yukeba  
kurushimi wo aiseru  
I STILL WANT YOU LOVE ai wo tomete  
kurui saku kioku wo keshite  
  
I just wanted to stay with you  
I just wanted to feel your breath of grace  
I didn't know what to do  
I couldn't say anything  
when consciousness returned  
everything had been washed away  
by the tide of time, even you  
but the scars of memory never fade away  
I can't stop loving you  
stop my tears  
stop my loving  
kill my memories  
  
YOU DYED MY HEART IN BLOOD  
NO WAY TO KILL MY SADNESS  
tachisaru mae ni koroshite  
kyouki no ai ni dakareta hitomi wa  
nani mo mienai  
ima mo I MISS YOU  
CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU  
  
SILENT JEALOUSY yume ni ochite  
dakishimeru kioku wo  
STAY IN YESTERDAY toki wo tomete  
kurikaesu kodoku wo keshite  
TAKE ME BACK TO THE MEMORY, TO THE DREAM  
SILENT JEALOUSY  
DON'T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE  
kanashimi ni midarete  
KILL ME LOVE
