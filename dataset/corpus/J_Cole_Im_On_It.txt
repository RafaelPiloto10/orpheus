Yeah, my God, Science  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lord I've been dreaming about the paper  
I want it all  
I wanna shine, I wanna ball  
I want the whip with the suicide doors  
This is my life homie, you decide yours  
I've been dreaming about the paper  
I want it all  
I wanna shine, I wanna ball  
I want the whip with the suicide doors  
This is my life homie, you decide yours  
  
Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it  
Get on my level I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man  
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it  
So in case you aint heard, observe  
  
I'm bringing that fire, you know that flame throw  
I'm getting you high, I spittin' that brown sugar that Deanglo  
Just look in the sky  
A n-gga so fly I'm up here touching rainbow's  
Aint making it rain though  
No don't be silly mama, I'm no pinata  
Letting my paper fall, no way  
But if you feeling it, you can take it all and show me  
Don't fight the feeling mama  
Not Jeffrey Dahmer but your body is a killer mama  
I'm tryna rock that ass to sleep like pyjamas  
  
I'ma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot  
My palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox  
Haters wish they could, bitch, I'm bad meaning good  
I live my life like you should cause...  
  
Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it  
Get on my level I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man  
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it  
So in case you aint heard, observe  
  
And I'm back with that flame, I got that flow that'll blow your brain  
They calling me Cole yeah that's my name  
  
And just like Martin I know that pain  
No novacaine and wont complain never  
But spit it so hot whenever I drop a verse I change weather  
Now hey badder I'm dropping that Floyd Mayweather or rather Lebron james  
Rather so much better than these featherweight rappers I'm ahead of my time  
And never pressing rewind  
Now watch me shine,  
  
I'ma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot  
My palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox  
Haters wish they could, bitch, I'm bad meaning good  
I live my life like you should cause...  
  
Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it  
Get on my level I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man  
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it  
So in case you aint heard, observe  
  
(Watch me shine)  
Big plans  
(Watch me shine)  
Big things  
(Watch me shine)  
Big money  
(Watch me shine)  
Big dreams  
(Watch me shine)  
Big crib

Big screen

I'ma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot  
My palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox  
Haters wish they could, bitch, I'm bad meaning good  
I live my life like you should cause...  
  
Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it  
Get on my level I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man  
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it  
So in case you aint heard, observe
