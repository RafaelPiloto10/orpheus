Lord I fell for her smile  
And she loved me for a while  
Then she said good-bye gotta go  
Left me standing on the side of the road  
Now she's gone and I'm a memory in her past  
And the long and short of it some things never last  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh because summers come, summers go  
I'll keep walking down this road  
It's alright and it's okay  
I'll live to love another day  
I'll live to love another day  
  
Lord I'm out here again  
With my back to the wind  
The warm sun that's sinking low  
Is gonna leave me out in the cold  
But the long and short of it some things never last  
And if that goes for the good  
It must go for the bad  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I fall down  
I'm not ashamed  
I always get back up again  
But I'll be fine 'till the right one comes to save me, save me, save me  
  
Lord I fell for her smile  
And she loved me for a while  
And someday she's gonna wish  
She hadn't left me here like this  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll live to love another day  
I'll live to love another day  
I'll live to love another day
