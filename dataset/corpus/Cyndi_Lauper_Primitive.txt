My heart keeps beating me to death  
I see you move and I can't catch my breath  
I want to touch you with my lips  
I want to touch you with a kiss  
  
My heart keeps pounding like a fist  
I see you there and I just can't resist  
You make me tremble like this  
You make me tremble like a jellyfish  
  
It's primitive  
You got me  
Oh  
It's primitive  
You make me feel  
Primitive  
When you lock me in your arms  
You chain me to your heart  
...Oh  
  
I hear you calling out my name  
And when you talk your words they numb my brain  
You make this fire in me start  
I want to touch you with my heart  
  
I hear you whisper in the dark  
And when you touch me I just come apart  
I feel the fever in your hands  
We feel things we don't even understand  
  
It's primitive  
You got me  
Oh  
It's primitive  
You make me feel  
Primitive  
When you lock me in your arms  
You chain me to your heart  
...Oh  
It's animal  
  
Like the moon pulls at the tide  
I'm at your side  
The world in which we live  
  
It's primitive  
You got me  
Oh  
It's primitive  
You make me real  
Primitive  
When you lock me in your arms  
You chain me to your heart  
...Oh
