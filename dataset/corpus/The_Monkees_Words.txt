Girl, don't you know every time I see you smiling,  
It hurts so bad, cause when I see you, I start crying,  
I've tried everything to stop, but there's no denying,  
That falling in love with you, girl, is just like dying.  
  
Oh, don't walk away,  
How, how can I make you stay?  
Don't turn away,  
I can still hear you saying those words that never were true,  
Just spoken to help nobody but you,  
Words with lies inside,  
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.  
  
Girl, don't you know we could work it out with talking?  
You won't look around or slow down your walking,  
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,  
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it.  
  
Now, I'm standing here,  
Strange, strange voices in my ears,  
I feel the tears,  
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,  
Just spoken to help nobody but you,  
Words with lies inside,  
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh.
