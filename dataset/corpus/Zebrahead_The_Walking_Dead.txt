I'd rather be dead than to live like this  
Than to just exist a hand and no fist  
See the walking dead around me  
Waking up and breaking down before my eyes  
Rather be dead, rather shoot and miss  
Rather die for a kiss than to live like this  
  
Hear the walking dead surround me  
Giving in and giving up because  
  
[Chorus]  
We're all doing fine  
And we're falling fast behind  
I don't think we'll be the same again  
We're losing our minds  
We're all doing fine  
Is there anyplace to hide?  
I don't think we'll be the same again  
We're losing  
We're losing our minds  
  
We walk tonight  
  
I'd rather be dead than to have no hope inside  
Watch my will bleed away and my soul divide  
Feel the walking dead around me  
Getting closer moving farther from the light  
  
I'd rather be dead, stay alive to find  
Somewhere I belong, someone to call mine  
See the walking dead surround me  
See the life and see the death and now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Reach out  
I never get it  
It's just out of reach and  
I watch it slipping away  
Reach out  
Just forget it  
It's never good enough  
It's never going to be the same  
  
[Chorus: x2]
