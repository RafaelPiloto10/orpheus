Yeah!  
  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you  
  
And I want to say, it's not the same since you went away  
And it's not right, you're not here with me tonight  
And it's a crime, just lying here, wasting my precious time  
I'm so lonely and I'm so blue, thinkin' 'bout the things I could do to you  
  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you  
  
And I want to know, don't you see how you hurt me so  
Going out of my head, yeah I'm here in this empty bed  
And it's a crime, whoa, just lying here, wasting my precious time  
I'm so lonely, baby, I'm so blue  
Thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do to you  
  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, every night I rock myself to sleep  
Every night I rock myself to sleep, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you
