Countless long nights  
While I stare at the wall  
I ask myself over again...  
How did I end up  
In this little hell?  
How - did it ever begin?  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess  
Helpless to turn back the clock  
That ticks on  
With its cruel shiny face  
It laughs while it watches  
My every disgrace - I was  
Born a sap - all the  
Nurses laughed when they  
Saw me the first time  
They giggled and they said  
"This poor little monster'd be  
Better off dead."  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly trapped in a body  
I'm sure -  
Should have never been mine.  
I bet that my real one's  
Doing just fine - and I  
Don't belong here, I  
Don't belong here - I  
Should be quite rich  
With a big shiny car  
A house with twelve rooms  
I deserve to go far.  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly falling in love  
But does love  
Really last through the night?  
To love - To honor -  
To kick and to bite! and I  
Don't belong here, I  
Don't belong here  
It's all a mistake  
I was destined for greatness  
A leader, a prophet -  
They're just too blind to notice.  
Where did this whole silly story begin?  
It seems that my mind has gone -  
Blank.  
I think that I've messed up a chapter or two.  
Perhaps it is best if I'm frank!  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess -  
Helplessly lost like that  
Poor chap who came  
For an innocent dance.  
He left with his brain smeared  
All over his pants! cause he  
Didn't belong here, he  
Didn't belong here  
He never should've left  
That warm cage in a zoo!  
His face was so ugly  
What else could I do?  
Can you - really blame me, I  
Had to smash it.  
He left me no choice,  
He was just like the others.  
I just had to kill him.  
With my poor, dear, old  
Mother.  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly fucked in the ass  
By a legion of forty ex-cons  
That's what it feels like  
When you walk all over me.  
Don't belong here, I  
Don't belong here  
Your eyes burn right through me.  
They fill me with fear.  
I could've been at home  
Watching football, and drinking beer.  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess, so Helpless.
