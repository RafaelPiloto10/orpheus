She lived at the end of a little dirt road  
In a house where secrets go untold  
Barefoot in a cotton dress, dark hair in a tangled mess  
And a head full of crazy dreams  
She said  
  
I'm going to California  
A place where the sun always shines  
I'm goin' to California  
And I'm leavin' everything behind  
  
You can't help, but feel a little bit touched  
When your daddy loves you a little too much  
You can wish on four leaf clovers, but all the fields have been plowed  
Over  
And there's nothin' left to do but fly away  
  
I'm going to California  
A place where the sun always shines  
I'm goin' to California  
And I'm leavin' everything behind  
  
Stars burn like candles on that two-lane highway  
She made her wish, and disappeared on her eighteenth birthday  
And she said  
  
I'm going to California  
A place where the sun always shines  
I'm goin' to California  
And I'm leavin everything behind  
  
I'm goin' to California  
And I'm leavin' everything behind  
  
Oh California  
I'm goin to California  
  
Oh California  
Leavin' it all behind  
California...
