Broken windows and empty hallways,  
A pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey.  
Human kindness is overflowing,  
And I think it's gonna rain today.  
  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles,  
The frozen smiles to chase love away.  
Human kindness is overflowing,  
And I think it's gonna rain today.  
  
Lonely, lonely.  
Tin can at my feet,  
I think I'll kick it down the street.  
That's the way to treat a friend.  
  
Bright before me the signs implore me:  
Help the needy and show them the way.  
Human kindness is overflowing,  
And I think it's gonna rain today.  
  
Lonely, so lonely.  
Tin can at my feet,  
I think I'll kick it down the street.  
That's the way to treat a friend.  
  
Bright before me the signs implore me:  
Help the needy and show them the way.  
Human kindness is overflowing,  
And I think it's gonna rain today.
