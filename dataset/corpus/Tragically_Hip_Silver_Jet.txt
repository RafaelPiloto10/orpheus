There's a still in the night, a tuneless moonlight  
Just the, I need you and here's whys  
Snoring Gords and Cheryls, there's a heron outside  
Inviolate light, there's an urge to go  
A shadow, a heightened air of peril  
Your heart jumps too and my heart jumps too  
I think, to myself "I don't really know my heart?  
And as you whisper 'me too'  
Silver jet roars overhead rocks the nocturne  
All everglade and gray sheers  
Silver jet, so far off already, fought the hot spurs off  
All the way to Cape Spear  
It's quiet again when a car like Big Ben  
Radio dopplerin' and for all you Gregory Peck fans  
Let us now praise famous men  
To take some pressure off the wondrous to fight' and  
Your heart jumps to and my heart jumps too  
As if the wolves of North humberland themselves  
Were rumored to be en route,  
Silver jet, way overhead  
Yer an archipelago, a satellite, a green star  
Silver jet, so far off already  
With your I need you and here's why, flying to the next part  
Your heart jumps too and my heart jumps too  
I'm thinking, to myself, 'packing is a secret heart'  
And as you whisper, 'me too'  
Silver jet roars overhead  
Silver jet, flying to the next part  
Silver jet, so far off already  
Silver jet, a satellite, a green star  
Silver jet, way overhead  
Silver jet, everglade gray sheers  
Silver jet, so far off already  
Silver jet, Clayqout Sound and Cape Spear
