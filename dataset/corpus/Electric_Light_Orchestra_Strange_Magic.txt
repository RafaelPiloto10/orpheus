You're sailing softly through the sun  
In a broken stone-age dawn.  
You fly so high.  
  
I get a strange magic,  
Oh, what a strange magic,  
Oh, it's a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic,  
Got a strange magic.  
  
You're walking meadows in my mind,  
Making waves across my tide,  
Oh no, oh no.  
  
I get a strange magic,  
Oh, what a strange magic,  
Oh, it's a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic,  
Got a strange magic.  
  
Oh, I'm never gonna be the same again,  
Now I've seen the way it's got to end,  
Sweet dream, sweet dream.  
  
Strange magic,  
Oh, what a strange magic,  
Oh, it's a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic,  
Got a strange magic.  
  
It's magic, it's magic, it's magic.  
Strange magic,  
Oh, what a strange magic,  
Oh, it's a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic  
You know I got a strange magic
