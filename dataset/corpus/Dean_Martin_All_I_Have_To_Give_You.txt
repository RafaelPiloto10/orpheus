All I have to give to you is my love  
All I have to offer you is me  
I wish that I could give you more than just my love  
The world and its treasures, the sun, the moon, the stars above  
I'll build you castles towering to the sky  
We'll be next door to heaven  
You and I  
Until these things come true  
My love will have to do  
This is all I have to give to you  
I'll build you castles towering to the sky  
We'll be next door to heaven  
You and I  
Until these things come true  
My love will have to do  
This is all I have to give to you
