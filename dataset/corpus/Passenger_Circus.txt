Sick of begging  
Sick of trying to please  
Sick of the struggle  
Sick of your fake id  
  
If I ever feel your scent again  
you're one fist to close  
  
If I ever see your shadow again  
you're going down the hard way  
They call me the comedy clown  
They feed me waste in the gutter  
They call me the comedy clown  
I am waste in the gutter  
  
If I ever see you again  
I'll be close to my grave  
If I ever lie to you again  
I'll be dirt
