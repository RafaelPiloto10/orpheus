Had our number changed today although I hated to  
But each time the phone would ring they'd want to speak to you  
And it hurts to tell them you're not here with me  
Maybe now oh telephone will let me be  
It's not in the book now so you'd better write it down  
Just in case your love for me should ever come around  
You might want to call and break the news to me  
Just dial Lonesome 7-7203  
  
I keep the telephone beside me all the time  
Hoping you might want to call and say you've changed your mind  
If you do then darling you know where I'll be  
I'm at Lonesome 7-7203  
You're the only one I'm givin' our new number to  
So now if the telephone should ring I'll know it's you  
If you ever long for love that used to be  
Just call Lonesome 7-7203
