Billy solves his problems by calling up his mom  
Heather solves her problems with drugs and Alcohol  
Daniel solves his problems with a doctor and the law  
But Malcolm has his own way and it's better than them all  
CHORUS  
'Cause Malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw  
And he never has the same problem twice  
Whether it's a bill or a cheque arriving late  
Rancid marble cheese or a steak that's second rate  
Awful TV programs or a broken ELvis plate  
Or his fiancee who dumps him because he's gaining weight  
CHORUS  
Aaaaggghhh Aaaaggghhh  
Problem solved
