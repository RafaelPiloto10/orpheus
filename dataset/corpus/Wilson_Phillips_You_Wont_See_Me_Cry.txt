I wish I had all you ever wanted.  
I'd give it right to you.  
But I don't have it.  
How could I ever find it?  
The strength to let you go, 'cause I don't have it.  
When will I have it?  
And it goes and it goes on.  
And it goes on.  
  
You won't see me cry.  
You know I decided.  
that I'm gonna pull myself together and find a way to fight it.  
I'm gonna have to hide it.  
You won't see me cry.  
You won't see me cry.  
  
I've got no choice but to face it.  
I have to let you know that I don't like it.  
My love is good for someone and it may take some time,  
but I will find him.  
Why should I waste it?  
When I go, (when I go)  
when I go on, I will go on.  
  
You won't see me cry.  
You know I decided.  
that I'm gonna pull myself together and find a way to fight it.  
Oh no. Even if I have to hide it.  
You won't see me cry.  
You won't see me cry.  
You won't see me cry.  
  
You know I decided. That I'm gonna pull myself together  
I finally decided and I found the way to fight it.  
So you won't see me cry.
