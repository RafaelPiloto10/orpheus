His after moan though cries oh no  
He's building up a shine but he take it slow  
And he knows it time to make a change here And time to get away  
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons And time to end the pain  
But he sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we Sleep all day over again  
Why don't we?  
  
She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord  
Would he take it all back what they've done  
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands  
That was my old man and he said  
If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it  
  
Oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie  
Recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there  
Going nowhere but for us, nowhere but for the two of us  
And we knew it was time to take a chance here  
And time to compromise our lives for awhile  
And it was time for all the wrong reasons  
But time is often on my side and I give it to you tonight  
And we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again  
  
As time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro
mile wide  
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in hot summer sun  
To swim beneath or over outside as they're reading between the lines  
Then they remember the part in the hallmark card where they read about the
dreams  
And reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to  
And they knew it was time, time to take a chance here  
Time to compromise our little lives for just a little while  
And they knew it was time for all the wrong reasons  
As time is often on my side and I give it to you, oh boy  
And we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again  
  
She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord  
Would he take it all back what they've done  
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands  
That was my old man and he said  
If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it
