Renegade  
come here boy  
There was this kid in our neighborhood  
His Pop had named him Renegade  
He lived up to his name  
With all the trouble that he made  
Renegade  
Come here boy  
Renegade  
Come here boy  
One day ol' Renegade  
Snuck into the Park Theater downtown  
For a laugh he set fire to the screen  
Burnt the whole damn place to the ground  
He thought that no one would mind  
He did that sort of thing all the time  
But his Pop was waitin' for him  
At age fifteen Renegade  
Stole a tow truck from Arnie's Shell  
Drove it through the front of a hardware store  
Spent the night in a county jail  
He didn't seem to mind a bit  
He liked the attention he would get  
Renegade  
Come here boy
