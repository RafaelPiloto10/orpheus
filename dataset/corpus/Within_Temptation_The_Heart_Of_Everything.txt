Nor the pain and the sorrow caused by my mistakes  
Won't repent to a mortal whom is all to blame  
Now I know I won't make it  
There will be a time we'll get back our freedom  
They can't break what's inside  
  
I'll face it cause it's the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes  
Save yourself from fading away now, don't let it go  
Open up your eyes  
See what you've become, don't sacrifice  
It's truly the heart of everything  
  
(Open up your eyes, open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes, it's the heart of everything  
Open up your eyes, open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes, open up your eyes)  
  
Stay with me now I'm facing my last solemn hour  
Very soon I'll embrace you on the other side  
Hear the crowd in the distance, screaming out my faith  
Now their voices are fading, I can feel no more pain  
  
I'll face it cause it's the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes  
Save yourself from fading away now, don't let it go  
Open up your eyes  
See what you've become, don't sacrifice  
It's truly the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes  
Save yourself from fading away now, don't let it go  
Open up your eyes  
See what you've become, don't sacrifice  
It's truly the heart of everything
