You came to me and told me it was over  
You assured me you wouldn't need him anymore  
But that look upon your face is too familiar  
It was long ago, but I've been there before  
  
And this song is like a movie that we might as well pretend  
From the moment as the camera closes in  
Just say it one more time with feeling  
One more time like you really mean it  
The last time you told me you loved me  
I almost believed you  
  
If I'd never realized what I was asking for  
I'd be confused upon the the presence of your pain  
Though your smile cannot disguise the hurt within you  
It appears upon the mention of his name  
  
But most of all the strangest thing  
It's hard for me to bear  
That the words that should be music to my ears  
  
Say it one more time with feeling  
One more time like you really mean it  
The last time you told me you loved me  
I almost believed it  
  
Sometimes I wish that you'd save that line for someone else  
Do you want me to believe what you don't believe yourself  
Well, let's not talk about it now  
In my life I've made mistakes  
This is just one chance I'll have to take  
  
So let's carry on with the story  
Try and shoot the scene again  
As the moment that the camera closes in  
Just say it one more time with feeling  
One more time like you really mean it  
The last time you told me that you loved me  
  
I almost believed you (I almost believed you)  
Say it one more time (I almost believed you)  
One more time with feeling (I almost believed you)  
Almost, I almost believed you  
One more time with feeling
