The day begins with CNN  
And it looks like WWIII  
The forecast calls for freezing rain  
It doesn't matter much to me  
  
The Wheel of Fortune never turns  
It's all insanity  
Have you seen her my friend?  
I've been up all night  
  
I've been out all day  
Though I try to pretend  
That she's still in town  
And I'll be ok  
  
Till I can hear her footsteps  
Outside my door again  
I'll wonder if she's lonely like me  
Oh, no! no!  
  
Have you seen her my friend?  
The dreams I have are troubled dreams  
I thought that I could change  
The winter's come inside my head  
  
And it's blowing through my brain  
The road I'm on won't straighten out  
So here I go again  
Have you seen her my friend?  
  
I've been up all night  
I've been out all day  
Though I try to pretend  
That she's still in town  
  
And I'll be ok  
Till I can hear her footsteps  
Outside my door again  
I'll wonder if she's lonely like me  
  
Oh, no! no!  
Have you seen her my friend?  
And if she calls you  
Say hello  
  
Don't tell her how things are  
The sun may shine tomorrow  
Tomorrow baby  
Maybe tomorrow  
  
I just don't know  
Have you seen her my friend?  
I've been up all night  
I've been out all day  
  
Though I try to pretend  
That she's still in town  
And I'll be ok  
Have you seen her my friend?  
  
I've been up all night  
Out all day  
Though I try to pretend  
That she's still in town  
  
And I'll be ok  
Cause I can feel her  
I can sense her  
I can feel her everywhere  
  
I can feel her  
I can sense her  
I can breathe her  
  
In the air  
In my world  
I can sense her  
I believe  
  
And I still care  
I can feel her  
And I know she's  
In my world  
  
She's everywhere  
She's everywhere  
I can feel her  
Everywhere
