I got no time to eat  
I got no time to sleep  
I got a truck full of stuff  
Should've been there last week  
I've been livin' in truck stops  
My body feels used  
Got the hamburger that's right, yeah  
The kentucky fried blues  
  
Flyin' high in my cab  
Got my foot on the gas  
Got to get there tonight  
Showin' nothin' but a pass  
Tired of livin' in truck stops, have mercy  
My body feels used  
Got the hamburger, that's right, yeah  
Kentucky fried blues  
  
Even in the fast lane  
Seems to slow down my brain  
Got one hell of a deadline  
Riggers do not complain  
Tired of livin' in truck stops  
Lord my body feels used  
Got the hamburger that's right yeah, yeah, yeah  
Kentucky fried blues.
