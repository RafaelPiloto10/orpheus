Can't breathe, can't sleep, crazy, what you do to me  
Head is smokin', feeling my heart is open  
So hazy, but it's alright, you take me, to the dark side  
Dangerous, but I'm fearless  
  
My eyes are blue but I'm seeing red  
And I just can't shake you outta my head  
Maybe maybe maybe, maybe maybe maybe  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
Ever get the feeling where you're miles away  
Everybodys looking at me walking, stumbling  
Hardly talking, mumbling, going red in the face  
Promise I've been drinkin' only lemonade, it's all I take  
My hearts just on one about someone  
And I'm a little bit love drunk  
  
Feelin' so hot, I'm taking your clothes off  
Glasses steamed up, I'm dreaming that no one can see us  
  
Lying underneath the stars, Jupiter hits on mars  
And it hits me so hard  
  
My eyes are blue but I'm seeing red  
And I just can't shake you outta my head  
Maybe maybe maybe, maybe maybe maybe  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
Ever get the feeling where you're miles away  
Everybodys looking at me walking, stumbling  
Hardly talking, mumbling, going red in the face  
Promise I've been drinkin' only lemonade, it's all I take  
My hearts just on one about someone  
And I'm a little bit love drunk  
  
Trippin' on the floor  
Freaky love for sure  
Still I need you more  
You knock me down with those eyes  
And do it every time  
Can't shake you out of my mind  
  
Just a little bit love drunk heading the crowd  
And that will never be a hater that can bring us down  
I've been slurring my words and I don't know what to say  
But it's a feeling that I believe in, never felt this way  
  
And I swear I don't even like anything  
They call me love drunk cuz I'm far from tipsy  
They call me love drunk, what are you doing to me?  
They call me love drunk cuz I'm far from tipsy  
  
My eyes are blue but I'm seeing red  
And I just can't shake you outta my head  
Maybe maybe maybe, maybe maybe maybe  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
Ever get the feeling where you're miles away  
Everybodys looking at me walking, stumbling  
Hardly talking, mumbling, going red in the face  
Promise I've been drinkin' only lemonade, it's all I take  
My hearts just on one about someone  
And I'm a little bit love drunk  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
My eyes are blue but I'm seeing red  
I'm a little bit love drunk
