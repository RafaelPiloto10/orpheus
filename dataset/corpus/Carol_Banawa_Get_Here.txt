With Juddha Paolo  
  
You can reach me by railway  
You can reach me by trailway  
You can reach me on an airplane  
You can reach me with your mind  
You can reach me by caravan  
Cross the desert like an Aram man  
I don't care how you get here  
Just - get here if you can -  
You can reach me by sail boat  
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope  
Take a sled and slide down the-slope  
Into these arms of mine  
You can jump on a speedy colt  
Cross the border in a blaze of hope  
I don't care how you get here  
Just get here if you can  
There are hills and mountains between us  
Always something to get over  
If I had my way, surely you would be closer  
I need you closer  
  
You can windsurf into my life  
Take me up on a carpet ride  
You can make it in a big balloon  
But you better make it soon'  
You can reach me by caravan  
Cross the desert like - an Arab man  
I don't care how you get here, just - get here  
If you can  
I don't care how you get here, just --get  
Here if - you can
