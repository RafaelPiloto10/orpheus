If you're gonna be true to me  
First you've got to be true to yourself  
Oh yeah  
It don't matter about nobody else  
Oh no  
If it's there in your mind  
  
It's a lesson I've just come to learn  
Something  
That I've only just begun to learn  
Oh yeah  
For the very first time  
For the very first time  
  
Angel above my head  
Calling my name in different places  
Angel above my head  
Saying it's alright to show your face to the world  
  
Everything seems new to me  
Such a very recent turn of events  
And the truth  
Just doesn't make any sense  
Oh no  
For the very first time  
  
If we had another year or two  
I would spend it being near to you  
Oh yeah  
Like the very first time  
Like the very first time  
  
Angel above my head  
Calling my name in different places  
Angel above my head  
Saying it's alright to show your face now  
  
Angel above my head  
Tapping me gently on my shoulder  
That angel above my head  
Saying it's time to be growing older, my friend  
  
If you wanna be true to me  
First you've got to be true to yourself  
Oh yeah  
It don't matter about nobody else  
Oh no  
Keep me there in your mind  
I'll be there by your side
