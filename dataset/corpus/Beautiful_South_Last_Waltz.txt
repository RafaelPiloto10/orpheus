Don't feel bad if you wake up feeling suddenly old  
More the realisation that you've let yourself be covered by mould  
Age is not something you wrap up if you're feeling the cold  
It's a laugh ten times harder at a joke eleven times told  
  
Down to the churchyard, check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz  
  
Don't feel bad if you're feeling past you sell-by date  
Like the roller coaster ride slowed down to a serious debate  
Oh the weather you tell them you're ready or whether you wait  
Does someone place a hand on your shoulder you point the way to the gate  
  
Down to the churchyard, check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz  
  
You don't count the birthdays 'til your out on your own  
They come thicker and faster and too damn late to postpone  
And wisdom's the last thing the scientists willing to clone  
Science advances, maturity dances alone
