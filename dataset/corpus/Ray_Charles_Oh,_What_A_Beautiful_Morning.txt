There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,  
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,  
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye,  
An' it looks like its climbin' clear up to the sky.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Oh what a beautiful morning,  
Oh what a beautiful day,  
I've got a wonderful feeling,  
Everything's going my way.  
  
All the cattle are standing like statues,  
All the cattel are standing like statues,  
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by.  
But a little brown mav'rick is winking her eye.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the sounds of the earth are like music,  
All the sounds of the earth are like music,  
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree,  
And an ol' Weepin' Willer is laughin' at me.
