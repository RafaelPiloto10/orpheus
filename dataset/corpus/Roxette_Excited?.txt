When the day gets dark  
Over a thousand streets  
And you feel your heart  
Is a living beat  
  
When you're all alone  
And you close your eyes  
Naked to the bone  
The dream comes alive  
  
Do you get excited  
When I touch you in the night?  
My oh my...  
Do you get excited  
When I meet you every night?  
You won't let the night pass you by  
  
When your body's hot  
The window's open wide  
This moment's all you got  
In this race of life  
  
When you feel the fire  
Is getting close to you  
Hey baby, you know  
I' m lonely too  
  
Do you get excited  
When I touch you in the night?  
My oh my...  
Do you get excited  
When I meet you every night?  
You won't let the night pass you by  
  
Do you get excited  
When I touch you in the night?  
My oh my...  
Do you get excited  
When I meet you every night?  
You won't let the night pass you by  
  
I wanna know  
  
I gotta know
