Got to work late 'cause my alarm was busted  
The boss chewed me out and everybody's disgusted  
'Cause it's just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
I lost one of my socks in the drier  
I can't find my wallet and my hair is on fire  
Just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
I just wrapped my Cadillac around a tree  
A big swarm of locusts is following me  
There's not even anything good on TV  
It's just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
Left all my Beatles records out in the sun  
Got a Coke bottle stuck on the end of my tongue  
It's just one of those days  
Gonna be one of those days  
  
The Nazis tied me up and covered me with ants  
And I spilled toxic waste on my brand new pants  
Just one of those days  
Ever have one of those days?  
  
The bank called me up and told me I'm overdrawn  
Some freaks are burnin' crosses out on my front lawn  
And I can't believe it, all the Cheetos are gone!  
It just...just one of those, one of those days  
Just one of those, one of those days  
  
The F.B.I. has got a tap on my phone  
Those darn Russian spies won't leave me alone  
Shouldn't have got up this morning, shoulda known  
It's just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
A 747 crashed into my den  
And there's nothin' but tater tots for dinner again  
It's just one of those days  
Never mind, it's just one of those days  
  
Big steamroller just ran over my mom  
And I cut myself shaving and they're dropping the bomb  
It's just one of those days  
That's all, it's just one of those days  
  
Then late at night, just before I go to bed  
The world blows up and now everybody's dead  
You just can't deny it, it's just like I said  
Just...just one of those, one of those days  
Just one of those days, one of those days
