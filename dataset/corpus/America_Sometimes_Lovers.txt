Sometimes there are teardrops across your face  
Sometimes there are rainbows in the same place  
And I don't know which way to turn  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
And sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  
I know sometimes we act just the same  
Your heart's in the city, it wears me down  
No love, no pity, in this town  
And I don't know which way to turn  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
And sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  
I know baby  
Hold on tight to me mama  
Tell me what went wrong  
I'm alright I will lay beside you  
Till the night is gone  
Ah, oo ...  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
And sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
Sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame
