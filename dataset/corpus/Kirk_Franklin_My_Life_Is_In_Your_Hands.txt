You don't have to worry  
And don't you be afraid  
Joy comes in the morning  
Troubles they don't last always  
For there's a friend named Jesus  
Who will wipe your tears away  
And if your heart is broken  
Just lift your hands and say  
  
Oh  
I know that I can make it  
I know that I can stand  
No matter what may come my way  
My life is in your hands  
  
With Jesus I can take it  
With Him I know I can stand  
No matter what may come my way  
My life is in your hands  
  
So when your tests and trials  
They seem to get you down  
And all your friends and loved ones  
Are nowhere to be found  
Remember there's a friend named Jesus  
Who will wipe your tears away  
And if you heart is broken  
Just lift your hands and say  
  
Oh  
I know that I can make it  
I know that I can stand  
No matter what may come my way  
My life is in your hands  
  
With Jesus I can take it  
With Him I know I can stand  
No matter what may come my way  
My life is in your hands
