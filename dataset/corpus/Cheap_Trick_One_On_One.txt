Reputation is a fragile thing  
Fame and money don't mean much to me  
Oh, don't go change to prove the point  
It doesn't matter, oh no  
  
We've had our problems and we've had our fun  
Did a lot of livin' on the run  
Oh don't go cover up the truth  
Cause we're together, oh yeah  
  
One on one, one on one  
It's you and me against the world  
It's one on one  
  
Head is spinning and your mouth is dry  
Happiness you couldn't find or buy  
Oh, ever want something so bad you could taste it?  
  
Made the deadline and you passed the test  
Sabotage seems safer than success  
Put it off until tomorrow  
I've hear it all before  
  
But it's one on one, one on one  
It's you and me against the world  
It's one on one  
  
I need some time to think the whole thing over  
You say you want to save the world alone  
I want to taste and test the waters with you  
It's not so easy when you're on your own  
  
Don't lie to me is all i ask of you  
No excuses i just want the truth  
Reputation is a fragile thing  
I know you know it, well it's  
One on one, one on one  
It's you and me against the world  
It's one on one  
  
One on one, one on one  
It's you and me against the world  
It's one on one
