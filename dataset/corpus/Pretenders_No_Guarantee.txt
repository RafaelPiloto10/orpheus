No guarantee  
Is what I'm getting today  
Appetite's so rampant  
And they're demanding money  
Everybody wants a good time  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
And wild terms to agree  
No credit taken  
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  
No guarantee  
  
No guarantee  
When we kiss  
Your lips are tempting  
Well, baby, listen to this  
Gotta have some action  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You know I got to be free  
Contracts are binding  
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  
No guarantee  
  
Guarantee, my baby  
Guarantee, my love  
  
Guarantee me for a month of good Sundays  
Promise me every single one'll be fun days  
Give me a dime for every party revolution  
Launder my debts in paragorical solution  
Even the boss has been slandered and slagged  
Now he's sitting in the alley  
With a bottle in a paper bag  
  
No guarantee  
When we play  
Turn the house lights up, Bob  
Fellas look over day!  
This hall is empty  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Up to seventeen B  
But what's depressing  
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  
No guarantee  
  
Guarantee me  
Guarantee, baby  
Guarantee, my love  
Oh, guarantee when you're coming in me  
You got a rubber on, baby  
Guarantee when I love you for free  
I'm gonna pay one day  
Oh, guarantee  
When you sock it to me  
When you punch it to me  
When you hook it to me  
When you knock it to me  
When you talk it to me  
You guarantee, my love  
Oh!
