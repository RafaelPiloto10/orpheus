When you're feeling lost and blue  
When there is no love for you  
You'll find him and it's all right  
It's all right, it's all right  
When you're feeling down and low  
When you've got no place to go  
And when no one smiles hello  
He's by your side, you know  
When you're getting deaf and blind  
When you drag one leg behind  
And when you're finally gonna  
Lose your mind  
It's all right, it's all right  
It's all right  
'Cause he is by your side  
'Cause he will be your guide  
'Cause he will be your light  
And you're not alone, you're not alone  
You're not alone, you're not alone
