Can't we leave the world outside  
Just for a while? Just for a while?  
And spend some time, you and I,  
Under this bright glorious sky.  
  
It's been so long since I first saw you,  
But I still love that smile in your eyes.  
  
Yes it's true, right from the start,  
I believed in the church of your heart.  
Yes it's you that made me be part of  
And believe in the church of your heart.  
  
Step inside, lay yourself down  
Just for a while, rest for a while.  
I can hear a thundering sound  
Beating inside when you're around.  
  
It's been so long since I first met you,  
Since we made love, you know how time flies.  
  
Yes it's true, right from the start,  
I believed in the church of your heart.  
Yes it's you that made me be part of  
And believe in the church of your heart.  
In the church of your heart.
