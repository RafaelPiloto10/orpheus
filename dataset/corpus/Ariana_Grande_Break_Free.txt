[Verse 1]  
If you want it, take it  
I should have said it before  
Tried to hide it, fake it  
I can't pretend anymore  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
You were better, deeper  
I was under a spell  
Like a deadly fear I am, babe  
On the highway to hell  
  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am  
  
[Bridge]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
(Our love baby, oooh)  
The thought on your body  
I came alive  
It was lethal  
It was fatal  
In my dreams it felt so right  
But I woke up and pretend  
Oh baby  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more
