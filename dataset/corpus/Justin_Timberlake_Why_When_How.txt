Do  
Do do do doooooo  
Dooo doooo  
Oooo  
Mmmmm  
  
You're still captivating  
Even though it's been so long  
You used to love me  
Tell me baby what went wrong  
'cause now you march to a beat of a different song  
I try to understand that we needed space  
But everywhere I turn I see your face  
And I've been wating for you to come home  
'cause I don't want to be alone  
Still Love you  
  
Why did you take away your love  
When did you think to just give up  
How am I suppose to carry on now  
With you  
You were my life  
  
I have changed girl since I last saw you  
When you left you don't know what you put me through  
But my heart still racing just being next to you  
I can't escape the magic in your eyes  
Is there a way to make you realize  
There is no one more special to my heart  
But you want us to be apart  
Still Love  
  
Why did you take away your love  
When did you think to just give up  
How am I suppose to carry on now  
With you  
  
You were my world  
You ment everything to me  
Your the air I breathe,  
The song I sing  
You were my queen  
I was your King  
But if we can try to work it out  
We'll show the world what love is about  
  
Baby come home  
'cause I can't no more  
Of this loneliness and emptiness  
  
Why did you take away your love  
When did you think to just give up  
How am I suppose to carry on now  
Without you  
  
Why did you take away your love  
When did you think to just give up  
How ami suppose to carry on  
Without you  
You were my life
