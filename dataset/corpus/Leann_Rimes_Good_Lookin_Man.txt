I've been catchin' a glance, do you like what you see?  
Even across the rrom, your eyes been talkin' to me.  
Easy to tell you've turned some heads  
In your day  
Hopin' you'll choose the next slow dance  
To walk my way  
  
Nothin' like a good lookin'.  
Good lookin' man.  
More 'bout you than meets the eye.  
I want to know first hand.  
Baby I've got this strong feelin'.  
Strong as a woman can.  
I'm lookin' into the face of love,  
And it's a good lookin' man.  
  
Hod did you get sweet fit  
Right in each of thos arms?  
Talkin' as if we're all alone,  
Workin' your charm.  
I'm likin' that edgy temper,  
You try not to show.  
Notice the shyness in the way,  
You smile real slow.  
  
Nothin' like a good lookin'.  
Good lookin' man.  
More 'bout you than meets the eye.  
I want to know first hand.  
Baby I've got this strong feelin'.  
Strong as a woman can.  
I'm lookin' into the face of love,  
And it's a good lookin' man.  
  
Come a little closer ...  
Closer yet ...  
The longer and longer I'm with you,  
The better and better you get!!!  
  
Nothin' like a good lookin'.  
Good lookin' man.  
More 'bout you than meets the eye.  
I want to know first hand.  
Baby I've got this strong feelin'.  
Strong as a woman can.  
I'm lookin' into the face of love,  
And it's a good lookin' man.  
  
Come a little closer ...  
Closer yet ...  
Oooooooh, Closer yet ....
