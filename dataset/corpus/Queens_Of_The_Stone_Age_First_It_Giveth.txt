I'm in you  
You're in me  
I can't tell  
  
You're so cruel  
More than me  
It is true  
That's right  
  
Loyal to  
Only you  
Up your sleeve  
  
I want some (come on, take it)  
Of all of you (it's yours)  
Trickin' me  
  
First it give'th  
Then it take'th away  
  
I would beg  
I would plead  
I would shake  
  
On a hook  
Dangling  
By the way  
  
I'm so young  
And beautiful  
(That's right)  
(I'm slick)  
I'm no fool  
  
Time goes by  
Tables turn  
Now I know  
  
First it give'th  
Then it take'th away
