Smiles, I was taught never to smile  
I was told the stylish smiles of buffoonery  
Chicanery and larceny abound  
My mom said unless someone sticks you right in front of a camera  
A smile is the last thing that you wanna do  
Those smiles, those mirthless toothy smiles  
Smiles, they all smile on tv  
The quizmaster with his withered crones  
The talkshow hosting movie stars, the politician licking feet  
The mugger, the rapist, the arsonic lover  
All smile out from the news, at one time or another  
Those smiles, those garish sickly smiles  
When I was young my mother said to me  
Never, ever, let anyone see that you're happy  
Smiles, never, ever let them see you smile  
They'll always put you down  
With those smiles, never, ever let them see you smile  
They'll always put you down  
With your smiles, never, ever let them see you smile  
Don't you know they'll make you go  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)  
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
