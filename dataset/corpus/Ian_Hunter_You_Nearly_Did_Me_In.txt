See lonely shadows - silver needles  
Abandoned in the evening war  
Lost children of the night - come catch the candle bright  
I hear a hollow sound - falling to the ground - she's lost before she's found  
  
Sad broken angels takin' rainbows  
Out on the street for all to see  
If we are the chosen few - what ever happened to  
All those things we knew, if this is being free -  
I'd rather search for me  
  
You nearly did, you nearly did, you nearly did  
You nearly did me in, you nearly did me in  
And I need some place to hide - my weary anger down  
  
Out on some misty distant highway  
Feel like I though a million miles  
Is my search nearly done - I think I see someone  
I get the urge to run on blindly through the rain,  
and I fool myself again  
  
You nearly did, you nearly did, you nearly did  
You nearly did me in, you nearly did me in  
And I need some place to hide - my weary anger down  
  
What ever happened to dignity  
What ever happened to integrity  
What ever happened to honesty  
Well I'll tell you something baby - I feel the pain just like the sea  
  
You nearly did, you nearly did, you nearly did  
You nearly did me in, you nearly did me in  
And I need some place to hide - my weary anger down
