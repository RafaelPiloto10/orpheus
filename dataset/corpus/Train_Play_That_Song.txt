[Chorus]  
Play that song  
The one that makes me go all night long  
The one that makes me think of you  
That's all you gotta do  
  
[Verse 1]  
Hey mister DJ when you gonna spin it  
My baby's favorite record  
She been waiting for a minute  
She invited all her friends  
And I'm buying all the rounds  
And they're all dolled up  
DJ please don't let me down  
When you gonna play that song, now  
When you gonna earn that pay  
When you gonna play that song  
And make my day  
  
She said  
  
[Chorus]  
Play that song  
The one that makes me go all night long  
The one that makes me think of you  
That's all you gotta do  
Hey  
  
Play that song  
The one the makes me stay out till dawn  
The one that makes me go oo  
That's all you gotta do  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hey Mr. guitar  
When you gonna strum it  
My girl just heard this song  
And you should play it cause she loves it  
Can you get me off the hook  
Get them fingers picking now  
I'll throw some money in your cup  
Mister please don't let me down  
  
When you gonna play that song, now  
Why you gotta hesitate  
When you gonna playthat song  
And make my day  
  
She said  
  
[Chorus]  
Play that song

The one that makes me think of you  
That's all you gotta do
