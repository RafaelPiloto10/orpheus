(June 7, 1969)  
  
1.  
I feel the ocean swaying me ...  
washing away all my pains.  
See where I was wounded,  
Remember the scar ?  
Now you can't see a thing ...  
And I feel no pain --  
  
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets  
Green and blue ... Canyons too  
Singing about Atlantis love songs.  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.  
  
2.  
  
Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining  
Telling me where I came from --  
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he  
lays in -- ... on the Burning  
edge Horizon.  
  
I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ...  
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam --  
See the wind make love to all  
the ocean ... Joy spread and  
the massage got home --  
  
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ...  
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord  
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising --  
  
3.  
  
Look out East coast, but you're  
gonna have a neighbor,  
A rebirth land ...  
the praying Burning Sands.  
  
We know there were worlds  
so much older ...  
And they shall rise, and  
tell us much more the truth of man --  
  
4.  
  
I see visions of sleeping peaks  
erupting ...  
releasing all hell that  
will shake the Earth from end to end --  
And this ain't bad news, good news,  
or any news ... it's just the truth,  
Better save your souls while  
you can --  
  
Singing about the New Valleys  
of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean,  
the world is gonna be ...  
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ...  
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.
