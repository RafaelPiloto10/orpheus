(David Olney)  
  
Man you should have seen me way back then  
I could tell a tale, I could make a spin  
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night  
Not only that I could tell you why  
Back then I could really tel a lie  
  
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame  
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again  
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick  
I was takin' everything they had to give  
It wasn't all that bad a way to live  
  
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell  
But no one's buyin' what I got to sell  
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk  
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day  
But everyone just turns and walks away  
  
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time  
So I head across the road to drink some wine  
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street  
You're pretty good if I do say myself  
But the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin' else  
  
Instead of callin' out for fire from above  
He just gets real quiet and talks about love  
And I'll tell you somethin' funny He didn't want nobody's money  
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means  
But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen  
  
Well since that time every town is the same  
I can't make a dime, I don't know why I came  
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him  
He has everyone convinced that he's for real  
Well I figure we can work us out a deal  
  
So he offers me a job and I say fine  
He says I'll get paid off on down the line  
Well I guess I'll string along Don't see how too much can go wrong  
As long as he pays my way I guess I'll follow  
We're headed for Jerusalem tomorrow
