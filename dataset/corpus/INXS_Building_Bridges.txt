And where has innocence gone  
Do we know too much  
Are you comfortable in your skin  
When does the strip begin  
All the words we are fed  
And the need to belong  
Cause we can't get connected  
Baby try  
Where has our innocence gone  
We whisper and touch  
It's like we should start again  
When does the strip begin  
Some are taken some are given  
Building bridges for the living  
Some are taken some are given  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Where has your innocence gone  
Do you just know too much  
Are you comfortable in your skin  
When does the strip begin  
  
Some are taken some are given  
Building bridges for the living  
Some are taken some are given back  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Some days I am everything I hate  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Some days I am everything I hate  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Some days I am everything I hate  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Some are taken some are given  
Building bridges for the living  
Some are taken some are given back  
There's nothing if the truth don't survive  
  
And where has innocence gone  
Do you know too much  
Are you comfortable in your skin  
When does the strip begin
