Watching the sun shine, peaking over the sky line  
Thinking I gotta get mine, gotta try at least one time  
Want to get near it, close enough to fear it, close enough to hear it  
Close enough to say that I looked it in the eye, then I turned away  
Chorus  
And I'm not scared, but I can't move I'm not scared, but I can't move  
Hangin' out on a weeknight, looking out on the street light  
Getting into some fistfight, trying to cling to my birthright  
Want to get near her, close enough to smell her,  
Close enough to tell her  
All the things that I want to say, then I looked her in the eye,  
Made her run away  
Chorus  
And I don't care, but I can't move I don't care, but I can't move  
Laying up at the Soho, looking out of my window  
Pulling back on some indo, watch the breeze as the wind blows  
Want to get near it, close enough to hear it, close enough to fear it  
Close enough to say that I looked it in the eye, then it turned away  
Chorus  
And I'm not scared, but I can't move I'm not scared, but I can't move
