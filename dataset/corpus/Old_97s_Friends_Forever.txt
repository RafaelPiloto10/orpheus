I was a debater  
Was not a stoner nor an inline skater  
Was not a player nor a player hater  
I was just a bookworm on a respirator  
Who's to say that's wrong  
I was in the chess club  
Didn't have a swimming pool much less a true love  
Didn't have a dalliance much less a hot tub  
I was just a brain whose brain never let up  
Who's to say that's wrong  
The twelve years after five  
Are years we're lucky to survive  
Hang in there friends forever  
In memory far away  
Hang in there friends forever  
In memory far away  
Went out for the football team  
Found out the hard way that you can't live your Dad's dream  
Had pretty thin skin to be in the machine  
Then I found a guitar and the rest's a fanzine  
Who's to say that's wrong  
The moral of the song  
Is that the high school kids are wrong  
You know they have been all along  
Come graduation day you'll be gone  
Hang in there friends forever  
In memory far away
