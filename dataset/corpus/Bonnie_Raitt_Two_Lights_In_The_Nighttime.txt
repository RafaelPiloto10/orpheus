No river can hold you darlin'  
No covers can hide you tying your shoes  
My cupboards are overflowing  
The wine is sublime I'm flyin' too  
  
So slide on over and forget it's wrong  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Come on over and pick up your song it's new  
And darlin' so are you  
Don't know nothin' 'bout no here and gone  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do  
No no no  
  
My government owns the bible  
My government owns the title too  
The car that I got this mornin'  
The car that I got for me and you  
  
So what's comin' on down that road  
It's two lights in the nighttime baby  
You know that I'm gonna wanna  
Share my load with you  
And boy you know it's true  
We'll stay together 'til the end of time  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do  
No no no  
  
So slide on over and forget it's wrong  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Come on over and pick up your song it's new  
And darlin' so are you  
Don't know nothin' 'bout no here and gone  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do  
No no no  
  
So what's comin' on down that road  
It's two lights in the nighttime baby  
You know that I'm gonna wanna  
Share my load with you  
And boy you know it's true  
We'll stay together 'til the end of time  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do  
Honey you know it's true
