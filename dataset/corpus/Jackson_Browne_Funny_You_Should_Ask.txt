Well it's funny you should ask me how I feel  
As the scenes before my eyes begin to reel  
I can't remember how long I cried  
I can't remember how hard I tried  
Turned my thoughts away from you  
Like I had something else to do  
And now I find you here  
  
And it's funny you should want to see me now  
Well I'd refuse you but I can't remember how  
I can't remember how long I cried  
I can't remember how hard I tried  
I'd tell myself I didn't care  
That I was down and you weren't there  
You've been away so long  
  
And it's funny you should want to know my plans  
As the future disappears beneath my hands  
I can't remember how long I cried  
I can't remember how hard I tried  
Now I'll cast aside my memories  
And shut you out most bitterly  
I'm down on my last smile
