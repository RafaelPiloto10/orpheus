I don't have a balance  
Think I'm gonna Fall  
Wish I have a talent  
I don't belong here at all  
  
Drowning in the Pressure  
In above my head  
Why did I think I could do this  
I should have walk away instead  
  
(Refrain)  
This is my chance to break free  
Everythings depending on me  
And if I keep trying I'll be  
  
(Chorus)  
On Top Of The World  
Where I can see everything before me  
Reaching up to touch the sky  
On Top Of The World  
Where all of my dreams are rushed into me  
Stretching on my wings to fly  
On Top Of The World...  
  
On Top Of The World  
  
(Repeat refrain)  
  
(Chorus)  
On Top Of The World  
Where I can see everything before me  
Reaching up to touch the sky  
On Top Of The World  
Where all of my dreams are rushed into me  
Stretching on my wings to fly  
On Top Of The World
