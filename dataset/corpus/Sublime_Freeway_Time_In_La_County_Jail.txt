On the freeway in the county the sun don't shine.  
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel a Bati man.  
And outside my cell deputies creep  
And in this cell all I do is sleep and I dream, that I'm free.  
And I'm back on the reef,  
Where I throw my net out into the sea,  
All the fine hinas come swimming to me.  
They hold me and they promise me things,  
And when the tides high I cry like a little baby.  
Don't give me no right kind a love no Sunday morning.  
Don't want no puppy loving.  
Hold me babe, a new stylee.  
Hungry babe, a new stylee.  
And a angry dog is a hungry dog.  
And a hungry dog is a angry dog.  
I feel like rocking, I wanna with you!  
  
I'm alive gotta contact home. Gotta contact my baby girl.  
But I wood never could get up. Why does it have to be so damn tough?  
With mayates and the eses, yes their steady on the floor.  
I'll be damned if a man with a shake in his hand will make me feel,  
I feel, I feel a Bati man.  
And I know, that I'm there someday.  
  
I'm back on the reef,  
Where I throw my net out into the sea,  
All the fine hinas come swimming to me.  
Hold babe promise me.  
With no protection on my erection I won't get no VD.  
Don't give me no right kind a love no Sunday morning.  
Don't want no puppy loving. Gwarn.  
Hold me babe, got a new stylee.  
And a angry dog's a hungry dog.  
He's a naked man is a naked man.  
And a wicked dog is a hungry dog.  
I feel like rocking, I wanna with you!
