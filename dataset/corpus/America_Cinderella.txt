I was out last night having a ball  
And comin' home, I wasn't thinkin' nothin' at all  
And there on the sidewalk what did I see  
A little glass slipper starin' back at me  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
  
Well I'm not superstitious but I'm smarter than I seem  
And I knew it was love, if you know what I mean  
When I saw that slipper it occurred to me  
The shoe fit her and she fit me  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
  
When I find her it will be  
A fairy tale for her and me  
I will never let her go  
Cinderella  
  
Now the other girls hold no fascination for me  
I just think of her wherever she may be  
I will search my whole life through  
'Cause no one else will ever do  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
  
When I find her it will be  
A fairy tale for her and me  
I will never let her go  
She will give my heart a home  
Until that day I'll be alone  
With just a slipper and a dream  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Oo (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)
