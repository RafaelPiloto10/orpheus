Once upon a time there was a little girl  
Once she was mine  
In my heart the only one  
I wonder where you are  
I know you're somewhere in me  
I can see your smile when I close, close my eyes  
  
Oh little girl  
Where did you go, little girl  
I miss you so  
Oh, I remember when she was mine  
I remember when she was mine  
  
Once upon a time there was a little voice  
Singing loud and clear  
In my heart the only one  
Once upon a time there were so many dreams  
Once they were mine  
Oh little girl, they're with, oh they're with you now  
  
Oh little girl  
Where did you go, little girl  
I miss you so  
I remember when she was mine  
Oh, I remember when she was mine  
  
Oh girl, little girl  
where did you go, little girl  
I miss you so  
Oh, I remember when she was mine  
Oh little girl  
where did you go, little girl  
I miss you so  
Oh, I remember when she was mine  
My little girl  
I remember when she was mine  
Oh, I remember when she was mine
