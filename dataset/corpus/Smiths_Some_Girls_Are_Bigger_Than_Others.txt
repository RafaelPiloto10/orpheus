From the ice-age to the dole-age  
There is but one concern  
I have just discovered :  
  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girl's mothers are bigger than  
Other girl's mothers  
  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girl's mothers are bigger than  
Other girl's mothers  
  
As Anthony said to Cleopatra  
As he opened a crate of ale :  
  
Oh, I say :  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girl's mothers are bigger than  
Other girl's mothers  
  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girls are bigger than others  
Some girl's mothers are bigger than  
Other girl's mothers  
  
Send me the pillow...  
The one that you dream on...  
Send me the pillow...  
The one that you dream on...  
And I'll send you mine
