Here we come,  
Through the market square,  
With our funny,  
Clothes and hair.  
  
Aristotle and Socrates,  
Plato and Diogenes,  
Four fab scholars,  
With our Greek philosophies.  
  
Hey, hey,  
We're the Thinkers,  
Wondering what,  
Life is for.  
  
We're paid to,  
Try and think up,  
The answer  
To that and more.  
  
People found me irritating  
Thanks to my interrogating  
Like a toddler, was always asking why.  
  
What is wisdom, what is beauty  
What is nature, what is duty  
Taught everything I know to  
This next guy.  
  
I'm Plato, was his pupil thinker  
Ended up with inky fingers  
Writing every word he taught me  
Down.  
  
Also had my own theory  
Like for everything that we see  
There's a perfect version  
To be found. Ooh!  
  
Hey, hey,  
We're The Thinkers,  
Mega brainy  
Ancient Greeks  
  
We're always  
Busy thinking  
Cause the truth is  
What we seek.  
  
My name is Diogenes  
I'm not one to say thanks or please  
Poked statues and walked barefoot  
In the snow.  
  
Never believed in possessions  
Thought they gave the wrong impression  
Put faith in total freedom  
Don't you know.  
  
I studied at Plato's academy  
Taught Alex the Great, I know everything me,  
Intrigued by the world  
Wanted to show it all.  
  
I took all their theories higher  
Discovered water, ether, earth, air and fire  
Learned every science  
I'm Mr Know-It-All!  
  
Hey, hey  
We're The Thinkers  
Very witty  
Very wise  
  
No one  
Can out-wink us  
We are Athens'  
Brainiest guys.  
  
Not everyone likes smarties though  
Even Socrates had his foe  
When tried for treason  
He simply said "Why?"  
  
They sentenced him to drink hemlock  
He said "You know if I take stock  
I am annoying, I'll take that  
And die. "  
  
Hey, hey,  
We're The Thinkers  
Politicians  
Gave us strife  
  
But we don't  
Give a tinkers  
Cause we taught them  
All about life.  
  
Ooohhh!
