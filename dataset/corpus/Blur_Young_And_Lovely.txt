Friday's child is planning to out for the first time  
Says "Don't worry Mum, I won't be out that late"  
Can't be playing those passive games right now, they're out of date  
You're awfully sweet, haven't got the time  
Growing up so fast, got better things to do  
You can get what you want, you're so young and lovely  
  
Oh, oh, la, la, la  
  
Kicking around the center of the town lookin' through shop windows  
Those mannequins look far too real at night  
Friday's child doesn't know if it's awake or if it's dreaming  
Says "Don't worry Dad, I'll do my bit, I'll raise the flag  
I'll be just like you"  
  
"Don't worry Mum, I'm not that dumb, I'll be just like you"
