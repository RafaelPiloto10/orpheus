Just the other day I heard my friend say  
Life was oh so bad, love was all he had  
You know all day long I sing sad songs  
Got the blues feel  
Things no doctor can heal  
  
You know thats ok I never change my ways  
Maybe i am wrong, but I'll soon be gone  
  
If i fail , no one can ever tell  
if i'm wrong, i soon be gone

If i fail , no one can ever tell  
if i'm wrong, i soon be gone  
  
i don't need no friends, i don't play no games  
i need lots of room to roam, before i go home  
you know someday, lord if things go my way  
i'll have a son of my own, left here to carry on  
  
if i fail , no one can ever tell  
if i'm wrong, i soon be gone
