Oh holy night!  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.  
The thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angel's voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night when Christ was born  
  
Led by the light a face serenely beaming  
With glowing heart by His cradle we stand  
So led by light of the star so sweetly beaming  
Here came the wise men from far different lands  
A King of Kings is born the world rejoices  
In all our trials born to be our friend.  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angel's voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night when Christ was born  
Oh night  
Oh holy night when Christ was born
