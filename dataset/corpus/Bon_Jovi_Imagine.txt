Imagine there's no heaven,  
It's easy if you try,  
No hell below us,  
Above us only sky,  
Imagine all the people  
Living for today...  
  
Imagine there's no countries,  
It isn't hard to do,  
Nothing to kill or die for,  
No religion too,  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer,  
But I'm not the only one,  
I hope some day you'll join us,  
And the world will live as one.  
  
Imagine no possesions,  
I wonder if you can,  
No need for greed or hunger,  
A brotherhood of man,  
Imagine all the people  
Sharing all the world...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer,  
But I'm not the only one,  
I hope some day you'll join us,  
And the world will live as one.
