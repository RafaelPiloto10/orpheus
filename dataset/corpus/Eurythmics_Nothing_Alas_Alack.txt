Nothing to do but work work work  
Nothing alas alack  
Nowhere to go but out out out  
Nowhere to come but back  
  
It's Christmas day in the workhouse  
They're handing out lollipops  
Progress would be wonderful  
If only it would stop  
  
No bees no honey no work no money  
  
Nothing to do but think think think  
Nothing alas alack  
Nowhere to go for a drink drink drink  
Nowhere to come but back  
  
It's Christmas day in the doghouse  
Lassie's gone barking mad  
Here comes Father Christmas  
Handing out lucky bags  
  
No bees no honey no work no money  
Nothing to do but work work work  
  
Money  
  
King bank is calling....
