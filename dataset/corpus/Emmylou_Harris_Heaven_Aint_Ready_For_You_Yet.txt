When they carried you into the parlor  
Your wounds were the worst I'd seen  
Cold as snow as your body trembled  
Cradled in the arms of morphine  
All the kinfolk cried out loud  
"Good Shepherd save this man"  
But you whispered with icy breath  
"It is not in His hands," and you said  
"Heaven ain't ready for me yet," and you looked at me  
"Give me your heart and take a bet," and you held my hand  
"Now I've seen your face, now that we've met  
"I shall not slip away"  
Mama said to me, "daughter  
"You must nurse your cousin well"  
So I cared for you through days and nights  
But your fever I did not quell  
For weeks I watched you suffer pain  
That no laudanum could ease  
All I had left to do is pray  
"Lord have mercy on him please," and you said  
"Heaven ain't ready for me yet," and you looked at me  
"Give me your heart and take a bet," and you held my hand  
"Now I've seen your face, now that we've met  
"I shall not slip away"  
Now winter's lights has cooled the air  
At last your strength's returned  
You talk to me of the life you spent  
And of the life you've earned  
You'll waste no time on vengeance  
You've no wish to fight again  
"To find peace," you say, "In God we trust  
"But little faith in Man"  
Heaven ain't' ready for you yet, Jesse  
I'll give you my heart, I'll take a bet, Jesse  
Now I've seen your face, now that we've met  
I shall not slip away
