I need someone, I need somebody to be a friend,  
I'm not alone, but still I'm lonely in the end  
She was runnin' away on the 9 o'clock train, so very far from home,  
With a head full of schemes, a handful of dreams  
I was on my own  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
What can I do, what can I say, to get her back,  
Alone I wait before my train comes runnin' down the tracks  
Heaven knows that I'd wait if God were to say that you would come  
I guess you can say it's the price that you pay for holdin' on  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
If you want me, if you need me, I'll be there,  
If you want me, please believe me, I'll be waiting  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night
