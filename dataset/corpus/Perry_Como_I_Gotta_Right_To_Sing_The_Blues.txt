I gotta right to sing the blues, I gotta right to feel low-down,  
I gotta right t' hang around, down around the river . . .  
  
A certain gal in this ol' town, keeps draggin' my poor heart around,  
All I see for me, is misery . . .  
  
I gotta right to sing the blues, I gotta right to moan and sigh,  
I gotta right to sit and cry, down around the river . . .  
  
I kno' the deep blue sea, will soon be callin' me,  
It must be love, say what you choose,  
I gotta right to sing the blues! (doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo, doo doo doo)  
  
(He's gotta right to sing the blues) I gotta right to sing the blues!  
(He's gotta right to moan and sigh) I gotta right t' moan and sigh!  
(He's gotta right to sit an' cry) sit an' cryin' down along the river!  
  
I kno' the deep blue sea, will soon be callin' me,  
It must be love, say what you choose,  
I gotta right to sing the blues . . . the blues,  
I gotta right (the right!) tonight (tonight!)  
I gotta right to sing the blues! (doo doo, doo doo, doo wah!)
