Everybody see's it's you  
I'm the one that lost the view  
Everybody says we're through  
I hope you haven't said it too  
  
So where  
Do we go from here  
With all this fear in our eyes'  
And where  
Can love take us now  
We've been so far down'  
We can still touch the sky  
  
If we crawl  
Till we can walk again  
Then we'll run  
Until we're strong enough to jump  
Then we'll fly  
Until there is no wind  
So lets crawl, crawl, crawl  
Back to love, yeah  
Back to love, yeah  
  
Why did I change the pace  
Hearts were never meant to race  
Always felt the need for space  
But now I can't reach your face (your face)  
So where  
Are you standing now  
Are you in the crowd of my faults  
Love, can you see my hand'  
I need one more chance  
We can still have it all  
  
So we'll crawl (if we crawl)  
Till we can walk again  
Then we'll run (then we'll run)  
Until we're strong enough to jump  
Then we'll fly  
Until there is no wind  
So lets crawl, crawl, crawl  
Back to love, yeah  
Back to love, yeah  
  
Everybody see's it's you  
Well I never wanna lose that view  
  
So we'll crawl (if we crawl)  
Till we can walk again  
Then we'll run (we'll run)  
Until we're strong enough to jump  
Then we'll fly  
Until there is no end  
So lets crawl, crawl, crawl (crawl)  
  
So we'll crawl (ooh)  
Till we can walk again (till we can walk again)  
Then we'll run (we'll run)  
Until we're strong enough to jump (until we're strong enough to jump)  
Then we'll fly (yeah, yeah)  
Until there is no wind  
So let's crawl, let's crawl, lets crawl  
Back to love
