Sometimes I move in chains  
But I never feel the pain  
I wish I could explain  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes it goes so fast  
I try to make some moment last  
I watch it slippin' past  
Sometimes  
  
I get this infernal need  
I'm losin' ground  
Gotta make up speed  
Right now  
Something's there just out of reach  
Something I'm not sure I need  
Something I just can't let be  
Touchin' something deep in me  
  
Sometimes burnin' bright  
In the dark heart of the night  
I think I see a light  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I hear the sound  
Of some night train leavin' town  
I want to chase it down  
Sometimes  
  
I want to catch that train  
I want to get on board  
I want to ride away to some distant shore  
Right now  
I want to leave behind this hopeless maze  
Of broken dreams and endless days  
I want to wake up some place far away  
I wanna wake up to a brand new day  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I move in chains  
But I never feel the pain  
I wish I could explain  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes it goes so fast  
I try to make some moment last  
I watch it slippin' past  
Sometimes  
  
I watch it slippin' past  
Sometimes
