Well I can't control the universe  
cause I am only a man  
And I've been in the papers but they won't tell me who I am  
And if you really need a new philosophie  
well there's one that makes sense  
The one I profess  
  
Chorus:  
I say hey whatever  
Let your beauty come alive  
Let your colour fill the sky  
And say hey whatever  
Why don't you liberate your mind  
Let your colour fill the sky  
  
All the world's in waiting room  
And we're standing in line  
I found the answer to the question  
What makes this time  
Oh won't let them change your story  
won't let them change your thought  
so let the gurus and philophers hit you on?  
  
Chorus:  
Hey, Whatever  
Let your beauty come alive  
Let your color fill the sky  
And say hey whatever  
Why don't you liberate your mind  
Let your colour fill the sky  
  
So I am taking a seat at the roulette thing  
We've just been in a wheel  
Should I bet or take what comes  
Don't change how I feel  
You're a champion of science  
You're just some freak show fool?  
What cannot be proved no no can still be true  
  
Chorus:  
And I say hey whatever  
Let your beauty come alive  
Let your colour fill the sky  
And say hey whatever  
Why don't you liberate your mind  
Let your colour fill the sky  
Hey whatever  
Let your beauty come alive  
Let your colour fill the sky  
And say hey whatever  
Why don't you liberate your mind?  
Let your colour fill the sky  
  
Aaaahh  
Hey whatever
