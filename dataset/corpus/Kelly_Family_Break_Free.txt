I want to break free with my heart  
With my soul with my hands  
I'll do it all with my hands  
With my there's a way  
Oh there's a way  
Oh there's a way  
Life is hardand beautiful  
That's why I wanna break free  
When it's hard I break the ice  
When it's nice it burns fire  
Oh burning fire  
Oh burning fire  
I was gone and I was dreaming  
That nobody liked me anymore  
All alone and under the water I knew  
My heart was still there  
I want to dance free till I fly  
With my soul with my hands  
I won't stop smiling for my treasure  
Family and me  
Oh burning fire ...
