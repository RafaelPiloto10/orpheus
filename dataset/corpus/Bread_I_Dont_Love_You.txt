I don't love you  
I just want you  
If I don't have you never be the same  
I don't love you, but girl you'd drive a man  
Insane  
I don't love you  
But I need you  
I don't even want to know your name  
Every single minute you know is causing me  
Great pain  
I don't come from 'cross the RR tracks  
I don't need no little body hangin' off my back  
If you got plans for me  
You'd better start singin' the blues.
