I'm having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon  
While my hands make a living my mind's home loving you  
I'm having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon  
And every night you make my dreams come true  
  
All day long while I'm working in town time slows down to a crawl  
When I'm not thinking about you I'm checking the clock on the wall  
Then it's goodbye factory and hello love and there's a smile across my face  
Cause I'm back in the arms of your sweet love where my thoughts have been all
day  
I'm having daydreams  
  
I'm having daydreams
