You think  
I don't know  
I swear  
That I do  
This time  
On my hands  
  
I've had all this time  
And I got a kick out of you  
Now I'm falling down  
And I'm felling sick how 'bout you  
Oh I'm falling  
  
But you seem  
Out of sorts  
But I know  
We'll be fine  
These chances  
We take  
Time wastes  
So much time  
  
But I can't stand anymore  
Without falling down  
And I'm getting used to the floor  
Forever falling  
  
And I got a kick out of you  
Now I'm falling down  
And I'm feeling sick how 'bout you  
Oh I'm falling  
Yeah I'm falling
