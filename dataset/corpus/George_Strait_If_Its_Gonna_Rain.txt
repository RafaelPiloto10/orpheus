If it's gonna rain I hope it pours  
Thunder and lightning  
Like never before  
'Cause that's how I feel  
Here in my heart  
If it's gonna rain  
Let the storm start  
  
If you're gonna leave go on and go  
Don't even look back  
When you hit the road  
If that's how you feel  
About you and me  
Now's a good time  
So go on and leave  
  
I've never been one for doing  
Something half the way  
I've loved you with all my heart  
But it's all been in vain  
  
It's gonna hurt  
Cut to the bone  
Break my heart in two  
When you move on  
I'm gonna cry a river of tears  
It's gonna rain and rain and rain  
'Round here for years  
  
I'm gonna cry a river of tears  
It's gonna rain  
Let the storm start  
If it's gonna rain I hope it pours
