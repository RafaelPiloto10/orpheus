Oh Caroline  
My life shined when you walked in  
Oh Caroline  
My world shined when you came in  
  
And if i go all over the world  
I wouldn't find another lover like you  
And if i knew a million girls, Caroline  
  
Go to the end of the world for your love  
Go to the end of the world for your love  
  
Oh Caroline  
My heart shined when you came in  
Oh Caroline  
Life means more since you came in  
  
And if i go all over the world  
I wouldn't find another lover like you  
And if i knew a million girls, Caroline  
  
(go to the end of the world) for your love  
(go to the end of the world) for your love  
(go to the end of the world) for your love, love, love oh Caroline  
(go to the end of the world) for your love  
  
Can you feel my heart strings?  
They're on fire  
You threw it all away  
  
(go to the end of the world) oh Caroline, oh Caroline  
(go to the end of the world) love, love, love, love oh Caroline  
(go to the end of the world) love  
(go to the end of the world) for your love, love.
