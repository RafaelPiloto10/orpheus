We can walk for miles  
We can talk for days  
Learn about each other always  
  
And though we walk for miles  
And we talk for days  
Sometimes we let pride get in our way  
  
And for a while something is broken and missing  
And I can't tell what's goin' on in your mind  
  
It ain't easy  
Getting it right  
It ain't easy  
Trying to read the signs  
It ain't easy  
Trying to work out what's going on in your mind  
  
And though we live and learn  
Love is give and take  
We fall into confusion some days  
  
Where there's fear and need  
We keep it all inside  
Sometimes we let pride get in our way  
  
And for a while something is broken and missing  
And I can't tell what's goin' on in your mind  
  
It ain't easy  
Getting it right  
It ain't easy  
Trying to read the signs  
It ain't easy  
Trying to work out what's going on in your mind
