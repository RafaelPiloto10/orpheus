She was the kind of girl that never quite fit in  
Holes in her shoes and freckles on her skin  
Every time she saw those school doors open wide  
She'd wanna turn around and run back home and hide  
  
She got used to being stuck at the back of the line  
The kind that kept her head down  
Most of the time  
Secret dreams 'bout the boy in the high school band  
And wake up thinking  
She never had a chance  
  
She's a wildflower  
That's waitin' on a sunny day  
Waitin' on the winds of change to blow  
Just a red hot spark that's looking for a little flame, yeah  
Trying to find the perfect place to grow  
She's a wildflower  
  
She makes a wish on every single star she sees  
Yeah somewhere deep down she still believes  
She prays every night before she goes to bed  
Pretty soon her life is gonna change  
She just doesn't know it yet  
  
She's a wildflower  
That's waitin' on a sunny day  
Waitin' on the winds of change to blow  
Just a red hot spark that's looking for a little flame, yeah  
Trying to find the perfect place to grow  
Yeah she's trying to find a place  
She's a wildflower that's waiting on a sunny day  
She's the secret that nobody knows  
She's a wildflower, she's a wildflower, she's a wildflower
