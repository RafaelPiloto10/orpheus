Hey now, all you sinners  
Put your lights on,  
Put your lights on  
Hey now all you lovers  
Put you lights on,  
Put your lights on  
  
Hey now, all you killers  
Put you lights on,  
Put you lights on  
Hey now, all you children  
Leave your lights on,  
You better leave you lights on  
  
'Cause there's a monster,  
Living under my bed,  
Whispering in my ear  
And there's an angel,  
With a hand on my head  
She say I got nothing to fear  
  
There's a darkness,  
Living deep in my soul  
I still got a purpose to serve  
So let your lights shine,  
Deep into my home  
God don't let me lose my nerve,  
Don't let me lose my nerve  
  
Hey now, hey now,  
Hey now, hey now  
Wo-oh hey now  
Hey now, hey now,  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Hey now, all you sinners  
Put you lights on,  
Put you lights on  
Hey now, all you children  
Leave your lights on,  
You better leave your lights on  
  
'Cause there's a monster,  
Living under my bed,  
Whispering in my ear  
And there's an angel,  
With a hand on my head  
She say I got nothing to fear  
La illaha illa Allah  
We all shine like stars  
La illaha illa Allah  
We all shine like stars  
And let it fade away
