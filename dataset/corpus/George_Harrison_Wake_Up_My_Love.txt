Here I go again  
Hear that knockin' won't you let me in  
Only want that same old thing  
Yet it's me here ring, ring, ring  
  
I want your love  
Wake up my love  
And let it in  
  
Well you know it's me out here  
Can't give up now let us make that clear  
All I've had's the run around  
Though I'm barking like some hound  
  
I want your love  
Wake up my love  
And let it in  
  
I want your love  
Wake up my love  
And let it in  
  
My life's been so many ways  
Too much darkness gets me crazed  
All around us people fight  
Christ I'm looking for some light  
  
Inside your love  
Wake up my love  
And let it in  
  
I don't have no friends of mine  
Who can swing me down that vine  
Not much sense in what I do  
That is why I'm calling you  
  
Inside my love  
Wake up my love  
And let it in  
I want your love  
Wake up my love  
And let it in  
I want your love  
Wake up my love  
And let it in
