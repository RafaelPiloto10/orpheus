Flo-Rida  
Gucci!  
Bird!  
  
I done bought all this Ciroc  
Now lil mama on my jock  
Staring at me up and down like when my roley's six o'clock  
Now you know you better stop  
You done heard about my squad  
I am G poe boy  
You either (uhh) or you not  
(Hold up shawty)  
Wait a minute shawty why you came  
Who you know and who the hell told you to come  
All up in the middle with the business unofficial  
When I can't stand a chick tryna score my fun  
Looking for a dude to rip you off some ?  
I don't need a chick tryna throw my one's  
Let me look rich, I wanna have his son  
I sip Perignon but do I look dumb  
Get a job shawty turn my knob  
And if it don't open up make sure you slob  
My boys [...?] behind the bar  
Sit back blow smoke from a Cuban cigar  
What's your mission  
Looks suspicious  
I don't get it  
No permission  
Back no interest  
What's the business  
Shawty listen  
  
I'm just tryna figure (figure)  
Why you up in here (x3)  
I'm just tryna figure (figure figure)  
Why you up in here (x2)  
All up in my grill  
Why you dancing on me  
Steady talking to me  
When you know that you're not gonna give it to me  
I'm just tryna figure (figure figure)  
Why you up in here (x2)  
All up in my grill  
  
Now I ain't got no time for silly games  
Got no time for silly notions  
But get smacked silly for playing with my emotions  
You figured you lead me on  
But bitch you led me out the door  
Now let me lead you with a song  
It goes like D yous a hoe  
Drunk up all my conjour  
Ain't even leave me with a glass  
So cough up my whole bottle  
Or Ima take out your ass  
Cos you don't wanna see me angry  
You don't like me when I'm angry  
Live like Jackson 5  
But get greezy like Jermaine  
Be dangerous like Michael  
So Tito pass the tissues  
Don't test me cos I keep a clipper number two pistols  
And you will be erased  
Outta sight and outta mind  
So get the fuck on or my girls will wipe the floor with your behind  
  
I'm just tryna figure (figure)  
Why you up in here (x3)  
I'm just tryna figure (figure figure)  
Why you up in here (x2)  
All up in my grill  
Why you dancing on me  
Steady talking to me  
When you know that you're not gonna give it to me  
I'm just tryna figure (figure figure)  
Why you up in here (x2)  
All up in my grill  
  
I'm not even gonna bother listening to Gucci  
  
I'm just tryna figure (figure)  
Why you up in here (x3)  
I'm just tryna figure (figure figure)  
Why you up in here (x2)  
All up in my grill  
Why you dancing on me  
Steady talking to me  
When you know that you're not gonna give it to me  
I'm just tryna figure (figure figure)  
Why you up in here (x2)  
All up in my grill
