When I was a boy, there's a dream that I had  
That a war if it's fought was for good against bad  
And I woke up to find that the world had gone mad  
And we'd all fall down  
And I feel like a child again sitting observing  
You're toying with power, your fingers are burning  
You're pushing so hard that the worms won't be turning  
We'll all fall down  
While you try to pretend you're a God upon high  
With your party ideals and your squeaky clean lies  
When it comes to the crunch you're not smarter than I  
And we'll all fall down  
If it's color or creed, or your old time religion  
Well, fighting for that shows a pure lack of vision  
The fight that we strive is the fight to survive  
And we'll all fall down  
Well, look in the mirror and what do you see  
An American, Russian, a soldier or me?  
When you've all pressed the buttons  
Just where will you be when we all fall down?  
It gets harder to see just what future's in store for us  
Hard to see through all the wool you pull over us  
Words that you give are just words to console us  
We'll all fall down  
And what will you do when you've pulled the release  
When the sound of the thunder has drowned out the pleas  
'Cos after all that was your idea of peace  
When we all fall down  
No sun for a world that once stood so tall  
No wind's going to blow and no rain's going to fall  
No flowers for graves, in fact no graves at all  
When we all fall down
