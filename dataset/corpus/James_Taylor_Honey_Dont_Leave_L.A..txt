That limousine in which you made the scene suits you to a 'T'  
If all you want to be is somebody that don't never walk.  
That big chateau where you want to go in the south of France,  
Gonna end our big romance. Don't you do it.  
  
Honey, don't leave L. A., that Riviera is so far away.  
Begging you s'il vous plait, they don't know nothing down in St. Tropez.  
Baby don't leave L. A.  
  
I heard it said that you had it made with you movie star, but, oh, how right
you are.  
If that's really 'bout the best you can do,  
You moved my soul so I played the role of your back door man.  
Yes and now I can't really complain cause I love you.  
  
Honey, don't leave L. A., that Riviera is so far away.  
Begging you sil vous plait, they don't know nothing down in St. Tropez.  
Baby don't leave L. A.
