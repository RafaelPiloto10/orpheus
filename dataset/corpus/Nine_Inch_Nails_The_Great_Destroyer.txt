Say your name  
Try to speak as clearly as you can  
You know everything gets written down  
Nod your head  
Just in case they could be watching with their shiny satellite  
  
[Chorus:]  
I hope they cannot see  
The limitless potential  
Living inside of me  
To murder everything  
I hope they cannot see  
I am the great destroyer  
  
Turn it up  
Listen to the shit they pump into  
Your head  
Filling you with apathy  
Hold your breath  
Wait until you know the time is right  
On time  
The end is near  
  
[Chorus]
