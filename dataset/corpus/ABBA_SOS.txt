And when I see the sign that points one way  
The lot we used to pass by every day  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame  
  
From deep inside the tears I forced to cry  
From deep inside the pain I chose to hide  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall  
Still find a way to haunt me  
Though they're so small  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame
