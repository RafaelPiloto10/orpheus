Welcome, this is a farmhouse.  
We have cluster flies, alas.  
And this time of year is bad.  
  
We are so very sorry  
There is little we can do,  
But swat them  
  
She didn't beg, oh not enough.  
She didn't stay when things got rough.  
I told a lie and she got mad  
She wasn't there when things got bad  
  
I never ever saw the Northern Lights  
(This is a farmhouse)  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
(Cluster flies, alas)  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
(This is a farmhouse)  
In the Farmhouse, it will be alright  
(Cluster flies, alas)  
  
Brought this one to the stinging lash  
Every man rise from the ash  
Each betrayal begins with trust  
Every man returns to dust  
  
I never ever saw the Northern Lights  
(This is a farmhouse)  
I never ever heard a cluster fly  
(Cluster flies, alas)  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
(This is a farmhouse)  
In the promise that you'll be all right  
(Cluster flies, alas)
