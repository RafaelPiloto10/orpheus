South of the border  
American dollars  
Take you a long, long way  
Beach side bungalow  
Sand between your toes  
Nobody knows your name  
  
There's a worm at the bottom of a bottle  
That's well within my reach  
And the heart that you broke will soon be a joke  
As soon as he and I meet  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, forgettin's cheap in Mexico  
She'll be there waitin' and she won't say no  
Tequila loves me  
Even if you don't  
  
Madame tequila's a fine senorita  
All my compadre's conquer  
She won't lie, she won't leave  
In your hour of need  
So we're raisin our glasses to her  
  
They say vamos ay charlo delgado  
It means drink it all down til you see  
The bottom of the glass and it's kickin' your ass  
Boys, the next round's on me!  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]  
Oh, forgettin's cheap in Mexico  
She'll be there waitin', and she won't say no  
Tequila loves me  
Even if you don't
