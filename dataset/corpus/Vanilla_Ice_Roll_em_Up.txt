[Chorus 8X]  
Roll 'em up, roll up the hooty mac, rollem up  
Roll 'em up, roll 'em up, roll 'em up..  
[Verse 1]  
I need some herbs and spices  
So I can feel nices  
The breeze, coolin like a summer tree  
Cause it's the I-see-E and you know I got the feel it  
I score it, and I ain't gotta steal it  
So bring on the sack that's phat  
And ya know I love my is izm and the 1.5  
'cause I get with 'em  
Everytime I get a little hit of the ummm  
The skunk, And the funk feels good to my lungs  
Fire, Fire, The izm is my desire  
And I need to get it quick cause it's callin me  
Come and roll me up please I-see-E  
Light the hooty mac, So we can start the par-ty  
You know I smoke good stuff, So go and get the bong  
Bong - Biggedy bong, Once again you know it's on - huh  
You feel it, You feel it, You want it, You want it  
Roll it, Roll it, Lick it - Now hit it  
[Chorus] - 8X  
[Verse 2]  
You see everytime I wake up, I got to clear my head  
But I clear it with cess, Cause it goes with my dreds  
And I can't stand to run out, Cause if you do I get illy  
Never get silly, So pass me the philly  
Blunt, and no I don't front like Zero  
Who wears a chronic hat but always says no  
But I say yes, and I get it off my chest  
Bring the bo, bring the skunk, and I hit the phunky cess  
Check it, You ain't gotta test it  
It's the mad bomb and I've already blessed it  
Checka 1-2, Tell me how ya do  
When you hear the dirty budda when the buzz comes through  
I ain't tryin to front, Cause I'm gettin' what I want  
Take a chunk of the funk, leave the sack in my trunk  
Yeah, You feel it, You feel it, You want it, You want it  
Roll it, Roll it, Lick it - Now hit it  
[Chorus] - 8X  
Roll 'em up the hooty mac, That what I said  
Now tell me how you feelin'  
Don't it feel good enought to jump and touch the ceiling  
It's on, It's on, I feel it comin on  
It's good to the bone, Cause the buzz is real strong  
Even though I can not stand it, But I recommend it  
Especially when ya sick with a cold, so spend it  
You know that twenty dollars that you've saved Throughout the week?  
If you're a non smoker, Then please don't try to speak  
The plan, The plan, Ya know I've got a plan  
Squirrels got the goods, Now tell me who's the man  
But not really the man that you call when you want it  
Ya know I stay legit, and I've got to stay up on it  
On and On Yo, Give me a ho [Ho!]  
And ask me what I want to do, then I'll let you know  
You feel it, you feel it, you want it, you want it  
Roll it, roll it, lick it - now hit it  
[Chorus] - 8X
