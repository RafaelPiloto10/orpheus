One more night  
To bear this nightmare  
What more do I have to say  
  
Crying for me was never worth a tear  
My lonely soul is only filled with fear  
  
Long hours of loneliness  
Between me and the sea  
  
Losing emotion  
Finding devotion  
Should I dress in white and search the sea  
As I always wished to be - one with the waves  
Ocean Soul  
  
Walking the tide line  
I hear your name  
Is angels whispering  
Something so beautiful it hurts  
  
Long hours of loneliness  
Between me and the sea  
  
I only wished to become something beautiful  
Through my music, through my silent devotion  
  
Losing emotion  
Finding devotion  
Should I dress in white and search the sea  
As I always wished to be one with the waves  
Ocean Soul
