Let me see the sunshine  
Let me feel the rain  
Let me go where I want to go  
I want to smell the flowers  
See the dawn again  
Find those friends I used to know  
  
Well, I spent twenty long years  
In a dirty old prison cell  
I never saw the light of day  
If you could understand  
Oh, that kind of living hell  
That's the price I have to pay  
That's the price I have to pay  
  
They say I killed a man  
But I never told them why  
So you can guess  
What I've been through  
So for twenty long years  
I've been thinking of that other guy  
And what I saw him do to you  
What I saw him do to you  
  
Listen here  
So if tomorrow comes  
And I walk outside that door  
Try to understand the strain  
But if you smile that smile  
I know I couldn't ask for more  
I know I'd do it all again  
Yes, I would  
I know I'd do it all again
