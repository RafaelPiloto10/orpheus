Goodbye angel  
I'm going down but I'm not going round the bend  
I'm giving out but I'm not giving in  
  
Love turned to hate  
Touch turned to pull  
What could I do  
My cup was full  
Goodbye angel  
  
Goodbye angel  
I'm giving out, but I'm not giving in  
Cause yesterday is not like today my friend  
  
Love turned to hate  
Touch turned to pull  
What could I do  
My cup was full  
Goodbye angel  
  
Goodbye angel  
(just let it go)  
(keeping on pulling)  
(just let it go)  
Goodbye angel  
(keeping on pulling)  
(just let it go)
