Alone in a crowd, a missin' planet  
You crash to the ground,  
You never planned that, It just happened this way.  
It happened this way.  
  
The starts in your eyes,  
If you believe in death you're certain to die.  
If you believe in love you're always alive.  
You're always alive.  
You're always alive.  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am.  
Waitin' for one last chance,  
'Cause this time we got, nothing left to loose,  
And everything is ruined.  
But the end is where we begin.  
  
You're lost in the clouds,  
I climbed a ladder but I can't talk you down.  
And all that matters is tomorrow, today.  
Tomorrow, today.  
Tomorrow, today.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the winds will lead us somewhere.  
And the winds will lead us somewhere.  
  
Hey!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ah, the end is where we begin.  
  
We got a long, long, long,  
We got a long, long, long,  
We got a long, long, long,  
Long way to go.
