Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Moving is breathing and breathing is life  
Stopping is dying  
You'll be alright  
Life is a hammer waiting to drop  
Drifting the shallows and the rowing won't stop  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Can't see the sky, nothing's on the horizon  
Can't feel my hands and the water keeps risin'  
Can't fall asleep 'cause I wake up dead  
I just keep polling, I just keep rowing  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Rowing is living and living is hard  
But living beats losing all that we are  
All that we know of, and all that we feel  
All we remember, imagine the real  
All we remember, imagine the real  
  
Hey!  
  
I heard an echo but the answer had changed  
From the word I remembered  
That I started out sayin'  
Living is cheating if you're not pulling oars  
The current is leaving  
I'll get mine  
You get yours  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Hey!  
  
Rowing is bleeding, bleeding is breathing  
Breathing is feeling, running, and freezing  
We're getting dirty but I started out clean  
  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on polling and  
Keep on polling and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing  
Keep on rowing  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row
