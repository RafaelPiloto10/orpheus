If only I'd ever listened  
to all of my closest friends,  
and knew that it was over  
and the party had to end.  
If only, I'd have noticed  
the sadness in your eyes,  
she'd still be in my arms tonight  
if only.  
  
If only I'd have realized  
the unimprotance of being cool,  
to give a kiss,  
maybe just say,  
"Darling I love you."  
If only I'd said I'm sorry  
I'd have been a much better man,  
she'd still be in my arms tonight,  
  
if only.  
There's an emptiness  
that fills my heart  
now that she's not here.  
I loved her more than my own life,  
something I've always feared,  
if only.  
  
If only I'd come home at night  
instead of stayin' out for one more drink,  
if only I'd been unconcerned  
what the other guys may think,  
if only I'd held her tight,  
but I guess it's too late now.  
Oh how blind can one man be,  
if only.  
Whoa but I will not be sad  
after all the fun we've had.  
You live some  
and you learn some, if only.  
  
If only I could convince her  
the importance of one more chance,  
if only God would allow me  
one more celestial dance,  
If only I have the nerve  
to call her up and tell her how I feel,  
she'd still be in my arms tonight,  
if only.  
  
But it's only love  
and love ain't real,  
it's only a four letter word.  
We spend half our lives chasing after it,  
how wonderf'ly absurd,  
if only.  
  
Oo whoa but I will not be sad  
after all the fun we had.  
You live some and you learn some,  
whoa but I will not be sad  
after all the fun we had.  
You live some and you learn some,  
you learn some. if only.  
  
If only I'd come home at night  
instead of stayin' for one more drink
