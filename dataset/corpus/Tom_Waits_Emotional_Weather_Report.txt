Late night and early morning low clouds  
With a chance of fog  
Chance of showers into the afternoon  
With variable high cloudiness  
And gusty winds, gusty winds  
At times around the corner of  
Sunset and Alvorado  
Things are tough all over  
When the thunder storms start  
Increasing over the southeast  
And south central portions  
Of my apartment, I get upset  
And a line of thunderstorms was  
Developing in the early morning  
Ahead of a slow moving cold front  
Cold blooded  
With tornado watches issued shortly  
Before noon Sunday, for the areas  
Including, the western region  
Of my mental health  
And the northern portions of my  
Ability to deal rationally with my  
Disconcerted precarious emotional  
Situation, it's cold out there  
Colder than a ticket taker's smile  
At the Ivar Theatre, on a Saturday night  
Flash flood watches covered the  
Southern portion of my disposition  
There was no severe weather well  
Into the afternoon, except for a lone gust of  
Wind in the bedroom  
In a high pressure zone, covering the eastern  
Portion of a small suburban community  
With a hundred and three and millibar high pressure zone  
And a weak pressure ridge extending from  
My eyes down to my cheeks cause since  
You left me baby  
And put the vice grips on my mental health  
Well the extended outlook for an  
Indefinite period of time until you  
Come back to me baby is high tonight  
Low tomorrow, and precipitation is  
Expected
