I never wanted to be  
A man of mystery  
My life's an open book  
by James Joyce and Agatha Christie  
  
Sometimes I get confused  
Somewhere around page two  
I live the perfect crime  
And crime pays more than it used to  
  
They're checkin' the evidence  
May be come charges pressed  
The only one they got me on  
is some misdemeanor craziness  
  
(CHORUS)  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
If they solve my life if they find me out  
Never thought to keep all I have found  
I hae had my fun If It All Falls Down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I hve had my fund I have bought a few rounds  
And been out on the town way out on the town  
Way way way out If It All Falls Down  
  
Never wanted to be  
A part of history  
I have my days in the sun  
A beach bum a man for all sea sides  
Guidance counselor said  
Your scores are anti-heroic  
Computer recommends  
Hard-drinking calypso poet  
  
Studied life at sea  
Studied life in bars  
Never passed my S.A.T.'s  
So I thought I'd study extra hard  
  
(CHROUS)  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I have learned my trade from the inside out  
I can strum real hard I can play real loud  
I can charm a crowd If It All Falls Down  
  
If It all Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can warm a crowd I can make them shout  
I can juggle verbs adverbs and nouns  
I can make them dance till they all fall down  
We had plenty of doctors  
We had plenty of lawyers  
We had people to make us things  
We had people to sell us those things  
We didn't have enough room for those things  
We build lots of self storage  
Calypso poet shortage  
Calypso poet shortage  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I'll have filled that void from city to town  
I'll have spent my money and taken my bows  
I'll have had my fun If It All Falls Down  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
If they solve my life if they find me out  
Never thought to keep all I have found  
I have had my fun If It All Falls Down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can charm a crowd till they snake danced round  
With calypso beat down island sound  
I can make them dance till they all fall down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can charm a crowd I can make them shout  
I can juggle verbs adverbs and nouns  
I can make them dance till they all fall down
