If I'm scared let me lose it  
If I'm hungry let me have it  
If I'm cold let my skin rise  
If I'm wrong let me learn it  
If I'm grubby let the dirt stay  
If I'm tired let me shut my eyes  
  
I have dread and fear and light and laughter  
I know there is an ever after  
I'm eager and ready  
It only hurts sometimes  
I run to the future and jump  
  
If I'm hurt let me feel it  
If I'm sad let the tears run  
If I'm stupid let me be that way  
And if I'm bored let me show it  
And if I'm bad let me be it  
If I'm sure let me have my say  
  
I have dread and fear and light and laughter  
I know there is an ever after  
I'm eager and ready  
It only hurts sometimes  
I run to the future and jump
