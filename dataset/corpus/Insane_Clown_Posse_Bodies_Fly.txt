Bodies flyin to the sky and explode  
People flyin to the sky and explode  
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode  
And then the blood rains all over the road  
  
I aint never seen anything like my first day in the pit  
I seen this lady tryin to hang on to some kid but no give  
Hes loose straight up into the sky and completely exploited  
And then the fuckin blood shower unloaded holy fuck!  
I'm trippin out I felt like I was gonna threw up  
And then another ninja threw up and blew up I'm like fuck!  
I tryed to call my mom I grabbed the bloody pay phone  
But the phone bit my ear off and left a hole in my dome  
  
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode  
People flyin to the sky and explode  
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode  
And then the blood rains all over the road  
  
I seen a fella sittin on the curb payin nobody no mind  
He was cryin like everyone else then he started flyin  
I knew what was comin next so I ran and tryed to duck  
But half his face landed by me bloody fried as fuck  
People shootin up like bottle rockets nothin can stop them  
Your starin at the floor catchin all them peices droppin  
And it's bloody bloody bloody it aint funny when it rains on  
Everybody body body body and your bodys fucked  
  
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode  
People flyin to the sky and explode  
Bodies flyin to the sky and explode  
And then the blood rains all over the road  
Put your hands in the air like you don't care  
That it's fuckin rainin blood everywhere  
Everybody put your hands in the air like you don't care  
That it's fuckin rainin blood everywhere  
Everybody put your hands in the air like you don't care  
That it's fuckin rainin blood everywhere  
Everybody put your hands in the air like you don't care  
That it's fuckin rainin blood everywhere  
Everybody put your hands in the air like you don't care  
That it's fuckin rainin blood everywhere  
Everybody put your hands in the air like you don't care  
That it's fuckin rainin blood everywhere  
Everybody put your hands in the air like you don't care  
That it's fuckin rainin blood everywhere
