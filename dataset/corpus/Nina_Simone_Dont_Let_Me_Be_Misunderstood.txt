Baby you understand me now  
If sometimes you see that I'm mad  
Doncha know that no one alive can always be an angel?  
When everything goes wrong you see some bad  
  
Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree  
With a joy that's hard to hide  
Then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry  
And then you burn to see my other side  
  
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
If I seem edgy  
I want you to know  
I never meant to take it out on you  
Life has it's problems  
And I get more than my share  
But that's one thing I never mean to do  
  
'Cause I love you  
Oh baby  
I'm just human  
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?  
  
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting  
Some little foolish thing  
Some simple thing that I've done  
  
Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Don't let me be misunderstood I try so hard  
So please don't let me be misunderstood
