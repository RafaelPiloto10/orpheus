Ah, you don't wanna be the little woman,  
No, you don't wanna be the little woman I love,  
No, no, no, no, I love.  
  
Ah, you don't wanna stay in my school,  
You don't wanna be the one that's cool,  
You don't wanna be the little woman I love.  
  
You're up all night  
And we can let it hang down right. (yes, we could)  
I say goodbye to all my expectations  
The day you walked out of my life.  
  
Winter time is a-coming now,  
Give me a sign if you can somehow.  
Make it clear where you heading for,  
Will I see you some day at my door?  
  
Taking it all in to consideration,  
Love's a game I never win.  
I've been in very similar situations  
Again and again and again.  
  
Ah, now you don't wanna be the little woman, (no!)  
You don't wanna be the little woman I love, I love.  
  
Ah, you don't wanna stay in my home,  
No, you just wanna be on your own,  
Well, you don't wanna be the little woman I love.  
  
Take it away!  
  
Oh, damn right!  
  
Ah, yeah, well, things were fine all summer long,  
And then things changed, so where did we go wrong?  
We can run but we cannot hide  
In greener grass on the other side.  
  
Taking it all in to consideration,  
But love's a game I never win.  
I've been in very similar situations  
Again and again and again,  
Again and again and again, oh,  
Again and again and again, (and again)  
Again and again and again, (and again)  
Again and again and again, (and again)  
And again and again and again, (oh)  
Again and again and again, (and again)  
Again and again and again, (and again)  
Again and again and again, (and again)  
Again and again and again, (and again)  
Again and again and again and again.
