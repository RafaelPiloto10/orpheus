Gonna build myself a castle  
High up in the clouds  
There'll be skies outside my window  
Lose these streets and crowds  
Dance the night away  
  
Will find myself an ocean  
Sail into the blue  
Live with golden swordfish  
Forget the time of you  
Dance the night away  
  
Dance myself to nothing  
Vanish from this place  
Gonna turn myself to shadow  
So I can't see your face  
Dance the night away
