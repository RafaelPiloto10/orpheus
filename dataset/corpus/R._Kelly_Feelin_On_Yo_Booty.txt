[Chorus]  
This is my song for real no doubt  
See the DJ is making me feel thugged out  
As I walk you to dance floor  
We begin to dance slow  
You put your arms around me  
I'm feeling on yo booty  
  
Hey pretty mama how you doing  
Said I'm just in town for the weekend  
Looking for a lil' trouble to get into  
Baby tell me what ya drinking and I got you  
  
Players want to play,  
Ballers want to ball,  
Rollers want to roll,  
But I'm taking all, after I dance  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Now yo body got me feeling like spending  
With a backroom I could come to live in  
And yo hair weave's looking kinda pretty (pretty)  
The way you back up on me baby Lord have mercy!  
  
Players want to play,  
Ballers want to ball (Ballers want to ball)  
Rollers want to roll,  
But I'm taking all, after I dance (yeah, whoa)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
If it's yo birthday, then put yo hands up  
You want to get drunk, then put yo hands up  
And if you got some cash, put yo hands up  
And your own job, put yo hands up (Players want to play)  
  
Players want to play  
Ballers want to ball (Ballers want to ball)  
Rollers want to roll (Feel so good, say it again)  
  
Players want to play,  
Ballers want to ball (oh)  
Rollers want to roll  
But I'm taking all, after I dance (oh yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is my song for real no doubt  
See the DJ is making me feel thugged out (Feeling thugged out)  
As I walk you t the dance floor (Walk you to the dance floor)  
We begin to dance slow (We begin to dance slow)  
You put yo arms around me (Put yo arms around me)  
I'm feelin on yo booty (Feelin on yo booty! Yes, I am!  
And I hope you like it girl)  
  
This is my song for real no doubt  
See the DJ is making me feel (And I hope you like girl) thugged out  
As I walk you to the dance (Walk you to the dance) floor  
We begin to dance (We begin to dance) slow  
You put yo arms around (Put yo arms around) me  
I'm feeling on yo booty  
  
Feelin' on yo booty,  
Yo booty, booty,  
Yo boo  
  
Feelin' on yo booty,  
Yo booty, booty,  
Yo booty  
Booty, booty,
