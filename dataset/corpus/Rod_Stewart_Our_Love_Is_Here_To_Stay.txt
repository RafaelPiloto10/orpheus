It's very clear, our love is here to stay  
Not for a year but ever and a day  
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know  
May just be passing fancies and in time may go  
  
But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay  
Together we're going a long, long way  
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble  
They're only made of clay  
But our love is here to stay  
  
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know  
May just be passing fancies and in time may go  
Oh, my dear, our love is here to stay  
Together we're going a long, long way  
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble  
They're only made of clay  
Oh, but our love is here  
Our love is here  
But our love is here to stay  
To stay
