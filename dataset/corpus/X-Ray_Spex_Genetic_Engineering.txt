Genetic engineering  
Could create the perfect race  
Could create an unknown life-force  
That could us exterminate  
  
Introducing worker clone  
As our subordinated slave  
His expertise proficiency  
Will surely dig our grave  
  
It's so tempting  
Will biologists resist  
When he becomes the creator  
Will he let us exist  
  
Bionic man is jumping  
Through the television set  
He's about to materialize  
And guess who's coming next
