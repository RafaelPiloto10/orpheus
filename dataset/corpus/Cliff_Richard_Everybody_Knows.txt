Everybody needs to cry some  
Everybody can't be wise  
Everybody needs some understanding  
Understanding when you cry  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always begin like this  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end with a kiss  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
Anyone who's ever hurt you  
Anyone who's ever tried  
Will only love you then desert you  
Won't believe you when you cry  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always begin like this  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end with a kiss  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
(guitar solo)  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always begin like this  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end with a kiss  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
Everybody needs to cry some  
Everybody can't be wise  
Everybody needs some understanding  
Understanding when you cry  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end like this
