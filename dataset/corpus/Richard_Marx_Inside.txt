Stars alight, August night,  
And you and I are set in motion  
Every fear disappears  
Like a tear into an ocean  
  
Say my name just the same  
Like a flame slowly burning  
Fill my eyes with the sight  
Of all that lies beyond the yearning  
  
Baby there is nothing but surrender left in me  
  
All at once our worlds collided  
I ain't strong enough to hide  
I've fallen, darling,  
I long to take each breath beside you  
Burn down all the nights before you  
Slipped your hand in mine and swore to reveal it  
The secret that lets me be the one inside you  
  
If there exists a deeper bliss  
Plant a kiss that wakes the morning  
Reach for me, sweet as sin  
You took me in against the warnings.  
  
So I will love you everyday until my days are done  
  
All at once our worlds collided  
I ain't strong enough to hide  
I've fallen, darling,  
I long to take each breath beside you  
Burn down all the nights before you  
Slipped your hand in mine and swore to reveal it  
The secret that lets me be the one inside you  
  
I will love you everyday until my days are done  
  
All at once our worlds collided  
I ain't strong enough to hide  
I've fallen, darling,  
I long to take each breath beside you  
Burn down all the nights before you  
Slipped your hand in mine and swore to reveal it  
The secret that lets me be the one inside you  
The one inside you  
The one inside you
