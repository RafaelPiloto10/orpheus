Wake up, come down  
The grass hasn't grown too high  
Well, ease your body down  
If you want to you can unhook your safety line  
Well, ease your body down  
The grass all around us is just green and fine  
  
We've all been waiting  
We've been wondering, will we ever know the truth?  
What it's like washing windows  
When you know that there are pigeons on the roof?  
  
Your reflection's looking clearer  
Now that you're working on a cloudy day  
And those ninth-floor office ladies  
They only hear what your beady little eyes gonna say  
You better wave your hands if you need a breeze  
Better spread real wings if you want to to fly  
You'll remember how to fly tonight in your dreams  
You know you're dreaming  
When there's nothing there worth buying  
  
We've all been waiting  
We've been wondering, will we ever know the truth?  
What it's like washing windows  
When you know that there are pigeons on the roof?  
  
Wake up, leave your body lying there  
It's like another, just another wrinkle in the sheets  
Wake up, I'm gonna poke you if you don't wake up  
You remember how to fly?  
  
We've all been waiting  
We've been wondering, will we ever know the truth?  
What it's like washing windows  
When you know that there are pigeons on the roof?
