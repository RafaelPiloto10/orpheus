I'll tell you 'bout a caveman lived a million years ago  
When mother earth was young and dinosaurs walked to and fro  
His skull contained but half a brain but he didn't mind at all  
He's a hot shot caveman, yah do dah [?]  
Who loved to fight and brawl  
  
He walked the misty plate in time to find whatever he could find  
Then at last he saw her there, covered with hair  
A cavegirl looking right his way, half naked, half well who can say  
Such a thing he'd never seen before, Well then need I tell you more  
The caveman fell in love, love, love  
And so he wielded his club  
  
Oooh oooh what could he do?  
You can't blame a fellow for trying his luck,  
He's just a simple caveman who wanted to---  
Well when the cavegirl came around she had some things to relate  
About the methods he used to communicate  
And she said--  
  
(Female spoken)  
I never expected a caveman to exhibit much finesse,  
But a fifty pound club ain't exactly a caress  
So if you want to call me, you better learn to talk  
Until you learn some manners buddy,  
Take a walk!
