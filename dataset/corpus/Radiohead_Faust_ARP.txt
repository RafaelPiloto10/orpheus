One two three four  
  
Wakey wakey  
Rise and shine  
It's on again, off again, on again  
Watch me fall  
Like domino's  
In pretty patterns  
Fingers in the blackbird pie  
I'm tingling tingling tingling  
It's what you feel now  
What you ought to, what you ought to  
Reasonable and sensible  
Dead from the neck up  
Because I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed  
We thought you had it in you  
But no, no, no  
For no real reason  
  
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles  
Take a bow take a bow take a bow  
It's what you feel now  
What you ought to  
What you ought to  
An elephant thats in the room is  
Tumbling tumbling tumbling  
In duplicate and duplicate  
Plastic bags and  
Duplicate and triplicate  
Dead from the neck up  
Guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed  
We thought you had it in you  
But no, no, no  
Exactly where do you get off  
Is enough is enough is enough  
I love you but enough is enough, enough  
A last stop  
There's no real reason
