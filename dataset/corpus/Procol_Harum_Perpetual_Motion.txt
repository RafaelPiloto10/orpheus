Rings around the crescent moon  
Passions rise from basement rooms  
Fountains play and worlds collide  
We gently swing and sway from side to side  
  
Dancers in perpetual motion  
Slip an' sliding across the floor  
Ships our on a moonlit ocean  
Sailin' t'ward a distant shore  
  
Star-crossed lovers they spoon and swim  
The laughing gods they just reel them in  
Hostages they're tempting fate  
See them wait down on the line to take the bait  
  
Dancers in perpetual motion  
Slip an' sliding across the floor  
Ships our on a moonlit ocean  
Sailin' t'ward a distant shore  
  
The simple stuff we build our dreams upon  
Waxing, waning, now it's almost gone  
Passion plays the sweetest tune  
These velvet days are gone far too soon  
  
Dancers in perpetual motion  
Slip an' sliding across the floor  
Ships our on a moonlit ocean  
Sailin' t'ward a distant shore  
  
We spend our nights on silken sheets  
We play for gold but not for keeps  
Dancers in perpetual motion  
Slip an' sliding across the floor  
Ships our on a moonlit ocean  
Sailin' t'ward a distant shore
