Arrive at seven the place feels good  
No time to call you today  
Encores till eleven then Chinese food  
Back to the hotel again  
  
I call your number the line ain't free  
I like to tell you come to me  
A night without you seems like a lost dream  
Love I can't tell you how I feel  
  
Always somewhere  
Miss you where I've been  
I'll be back to love you again  
  
Another morning another place  
The only day off is far away  
But every city has seen me in the end  
And brings me to you again  
  
Always somewhere  
Miss you where I've been  
I'll be back to love you again
