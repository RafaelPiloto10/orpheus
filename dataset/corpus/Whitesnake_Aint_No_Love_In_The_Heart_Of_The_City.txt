Ain't no love in the heart of the city,  
Ain't no love in the heart of town.  
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity,  
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around.  
Baby, since you been around.  
  
Ain't no love in the heart of the city,  
Ain't no love in the heart of town.  
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity, child  
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around.  
  
Every place that I go,  
Well, it seems so strange.  
Without you love, baby, baby,  
Things have changed.  
Now that you're gone  
Why know the sun don't shine,  
From the city hall  
To the county line, that's why  
  
Ain't no love in the heart of the city,  
Ain't no love in the heart of town.  
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity,  
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around.

Without you love, baby, baby,  
Things have changed.  
Now that you're gone  
Why know the sun don't shine,  
From the city hall  
Woman, to the county line, that's why  
  
Ain't no love in the heart of the city,  
There ain't no love in the heart of town.  
There ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity,  
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around.  
  
There ain't no love in the heart of the city,  
There ain't no love in the heart of town.  
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity,  
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around,  
'Cause you ain't around.
