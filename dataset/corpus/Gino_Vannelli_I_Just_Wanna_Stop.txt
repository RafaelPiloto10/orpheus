(For your love, for your love)  
When I think about those nights in Montreal  
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me  
Memories of love above the city lights  
Ooh, I've tried so hard to take it  
But oh Lord my heart won't make it  
  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
I never want to live without you babe  
I just gotta stop  
For your love  
  
(For your love)  
For your love  
(For your love)  
When I think about the way the world must turn (the world must turn)  
I get the saddest thoughts for you and me (you and me)  
Memories of life and times go on and on  
Ooh, I've tried hard to forget it  
But oh Lord my mind won't let it  
  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
The world ain't right without you babe  
I just gotta stop  
For your love  
  
Oh, I've tried so hard to take it  
But oh Lord my heart won't make it  
  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
The world ain't right without you babe  
I just want to stop  
For your love  
  
Stop (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
I just want to stop (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
The world ain't right without you babe  
I just want to stop (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
I just want to stop.
