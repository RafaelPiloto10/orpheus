Child in the distance  
A memory untamed  
Family connections  
There's a mess in the kitchen  
All messages received  
Always a quick reply  
The mood the afternoon  
Another change of light  
There's nothing like an English  
Summer  
The telephone is good  
So wonderful and true  
We need the time to think  
Everyone's listening  
Another change of light  
The underlying truth  
Request to pack it in  
No solutions
