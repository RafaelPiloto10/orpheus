Mama, where's your pretty little girl tonight?  
Trying to run before she can walk, that's right  
She's growing up, she has a young man waiting  
She's growing up, she has a young man waiting  
Wide eyes, she'll be street-wise  
To the lies and the jive talk  
But she'll find true love  
And tenderness on the block  
Daddy, don't you ask her when she's coming in  
And when she's home don't ask her where she's been  
She's going out, she has a young man waiting  
She's going out, can't keep her young man waiting  
She'll be okay, let her have her day  
'Cause it's a long way, it's a long walk  
But she'll find true love  
And tenderness on the block  
I know how much it hurts to see her go  
She has a mind of her own, you know  
She's all grown up, she has a young man waiting  
She's all grown up, she has a young man waiting  
She was wide-eyed, now she's street-wise  
To the lies and the jive talk  
But she'll find true love  
And tenderness on the block  
She'll find true love  
And tenderness on the block
