What a stormy night, when I met the pony,  
It was so dark, that I could hardly see,  
It smelled so sweet, you know who and Joanie,  
So many butterflies, one could not see...  
We all could feel desire, took off in flight,  
It was hotter than fire, then came the light.  
I smell the heat, the dancing ponies,  
Unwrapped his wings, to dry off Joanie,  
The pony he grew in size, the thunder and rain,  
And finally realized, what was, what it does, and what it come to say.  
Love to kiss the cheek of mother nature, nobody here can deni such things,  
Make the ladies you love come honey, no butterfly should be denied its
wings...  
He was kick ass rocking horse! He was like a hell bent tied to the Gavin pole,  
He was a one time fantasy, I got the bare bones riding to the Holy Land,  
Bare backed, riding like a running man, nightmares,  
And he can't hold the candle to my dreams!  
We rode the night, and took to wing, it was so all right, it was everything,  
We flew into burning skies, the thunder and rain, and finally realized,  
What it is, what it does, and what it come to say!  
No, no, no, no, took off in flight,  
No, no, no, no, then came the light.  
Flashback, somethings coming over me, no sweat one time fanatsy.  
Bare bones all in the wind it seems, hell, who's the chick,  
That rides into my dreams?  
No Libury,  
No stablize,  
No one try to please,  
Nobody's eyes.  
We'll never see us again, tell me when it passed,  
Let it all begin, but all of that time, somebody shot an arrow...  
Being tempted by the time is never,  
Breaking me cause your cold sometimes...  
Being seduced by your own pleasures,  
Being king on your own time...  
He was a kick ass rocking horse, he was a...  
One horn, unicornucopia,  
Two, two in utopia,  
Three star, verge in to infinity,  
Four, four, ya... yaa hoo...
