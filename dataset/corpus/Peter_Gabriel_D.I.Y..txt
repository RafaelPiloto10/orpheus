Don't tell me what I will do, 'cause I won't  
Don't tell me to believe in you, 'cause I don't  
Be on your guard, better hostile and don't risk affection  
Like flesh to the bone in the no-go zone  
You're still waiting for the resurrection  
Come up to me with your "What did you say?"  
And I'll tell you straight in the eye  
  
D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y.  
Do it yourself  
  
Everyone want to be what he not, what he not  
Nobody happy with what he got, what he got  
You function like a dummy with a new ventriloquist  
Do you say nothing yourself?  
Hanging like a thriller on the final twist  
You know you're getting stuck on the shelf  
Come up to me with your "What did you say?"  
And I'll tell you straight in the eye  
  
D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y.  
  
When things get so big, I don't trust them at all  
You want some control,you've got to keep it small  
  
D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y.  
Do it yourself
