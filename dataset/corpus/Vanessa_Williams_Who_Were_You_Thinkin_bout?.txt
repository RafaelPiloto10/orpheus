Who were you thinkin' bout  
Who were you thinkin' about  
Who were you thinkin' bout  
  
Were you thinkin' bout me, baby  
The first time she touched you hand?  
Were you thinkin' bout me, baby  
Did you forget you were my man  
Were you thinking of me when you removed your ring?  
Or did you just think I would not think anything?  
  
Who were you thinkin' about? Who were you thinkin' about?  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
  
Were you thinkin' bout me, baby?  
Each time you kissed her lips?  
Were you thinkin' bout me, baby?  
When your hands were on her hips?  
Were you thinkin' bout me did she do it like I do?  
Did you ever think of anyone but you now?  
  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
  
Were you thinking I would understand?  
And that I was a fool, and that I would never suspect  
You were doing wrong?  
And tell me did you feel bad? Did it feel good?  
Did it feel like you thought it would?  
And I would never know?  
What you were thinking?  
  
Sure weren't thinkin' bout me  
  
You were thinkin' bout her, baby  
You were thinkin' bout you, baby  
You weren't thinkin' bout me  
  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
  
Sure weren't thinkin' bout me  
Sure weren't thinkin' bout me
