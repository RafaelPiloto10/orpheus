Days feel hard earned  
Night grows longer  
Summer says its goodbyes  
And darkness covers  
We find shelter  
Our own place to hide  
  
Oh  
As the light goes out  
Thoughts turn to angels  
Over us  
Oh  
As the night comes in  
Dreams start their drifting  
And you hear  
A lullaby  
  
Ooooh  
A lullaby  
You and I  
  
Trees touch windows  
Say their hellos  
We hear this house as it settles in  
Worry slips away  
It don't know your name  
It don't know where to find us  
  
Oh  
As the light goes out  
Thoughts turn to angels  
All around us  
Oh  
As the night comes in  
Dreams start their drifting  
And we hear  
A lullaby  
A lullaby  
You and I  
You and I  
  
Lullaby  
Oooh
