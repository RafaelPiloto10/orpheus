Are you ready?!  
There's a place inside my mind, a place I like to hide  
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!  
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain  
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!  
  
Another place I find to escape the pain inside  
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!  
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain  
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!  
  
Deeper and deeper and deeper  
As I journey to live a life that seems to be a lost reality  
That I could never find a way to reach my inner self esteem is low  
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay  
If I don't find a way to sift through the grey that clouds my mind  
This time I look to see what's between the lines  
  
I can see, I can see, I'm going blind  
I'm blind!
