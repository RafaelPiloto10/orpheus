Uh, oh oh, oh  
Uh, oh oh, oh  
Uh, oh oh, oh  
Uh, oh oh, oh  
Uh, oh oh, oh  
  
You walk and talk  
Like you're some new sensation  
You move in circles  
You don't need an invitation  
You spend your money  
You can't get no satisfaction  
You play it right so you can get the right reaction  
  
It won't be long my darling  
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it  
Where are your friends now baby  
Aren't they the ones supposed to be there for  
  
You (you)  
You're falling down  
The world's not spinning 'round  
You (you)  
When you're falling down  
No, it's not all about  
You (you)  
When you're falling down  
You know I'll be around  
When you're falling down, falling down  
  
Falling down, down, down, you're falling down.  
  
What's out of place when you look into the mirror?  
The truth is blurry but the lies are getting clearer  
Your eyes are fixed, your smile is so elastic  
You gave me roses but they're all just made of plastic  
  
It won't be long my darling  
Pick up the phone, nobody's on it  
Where are your friends now baby  
How's anyone supposed to be there for  
  
You (you)  
When you're falling down  
The world's not spinning 'round  
You (you)  
When you're falling down  
No, it's not all about  
You (you)  
When you're falling down  
You know I'll be around  
When you're falling down, falling down  
  
Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at ya  
Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya  
Smile for the camera, camera, camera, smile for the camera  
Who's gonna catch ya?  
  
You, you  
  
You (you)  
When you're falling down  
The world's not spinning 'round  
You (you)  
When you're falling down  
No, it's not all about  
You (you)  
When you're falling down  
You know I'll be around  
When you're falling down, falling down  
  
Smile for the camera,  
Everybody's looking at ya.  
Smile for the camera  
'Cause they're all about to trash ya.
