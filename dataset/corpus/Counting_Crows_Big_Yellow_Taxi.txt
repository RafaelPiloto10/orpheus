They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
With a pink hotel, a boutique  
And a swinging hot spot  
  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got til its gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
  
They took all the trees  
And put 'em in a tree museum  
And they charged the people  
A dollar and a half to seem 'em  
  
No no no  
Don't it always seem to go,  
That you don't know what you've got  
Til its gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
  
Hey farmer farmer  
Put away the DDT  
I don't care about spots on my apples  
Leave me the birds and the bees  
Please!  
  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Til its gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
Hey, now they paved paradise  
To put up a parking lot  
Why not?  
  
Listenin' late last night  
I heard the screen door slam  
And a big yellow taxi  
Took my girl away  
Now, don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Til its gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
  
Hey now, now  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you got  
Til its gone  
They paved paradise  
To put up a parking lot  
Why not?  
They paved paradise  
To put up a parking lot  
Hey hey hey  
Paved paradise  
To put up a parking lot  
  
I don't want give it  
Why you want give,  
Why you want give it all away?  
Hey hey hey  
Now you want give it,  
Ah she want to give it  
Cause she givin' it all away  
Now now now  
  
I don't want give it  
Why you want give,  
Why you want give it all away?  
Giving it all, giving it all away  
  
Why you want it?  
Why do you want it? (She's giving it all away)  
  
Hey pave paradise  
Put up a parking lot
