She is my flower  
And she blooms for the one who loves her best  
The miners stop to watch her when she walks  
They know her love is not for sale  
She will never fail me 'cause I know  
I watch her grow  
And the mother of a miner's child  
Waits for me beside the kitchen door  
She is my light  
In this place where the darkness never ends  
She'll guide me where the tunnels twist and bend  
She's the only one who listens when I tell her  
I got less than I can spend  
She knows the pace  
Oh mother of a miner's child  
Wash away the coal dust from my face  
When the night shift's done  
She'll be waiting by the table when I come  
Searchin' for another dream to chase  
Oh a mother of a miner's child  
I know that you still think about the day  
When we'll be movin' on  
Remember dear ole daddy and  
The promise that I made to carry on  
Sometimes I smile  
In the cage where the cables softly hum  
I'd curse that old straw boss to the bone  
But the mother of a miner's child  
Is waiting for her paycheck to come home  
Come Saturday  
And he is just a miner's boy  
I hope that he will find a better way  
She is my flower  
And she blooms for the one who loves her best  
The miners stop to watch her when she walks  
They know her love is not for sale  
She will never fail me 'cause I know  
I watch her grow  
And the mother of a miner's child  
Waits for me beside the kitchen door
