Awaken  
In a web like hell  
How did "I reach this place  
Why are they haunting me  
I cannot look at God's face  
  
Paralyzing  
Brilliant light  
Trying to run  
Want to scream but cannot speak  
I cannot look at God's face  
  
Blind my eyes I can't see  
What is being done to me  
In my mind only pain  
All the memories are drained  
  
Victimized  
Specimen  
Deathless torture  
Void with no mercy  
Black shroud binds those who see  
  
Violated  
Naked before you I stand  
Shattered shrine of flesh and bone  
God's piercing through my soul  
  
Segments of my life  
Morbid pieces of reality  
Twisted personality  
Many faces yet faceless  
Familiar things give way to strange  
No mercy no reason but pain  
  
Fatal  
Subconscious control  
Threshold of pain unfolds  
Transfixed martyr saving race  
Who am I to judge thy grace  
  
Awaken  
In a web like hell  
How did I reach this place  
Why are they haunting me  
I cannot look at God's face
