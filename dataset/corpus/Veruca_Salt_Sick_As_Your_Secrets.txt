Sick  
Sick of the night  
Sick of the day  
Sick of the sun that burns you  
White  
Knuckling it  
Wasting away  
Color yourself back in again  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're as sick as your secrets  
Slip  
Into the bath  
Into the grey  
Hating yourself so much it hurts  
Wake  
Up from a nap  
Wish you were brave  
But you're not that kind of person  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're sick of it  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're sick of it  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're sick of it all  
I'll take you back  
I'll take you on  
I want you to crack  
I want you to crawl  
I'll take your mistakes  
I want you to break  
I'll bring you home  
Scared  
Scared of yourself  
And what you might say  
So you just let the phone ring  
Hey  
You could come back  
Back to L.A.  
You used to like the summer
