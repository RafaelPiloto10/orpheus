I think images are worth repeating  
Images repeated from a painting  
Images taken from a painting  
From a photo worth re-seeing  
I love images worth repeating, project them upon the ceiling  
Multiply them with silk screening  
See them with a different feeling  
Images images images images  
  
Some say images have no feeling, I think there's a deeper meaning  
Mechanical precision or so it's seeming  
Instigates a cooler feeling  
I love multiplicity of screenings  
Things born anew display new meanings  
I think images are worth repeating and repeating and repeating  
  
I'm no urban idiot savant spewing paint without any order  
I'm no sphinx, no mystery enigma  
What I paint is very ordinary  
I don't think I'm old or modern, I don't think I think  
I'm thinking  
It doesn't matter what I am thinking  
It's the images that are worth repeating  
Images images images images  
  
If you're looking for a deeper meaning, I'm as deep as this high ceiling  
If you think technique is meaning, you might find me very simple  
You might think the images boring  
Cars and cans and chairs and flowers  
You might find me personally boring  
Hammer, sickle, Mao Tse Tung, Mao Tse Tung -  
I think that it bears repeating the images upon the ceiling  
I love images worth repeating and repeating and repeating  
Images images images images
