Could it be you?  
I've been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
(You were here all the time)  
Could it be you?  
  
You never looked as good to me  
As you look tonight, oh yeah  
It's like I've seen you for the first time  
Through a lover's eyes  
How could it be that I never knew?  
It's always been you that I've been looking for  
  
You were always right here by my side, oh yeah  
Could it be you?  
I've been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time, oh yeah  
Could it be you?  
  
The girl I've always had dreams about  
The one I just can't live without  
Is it so? Tell me now  
(Please tell me)  
Could it be you?  
Could you imagine what it's like?  
  
To always live without love  
I need to have you in my life  
I think I know that now  
My open heart will make you a part  
A part of this love I've been keeping  
And I might just give it all to you, oh  
  
Could it be you?  
I've been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
Could it be you?  
The girl I've always had dreams about  
  
The one I just can't live without  
Is it so? Tell me now  
Every girl I meet  
Though they might be sweet  
They can't compare to you  
So I search no more  
  
Cause what I've been looking for  
I know I've found in you  
Could it be you?  
I've been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
  
Could it be you?  
The girl I've always had dreams about  
The one I just can't live without  
Is it so? Tell me now  
Could it be you
