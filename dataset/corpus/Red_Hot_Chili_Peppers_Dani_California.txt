Getting born in the state of Mississippi  
Papa was a copper, and mama was a hippie  
In Alabama she would swing a hammer  
Price you got to pay when you break the panorama  
She never knew that there was anything more than all  
What in the world does your compliment take me for?  
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana  
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana  
She's a runner  
Rebel, and a stunner  
On her merry way sayin "Baby, watcha gonna?"  
Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five  
Just another way to survive  
  
[Chorus]  
California, rest in peace  
Simultaneous release  
California, show your teeth  
She's my priestess  
I'm your priest  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
She's a lover  
Baby, and a fighter  
Shoulda seen it comin' when it got a little brighter  
With a name like "Dani California"  
Tje day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya  
A little loaded,she was stealin' another breath  
I love my baby to death...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who knew the other side of you?  
Who knew that others died to prove?  
Too true to say goodbye to you  
Too true to say, say, say  
  
Pushed the fader  
Gifted animator  
One for the now  
And eleven for the later  
Never made it up to Minnesota  
North Dakota man  
Was a gunnin' for the quota  
Down in the Badlands she was savin' the best for last  
It only hurts when I laugh  
Gone to fast  
  
[Chorus x2]
