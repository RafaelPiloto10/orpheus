I remember the days  
When you're here with me  
Those laughter and tears  
We shared for years  
Mem'ries that we had  
For so long it's me and you  
Now you're gone away  
You left me all alone  
  
Go on, do what you want  
But please don't leave me  
You'll break my heart  
Hey, what should I do  
Babe, I'm missing you  
Please don't disappear  
These are the words that you should hear  
Time and time again  
I wish that you were here  
  
I don't wanna lose you girl  
I need you back to me  
I don't wanna lose you  
Baby can't you see  
Oh, I need you  
You've been a part of me  
  
I wish someday you'll be back home  
Cause I really miss you  
Darling, please come home  
  
I wish someday you'll be back home  
Cause I really miss you  
Darling, please come home  
  
I remember the days  
When you're here with me
