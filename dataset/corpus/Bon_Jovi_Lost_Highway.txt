Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
In my rearview mirror  
My life is getting clearer  
The sunset sighs and slowly disappears  
These trinkets once were treasure  
Life changes like the weather  
You grow up, grow old, or you hit the road 'round here  
So I drive (Drive, drive)  
Watching white lines passing by  
With my plastic dashboard Jesus  
Waiting there to greet us  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, hey  
I finally found my way  
Said goodbye to yesterday  
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on this lost highway  
Yeah, I'm busting loose, I'm lettin' go  
Out on this open road  
It's independence day on this lost highway  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
Don't know where I'm going  
But I know where I've been  
I'm afraid of going back again  
So I drive (Drive, drive)  
Years and miles are flying by  
And waiting there to greet us  
Is my plastic dashboard Jesus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh patron saint of lonely souls  
Tell this boy which way to go  
Guide the car, you've got the keys  
Farewell to mediocrity  
Kicking off the cruise control  
And turning up the radio  
Got just enough religion  
And a half a tank of gas  
Come on  
Let's go  
  
I finally found my way  
Said goodbye to yesterday  
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on this lost highway  
I'm busting loose, I'm lettin' go  
When I'm out on this open road  
It's independence day on this lost highway  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
On this lost highway
