A suited man smiled said:  
"It's just a matter of time  
You can have the world at your feet  
By tomorrow  
Just sign on this line."  
Hold tight, limelight!  
Approaching the paramount  
With the sun in our eyes  
Fearing family ties, legalize,  
Compromise  
  
In a dimly lit room with a stool as his  
Stage  
A dream-stricken prince of a pauper's  
Descent  
Haunts the eavesdropping silence  
That presses his window  
As he sweats a performance  
To an audience that ticks on the wall  
  
To the practical observer  
It's just a matter of time  
"You can deviate from the com-  
Monplace  
Only to fall back in line."  
I understand mine's a risky plan  
And your system can't miss  
But is security after all a cause  
Or symptom of happiness?  
  
Brave, yet afraid, his eyes on horizon  
In a steady-set gaze  
A mariner soon from an open cocoon  
Takes a moment to summon his courage  
To stifle his grave apprehension and  
Trembling, approaches the surf  
A father's benediction as his hopeful  
Son departs  
To brave the sea of rage and conquer  
At all costs  
  
Lingers in his memory  
And visions still surviving in a logic-  
Proof shell  
That should have been held sacred, safe  
And hidden well  
Are compromised in usury  
With every rising sun that yields no  
Sight of land  
The hesitation cultivates within the  
Tired man  
And rumors spread of mutiny  
And though the time will come when  
Dream and day unite  
Tonight the only consolation causing  
Him to fight  
In fearless faith in destiny  
  
Even when plans fall to pieces  
I can still find the courage  
With promise I've found in my faith  
  
Likely or not, it's a dream that we keep  
And at odds with our senses we'll climb  
But if faith is the answer, we're already  
Reached it  
And if spirit's a sign  
Then it's only a matter of time
