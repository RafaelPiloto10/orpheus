Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Anytime she goes away  
I wonder this time where she's gone  
I wonder if she's gonna stay  
'Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
This house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away  
Well, I got a little young thing alone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Only darkness everyday  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
This house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away
