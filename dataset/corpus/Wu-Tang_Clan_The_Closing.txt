Yeah, yeah  
I see everything

You know what I'm sayin?  
  
It's like when we come through  
You better have your fuckin' third eye open  
You know, cause that's what time it is  
You know what I'm sayin?  
  
'Cause it's like, when you walk  
You striving for perfection  
That's what we doing  
Understand?  
  
So all that little fake shit out there  
We know the science on that  
We done seen that shit from, from  
From difference of angles  
  
You know what I'm sayin?  
It's like, yo kid, for real  
Wu-Tang, we set off a lot of shit in this shit kid  
You know what I'm sayin?  
  
But you know, you know us  
We play it calm, humble  
You know what I'm sayin?  
But I just be checking out niggaz darts and I be like  
  
Damn, them niggaz, them niggaz is  
Really, really, really, really, really

Uh ha, uh ha ha  
  
You know what I'm sayin?  
But it's all good cause I'm the soul controller  
You know what I'm sayin?  
Rather I say we the soul controllers  
  
The bottom line, like I said  
Deal with freedom, justice, equality  
You know?  
Keep shining, add on  
  
Food, clothing, and shelter  
All my niggaz, go pick up uniforms  
Go, when you buy this album  
Go pick up uniforms, for real  
  
You know what I'm sayin?  
'Cause don't think we doing this just for anybody  
We doing this shit for certain niggaz kid  
Certain people rather, certain  
  
Certain fans, certain supporters  
Certain delegators, word  
What the fuck man, I'm tired of seeing these  
Fake ass niggaz fucking, running with the fucking globe  
  
Ain't even, ain't even really seeing it the  
Way it, it should really be seen  
You know what I'm sayin?  
It's like, if you going to spread mathematics  
  
Spread it right  
You know what I'm sayin?
