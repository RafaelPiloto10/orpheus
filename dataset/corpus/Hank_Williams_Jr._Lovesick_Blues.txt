Capo: 3rd fret key: f play: d  
I got a feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, lawd  
Since my baby said good-bye  
And I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo  
All I do is sit and sigh-igh, oh, lawd  
That last long day she said good-bye  
Well lawd I thought I would cry  
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'  
Lawd, I love to hear her when she calls me  
Sweet dad-ad-ad-dy, such a beautiful dream  
I hate to think it all o-o-ver  
I've lost my heart it seems  
I've grown so used to you some-how  
Well, I'm nobody's sugar- daddy now  
And I'm lo-on-lonesome  
I got the lovesick blu-ues.  
  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal  
That's what's the matter with me  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal  
But she don't care about me  
Lawd, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied  
But she just wouldn't stay  
So now that she is lea-eav-in'  
This is all I can say.  
  
Repeat 1st verse
