VERSE  
Christ is my reward  
And all of my devotion  
Now there's nothing in this world  
That could ever satisfy  
  
PRE-CHORUS  
Through every trial  
My soul will sing  
No turning back  
I've been set free  
  
CHORUS  
Christ is enough for me  
Christ is enough for me  
Everything I need is in You  
Everything I need  
  
VERSE  
Christ my all in all  
The joy of my salvation  
And this hope will never fail  
Heaven is our home  
  
PRE-CHORUS  
Through every storm  
My soul will sing  
Jesus is here  
To God be the glory  
  
BRIDGE  
I have decided to follow Jesus  
No turning back  
No turning back  
  
The cross before me  
The world behind me  
No turning back  
No turning back
