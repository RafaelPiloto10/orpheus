There's a certain sound always follows me around When you're close to me you
will hear it It's the sound that lovers hear when they discover There could be
no other for their love It's my happy heart you hear Singing loud and singing
clear And it's all because you're near me, my love Take my happy heart away
Let me love you night and day In your arms I wanna stay, oh my love Feeling
more and more like I've never felt before You have changed my life so
completely Music fills my soul now, I've lost all control now I'm not half,
I'm whole now with your love It's my happy heart you hear Singing loud and
singing clear And it's all because you're near me, my love Take my happy heart
away Let me love you night and day In your arms I wanna stay, oh my love It's
my happy heart you hear Singing loud and singing clear And it's all because
you're near me, my love Take my happy heart away Let me love you night and day
In your arms I wanna stay, oh my love It's my happy heart you hear Singing
loud and singing clear And it's all because you're near me, my love Take my
happy heart away Let me love you night and day In your arms I wanna stay, oh
my love
