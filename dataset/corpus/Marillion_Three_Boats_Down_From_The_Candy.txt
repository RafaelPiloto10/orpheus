Three boats down from the candy, vacant deckchairs on a floodlit beach  
Three boats down from the candy, rollers coast invade the deepest sleep  
Three boats down from the candy, carnal dancer let their senses preach  
It's a social disease, it's the new moral cancer  
  
Don't think crying wolf will give you the answer  
You ask for my love on the strength of a kiss  
But can't you just play for experience?  
I'm a poet, I'm a poet, I'm a minstrel, I'm a minstrel  
  
I don't need your chains  
Romance lies in ruin let debauchery reign, let it rain  
Wipe the tears from your eyes, wipe the sweat from your thighs  
Don't crawl to me with sentiment, my laughter drowns your cries  
  
You're a memory trapped on Polaroid, a puppet drawn on celluloid  
So drink the wine, confess your sin, just flotsam in a silent void  
Three boats down from the candy  
I'll remember you  
  
Three boats down from the candy, much to much to lose  
Three boats down from the candy, those words were never true  
Three boats down from the candy  
I'll remember you  
  
I'll remember you  
I'll remember you
