Stick it up, mister  
Hear what I say, sir, yeah  
Get your hands in the air, sir  
And you will get no hurt, mister, no no no  
I said, "Yeah"  
(I said, "Yeah")  
What did I say?  
(What did I say?)  
Don't you hear? I said, "Yeah"  
(Yeah yeah)  
Listen to what I say  
(Listen to what I say)  
Do you believe  
I would take something with me  
And give it to the policeman?  
I wouldn't do that  
And if I do that, I would say  
"Sir, I want to put the charge on me"  
I wouldn't do that  
You know, I wouldn't do that  
I'm not a fool to hurt myself  
So I was innocent of what they done to me  
They was wrong  
Listen to me one more time, they were wrong  
Give it to me one time  
Give it to me two time  
Give it to me three time  
Give it to me four time  
54-46, was my number  
Right now, someone else has that number  
One more time, 54-46, was my number, was my number  
Right now, someone else has that number  
I said, "Yeah"  
(I said, "Yeah")  
Listen, what they say?  
(Listen, what they say?)  
I said, "Help me now"  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Listen to what they say  
(Listen to what they say)  
Give it to me one time  
Give it to me two time  
Give me, give me, give me  
No, no, no, no  
54-46, was my number  
Right now, someone else has that number
