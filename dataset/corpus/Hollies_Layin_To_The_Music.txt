Bright light city's high  
Maybe we're gonna fly  
Get on the scene  
King and Queen  
Laying to the music if you know what I mean  
  
Downtown get around  
Searching for a mean sound  
Itchy feet  
Want to dance to the beat  
Laying to the music if you know what I mean  
  
Coming on strong  
Won't be long  
Reaching out to where I belong  
I'm in my stride  
Good music to ride by  
Horse riders in the sky  
  
Coming on strong  
Won't be long  
Reaching out to where I belong  
I'm in my stride  
Good music to ride by  
Horse riders in the sky  
  
Drinking wine from a slipper shoe  
Baby can we boogaloo  
Move to the right  
Slip in tight  
Laying to the music all night  
Laying to the music it's all right  
Laying to the music all night
