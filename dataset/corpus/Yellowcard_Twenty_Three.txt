I got to tell you that he waited all his life  
For someone like you to come make the wrong things right  
I know he didn't have the answers all the time  
But you can't tell me that you've never told a lie  
  
We're almost twenty-three and you're still mad at me  
So much that I said to you and I want to take it back now  
Twenty-three and it's so sad to me  
You tell the world I'm dead to you  
But I know you want me back now  
  
Was it fun for you to watch him fall apart? (Watch me fall)  
And suffocate him while you held him in your arms (in your arms)  
I swear to God I wish he never let you in (let you in)  
And I just hope we never hear from you again  
  
We're almost twenty-three and you're still mad at me  
So much that I said to you and I want to take it back now  
Twenty-three and it's so sad to me  
you tell the world I'm dead to you  
But I know you want me back  
  
Wasted on you (wasted on you)  
Wasted on you (so much time I've)  
Wasted on you (wasted on you)  
Wasted on you  
On you  
On you  
  
Twenty-three and you're still mad at me  
So much that I said to you and I want to take it back now  
Twenty-three and it's so sad to me  
You tell the world I'm dead to you  
But I know you want me back now
