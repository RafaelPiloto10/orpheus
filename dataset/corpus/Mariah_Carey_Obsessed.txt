All up in the blogs, sayin' we met at the bar,  
When I don't even, know who you are.  
Sayin' we up in your house, sayin' I'm up in your car,  
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's.  
I'm up in the A, you're so so lame,  
And no one here, even mentions your name.  
It must be the weed, it must be the E,  
Heard you get it poppin', you get it poppin'.  
  
Ah oh.  
Why you so obsessed with me?  
Boy I want to know, lyin' that you're sexing me.  
When everybody knows, it's clear that you're upset with me.  
Ohh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress,  
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this.  
  
You're delusional, you're delusional,  
Boy you're losing your mind.  
It's confusing yo, you're confused you know,  
Why you wasting your time?  
Got you all fired up, with your Napoleon complex,  
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex.  
  
Ooh oh oh.

All the girls sing.  
(Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed.)  
  
You on your job, you hatin' hard,  
Ain't goin' feed you, I'm a let you starve.  
Graspin' for air, and I'm ventilation,  
You out of breath, hope you ain't waitin'.  
Tellin' the world how much you miss me,  
But we never were, so why you trippin'?  
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation,  
I'm the, press conference, you're a conversation.

Why you so obsessed with me?  
And boy I want to know, lyin' that you're sexing me.  
When everybody knows, it's clear that you're upset with me.
