I've known some women in every state  
New York City to the Golden Gate  
I've lived with some, and buddy, I loved 'em all. (Yes, I did)  
But no one woman had a claim on me  
'Cause I still had a lotta world to see  
And I sometimes stagger, but sugar, I seldom fall.  
Then like a hungry man, I went to Louisiana  
Where the lovin' and the livin' was good  
Without a care to hide and just as satisfied as I could be.  
A lotta women and wine and not a tie to bind me  
And behaving just as cool as I could  
'Til that long legged, sweet walkin' ravenhaired cajun lookin'  
Devil put the sweat on me  
They call her Smokey, she's a little bit-a evil  
Smokey, right as wrong can be.  
Smokey, she could shake the very devil  
Smokey put the sweat on me.  
Oh, my pulse is a beatin' to the clickety clack  
Of this one-way ride that's gonna take me back  
And my body's just a-breathin' in that Mississippi River smell  
Well, my feet wasn't ready yet for settling down  
But my soul kept tellin' me to turn around  
And the longer I tried to fight it, the harder I fell  
And like a hungry man, I went to Louisiana  
Where the lovin' and the livin' is good  
I'll get a brand new bride and be as satisfied as I can be  
And I won't even mind the world I'm leavin' behind  
Because I never really thought that I could  
'Til that long legged, sweet walkin' ravenhaired cajun looking devil  
Put the sweat on me.  
They call her Smokey, she's a little bit-a evil  
Smokey, right as wrong can be  
Smokey, she could shake the very devil  
Smokey put the sweat on me  
Smokey put the sweat on me  
Awww, Smokey put the sweat on me.
