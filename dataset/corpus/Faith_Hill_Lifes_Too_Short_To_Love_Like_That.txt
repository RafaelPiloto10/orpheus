Baby, we had something  
Goin' wrong  
I've never seen nothin'  
So right go wrong  
You used to want to  
Love me day and night  
We used to never want to  
Leave paradise  
Now we sleep  
At night back to back  
Life's too short to love like that  
  
You never want to  
Kiss me anymore  
You run around  
And I walk the floor  
You know I used to  
Mean everyting to you  
Not I'm last in line  
And that just won't do  
I feel blue, you feel trapped  
Life's too short to love like that  
  
You put me down  
Just to stand me up  
Time after time,  
Well enough's enough  
I give and give  
Without gettin' back  
Life's too short to love like that  
Life's too short to love like that  
  
It's way too late  
For a wake-up call  
And I ain't gonna wait  
For those tears to fall  
I used to think  
We could work things out  
But if you don't want to change  
Then there's no doubt  
The fire is out  
And that's so sad  
Life's too short to love like that  
  
You put me down  
Just to stand me up  
Time after time,  
Well enough's enough  
I give and give  
Without gettin' back  
Life's too short to love like that  
Life's too short to love like that
