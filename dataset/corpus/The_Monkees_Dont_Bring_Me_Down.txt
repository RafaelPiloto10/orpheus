It used to be such a good thing  
Such an easy feeling  
I didn't know you were looking  
Didn't know you were stealing  
  
I was loving you when we were alone  
But you had other ideas of your own  
Word gets around  
Don't bring me down  
  
We used to have us some good times  
Used to laugh together  
It took awhile to realize  
You were wantin' something better  
  
When we were kissin' I closed my eyes  
But you were lookin' at the other guys  
I played the clown  
Don't bring me down  
  
It used to be such a good thing  
Such an easy feelin'  
I didn't know you were lookin'  
I didn't know you were stealing  
  
I went and messed it up and fell in love  
But you sure know how to make it rough  
You're still around  
Don't bring me down
