You never knew yourself well enough  
But she never knew you at all  
And when she put you out on your own  
It may have stolen your innocence  
But not your soul  
  
Tell me where is little boy blue  
You'll find him standing always  
One step ahead  
Fast a little, shy a little, boy blue  
Wise blood runs warms and deep  
On the street  
...Kids walking, just a kid walking  
  
You send a letter with photographs  
And I'll tuck them under my dreams  
And if we wake up old beyond our years  
Not quite as brave as we seem  
It's just the pain that never disappears  
  
Tell me where is boy blue  
You'll find him standing always one step ahead...  
  
Dance a little, cry a little...  
  
Where are you boy blue  
Where are you...
