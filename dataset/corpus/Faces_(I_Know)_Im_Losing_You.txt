Your love is fading I can feel your love fading  
Woman it's fading away from me  
'Cause your personal touch has grown cold  
As if someone else controls your very soul  
I fooled myself long as I can  
I can feel the presence of another man  
  
It's there when you speak my name  
It's just not the same  
Oh honey I'm losing you  
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere  
Oh I'm losing you  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
Any day you'll be up and gone  
Oh I'm losing you  
It's all over your face someone's takin' my place  
Could it be that I'm losing you  
  
When I look into your eyes a reflection of a face I see  
Oh Lord I'm losing you  
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried girl  
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me  
  
Your love is fadin' I can feel it fadin'  
Oh away from me  
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere  
Oh I'm losing you  
I don't wanna lose you  
But I know I'm gonna groove you  
Oh Lord I'm losing you  
  
I don't wanna lose you  
But I know I'm gonna groove you  
Oh Lord I'm losing you, and I'm a losin' you  
  
Your love is fadin' I can feel it fadin'  
Oh Lord I'm losing you
