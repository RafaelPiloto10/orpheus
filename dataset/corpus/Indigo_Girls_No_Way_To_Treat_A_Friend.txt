When I walked you to the door I was feeling mighty fine  
I was thinking hey I've got love to ease my mind  
Then I got to the car and I was staring at your scars  
Thinking hey, this aint no way to spend my time  
  
Now I want a true love affair  
Not this touch-and-go in the air  
You know I don't know if I'm coming or I'm down  
I don't want a love touch and go  
I want a feeling I only know  
Or else you can get me out of this town  
  
When I saw you smile I knew one look into your eyes  
And I was thinking hey, are you in love again  
Then I heard you laugh honey you were laughing at the past  
I was thinking this aint no way to treat a friend  
  
You were laughing at the past  
Honey you were smiling through your glass  
Watching cars drive away in your mind  
You were hoping I would leave  
Honey I was dreaming I could stay  
And this aint no way to spend my time  
This aint no way to treat a friend  
This aint no way to see me  
I'm looking for the end  
This aint no way to treat a friend  
  
Now I want words I want touch  
Maybe that's a bit too much  
For one so far removed  
From what you used to claim  
Well if you be cruel, Ill still be kind  
You know I've got it in my mind  
I'm in love with you  
I aint gonna play your games  
If you want my advice  
don't say its wrong if it feels right  
don't push me down just to see me crawl  
Ill be crawling on the floor  
Then Ill be reaching for the door  
Ill be crawling right out of your eyes  
Honey Ill be walking right out of your eyes  
Honey Ill be walking right out of your eyes
