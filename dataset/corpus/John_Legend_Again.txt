First time we ever got a chance to be alone we knew...  
It was wrong to do  
I guess that's why I was drawn to you  
Second time leads to the third, the fifth, the seventh time  
  
I feel so alive... it won't last but it's alright  
Fleeting joy and faded ecstasy  
Here goes again, sneaking fruit from the forbidden tree  
Sweet taste of sin  
  
And I'm doing it again  
Yes, I'm doing it again  
Oh, I'm doing it again  
I said it would end  
But here it goes again  
  
This time you told me you saw me at the same motel  
You said you knew me well, and I had that familiar smell  
Asked me, "How am I ever going to learn to put my trust in you,  
'Cause I know what you're prone to do?"  
Accusations fly like bullets do  
Here it goes again  
Oh, you know me because you're doing it too  
Cycle never ends, it never ends  
  
Oh, you're doing it again  
Yes, you're doing it again  
Are you doing it again?  
You said it would end, but here it goes again and again and again  
  
Damn, I love you, but this is crazy  
I have to fight you, almost daily  
We break up so fast and we, we make up so passionately  
Why can't we just trust each other?  
You can't hate me and be my lover  
Passion ends, the pain begins  
I come back, and we're doing it again  
  
Yes, we're doing it again  
Oh, we're doing it again  
We said it would end  
But here it goes again  
  
Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain,  
Saying "things'll change," you'll take away the pain  
Then we flash back to the first time you put your spell on me  
You envelop me, you feel good as hell to me  
One moment leads to another few  
Here it goes again  
Leaving you is oh so hard to do  
I just can't pretend...can't pretend  
  
I keep doing it again  
Oh, I'm doing it again  
Yes, I'm doing it again  
I said it would end  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, I'm doing it again  
I said it would end  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, I'm doing it again  
I said it would end  
But here it goes again
