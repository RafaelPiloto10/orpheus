Well I just found out you let your baby down  
So I made up my mind and my face and I'm goin to town  
I'm gonna pay you back by doin you the way you've done me  
And some dude don't know how lucky he's about to be  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna do somebody right just to do you wrong  
I'm gonna make his day, if it takes me all night long  
I'm gonna pick him up, love him up, and really come on strong  
I'm gonna do somebody right, I'm gonna break your heart tonight  
I'm gonna do somebody right just to do you wrong  
  
I'm gonna give you just what you deserve  
Cause the crime sure fit's the sentence you must serve  
Then I'm gonna make it twice as hard on you I know because  
I'm gonna come back in the morning and tell you how it was  
  
[Chorus:]
