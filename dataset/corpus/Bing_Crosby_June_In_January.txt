A clouded moon creeps across the clouded sky  
Winds of January sigh and moan  
And yet it's June.  
I can see a sky of blue  
Dear the miracle is due to you.  
Just you.  
It's June in January  
Because I'm in love  
It always is spring in my heart  
with you in my arms.  
The snow is just white blossoms  
that fall from above.  
And here is the reason, my dear,  
Your magical charms.  
The night is cold  
The trees are bare  
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air.  
It's June in January  
Because I'm in love.  
But only because I'm in love with you.  
  
Oh the night is cold!  
Won't it be too bare  
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air.  
It's June in January  
Because I'm in love  
But only because I'm in love with you.
