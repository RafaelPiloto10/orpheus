Here it is, a dope hit, Iceman comin' with a dope hit  
Cause a few suckers need their throats slit  
Jealous cause I went multi platinum  
Now I'm gonna blast you in the head  
Till you're dead with my magnum  
Lyrics might be simplistic, but I'm no simp  
On the strip, cause I know how to pimp it  
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinking  
In my quicksand, Vanilla Ice, vocal hitman  
Got the number three in my crosses, sittin' on the rooftop  
Bop bop bop  
And you fools drop, Was a big fl-fl-flop flop  
Brother's didn't like your record 'cause it wasn't hip hop hop  
But this ain't a dis 'cause you sold gold  
Still, I made a killin' and it ain't even a ten eleven million  
Given my rhyming spice while my DJ's on the slice  
Vanilla Ice is back on the map, with the wrath of the Ice king  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Why does my man try to run my actions?  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Now why does my man try to run my actions?  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] my living condition  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] it's my living condition  
Etch on a sketch on a rhyme like an architect  
Now watch your back son, cause you might lose your neck  
Pound for pound, I rock the ground I stand on  
I rock records, every record at random  
Flyin' heads, as the heads get full  
[Incomprehensible] speakers get ripped and torn  
To my tomb  
I'm wicked as a witch on a broom stick  
I smash bricks with one lick  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Why does my man try to run my actions?  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Now why does my man try to run my actions?  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] my living condition  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] it's my living condition  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible]  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
You don't get a second chance  
(No one will stop me)  
Cause and tremors bring the scales in hand  
Call the cops, the paramedics, the man's down  
(No one will stop me)  
You wanna rock my bell so I broke them down  
My tongue snapped and cracked like a bull whip  
(No one will stop me)  
And you ain't nothing but my itty bitty target  
And as I walk through the valley of sin  
(No one will stop me)  
I walk with all you my friends
