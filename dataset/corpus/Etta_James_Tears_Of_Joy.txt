I'm just a fool who really loves you  
There is no greater fool than me  
You told me lies and I believed you  
How big a fool can you be  
  
I close my eyes when people tell me  
They saw you kissin' someone new  
I just won't let my heart believe it  
I'm just a fool in love with you  
  
Some day you may be crying  
Crying over me  
And if that ever happens  
A fool you too may be  
  
Why don't you change your way of livin'?  
And walk the straight and never lie  
The Lord forgives a fool who's willin'  
I'll give the world to make you mine  
  
Some day you may be crying  
Crying over me  
And if that ever happens  
A fool you too, you too may be  
  
Why don't you change your way of livin'?  
And walk the straight and never lie  
The Lord forgives a fool who's willin'  
I'll give the world to make you mine
