I've got a Dungeon Master's Guide  
I've got a twelve-sided die  
I've got Kitty Pryde  
And Nightcrawler too  
Waiting there for me  
Yes I do, I do  
I've got posters on the wall  
My favorite rock group Kiss  
I've got Ace Frehley  
I've got Peter Criss  
Waiting there for me  
Yes I do, I do  
  
[Chorus:]  
In the garage  
I feel safe  
No one cares about my ways  
In the garage  
Where I belong  
No one hears me sing this song  
In the garage  
  
I've got an electric guitar  
I play my stupid songs  
I write these stupid words  
And I love every one  
Waiting there for me  
Yes I do, I do  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]
