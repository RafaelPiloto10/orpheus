Everybody's talkin' at me  
I don't hear a word their sayin'  
Only the echos of my mind  
People stop and stare  
I can't see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
  
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
Through the pourin' rain  
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes  
Bankin' off of the northeast winds  
Sailin' on summer breeze  
And skippin' over the ocean like a stone  
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
Through the pourin' rain  
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes  
Bankin' off of the northeast winds  
Sailin' on summer breeze  
And skippin' over the ocean like a stone  
  
Everybody's talkin' at me  
Can't hear a word their sayin'  
Only the echos of my mind  
I won't let you leave my love behind  
No i won't let you leave  
I won't let you leave my love behind
