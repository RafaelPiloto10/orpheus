There's a new wind blowin' like I never known  
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done  
And it sure feels good to finally feel the way I do  
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays  
Forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made  
There's just one thing, the only thing I need to do  
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I wanna feel sunshine  
Shinin' down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
Let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do  
  
I'm runnin' 'round in circles goin' no-where fast  
I'd take one step forward and then two steps back  
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to  
Yeah, I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I wanna feel sunshine  
Shinin' down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
Let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do  
  
Sometimes it's hard for me to really understand  
But you're teachin' me to be a better man  
Don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do  
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you, like you  
Love somebody, love somebody like you  
Yeah, baby, like you, like you  
Somebody like you
