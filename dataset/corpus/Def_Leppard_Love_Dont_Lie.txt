Time  
Just watching the time slippin' away  
Gimme a sign  
Where do you go when you can't find the way  
  
So we watch and we wait  
And we crawl and we kneel  
If you know who you are  
Then you know how to feel  
In time  
Maybe temptation is all that you need  
  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
It's stronger than steel  
It's got the heart and emotion to heal  
It's not as easy as it seems  
When you can't even sleep in your dreams  
Love don't lie  
And that's the truth  
Look me straight in the eye for the proof  
That love don't lie  
Yeah, love don't lie  
  
Out in the cold  
With a love that burns like the sun  
You've stolen my soul  
So justice would seem to be done  
  
So we hope and we pray  
And we live and we learn  
If we know where we are  
Then we know where to turn  
In time  
Maybe persuasion is all that you need  
  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
It's stronger than steel  
It's got the heart and emotion to heal  
It's not as easy as it seems  
When you can't even sleep in your dreams  
Love don't lie  
And that's the truth  
Look me straight in the eye for the proof  
That love don't lie  
  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
It's stronger than steel  
It's got the heart and emotion to heal  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
And that's the truth  
Look me straight in the eye  
Straight in the eye for the proof  
Love don't lie  
Yeah love don't lie  
Oh, oh  
Love don't lie  
Yeah love don't lie
