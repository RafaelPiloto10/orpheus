Chorus  
How did you feel the morning after,  
After the love we made last night,  
I never ever knew such rapture,  
Before you girl I never felt it right.  
You wrapped your arms around me and held me tight,  
I kissed your mouth and girl it sure did delight,  
And When I felt your body pressing on mine,  
The feeling almost drove me crazy out of my mind.  
Chorus  
Now, and then you started kissing my ear,  
You kissed my neck and then you me right on here,  
And then you threw your thing in my direction,  
Next thing I knew we had the right connection.  
(I felt good the morning after,  
Felt so good the morning after,  
I'm looking forward to the night).  
After the morning had gone and the sun comes up,  
You bring me coffee girl in my favourite cup,  
I love to love you all night babe,  
So tell me pretty baby that you'll never go away.  
Instrumental  
Chorus  
And as the night went on you thrilled me some more,  
You made it happen right there on the floor,  
We did the dance of love all night long,  
When night was through love was still going strong.  
Chorus  
I never want you to be with some one else,  
I got to have you all to myself,  
After last night I really know the score,  
And oh pretty baby I want it more and more  
(I felt good the morning after,  
Felt so good the morning after,  
I'm looking forward to the night).  
After the morning had gone and the sun comes up,  
You bring me coffee girl in my favourite cup,  
I love to love you all night babe,  
Come on baby say you'll never go away.
