Oh Mary of Silence,  
You pick my heart with a smile  
Oh sweet Mary,  
Come inside for a while  
Help me get a hold on you,  
Or I look in the night  
I thought of myself beside you  
Take me into your skin  
  
Oh, Sweet Mary of Silence  
Oh, Sleeping Mary of Silence  
  
We have a steady confusion,  
You're looking at fear  
It doesn't seem like the first time,  
You walked out in a hurry  
  
Oh, Sweet Mary of Silence  
Oh, Sleeping Mary of Silence  
  
I look in , In your window,  
To check my head in your pane  
My last thoughts , they come to me,  
I can't take the pain  
  
Oh, Sweet Mary of Silence  
Oh, Sleeping Mary of Silence  
  
Help me walk with you, To the sky that we see  
Shuddering in myself, in-my-self  
Oh where  
Oh when  
Oh well  
Sweet Mary of Silence  
Sweet Mary of Silence  
Sweet Mary of Silence  
Sweet Mary of Silence
