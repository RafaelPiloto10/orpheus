Tommy Mottola lives on the road  
He lost his lady two months ago  
Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't,  
oh, oh, never, nooo  
He sleeps in the back of his grey Cadillac, oh my honey  
Blowing his mind on cheap grass and wine  
Oh ain't it crazy baby, hey  
Guess you could say hey, hey  
This man has learned his lesson, oh hey  
Now he's alone  
He's got no woman and no home  
For misery, oh, oh  
Cherchez la femme  
Miggie, Miggie Bonija's very upset  
She's sick and tired of living in debt  
Tired of roaches, tired of rats, I know she is oooh  
So her noble man says,  
"Baby I understand, oh my honey"  
Now he's working two jobs at Eighth Avenue bars  
Oh ain't crazy baby  
Now she complains  
That her man is never present, no  
She goes next door, I know that she's just playing the whore  
Hey for misery (my friend)  
Cheechez la femme  
They tell you a lie with a colgate smile, hey baby  
Love you one second and hate the next one  
Oh ain't it crazy, yeah  
All I can say , ay, hey, og one thing I am certain, oh, oh  
They're all the same, all the sluts and the saints For misery (my friend),
"Cherchez la femme"
