It ain't nuthin Gee, it's just a small thing (4X)  
  
Hey, I got a flow that is wicked, so sit back while I kick it  
The incredible edible, change my pitch while I rip it  
We can make it just happen, while I'm keepin' you snappin'  
Now the style is correct, so I'ma keep gangsta rappin'  
'Cause I'm back and I'm flowin', I'ma keep people knowin'  
that I'm just like the Energizer (Still going!)  
So get that and make that, somethin' you think is real fat  
It's a small thing I'm back, on the Delta Force track  
As the figure get bigger, as the soul brother nigga  
I don't plan to waste time black, I just pull the trigger  
Now my mic is just smokin', like the 'are' I'm not jokin  
Fuck around, step to me troop, your big toes is broken  
Now I be the headbanger, releasin' more anger  
'Cause my fury is deep, so don't challengers scatter  
When I'm ? the head, I make beats that just flip  
So I write up a rhyme next, then flex  
Back at the ranch with the 4-H Horsemen  
The flavor is steady, move your head to the bass  
So check the rhymes and check my stats  
And now you know, that Ced Gee is back  
I'm still the Delta
