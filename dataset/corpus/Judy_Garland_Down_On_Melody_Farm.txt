I'm tired of the noise and hurly-burly  
That fills the city late and early.  
I long to hear the music of the used-to-be  
That mother nature made for me.  
I want to wander where the skies are blue,  
Where birds are singing all the long day through,  
The music that I love to listen to  
Down on melody farm.  
The cowbells tinkle in the early morn.  
The bees are buzzin' 'round a field of corn,  
To tell me that another song is born  
Down on melody farm.  
The lazy river is drifting along  
While daffodils dance on a hill  
And while it's drifting it composes a song  
To a water lily.  
The morning sings the golden melody,  
The evening brings the moonlight symphony,  
For all the world is wrapped in harmony  
Down on melody farm.  
I'm gonna pack my bag,  
I'm gonna clear my brain,  
And then I'm gonna buy a one-way ticket  
On the fastest choo-choo train.  
I'm gonna try to find  
A little peace of mind.  
I wanna leave the sound of rivets  
And the horns of taxis way behind.  
I want to run through the fields of the new-mown hay  
And at the close of day  
Let me stray  
Where I hear the organ playing.  
Just a song at twighlight  
When the lights are low.  
I wanna go,  
I wanna go  
I wanna be a little country girl in calico.  
The morning sings the golden melody,  
The evening brings the moonlight symphony,  
For all the world is wrapped in harmony  
Down on melody farm.
