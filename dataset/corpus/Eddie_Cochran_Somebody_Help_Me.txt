I've got a bone to pick with this world  
But I'm not very handsome, I can't find a girl  
I asked the aid of the whole universe  
I'm not very happy, it could be worse  
  
[Chorus:]  
Somebody help me (yeah-yeah-yeah)  
Somebody help me (yeah-yeah-yeah)  
Somebody please, somebody please help me  
  
I've been searchin' all over town  
Tryin' to find a girl who'd dare to vow  
The birds and the bees are helping me around  
We're turning this whole town upside down  
  
I've been watching the clock on the wall  
I've been waiting for my baby to call  
I've been pacin' all the floor  
Waiting for my baby to knock on the door
