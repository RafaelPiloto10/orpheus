(Another mother's child)  
Another mother's child lay dying  
Caught up in the games that people play  
You think guns are the only answer  
But words can have a stronger say  
I feel like zoomin'  
I feel like zoomin', baby  
Zoomin' away from here now  
I, I feel like zoomin', oh yeah  
Zoomin' away from here  
If a brother is really your brother  
Does is matter, the colors that he wears?  
But every brother is your brother  
Can you hear me?  
But I don't think you really care  
I feel like zoomin'  
(Gotta change the way we think about it)  
Zoomin' away from here now  
I, I feel like zoomin', oh yeah  
Zoomin' away from here  
One mother's love shot down in a minute  
But you know, there's two mothers crying  
One son has paid the price, lost his life  
One's locked away but they're both goin' to stay  
Crazy love, how long  
(How long is this gonna go on?)  
Feel like zoomin'  
(Gotta find a better place right now)  
Feel like zoomin'  
(Gotta go on up, a little higher)  
There's so much trouble going on all around us  
We've got to find a better way of thinking  
Zoomin' is just a change in space to a place  
That's in your mind and it's not hard to find  
And it's not hard to find  
I feel like zoomin', oh yeah  
Zoomin' away from here  
Let me tell you  
Do you want a better place?  
Don't you want a better space?  
Let's go zoomin'  
You know, it's never hard to find  
It's just inside your mind  
Let's go zoomin', oh yeah  
I feel like zoomin'  
Feel like zoomin', baby  
Zoomin', yeah  
Zoomin' away from here now  
I, I feel like zoomin', oh yeah  
Zoomin' away from here  
Do you want a better place?  
Don't you want a better space?  
Let's go zoomin'  
You know, it's never hard to find  
It's just inside your mind  
Let's go zoomin', oh yeah
