I'll never grow up, I won't try  
I can live with that, don't ask why  
I am resigned that this is me  
If I can take it, why can't she?  
  
I am bad at my best, but she will not accept that  
I can't get away with things I might regret  
She makes me get started when nothing's ever through  
And I do the best that I can do but  
  
Mimi gets mad when I make her wait  
Mimi gets mad when I phone too late  
But then Mimi gets sad if I hurt myself  
Can't say that about nobody else  
  
Someone should tell her honestly  
She is a fool to count on me  
I swore there would be no delay  
I should have been here yesterday  
  
So I sneak in the door and there she is again  
She could squeeze off a shot just as soon as look at me  
She don't say a word and every word is true  
And if that's the best that I can do then  
  
Mimi gets mad every time I'm wrong  
Mimi gets mad when I sleep too long  
But then Mimi gets glad when I do my share  
See no smile but I know it's there  
  
There must be a dozen other boys  
She could give her anger to  
I'm the only one, it doesn't matter what I do  
It's not very pretty but it's absolutely true  
That I'm still the best that she can do so  
  
Mimi gets mad
