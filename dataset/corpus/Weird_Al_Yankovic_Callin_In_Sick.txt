Hit my snooze alarm for the twenty seventh time  
Just don't feel like goin' to work, I think I'll call my boss,  
Then I'm gonna hack and cough and wheeze  
Swear I've got some strange disease  
What's that little twerp gonna say?  
Hey  
I'm callin' in sick today  
Callin' in sick today  
  
I could shine my pennies or clean my lava lamp  
I could spend all day in my underwear watching "Ernest Goes to Camp"  
I could sit and count my hair  
I could burp my Tupperware  
I'm not busy now anyway  
Hey  
  
I'm callin' in sick today  
Callin' in sick today  
Ain't goin' to work, no way  
Callin' in sick today  
  
I can do anything I want to  
I am invincible now  
I'm on fire, baby  
I'm alive, I'm alive, can you hear me, world?  
I'm alive!  
  
Maybe I'll spend all day staring at the sun  
And trying not to squint  
Maybe I'll make a huge color tapestry from  
My belly button lint  
When I'm sick of takin' abuse  
I just make up some lame excuse  
Freedom's just seven digits away  
Hey  
  
I'm callin' in sick today  
Callin' in sick today  
Ain't goin' to work, no way  
Callin' in sick today
