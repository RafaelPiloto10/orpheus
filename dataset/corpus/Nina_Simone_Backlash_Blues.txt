Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash  
Just who do think I am  
You raise my taxes, freeze my wages  
And send my son to Vietnam  
  
You give me second class houses  
And second class schools  
Do you think that alla colored folks  
Are just second class fools  
Mr. Backlash, I'm gonna leave you  
With the backlash blues  
  
When I try to find a job  
To earn a little cash  
All you got to offer  
Is your mean old white backlash  
But the world is big  
Big and bright and round  
And it's full of folks like me  
Who are black, yellow, beige and brown  
Mr. Backlash, I'm gonna leave you  
With the backlash blues  
  
Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash  
Just what do you think I got to lose  
I'm gonna leave you  
With the backlash blues  
You're the one will have the blues  
Not me, just wait and see
