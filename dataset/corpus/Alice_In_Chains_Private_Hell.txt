Give away a love  
And then remove another too  
Painted words adorn the walls  
Echoing untrue  
(I feel cold)  
  
Promises abound  
You rarely find it to begin  
Maybe I'm afraid  
To let you all the way in  
(I guess so)  
  
I excuse myself  
I'm used to my little cell  
I amuse myself  
In my very own private hell  
  
Lately I'm beside myself  
Pretending, unconcerned  
Standing on a corner  
Where I threw you on a turn  
(I'll move on)  
  
Flowers on a cross remain  
Mark an ending scene  
Damn it all if blood you spill  
Turn the grass more green  
(Life is short)  
  
I excuse myself  
I'm used to my little cell  
I amuse myself  
In my very own private hell
