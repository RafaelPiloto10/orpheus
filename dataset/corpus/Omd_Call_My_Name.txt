I've seen a new sensation  
I heard you call in pain  
But running round in circles  
Wont make it right again  
The telephone keeps ringing  
Your head is in the sand  
The future is unfolding  
But it's not what you had planned  
  
No matter what you do  
There's no escape for you  
You say we go too far  
You say I'll take my car  
  
So it always ends the same  
There's no one else to blame  
But I'd die  
If you would call my name  
  
Caught between two evils  
You should have stayed at home  
To wish upon and walk upon  
A planet of your own  
  
No matter what you do  
There's no escape for you  
You say we go too far  
You say I'll take my car  
  
So it always ends the same  
There's no one else to blame  
But I'd die  
If you would call my name  
  
Yes I'd die  
If you would call my name  
  
No matter what you do  
There's no escape for you  
You say we go too far  
You say I'll take my car  
  
So it always ends the same  
There's no one else to blame  
But I'd die  
If you would call my name  
  
Oh yes I'd die  
If you would call my name
