Guess this is where I get off  
Yep, member everything I told ya?  
Yep  
Got your song book?  
Yep  
Got them beats I gave ya?  
Yep  
Money?  
Yep  
Cell phone?  
Uh huh  
What's wrong?  
What if I don't make it?  
That's impossible  
Well what if?  
Fuck what and tell if to suck my dick  
Alright  
I taught you too well for that  
Besides, the money's already made,  
And the foundation's already been laid  
Now remember the most important thing I  
Taught ya when it gets crazy out there, with the  
Money, and the girls,and the fame  
What's that?

Before you roll it down  
Got it
