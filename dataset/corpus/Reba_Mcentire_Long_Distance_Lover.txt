Then you call me long distance from Memphis  
When they said it was you on the line  
I said don't come tomorrow  
Cause I won't be here  
You'd only be wasting your time  
  
I've been your long distance lover  
For far too long  
But I'm not here to tell you  
Who's right or who's wrong  
But I know I once loved you  
But somehow it seems  
That it's all a part of a dream  
  
So don't call me again in the morning  
Cause I won't be changing my mind  
And the phone will be ringing in my empty room  
I ain't leaving nothing behind  
  
I've been your long distance lover  
For far too long  
The nights are so lonely  
Can't keep holding on  
And the miles are like mountains  
That hide you from me  
And it's all a part of a dream  
  
I've been your long distance lover  
For far too long  
Can't hold on to feelings  
When you're so long gone  
It all keeps on a changing  
And now it just means  
That it's all a part of a dream
