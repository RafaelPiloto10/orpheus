You were good  
I was bad  
I just want everything you had  
Good loving is meant for two  
A bit for me and a bit for you  
Alright, oh yeah  
C'mon and make my bed  
Oh, baby, baby, I... C'mon  
Kneel and pray  
Oh baby this is what I say  
You did right, I did wrong  
Let me sing my simple song  
Oh baby, oh please  
Oh tremble on my knees  
Yeah, yeah, I need you so  
Come in, come in, oh let us play with sin  
Alright, yeah  
Kneel and pray  
Oh baby this is what I say  
Oh...  
Lady, lady, lady  
You better turn around  
Look at the ground  
Tell me what you found  
Aaah, oh yeah  
I wanna feel so good inside you  
Alright  
I can't hear you  
I can't see you  
I need you  
You better turn around  
Look at the ground  
Tell me what you found
