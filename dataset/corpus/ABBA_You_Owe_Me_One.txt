Frida Now there's a shadow falling over our faces  
Doubt forever in our hearts  
And in a while we'll start to pick up the traces  
We won't find the missing parts  
  
Buy me a ticket, I'll go to the Bahamas  
I need a rest from our petty little dramas  
Yes I really do  
Agnetha, Frida Aha, mm  
  
Now look what you've done  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
  
It's my turn to run  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Frida I wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion  
  
I was taken by surprise  
Now both of us are in a state of confusion  
Hesitation in our eyes  
Something unwanted has entered our existence  
  
I think it's better to view it from a distance  
Yes I really do  
Agnetha, Frida Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha
