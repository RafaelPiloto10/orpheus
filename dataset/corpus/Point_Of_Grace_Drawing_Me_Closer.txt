I'd be lost here inside myself  
I'd be nothing without You  
If Your ways didn't pull me in  
Like they do  
  
(Chorus)  
It's the hope I know, the grace you show  
That drawing me closer, drawing me closer  
It's the peace I feel, it's your love so real  
That's drawing me closer  
  
And my heart beats with pure amazement  
Every time I fell the tender touch of your love  
Drawing me closer  
Tell me how when You hold me near  
I can feel so free  
Where would I be if not for You  
Moving me  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Your love  
I can hear your voice it's calling me  
To the shelter of Your arms  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
It's the hope I know, the grace You show  
That's drawing me closer  
It's the peace I feel, it's Your love so real  
That's drawing me closer  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Your love  
Closer, Closer  
Hey, hey now drawing me closer  
Hey, hey now  
Everybody come and see  
Hey, hey now yeah  
Drawing me closer  
Hey, hey now...
