Something dreamy for dancing  
While we're here romancing  
It's love's holiday  
And love will be our guide  
Close your eyes  
When you open them dear  
I'll be right hear by your side  
So...  
Close your eyes  
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep  
Close your eyes  
And I will close mine  
Close your eyes  
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep  
Close your eyes  
This is divine  
Music play  
Something dreamy for dancing  
While were here romancing  
It's love's holiday  
And love will be our guide  
Close your eyes  
When you open them dear  
I'll be near by your side  
So won't you close your eyes...
