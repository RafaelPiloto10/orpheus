How can I bear this? show me  
How can I survive  
Trapped in your madness  
With no hope of release? oh -  
Do I just wait for  
Your demons to arrive?  
Blaming me for your ills  
While you rest in peace  
You are marked with death  
By your cruel lies  
You deserve all this  
You betrayed me  
With your final breath  
You will still despise  
Every tear or kiss  
You betrayed me  
I shall not be tricked  
Into pity for  
You must know full well  
That I love you  
And you can't inflict  
Any pain that's more  
Than this living hell  
But I love you  
I see the eyes that deceived  
Poor wasted hands growing cold  
No lover's comfort  
No belief to hold  
You have killed yourself  
Yours the infernal  
Original sin  
Mine the misfortune  
Of your heartless caprice - oh -  
Do I just wait for  
All your devils to move in?  
Blaming me for your death  
While you rest in peace  
I am marked for life  
And the peace I crave  
Is a fool's conceit  
I am branded  
And you'll twist the knife  
From beyond the grave  
And I fall, retreat  
Empty handed  
I shall not be tricked  
Into pity for  
You must know full well  
That I love you  
And you can't inflict  
Any pain that's more  
Than this living hell  
But I love you  
I see the eyes that betrayed  
Poor wasted hands growing cold  
No lover's comfort  
No belief to hold  
You are marked with death  
How can I convince you  
That you broke your own heart?  
How can I forgive you  
For the murderous part  
You played in destroying  
Your love and your life  
And mine ...  
I shall not be tricked  
Into pity for  
You must know full well  
That I love you  
And you can't inflict  
Any pain that's more  
Than this living hell  
But I love you  
I see the eyes that deceived  
Poor wasted hands growing cold  
No lover's comfort  
No belief to hold  
I am marked for life  
You are marked with death ...
