You say you need someone to love  
But when will you learn  
Whatever's done in this world  
Is still gonna turn  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, down comes the night, just another forever  
How long  
How long 'till you see that we're in this together  
How long, how long  
  
If you weren't so far away  
So far from here  
I'd make your tears go away  
And make you see clear  
  
Oh, you'd see a night when two hearts would surrender  
How long  
I don't want you to be the one I remember  
How long, how long  
  
Though time goes by in the blink of an eye  
It's passed over you  
There's no time to hide, won't you stand by my side  
I'm asking you, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say you need someone to love  
But when will you learn  
  
You say you need someone to love
