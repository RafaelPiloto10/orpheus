Overhead the albatross  
Hangs motionless upon the air  
And deep beneath the rolling waves  
In labyrinths of coral caves  
An echo of a distant time  
Comes willowing across the sand  
And everything is green and submarine.  
  
And no one called us to the land  
And no one knows the where's or why's.  
Something stirs and something tries  
Starts to climb toward the light.  
  
Strangers passing in the street  
By chance two separate glances meet  
And I am you and what I see is me.  
And do I take you by the hand  
And lead you through the land  
And help me understand  
The best I can.  
  
And no one called us to move on,  
And no one forces down our eyes.  
No one speaks and no one tries  
No one flies around the sun  
  
Cloudless everyday you fall  
Upon my waking eyes,  
Inviting and inciting me  
To rise.  
And through the window in the wall  
Come streaming in on sunlight wings  
A million bright ambassadors of morning.  
  
And no one sings me lullabys  
And no one makes me close my eyes  
So I throw the windows wide  
And call to you across the sky
