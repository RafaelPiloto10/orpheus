See me walking around I'm the boy about town that you heard of  
See me walking the streets I'm on top of the world that you heard of  
Oh like paper caught in wind  
I glide upstreet, I glide downstreet  
  
Oh and it won't let you go  
Till you finally come to rest or someone picks you up  
Upstreet downstreet and puts you in the bin  
See me walking around I'm the boy about town that you heard of  
  
See me walking the streets I'm on top of the world that you heard  
Oh I'm sitting watching rainbows  
And watching the people go crazy  
Oh please leave me aside  
  
I want to be a, I want to be,  
I want to live in,  
Upstreet downstreet like paper caught in wind  
Upstreet downstreet it won't let you go  
  
Na na na nah, na na na nah  
Na na na na na na nah  
Na na na nah, na na na nah  
There's more than you can hope for in this world
