So hot outside all I can wear  
Is these cut off overalls  
And sandals on my feet.  
But I emptied my pockets for a bus ticket  
Just so I could sit there on a broken seat  
I got no place I should go  
I got no worries you know  
Second or seventh street,  
It doesn't matter to me.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause you're mine  
That's all I need to know  
The sunshine's everywhere we go  
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold  
Every night, yeah  
I'm the lucky one.  
I'm the lucky one.  
  
Well I pulled back down to  
My upstreet apartment  
The air never works in that old place  
Twenty-seven I thought I'd  
Be further along  
Than just this rented space.  
I got no papers to read  
I got no cable TV  
And I got no places to be  
I got no people to meet  
  
'Cause you're mine  
That's all I need to know  
The sunshine's everywhere we go  
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold  
Every night, yeah  
I'm the lucky one.  
I'm the lucky one.  
  
I'm on a roll  
When I'm with you  
Don't stop me now  
I just can't lose  
  
'Cause you're mine  
That's all I need to know  
The sunshine's everywhere we go  
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold  
Every night  
  
'Cause you're mine  
That's all I need to know  
The sunshine's everywhere we go  
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold  
Every night, yeah  
I'm the lucky one  
I'm the lucky one,  
Yeah I'm the lucky one  
I'm the lucky one
