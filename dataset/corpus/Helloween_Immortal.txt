Two lifes, one fate  
I have to leave  
So will you follow me?  
That's how it's meant to be  
I reigned as God  
I'm monumental  
Soon I will arise  
With you by my side  
And we will radiate the skies  
He who will gaze our lights  
Will kill his mind, his vision blind  
  
Tonight we are stars  
Stars that shine on bright  
Tonight we are stars  
Stars immortal light  
Tonight we are stars  
  
All treasures all goods  
We bury where we lay down to die  
And pay for paradise  
Await the highest thorn of all  
And who will gaze our lights  
Will kill his mind, is going blind  
  
Tonight we are stars  
Stars that shine on bright  
Tonght we are stars  
Stars inside the nights of ache  
Love and hate  
Hope and shade  
Take you away  
  
I will take you away  
I'm gonna take you away  
I'm gonna take you away  
  
Tonight we are stars  
Stars that shine on bright  
Tonight we are stars  
Stars immortal light of ache  
Light of hate  
Hope and shade  
Part of the fate  
Tonight we are stars
