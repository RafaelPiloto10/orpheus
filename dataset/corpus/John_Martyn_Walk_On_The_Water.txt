She walked to the water  
And came back looking good and feeling fine  
And you could tell by her eyes  
She was not wasting time  
  
She walked to the water  
And every light went on inside the town  
You know the love in her eyes  
Was flashing on the rocks all around  
  
Down to the water she walked  
And all the people moved aside  
You know the light in her hair so bright  
They almost cried  
  
Saved by the water  
She said and she was right, I know she was  
You know she told me true  
About all the things I got  
  
Going down to see her  
Bring yourself and all that you might own  
She can give you the clues  
To all the seeds you've sown  
  
Down to the water  
She came back feeling fine and looking good  
And you could tell by her eyes  
That she always knew she would
