I can't laugh I can't cry I can't see inside of me  
Don't know the reason why  
  
I ain't straight  
And I ain't high  
I'm the ugly in between  
Can't live and I can't die  
  
I wanna scream  
And I can't win  
My life's a living soundtrack  
For a human horror film  
I can't feel  
And I can't love  
My mama never showed me how  
I never was enough  
  
I can't laugh  
And I can't smile  
I'll sacrifice my aged elders  
To show me how to die  
I can't love  
And I can't feel  
And my mother never loved me  
Deep down she hated me  
  
I can't fuck  
I can't feel  
I'm one bizarre motherfucker  
What the fuck's inside of me  
  
I'll kill the beast so to free my soul  
And smash the mirrors that won't let me go  
Oh if there's a smile that ya see  
It's only the clockwork orange that's in me  
  
I curse the darkness impassioned plea  
And tear the heart out and watch me bleed  
I'll sacrifice my blood for free  
To satisfy the vengeance that's in me  
And bury the mirror that's inside me
