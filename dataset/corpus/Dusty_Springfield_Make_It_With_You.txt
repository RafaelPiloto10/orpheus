Ah, ha, have you ever tried  
Really reaching out for the other side?  
I may be climbing up rainbows  
But baby, here goes  
Oh, dreams, they're for those who sleep  
Life is for us to keep  
And if you're wonderin' what this all is leadin' to  
I want to make it with you  
I really think that we could make it, ooh  
  
No, you don't know me well  
And every little thing only time will tell  
But you believe the things that I do  
And we'll see it through  
Oh, life can be short or long  
Love can be right or wrong  
And if I choose the one I'd like to help me through  
I'd like to make it with you  
I really think that we could make it, yeah, yeah, ooh  
  
Ah, ha, and if I choose the one I'd like to help me through  
Oh, hoo, I'd like to make it with you, ah, ha  
Oh, baby, ah, I want to make it with you  
Oh, let's make it, I want to make it with you  
Oh, baby, yeah, I want to make it with you  
Oh, hoo, let's make it, I want to make it with you  
Ah, make it, let's make it  
I want to make it with you
