The times were hard and I was running  
I could feel my chance was coming  
Another time, another place  
A pillow filled with frozen tears  
  
See the gates, a distant fire  
Shows the way, to my desire  
Laying down my heart for you  
'Cause I'm lonely, feelin' blue  
  
I know that I'll never die on love  
But I'll never get enough  
Oh, I got no time to lose  
  
On my avenue to a jet airliner  
Avenue to my broken dreams  
My avenue to a jet airliner  
Like an old old movie-scene  
  
My avenue to a jet airliner  
Brings me back to the dreams I loved  
Good guys only win in movies  
But this time babe I'll get enough  
  
(The avenue is closed, is closed forever)  
  
Love can breed misunderstanding  
But my heart will soon be landing  
Another love on golden wings  
Oh, I'll buy you diamond rings  
  
Waitin' for a lonely rainbow  
Magic wave where will I go  
Breaking down my heart to you  
'Cause I'm lonely, feelin' blue  
  
I know that I'll never die on love  
But I'll never get enough  
Oh, I got no time to lose  
  
(But you know, yes you know you can change it)
