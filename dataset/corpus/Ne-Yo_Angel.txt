Where did you go? When I woke up  
You were gone  
Find someone to replace you  
I'll never be alone  
I sit around so anxious for you to call my phone  
She went up to heaven, said she'd be back later on, ooo  
  
[Chorus:]  
In love with an angel (an angel)  
She don't belong to me (I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)  
In love with an angel (an angel)  
She don't belong to me (I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)  
In love with an angel (an angel)  
She don't belong to me (I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)  
In love with an angel  
I'm in love  
I'm in love  
I'm in love  
I'm in love  
I'm in love  
I'm in love  
I'm in love  
  
And I just can't chase the clouds out of my mind (out of my mind)  
She's the cause of my heartache, but I, I'll be fine (I think I'll be fine)  
'Cause when we kiss, there's no playin' around, there's no time, ooo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooo  
Hey  
Ooo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In love with an angel  
In love with an angel  
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love  
In love with an angel  
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love  
In love with an angel  
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
