Are you low?  
Are you low?  
Take it slow  
Tried to live high ended up so low  
  
Can't believe this is real, somethings got to change  
Got to live my life, but I love to be strange  
Don't wanna be wrapped up in a typical package  
Ran away but couldn't find my way back  
Now I'm low  
I feel low  
  
Stuck in between, it's hard to explain  
Why every new beginning feels exactly the same  
And so I drink, drink still I am famished  
I want to go the distance but never quite finish  
  
Now I'm low  
I feel low  
Take it slow  
Try to live high and you end up low  
  
So here I reside in the middle of pride  
In the middle of the night I lost my ride  
And in a blink, blink everyone vanished  
I know your vision understands my condition  
Now I'm low  
Are you low?  
Take it slow  
Tried to live high, but I lost control  
Now I'm low  
Are you low?  
Take it slow  
Got to slow it down  
And regain control  
  
Pain might take you away from where you wanted to be  
I'm drawing the line  
Somewhere down below  
And then I'm gonna rise up  
Make my way back into the line up  
Oh, must let it go  
If the one-drop undertow tells you so  
Are you low?  
(Or are you waiting?)  
Are you low?  
(While the sun is fading)  
Down below  
(Why are you waiting?)  
You know you can't live high if you can't live low  
If you can't live low  
Are you low?  
(Or are you waiting?)  
Are you low?  
(While the sun is fading)  
Take me slow  
(Why are you waiting?)  
I know you want to be high, but you must be low  
Are you low?  
(Or are you waiting?)  
Are you low?  
(While the sun is fading)  
(Why are you waiting?)  
If you want to be high  
You've got to live low
