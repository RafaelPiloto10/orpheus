Grass is green  
Like I've never seen.  
Sky above was never so blue.  
Now here am I  
No one standing near.  
It's a lonely world  
Such a lonely world.  
  
The world through a tear  
From days gone by  
The world through a tear  
Too slow to dry  
The world through a tear.  
The tear I cry.  
  
Just last year  
We wandered here  
And dreamed a dream  
That never would die.  
Now only me  
Hopin' she'll appear  
It's a lonely world  
Such a lonely world  
  
The world through a tear  
From days gone by  
The world through a tear  
Too slow to dry  
The world through a tear  
The tear I cry.
