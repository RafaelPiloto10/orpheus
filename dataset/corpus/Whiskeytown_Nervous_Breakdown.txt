I'm about to have a nervous breakdown  
My head really hurts  
If I don't get the hell outta here  
I'm gonna go berserk, cause  
I'm crazy and I'm hurt  
Head on my shoulders  
I'm going berserk  
Always talk the same old talk  
The same old lies  
You see the way i am  
You stop anytime you can, cause  
I'm crazy and I'm hurt  
Head on my shoulders  
H'm going berserk  
I'm crazy and I'm hurt  
Head on my shoulders  
I'm going berserk
