To all my people in the struggle  
You think God's forgotten about you  
Here's some pain medicine  
Let's go!  
You're in your car  
You at the house, on you job  
Be encouraged, boo  
  
I've been down so long  
I've been hurt for so long  
There were times I thought I would never see the break of day  
It was hard for me to see your plan for me  
And I tried to believe trouble won't last always  
See, night after night (night after night, night after night)  
I pray Lord don't take your joy from me  
And then late one night (then late one night)  
I read in your love letter that it's gonna get better  
  
Don't cha know that  
I've been looking for you?  
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me  
I'm so glad I found you  
Now that I'm changed, no one can keep me away from you  
Oh  
You've been so good to us  
You brought us a mighty long way  
That's why we love ya  
  
When my enemies tried to come for me  
And they thought that my world was coming to an end  
All the while you knew  
That I would make it through  
I feel closer to you now than when I first began  
Jesus you are (Jesus you are, Jesus you are)  
You are my sun right after the rain  
Wherever you are (wherever you are)  
I just wanna be near you  
I'm so glad I can hear you  
  
Don't cha know that  
I've been looking for you?  
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me  
I'm so glad I found you  
Now that I'm changed, no one can keep me away from you  
Don't cha know that  
I've been looking for you?  
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me  
I'm so glad I found you  
Now that I'm changed, no one can keep me away from you  
(Here we go now, here we go now  
Don't stop now, let's go now, in the front now  
In the back now, let's go now, ladies!)  
  
Uh oh, uh uh oh (That's for the struggle)  
Uh oh, uh uh oh (That's for the pain)  
Uh oh, uh uh oh (That's for those dark nights)  
Uh oh, uh uh oh (Come on and sing it wit' us, ya'll)  
  
Jesus you are (Jesus you are, Jesus you are)  
You are my sunlight after the rain  
Wherever you are (wherever you are)  
I just wanna be near you  
I so glad I found you

Uh oh, uh uh oh (oh oh)  
Uh oh, uh uh oh (oh oh)  
Uh oh, uh uh oh (oh oh)  
Uh oh, uh uh oh (oh oh)
