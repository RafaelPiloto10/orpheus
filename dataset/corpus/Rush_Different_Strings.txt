Who's come to slay the dragon  
Come to watch him fall?  
Making arrows out of pointed words  
Giant killers, at the call  
Too much fuss and bother  
Too much contradiction  
And confusion  
Peel away the mystery  
Here's a clue to some real motivation  
  
All there really is  
The two of us  
And we both know why we've come along  
Nothing to explain  
It's a part of us  
To be found within a song  
  
What happened to our innocence  
Did it go out of style?  
Along with our naivete?  
No longer a child  
Different eyes see different things  
Different hearts  
Beat on different strings  
But there are times  
For you and me  
When all such things agree
