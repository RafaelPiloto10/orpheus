Hear the silent song  
A moment have come before this.  
My heart, so violently beats along.  
Bleeding me to want to end it all.  
  
I weep for the dream in a dream.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
  
I read the words on torn down walls  
Reminding me how much I love you.  
  
I weep for the dream in a dream.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
I leave bleeding yet another day.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
It's all for you.  
It's all for you.  
  
Weep for the dream in a dream.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
I leave bleeding yet another day.  
The one that made all lips go blue.  
It's all for you.  
It's all for you.  
It's all for you.
