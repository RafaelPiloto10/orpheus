This England made me  
Between the war and a rockets flying  
You found the crib that saves me  
And teach me wrong and right  
  
Then the world was talking  
It never got it's chance to say  
When there's too much talking  
Nobody hears the words you say  
  
[Chorus]  
You won't see  
Baby now I want you  
These blind communications  
Only last throughout the year  
And half of what we're saying  
Is halfway in a truth  
And blind communications  
For a million hearts and fools  
  
I am a witness  
To a land of a million fools  
All placing bets on life  
Then hate the ones you lose  
And all the lonely  
Never get the chance to say  
That their one and only  
Would be the chance to even play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hello Monday  
The week is just a blur  
I've been burning bridges  
And now I'm begging at your door  
So I keep on working  
'cause it's a chance for me to pay  
But too much talking  
When you believe the words I say  
  
[Chorus]
