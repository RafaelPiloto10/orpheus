Told that I was supposed to fail  
I would'nt amount to much of nothin'  
Yes I pray  
There was days I wondered if you really loved me  
But baby you feel pain.  
Mama was sane when I felt like runnin' away.  
I couldn't take it.  
I'm so hinted, angry with all of the world.  
I couldn't keep friends just wishin' you'd come back and see  
My difficult times being an adolescent.  
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean.  
  
I needed you  
When I needed a father figure.  
I needed you  
To stop me from makin'the wrong decisions.  
At seventeen, when the cold of the world got my back up against the wall.  
I need, I needed you.  
(With the hope of being sometihng special in life)  
(And what happens when the one that they depend on the most)  
I need, I needed you.  
(Is never there)

An Lord I pray.  
Give me strength to forgive them and not hold all the I've hate I got.  
Even though the pains from this was too heavy.  
Lord I pray.  
Show my younger brothers growin' up without a father how to turn what they
have less into a legacy.

From the knowledge I ain't get  
God, you gave me.  
And temptations was callin' me, didn't know which way to go.
