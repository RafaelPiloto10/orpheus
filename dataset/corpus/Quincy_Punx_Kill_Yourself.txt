  
well you say its always darkest  
Just before it turns pitch black  
If you ever had a good time  
You'd probably have a heart attack  
You've only got two moods  
Self pity and depression  
I'm really fucking sick of it  
So let me give you a suggestion  
Kill yourself, Kill yourself, Kill yourself  
Death might be fun why don't you try and see  
Kill yourself, Kill yourself, Kill yourself  
Just put us all out of your misery  
You think the worlds against you  
But you dring it on yourself  
I think you need a doctor  
Maybe Kavorkian can help  
Lets have your funeral now  
I'll run you over with the hearse  
Death might improve your attitude  
You know it couldn't get any worse
