Look at me, I appear in the night  
Look at me, I'm made up of lights  
Look at me, I am really a sight  
A sight to behold  
  
To hold with your eyes  
Look at me, I can move like you  
Look at me, I can zoom in on you  
Look at me, I can, and scream  
I can make you laugh, I can make you scream  
  
3-d, the more you look  
The more you'll see  
3-d, the more you  
The closer I'll see you  
Look at me, I'm out of control  
Look at me  
  
You can look down my throat  
Look at me, but can't out just me  
I'm mind, I'm matter on the video screen  
Look at me, ooh, the reds and greens  
Look at me, all the colors so real  
Look at me, I'll make you laugh  
And I'll make you scream  
I'm mind, I'm matter on the video screen  
3-d, the more you look  
The more you'll see  
3-d, the more you  
The closer I'll see you  
I like what I see  
I feel good about me  
  
You'll like what you see  
You'll like what you see  
You'll like what you see  
You'll like what you see  
You'll like what you see  
  
Well it's in 3-d  
3-d, the more you look  
The more you'll see  
3-d, the more you look  
The more you'll see  
3-d, the more you look  
The more you'll see  
3-d, the more you look  
The closer I'll see you
