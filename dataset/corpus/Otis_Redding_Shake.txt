Shake! (Everybody say it!)  
Shake! (Early in the morning)  
Shake! (Late in the evening)  
Shake! (In the midnight hour)  
Shake! (When the time's going bad, now)  
Shake!  
Shake with the feeling!  
Shake with the feeling!  
  
Listen while I'm talkin' to you now  
Tell you what I'm gonna do now  
There's a new thing going around now  
I'll tell what to put down now  
  
You move your body all around  
And just shake  
That's the way you do it  
Shake, shake, shake it baby  
Shake it like a bowl of soup  
Let your body loop de loop  
Put your hands on your hip  
Come on and let your backbone slip  
Move your body like your hip  
And just shake!  
  
Shake early in the morning  
Shake early in the evening  
  
A ring-a-ling-a-ling  
Honey, shakin' is the greatest thing  
But if you really roll  
Gotta do the thing with soul!  
  
Shake shake with all your might now  
If you do it, do it right now  
Put your hands on your hip,yeah  
Come on and let your backbone slip  
Move your body like your hip  
And just shake  
  
(God have mercy now!)  
Early in the morning  
Early in the evening  
All night long, y'all!  
  
If you really want to roll  
Gotta do the thing with soul!  
Shake shake with all your might  
If you do it, do it right  
Let your body loop de lite  
Shake!  
Everybody say it, shake!  
One more time, shake!  
Everybody louder, shake!  
One more time, now, say shake!  
Everybody a bit louder, shake!
