I wish  
With all my heart  
That you would stay...  
And I've never felt this way  
But here, today, I need to say...  
  
You're in the past  
We've all grown up  
Without your help, though  
I never would've thought  
That I could be whatever,  
Beyond my hopes and dreams  
But you need to know  
I'm gonna go my own way...  
  
I guess you should've seen it coming  
We've both made mistakes back then  
But ever since we've been together  
I've learned from all of them  
We'll always be together  
Yeah, no matter what!  
But if you listen to your heart,  
You can tell them what you're not... !  
  
You're in the past  
  
We've all grown up  
Without your help, though  
I never would've thought  
That I could be whatever,  
Beyond my hopes and dreams  
But you need to know  
I'm gonna go my own way...  
  
We've both been made fun of,  
Had stops on our way!  
But if we fight together,  
We'll make it through some day!  
  
You're in the past  
We've all grown up  
Without your help, though  
I never would've thought  
That I could be whatever,  
Beyond my hopes and dreams  
But you need to know  
I'm gonna go my own way...  
  
Can't believe what's happened  
Through the years...  
But we knew someday  
I'd have to go my own way...
