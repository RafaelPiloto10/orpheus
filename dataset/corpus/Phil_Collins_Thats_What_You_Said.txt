I remember the night you weren't at home  
(had to work late is what I heard)  
That's what you said  
I can never forget the way it felt,  
You needed some time to work it out,  
That's what you said  
And now I feel a fool.  
  
Cause late at night I call your name,  
I'm wondering what for,  
Cause I've seen those other guys  
Sniffin' around your door.  
  
Whatever happened to the words  
'Lovers for all eternity?'  
That's what you said,  
I was your Romeo, you were my Juliet,  
Eternally  
That's what you said  
And now I feel a fool.  
  
Cause late at night I hear your voice  
Calling out my name,  
Oh I know it's just a dream  
But every night's the same.  
  
I carried a torch for you, through the thick and thin  
You know it don't seem right that I won't see you again  
No no  
  
Late at night I call your name,  
I'm wondering what for,  
Cause I keep seeing those other guys  
Sniffin' around your door.  
  
I carried a torch for you through the wind and rain  
I'll never forget you, but I won't see you again  
No no  
  
I thought your friends all liked me  
I thought I fitted in just right,  
That's what you said.  
Soon I'll be gone and you'll be free,  
You can go find the things that you want.  
That's what you said  
And I won't feel a fool  
  
Cause late at night I still call your name,  
I'm wondering what for,  
Cause I keep seeing those other guys  
Sniffin' around your door.  
  
What for?
