Father, let us build a boat and sail away  
There's nothing for you here  
And brother, let us throw our lot out upon the sea  
It's been done before  
  
I'm thinking 'bout a broken heart  
I'm talking 'bout the break of dawn  
You love me while I'm here  
Then you can miss me when I'm gone  
Sweet misunderstanding  
Won't you leave a poor boy alone  
I'm the one eyed seed of a tumbleweed  
In the belly of a rolling stone  
  
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Back on the road again  
  
I had a little woman in Memphis  
She wanted to be my bride  
She said, settle on down, traveling man  
You can stay right by my side  
I tried so hard to please her  
But I couldn't hold out too long  
'Cause one Saturday night I was laying in bed  
And I heard that highway song  
  
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Back on the road again  
  
Now one of these days that highway song will lose its appeal to me  
I'm gonna settle on down like a natural born man  
I'm gonna live my life naturally (Free and easy)  
Until that day the thunder's gonna roll  
And I notice there's a sign of rain  
So I grab my bags and I pack my clothes  
And I'm back on the road again  
  
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Back on the road again  
  
I'm thinking 'bout a broken heart  
I been talking 'bout the break of dawn  
You loved me while I'm here  
and you can miss me when I'm gone  
And I said sweet misunderstanding  
Won't you leave a poor boy alone  
'Cause I'm the one eyed seed of a tumbleweed  
In the belly of a rolling stone  
  
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Back on the road again  
  
Here I am again  
Holiday Inn  
Same old four walls again  
Gee, but it's fine to be back home again (whoa, now)  
Say, Holiday Inn, I'm on the road again
