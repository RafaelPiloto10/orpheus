No good man  
Loving on a no good plan never treats me as he should  
And that ain't good he's always bringing me down  
He's no saint Heaven knows that's what he ain't  
Spends his money foolishly and not on me  
I'm the one who gets the run around  
  
I ought to hate him but still I love him so  
Cos I require love that's made of fire  
And in his arms I find always get that kind  
No good man  
Ever since the world began there's been other folks like me  
Born to be in love with a no good man  
  
I ought to hate him but still I love him so  
Cos you see I require love that's made of fire  
And in his arms I find always get that kind  
No good man  
Ever since the world began there's been other folks like me  
Born to be in love with a no good man
