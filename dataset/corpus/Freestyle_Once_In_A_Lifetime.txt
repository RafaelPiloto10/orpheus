Been thinking bout you baby  
And I don't know what to do  
All I think about is you  
Seems everything around me  
Things I've never understood  
They all make sense when I'm with you.  
  
Oh, I've heard it all before  
Finding so called love then you leave it behind  
But now I feel so sure  
I listen to my heart this time  
So I lay it on the line  
  
Chorus:  
  
I know that what I've found is once in a lifetime  
And I know there's no way out  
Cause it's once in a lifetime  
  
I've always been so lonely  
No one there for me to hold  
And every night was just so cold  
Oh don't get me wrong I've been around  
But I've resigned myself to thinking  
Mine is just another story often told  
  
Oh, I've heard it all before  
Finding so called love then you leave it behind  
But now I feel so sure  
I listen to my heart this time  
Put my heart before my mind  
  
Chorus:  
  
I know that what I've found is once in a lifetime  
And I know there's no way out  
Cause it's once in a lifetime  
  
Coda:  
  
It's not like I'm running out of time  
I'm taking everything in stride  
It's just I never thought I'd find  
What would make me change my mind  
  
Chorus:  
  
I know that what I've found is once in a lifetime yeah yeah  
And I know there's no way out  
Cause it's once in a lifetime  
  
Ohhhh... ohhhhh...
