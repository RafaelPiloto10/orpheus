I see your scars  
I know where they're from  
So sensually carved and bleeding  
Until you're dead and gone  
I've seen it all before  
Beauty and splendor torn  
It's when heaven turns to black  
And hell to white  
Right so wrong and wrong so right  
  
Feel it turning your heart into stone  
Feel it piercing your courageous soul  
You're beyond now- redemption  
And no one's going to catch you when you fall  
  
I see you crawl  
You can barely walk  
And arms wide open  
You keep on begging for more  
I've been there before  
Knocking on the same door  
It's when hate turns to love  
And love to hate  
Faith to doubt and doubt to faith
