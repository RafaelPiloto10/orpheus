We get to be, a ripple in the water  
We get to be a rock that's thrown  
We get to be a boy on the bridge  
Standing over the reservoir  
See the water lap along the shore line  
The buried forest of a man made lake  
Cemeteries are laying underneath it  
Your heart like a dam when it breaks.  
  
We are floating, we are swimming  
And in this moment we are forgetting  
What it costs, what it takes  
For one perfect world  
When we look the other way.  
I'm okay, if I don't look a little closer  
I am driving with the tank full  
I'm OK if I don't see beyond the shore  
The sun is blistering this black top road.  
I'm OK if I don't have to do the killing  
We are talking, cellular and mobile  
OK know what the killing is for.  
As if its some kind of cure for this world of woe  
  
We are talking, we are driving  
And in this moment we are denying  
What it costs, what it takes  
For one perfect world  
When we look the other way  
It's one perfect world  
When we look the other way  
Its one perfect world  
  
If you can't see beyond the myth of isolation  
And the miracle of daybreak doesn't move you anymore,  
Connect the points and see the constellations  
As the night comes down on the reservoir.  
  
We are swimming, we are floating  
And in this moment we are beholden to  
What it costs, and what it takes  
For one perfect world  
Can we learn to live another way?  
It's one perfect world  
Can we learn to live another way?  
Its one perfect world  
Can we learn to live another world?  
It's one perfect world  
  
We get to be a ripple in the water.
