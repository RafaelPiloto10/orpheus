I've been around.  
I used to sing songs that were hand-me-downs.  
I've been called a hero,  
I've been called a clown.  
I've learned the old ways and the new ways now.  
  
I've been around.  
I can drop names that will knock ya down.  
I've rock and rolled and I've fiddled around,  
From Hollywood to the Nashville sound.  
  
I've been around,  
Climbed the highest mountain I found.  
I went to the top and I fell back down.  
And I know what I'm talking about,  
'Cause I've been around.  
  
I've been in love.  
I've been down on my knees and prayed to God above.  
"Why does so much pain go with so mich love?  
Why is she still the one I'm dreaming of? "  
  
Yeah, I've been around,  
And the best two friends I've ever found  
Are a woman's love and a guitar sound.  
And I know what I'm talking about,  
'Cause I've been around.  
Yeah I've been around.
