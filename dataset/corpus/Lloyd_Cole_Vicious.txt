Vicious, you hit me with a flower  
You do it every hour  
Oh baby you're so vicious  
Vicious, you want me to hit you with a stick  
All I got here is a guitar pick  
Baby you're so vicious  
When I see you come, baby I just have to run far away  
You're not the kind of person around whom I want to stay ah ah  
(when I see you coming)  
When I see you coming down my street  
(I just have to run)  
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet  
(when I see you come come come come)  
You're not the kind of person with whom I want to make  
Cause you're so vicious  
Ah ah vicious (vicious)  
Oh yeah  
  
Delicious, you hit me with your flower  
You do it every hour  
Oh baby you're so vicious  
Vicious, why don't you go swallow razor blades  
You must think i'm some kind of gay blade? Uh uh  
Oh baby you're so vicious  
When I see you coming baby I just got to run  
(run run)  
Far away  
You're not that good but you're  
Certainly fair game  
(when I see you coming)  
When I see you coming down my street  
(I just have to run)  
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet  
(when I see you come come come come)  
You're not the kind of person that I even wanna meet  
Cause you're so vicious  
You're so vicious, you're so vicious  
You're so vicious, you're so vicious  
You're so vicious, you're so vicious  
You're so vicious
