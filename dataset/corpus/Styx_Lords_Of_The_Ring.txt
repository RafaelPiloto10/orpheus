All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the music in their story  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the lands of ancient glory  
  
In the year of the Lords  
The message came from above  
The heavens opened with their mighty sound  
that shook the people in the town  
  
And so we came from everywhere  
The young and old the rich and poor  
To hear the legend of the magic ring  
and of the powers it could bring, they sing  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the music in their story  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery it brings  
May we someday wear its glory  
  
And now the message is clear  
For I became a Lord this year  
And though the legend was pure fantasy  
We still need the hope it brings, so let's sing  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To believe is a wonderous thing  
May we always sing their glory  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the promise of their story
