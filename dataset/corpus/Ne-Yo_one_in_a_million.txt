Jet setter  
Go getter  
Nothing better  
Call me Mr. been there done that  
Top model chick to your every day hood rat  
Less than all but more than a few  
But I've never met one like you  
  
Been all over the world  
Done a little bit of everything  
Little bit of everywhere  
With a little bit of everyone  
But all the girls I've been with  
Things I've seen and it takes much to impress  
But sho nuff you blow it makes your soul stand out from the rest  
  
I can be in love  
But I just don't know (don't know girl)  
Baby one thing is for certain  
Whatever you do it's working  
Other girls don't matter  
In your presence can't do what you do  
There's a million girls around  
But I don't see no one but you  
  
Girl you're so one in a million  
You are  
Baby you're the best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
And I'm certain that  
There ain't nothing better  
No there ain't nothing better than this  
  
You're not a regular girl  
You don't give a damn about the loot  
Talking about I can't do it for you  
But you can do it for yourself  
Even though that ain't so  
Baby cos my dough don't know how to end  
But that independent thing I'm with it  
All we do is win, baby  
  
I could be in love  
But I just don't know (don't know girl)  
Baby one thing is for certain  
Whatever you do it's working  
Other girls don't matter  
In your presence can't do what you do  
There's a million girls around  
But I don't see no one but you  
  
Baby you're so one in a million  
You are  
Baby you're the best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
And I'm certain that  
There ain't nothing better  
No there ain't nothing better than this  
Baby you're so one in a million  
You are (say you are)  
Baby you're the best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
And I'm certain that  
There ain't nothing better  
No there ain't nothing better than this  
  
Diamond girl  
Only one in the world  
Just one of a kind  
She mine  
  
Ooh all that I can think  
About is what this thing could be  
A future baby  
Baby you're one of a kind  
That means that you're the only one for me  
Only one for me  
  
Baby girl you're so one in a million  
You are  
Baby you're the best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
And I'm certain that  
There ain't nothing better  
No there ain't nothing better than this  
Girl you're so one in a million  
You are  
Baby you're the best I ever had  
Best I ever had  
And I'm certain that  
There ain't nothing better  
No there ain't nothing better than this
