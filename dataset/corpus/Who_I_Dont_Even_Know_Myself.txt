There's nothing in the way I walk that could tell you where I'm going,  
There's nothing in the words I speak that can betray anything I'm knowing,  
Don't think about the way I dress, you can fit me on a labeled shelf,  
Don't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myself,  
Ooh I don't know myself.  
  
I don't mind if you try once in a while,  
I don't mind if I cry once in a while,  
The doors aren't shut as tight as they might seem,  
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream.  
  
Don't listen to the words I say, weighing up if I'm enlightened,  
Don't shiver as you pass me by, 'cause mister I'm the one who's frightened,  
The police just came and left, they wanted me and no one else,  
Don't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myself,  
I said I don't know myself.  
  
I don't mind if you try once in a while,  
I don't mind if I cry once in a while,  
The doors aren't shut as tight as they might seem,  
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream.  
  
Do you remember me, I don't remember you,  
Do you still love me, you know I think you do,  
I have been gone, and some prison warder knows my scream,  
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream.  
  
There's only five who know my real name,  
And my mother don't believe they know it,  
What she called me is the way I'm staying,  
And no one'll ever know it,  
Come on all of you big boys, come on all of you elves,  
Don't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myself,  
I said I don't know myself.  
  
I don't mind if you try once in a while,  
And I don't mind if I cry once in a while.
