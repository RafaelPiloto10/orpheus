Do the worm on the Acropolis  
Slam dance the cosmopolis  
Enlighten the populace  
  
Hungry darkness of living  
Who will thirst in the pit?  
Hooked in metropolis  
She spent a lifetime deciding  
How to run from it  
Addicts of metropolis  
Once fate had a witness  
And the years seemed like friends  
Girlfriends  
Her babies can dream  
But dreams begin like the end  
Shot into eternity  
Methadone kitty  
Iron serenity  
  
Ghetto defendant  
It is heroin pity  
Not tear gas nor baton charge  
That stops you taking the city  
  
Strung out committee  
Walled out of the city  
Clubbed down from uptown  
Sprayed pest from the nest  
Run out to barrio town  
The guards are itchy  
Forced to watch at the feast  
Then sweep up the night  
Flipped pieces of coin  
Broken bottles  
Exchanged for birthright  
Grafted in a jiffy  
  
Strung out committee  
Sitting pretty  
Graphed in a jiffy  
No pity, pretty  
  
The ghetto prince of gutter poets  
Was bounced out of the room  
Jean Arthur Rimbaud  
By the bodyguards of greed  
For disturbing the tomb  
1873  
His words like flamethrowers  
Paris commune  
Burnt the ghettos in their chests  
His face was painted whiter  
And he was laid to rest  
Died in Marseilles  
Buried in Charleville  
Shut up  
  
Soap floods oil in water  
All churn in the wake  
On the great ship of progress  
The crew can't find the brake  
Klaxons are blaring  
The admiral snores command  
Submarines boil in oceans  
While the armies fight with suns
