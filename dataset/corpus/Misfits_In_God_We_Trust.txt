Sentenced to a barren waste, wo-oh-oh  
Imprisoned somewhere deep in space, wo-oh-oh  
For in God we still believe, wo-oh-oh  
Left to die we watch them leave  
  
Lift our heads to the sky  
He won't let us die  
We will survive  
Wheeling our swords for the Lord  
  
Prisoners of faith cannot be  
Tearing our chains we break free  
  
With a burst of light the walls are blown away  
The one who's captured us with life, they'll pay  
And the blood we leave behind won't wash away  
  
Another time, another place, wo-oh-oh  
A planet Earth now lost in space, wo-oh-oh  
They live in fear, for peace they yearn, wo-oh-oh  
For those who don't, their souls will burn  
  
So reach for the sky  
For our Lord we will die  
We will survive  
Wheeling our swords for the Lord  
  
Father, your voice we have heard  
We raise up our swords, speak the word  
  
For we have seen the face of Hell and still believe  
That the sword to kill the beast He's given me  
So how many more must die that one may see  
  
For we have seen the face of Hell and still believe  
That the sword to kill the beast He's given me  
So how many more must die that one may see  
Yeah
