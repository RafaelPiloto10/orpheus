The morning slowly came, my life about to end  
Then the wind would change, all but one had left  
The angelic wolf had stayed, without a word she said  
Follow me, follow the wolf  
  
And so I followed the wolf, up the wooded mountain side  
Close to the top... she suddenly stopped  
Sun to the East, man and beast  
Just two silhouettes... in a landscape never to forget  
  
Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the village beneath  
A few and distant roads all leading away from here  
Nobody in the streets... decay  
I must follow the wolf again, I must follow her till the end  
  
The end  
The Wolf had turned around, facing higher ground  
And there it was... The House of God  
In awe I looked as time had stopped  
  
Follow me  
I had never seen a church like this before  
"This Place is terrible" inscribed above the door  
Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the church within  
  
A few distant thoughts, inviting me in to sin  
Nobody in the church... decay  
Shrouded in a gloomy light, as if my final night  
I wonder if God was ever here  
Or did he turn away in fear, did he turn away in fear?
