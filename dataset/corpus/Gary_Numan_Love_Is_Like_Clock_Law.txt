This heart is empty  
I've barely hidden memories  
I've found a picture that haunts me again  
  
I've no sad expression  
I've no tears in my eyes  
But I am the clown who forgot how to laugh  
  
I wonder, does she think of me?  
I wonder, I wonder  
I wonder, does she call my name?  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
  
Love is like clock law  
Tick tock my heartbeat  
I was a passion that passed her spare time  
  
This room is prison  
Love doesn't come here  
These quiet nights will slowly kill me  
  
I wonder, does she think of me?  
I wonder, I wonder  
I wonder, does she call my name  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me here  
I'm quite alone
