Last night I took a walk in the dark  
To a place called Palisades Park  
To have some fun, to see what I could see  
That's where the girls are  
I took a ride on the shoopty shoop  
The girl I sat with almost, almost puked  
  
And when it stopped, she was holding hands with me  
My arms were flying up, like a rocket ship  
Down, like a roller coaster  
Fast, like a loopty loop  
Then around, like a merry-go-round  
We even at a hot dog stand  
Slam danced to a rockin' band  
And when she winked, I gave that girl a hug  
In the tunnel of love  
You'll never know how good it just can feel  
'Til it stops at the top of the Ferris wheel  
  
I fell in love, down at Palisades Park
