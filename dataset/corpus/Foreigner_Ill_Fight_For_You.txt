I'm turning to you, when love is on my mind  
You're all I want, woman, and love's so hard to find  
I know that I hurt you, and I know that I was wrong  
But I want you back, back where you belong  
  
And I won't give you up, no I won't walk away  
I hope and I pray, I hope and I pray  
You'll forgive me someday  
  
I'll fight for you, I'll give you all I got to give  
I'll fight for you, as long as we both should live  
I'll search for heaven each day  
And together, we'll find a way  
And I'll fight for you darlin'  
I'll fight for you baby, cause I've waited too long for love  
  
You're all of my life, and every time I look at you  
I keep tellin' myself, you're the one thing I just can't lose  
Our love runs so deeply, can't you feel it in your heart  
'Cause girl we've got something, that no one can tear apart  
  
I'm tellin' you now, this love, it just can't be wrong  
Oh, it can't be wrong  
And I won't give you up 'cause I've waited too long  
Oh, I've waited too long for love  
  
I'll fight for you, I'll give you all I got to give  
I'll fight for you, as long as we should live  
I'll search for heaven each day  
And together, we'll find a way  
And I'll fight for you darlin'  
I'll fight for you
