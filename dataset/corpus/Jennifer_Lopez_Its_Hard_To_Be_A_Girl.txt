Once upon a magazine  
There I saw a beauty queen  
And she challenged me to be something I could not be  
She had the looks, the kind that kill.  
With one look I felt so incomplete and obsolete  
I can't compete, you can't compete...  
So I'm lookin' in the mirror I'm tryin' to see mine,  
Not the traces of the faces that I've seen a million times...  
With Jesus in my life, Jesus in my life  
I don't have to change...  
  
CHORUS  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl  
  
So, you want a perfect girl  
In a mini skirt and pearls  
With a lovely disposition and changeable opinions  
That may be nice, but here's the facts...  
I won't sacrifice true love that lasts, for house and cash  
I can't do that, I won't do that  
  
So I'm lookin' in the mirror and I can't believe my eyes  
Cause I'm seeing what's inside me for the very first time  
With Jesus in my life, Jesus in my life  
I don't have to change a thing  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl  
  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl  
  
Gotta get your influence from something real  
So c'mon live your life girl...  
God will give you the hope  
If you just imagine  
All that He can do if you want Him to  
  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl (Repeat)
