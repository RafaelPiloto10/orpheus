(Dolly Parton)  
I was lookin' for greener pastures  
When I left my old Kentucky home  
I was chasin' after dreams I thought I'd master  
So I left the one that loved me all along  
Thinkin' only of myself and doin' better  
Didn't care about the grief I left behind  
Didn't even make a card or write a letter  
So sure I'd be successful in no time  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?  
How what you have is never good enough  
How the years will find you searchin' through your plunder  
Lookin' for the treasures you gave up  
Well the seasons came, they went  
The dreams all shattered  
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown  
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered  
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind  
Where the bluegrass music's always playin'  
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin  
I'm heading for bluer pastures
