Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand  
Dink in link in, sand-script with a fan  
Remembering me, before it began  
Sometimes I felt so def in a jam  
But the ones who loved me, told me to stop  
Like home girl can't catch shit if it drops  
A superwoman chick, you know that I am  
Some shit don't fly by me in a man  
  
'Cause I do not accept any less  
Than someone just as real, as fabulous  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Won't sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But don't have no follow through  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I don't do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
  
Got something really shiny to start  
Want me to sign there on your range rover heart?  
I've heard it before  
Yeah, the dinners were nice  
Till your diamond words melted into some ice  
  
You should been rapping to the beat of my song Mr. California,  
Paper gangsta and I'm lookin' for love, not an  
Not an empty page full of stuff that means nothing but  
You've been played  
  
'Cause I do not accept any less  
Than someone just as real, as fabulous  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Won't sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But don't have no follow through  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I don't do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Won't sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But don't have no follow through  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I don't do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Won't sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But don't have no follow through  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I don't do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Don't want no paper gangsta
