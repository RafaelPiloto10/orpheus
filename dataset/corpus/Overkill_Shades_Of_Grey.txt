I watch the smoke drift, from my cigarette.  
I hear the roaches cross the floor.  
Slam dance around me, in my chair I sit.  
The grey's leakin' through the door.  
There's a shade of grey! I've never seen before  
  
My gaze fixed on, the space beneath the door.  
My life flash. before my eyes  
All this sweat grew from one solitary drop  
Grey's movin' cross the floor.  
  
We walk alone, no one beside us!  
It's never simple as black or white.  
We should have known, no one would find us!  
That we would all wind up in  
Shades of grey  
  
"It seems like every time I get a chance, is quite naked.  
And as I turn around, as I turn around, and  
Inside there's no doubt its gonna happen again"  
  
Nobody listenin', so I talk to myself.  
Sometimes I pay me no, mind  
I lost this argument, so very long ago  
The right words were so hard to find  
I can't breathe in the grey!  
An' I can't find the key to the door
