Patrick simmons  
Underneath us all  
There's a world that we always forget 'til it moves us  
Where the moon on the bay dances all alone  
Ramone, he draw the razor swift, it slice the air  
No more lovely dreams of those summer nights  
Down in santo domingo  
They laugh and play in the sleepy harbor town  
So unaware of the danger that's around  
Livin' on the fault line  
Livin' on the fault line  
Livin' on the fault line  
Livin' on the fault line  
No one can run when it finally comes down  
Nobody knows what is stirrin' underground  
Caruso stumbled  
While the city tumbled down  
The palace was in splinters  
Theodore was leaving town
