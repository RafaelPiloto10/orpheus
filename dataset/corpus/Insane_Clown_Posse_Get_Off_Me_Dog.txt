Get Off Me, Dog!  
"Yo, 2 Dope, man, check this out, man  
You know what the word on the streets is, dawg  
The word on the streets is that you a bitch  
What's up with that, man?"  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Motherfuckers tweek, gotta tweek while ya tweek  
Golley guy's rhythm, 'cause me on mic, my on meek  
Get off me, dog, before I sting your chin  
I let my nutsac flap in the wind  
'cause I'm 2 Dope, clown loco G,  
And it's one chop, two boing, boom chop three  
In the melon, in the back of the melon  
One black, two black eyeballs swelling  
Always back with stickin, taking back what's more to lordy  
Sippin on the blunt, puffing on the 40  
Or the O-Z, muthafuck me  
Fuck Stuart Frankie, they call me  
Jelly jello boy 'cause my nutsac jiggles  
And when it's cold out, my nutsac shrivles  
And crawls at my booty all warm and snug  
And gets chased out by the booty ho bug  
Goddamn, I ain't who I am  
I'm always fucking fat bitches named Pam  
Nineteen years of breathing smog  
Has got me mental  
So get off me, dog!...  
[Chorus (14x)]  
Get Off Me, Dog!
