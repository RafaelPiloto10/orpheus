We must battle on  
Through barren lands and waste  
While there is still light of day  
  
Allegiance to the cursed and tortured ways  
To plain sight we sow the seeds for apathy  
Bury us in our sorrow, erode our strength  
Bury us in our sorrow shadowed and silenced  
  
Battle on, battle on  
Through barren lands and waste  
Battle on, battle on  
While there's still light of day  
  
The time has come to ignite  
Enraged in a venom haze  
Cleared of the cloak of shadows  
Headstrong to shake our claim  
  
Drown away our sorrow  
Fuels inner strength  
Drown away our sorrow  
A war cry leads us to this light  
  
Into this fight  
There's no surrender  
I refuse to fall silent, I refuse  
There's no surrender  
  
Battle on, battle on  
Through barren lands and waste  
Battle on, battle on  
While there's still light of day  
  
Arise the war cry like it will be your last  
Arise the war cry, arise the war cry like it is your last  
Arise the war cry  
  
Battle on, battle on  
Through barren lands and waste  
Battle on, battle on  
While there's still light of day  
  
Arise the war cry
