Now that I can  
Release my tensions  
Let me make clear  
My best intentions  
Girls ask and I  
Define decision  
Boys ask and I  
Describe their function  
  
Oh the boys  
Want to talk  
Like to to talk about those problems  
And the girls  
Say they're concerned  
And they are  
Concerned with these decisions  
  
And it's all  
Hard Logic  
To follow and the  
Girls get lost  
And the boys  
Say they're concerned  
But they are  
Concerned with these decisions  
  
I want to talk  
I want to talk as much as I want  
I'm gonna give  
I'm gonna give the problem to you  
I want to talk  
I want to talk as much as I want  
I'm gonna give  
I'm gonna give the problem to you  
  
Decide, decide  
Make up your mind  
Decide, decide  
I told you what to say  
Confuse, confuse  
Describe what I found  
Confuse, confuse  
I told you what to say  
  
Oh the girls  
Still want to talk  
Want to talk about those problems  
And the boys  
Say they're concerned  
But they are concerned with these decisions  
  
And it's all  
Hard Logic  
I know  
And the girls get lost  
And the boys  
Say they're concerned  
And they are concerned with these decisions  
  
I want to talk  
I want to talk as much as I want  
I'm gonna give  
I'm gonna give the problem to you  
I want to talk  
I want to talk as much as I want  
I'm gonna give  
I'm gonna give the problem to you  
  
Decide, decide  
Make up your mind  
Decide, decide  
I told you what to say  
Confuse, confuse  
Describe what I found  
Confuse, confuse  
I told you what to say
