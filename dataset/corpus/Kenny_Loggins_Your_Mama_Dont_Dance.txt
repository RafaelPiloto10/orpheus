Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
But when evening comes around and it's time to  
Hit the town  
Where do you go, you gotta rock it  
  
The old folks say that ya gotta end your date  
By ten  
But if you're out on a date don't you  
Bring her home late 'cause it's a sin  
You know there's no excuse  
You know you're gonna lose you never win  
I'll say it again  
  
And it's all because your mama don't dance  
And your daddy don't rock and roll  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
When evenin' rolls around and it's time to  
Hit the town  
Where do you go, to rock it, rock it  
  
(lead)  
Everyone gather round let me tell you all  
About it  
You see I pulled into a drive-in and  
I found a place to park  
We hopped into the backseat where it's  
Always nice and dark  
I'm just about to move thinking to myself Mmm  
Bret this is a breeze  
Then there's a light in my eye and a guy says  
Out of the car long hair  
Oowee, you're coming with me  
Said the local police  
  
And it's all because your mama don't dance  
And your daddy don't rock and roll  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
When evenin' rolls around and it's time to  
Hit the town  
Where do you go, play me a little C.C.  
  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
They just ain't cool and they ain't about to start  
Your mama don't dance and you daddy don't rock  
  
Your mama don't dance, no  
She just don't dance, no  
You mama don't dance  
And you daddy don't rock and roll, oww no
