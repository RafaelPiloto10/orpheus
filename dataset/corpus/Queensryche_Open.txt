You're an angel with your wings broken,  
wearing sandals that I tripped in.  
You're a holiday already taken,  
a cocktail that's stirred never shaken.  
Your heads in overload.  
You've reached your threshold  
and you're about to explode.  
Open your eyes. Just say what you want to say?  
Open your eyes, you see yours isn't the only way .  
Open your eyes. To you everyone is blind.  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
You're like a hand gun that's fully loaded  
making idle threats of violence.  
Your heads in overload.  
You've reached your threshold  
and you're about to explode.  
Open your eyes. You take what you want for free,  
Open your eyes. and you see what you want to see.  
Open your eyes. To you everyone is blind.  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
Open your eyes. Just say what you want to say?  
Open your eyes, you see yours isn't the only way .  
Open your eyes. Do you really think I'm blind?  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
Open your mind.  
Open your eyes. and you see what you want to see.  
Open your eyes. To you everyone is blind.  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
Open your eyes. Just say what you want to say?  
Open your eyes, you see yours isn't the only way .  
Open your eyes. Do you really think I'm blind?  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
Open your mind.
