See the water break my hand  
No one knows my name  
I'm not in demand  
  
Signs are right  
The signs are here  
Who needs virtual world  
When I can see it now  
I can see it now, oh now, oh now, now  
No one goes no one cares  
No one seen it anywhere  
  
She's breathing life into lonely dead stars  
Have you ever seen it  
I ain't seen nothing at all  
  
Come see the water break my fall  
No one knows no one comes  
Have you ever seen the book  
The one on my help  
The one entitled self-death, self-death  
How to earn a million pounds  
I can see it now oh the hearse  
  
She's breathing down in a hole in my head  
In the dirty half light where  
Time means nothing at all  
  
I'm calling out to some one  
Anyone who'll have me?  
Does anyone need me?  
Does anyone know how to cry?  
What happens when I go?  
What happens when it snows?  
I bet you could if you wanted to end
