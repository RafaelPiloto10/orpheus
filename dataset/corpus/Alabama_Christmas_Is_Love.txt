It's that time of year when the whole world is heart tot heart  
You can feel love all around you, you can see it everywhere  
  
Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing  
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home  
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces  
Christmas is love  
  
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling  
Christmas is love, hear the church bells ring  
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving  
Christmas is love  
  
We all gather 'round, watch the lights dancing on the tree  
The spirit of the season, you feel it in the air  
  
Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing  
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home  
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces  
  
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling  
Christmas is love, just hear the church bells ring  
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving  
Christmas is love, Christmas is love, Christmas is love
