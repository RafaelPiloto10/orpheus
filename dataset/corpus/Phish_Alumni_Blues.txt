Woke up this morning and I had those Walking Blues (x2)  
I wasn't walkin' nowhere 'cause I didn't have no floor!  
  
Staring over the edge of the bed  
My old lady lying next to me, I started to cry (x2)  
She said "I'm gonna take this diploma,  
I'm gonna slice you in the eye!"  
  
Well I'm alright (he's alright) (x9)  
'cause I got a degree!  
  
Escaping through my window  
There's a policeman on the lawn outside my home (x2)  
I opened my mouth to scream but my throat was full of foam  
  
So I'm sittin' in this cell  
My fortune dwindled to a thimble full of filth (x2)  
I may spend the rest of my life in jail but at least it's got a floor!  
  
Chorus
