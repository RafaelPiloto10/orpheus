I don't know why I love ya like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
Well I don't know why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why you, just do  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Ah, the only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
  
I don't know why I love ya like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
I don't know why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why you, just do  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Ah, the only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
  
I don't know why I love you like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
I don't know why I love ya like I do  
I don't know why I just do  
I don't know why you thrill me like you do  
I don't know why but you do  
You never seem to want my romancing  
Ah, the only time you hold me is when we're dancing  
  
I don't know why I love ya like I do  
I don't know why I just do
