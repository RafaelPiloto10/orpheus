Guess who just got back today?  
Those wild-eyed boys that had been away  
Haven't changed, haven't much to say  
But man, I still think those cats are great  
  
They were asking if you were around  
How you was, where you could be found  
I told them you were living downtown  
Driving all the old men crazy  
  
The boys are back in town  
  
You know the chick that used to dance a lot  
Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got  
Man when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot  
I mean she was steaming  
  
That night over at Johnny's place  
Well this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face  
Man we just fell about the place  
If that chick don't want to know, forget her  
  
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill  
Down at Dino's bar and grill  
The drink will flow and blood will spill  
If the boys want to fight, you'd better let them  
  
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song  
The nights are getting warmer, it won't be long  
It won't be long till summer comes  
Now that the boys are here again  
  
The boys are back in town
