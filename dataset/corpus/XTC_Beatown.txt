Beatown  
I spoke to your boss this morning  
He asked why you weren't home?  
I said sir they left without warning  
You won't even get them on the telephone  
  
They're in Beatown, it's a capital city and all roads lead to  
Beatown, beatown  
  
I spoke to your owner this lunchtime  
He asked why you weren't home?  
I said they thought it was hunchtime  
You won't even see them standing on their own  
  
Beatown, it's a capital city and all roads lead to  
Beatown, beatown  
  
He says he wants his money back sir  
He says you're all communists sir  
I said they beat you fair and square sir  
They use the head, and not the fist  
  
Beatown, beatown  
Beatown
