I have been lost in this verbal rain  
I went to bed feeling no pain  
I was drowning baby, you're my wine  
You're my thoughts, you're my silence  
You're my sense of time  
  
By 7:30 you'll fall in love with me  
Do you believe in destiny?  
I believe by 7:30  
  
Maybe your love's an uncrackable code  
Or maybe your love is a railroad  
That you ride when you are all alone  
And you speed down the tracks  
To what you call home  
  
By 7:30 you'll fall in love with me  
Do you believe in destiny?  
I believe by 7:30  
  
Quite unsubtle these thoughts  
You send me  
Or is it I who sends them unreceived?  
And they fly through the air  
At enormous speed  
Like a boomerang flying back at me  
  
By 7:30 you'll fall in love with me  
So you believe in destiny?  
I believe by 7:30
