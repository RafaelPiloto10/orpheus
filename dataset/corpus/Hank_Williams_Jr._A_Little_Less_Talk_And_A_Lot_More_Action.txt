I was getting kinda tired  
Of her endless chatter  
Nothing I could say  
Ever seemed to matter  
So I took a little drive  
Just to clear my head  
I saw a flashing neon, up ahead  
It looked like a place  
To find some satisfaction  
With a little less talk  
And a lot more action  
  
I paid the man at the door  
And pushed my way to the bar  
Shouted for a drink  
Over a screaming guitar  
A drunk on a stool  
Tried to mess with my head  
But I didn't even listen  
To a word he said  
I knew somewhere  
Amid all this distraction  
Was a little less talk  
And a lot more action  
  
A little less talk  
If you please  
A lot more loving  
Is what I need  
Let's get on down  
To the main attraction  
With a little less talk  
And a lot more action  
  
Well she was fighting them off  
At a corner table  
She had a longneck bottle  
She was peeling the label  
The look on her face  
It was perfectly clear  
She said, somebody please  
Get me, out of here  
The look she shot me  
Through the glass refraction  
Said a little less talk  
And a lot more action  
  
A little less talk  
If you please  
A lot more loving  
Is what I need  
Let's get on down  
To the main attraction  
With a little less talk  
And a lot more action
