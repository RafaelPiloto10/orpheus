Well goodbye tubs and clothes lines goodbye pots and pans  
I'm a gonna take a greyhound bus as further as I can  
I ain't a gonna wash no windows and I ain't a gonna scrub no floors  
And when you realize I'm gone I'm a gonna hear you roar  
And you'll say hey Loretta I love you more than my Irish Setter  
Hey Loretta don't leave me alone  
Hey Loretta I swear I'm a gonna treat you better  
Buy you brand new overalls if you'll only come back home  
I work my fingers to the bone and we don't hardly speak  
And all I ever get is just a little kiss about once a week  
So you can feed the chickens and you can milk the cow  
This a woman's liberation honey is a gonna start right now  
And you'll say hey Loretta...  
I'll dress up like a movie star and pretty up my hair  
And no one here is a gonna know what I'll be doing there  
I'll be swinging from a chandelier and bouncin' off the walls  
Instead of lovin' just one man I'm a gonna love 'em all  
And you'll say hey Loretta...
