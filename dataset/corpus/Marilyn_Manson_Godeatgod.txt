Dear god do you want to tear your knuckles down  
And hold yourself  
Dear god do you want to climb of that tree  
Meat in the shape of a 'T'  
Dear god the paper says you were the King  
In the black limousine  
Dear John and all the King's men  
Can't put your head together again  
  
Before the bullets  
Before the flies  
Before authorities take out my eyes  
The only smiling are you dolls that I made  
But you are plastic and so are your brains  
  
Dear god the sky is as blue  
As a gunshot wound  
Dear god if you were alive  
You know we'd kill you  
  
Before the bullets  
Before the flies  
Before authorities take out my eyes  
The only smiling are you dolls that I made  
But you are plastic and so are your brains
