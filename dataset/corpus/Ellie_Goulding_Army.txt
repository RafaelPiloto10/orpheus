[Verse 1]  
I know that I've messed up  
You never let me give up  
All the nights and the fights  
And the blood and the breakups  
You're always there to call up  
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid  
But yeah, you understand  
Yeah like no one can  
I know that we don't look like much  
But no one fucks it up like us  
  
[Verse 2]  
Sixteen and you never even judged me  
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me  
Sitting there in the caravan  
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor  
And yeah you understand  
Yeah like no one can  
We both know what they say about us  
But they don't stand a chance because  
  
[Chorus]  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
I'm standing with an army  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
  
[Verse 3]  
Dark times, you can always find the bright side  
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice  
Just to be there for me  
How you cringe when you sing out of tune  
And yeah it's everything  
So don't change a thing  
We both know what they say about us  
But they don't stand a chance because  
  
[Chorus]  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
I'm standing with an army  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
  
[Refrain]  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
(I'll be yours)  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
I'm standing with an army  
  
[Bridge]  
Yeah you understand  
Yeah like no one can  
We both know what they say about us  
  
[Chorus]  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
I'm standing with an army  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
I'm standing with an army  
They don't have a chance either  
  
[Outro]  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing near you  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
Standing with an army  
When I'm with you  
Standing with an army
