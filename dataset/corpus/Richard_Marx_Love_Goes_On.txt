Elusive happiness  
Can be like promises  
That rest so gently on our pillow  
We stood out on the ledge  
And leaned over the edge  
And nearly fell right through that window  
There were those who had us done by now  
Baby, we've only just begun  
  
The world may crash and burn  
Or suddenly just cease to turn  
But love goes on  
It may look out of reach  
And time may rob us like a thief  
But love goes on  
Our love goes on  
  
No one may recognize  
What lives behind our eyes  
Sometimes the good times are the hardest  
And when my strength is gone  
  
It's you that I lean on  
A light at the end of all my darkness  
And in the end if I know nothing else  
The answer is only in your arms  
  
The world may crash and burn  
Or suddenly just cease to turn  
But love goes on  
It may look out of reach  
  
And time may rob us like a thief  
But love goes on  
And in the end if I know nothing else  
The answer is right here in your arms  
It's always in your arms  
  
The world may crash and burn  
Or suddenly just cease to turn  
But love goes on  
It may look out of reach  
  
And time may rob us like a thief  
But love goes on  
Oh love goes on  
It may look out of reach  
  
And time may rob us like a thief  
But love goes on
