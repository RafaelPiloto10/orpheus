Silver screen such a disgrace  
I couldn't look her straight in the face  
A blue addiction I live in disgust  
Degradation I'm being eaten by lust  
  
[Chorus]  
No bone movies  
No bone movies  
No bone movies  
  
Inspiration that's blue and uncut  
Can't kick the habit obsession of smut  
Voyeur straining in love with his hand  
A poison passion a pulsating gland  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Flaps  
  
I shouldn't do it the guilt tells me why  
I just can't stop it I try and I try  
X rated demon that lives in my head  
Hungary for bodge and he wants to be fed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No bone movies
