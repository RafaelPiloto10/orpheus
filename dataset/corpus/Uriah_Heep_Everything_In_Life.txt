It doesn't matter what you say  
The cards are in your favour  
We don't need no magic ride  
To take you far away  
Just give it a silent thought  
And you will find the power  
'cause everything in life  
Will tell you something  
Yeah everything in life can set you free  
Can you remember a distant dream  
That holds your real attention  
You don't need a preacher's word  
To know what's going on  
The secret is all aboard  
The wings of your perception  
Stand up and fight your troubled mind  
Wait no longer  
See the power in your life  
Disbelievers come on strong  
Lost in self importance  
They don't know an average man  
Can see this mystery  
Jump into the twilight world  
And gather your awareness
