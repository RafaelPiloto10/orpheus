I can't say I didn't know what I was doin'  
I can't pretend things just got outta' hand  
I should'a kept my distance  
While I was still strong  
But I got caught up in the feelin'  
Carried along and it's  
Too late baby  
I can't stop now  
  
Well I walked right in with my eyes wide open (I did)  
And I was blind when you told me  
You'd be mine just as soon as you were free  
I should have kept my distance  
While I was still strong  
But I got caught up in the feelin'  
Carried along and it's  
Too late baby  
I can't stop now  
  
Can't stop now  
Crazy heart's runnin' outta control  
Can't stop now  
And I'll be falling apart somewhere down the road  
I might be headed for a breakdown  
But I can't stop now
