The wind is howling and the time is right for fear  
In the emergence in the phosphorescent tears  
And all the hippies gonna lick the mind of God?  
They've already been immersed in the wad  
  
The wind is howling and the sea is boiling down  
The mind is the water, the mind is the water  
Cause it's a mushroom festival in hell  
Cause it's a mushroom festival in hell  
  
Yeah! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!
