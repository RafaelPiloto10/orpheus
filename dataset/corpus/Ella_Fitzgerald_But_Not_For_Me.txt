They're writing songs of love, but not for me  
A lucky star's above, but not for me  
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray  
Than any Russian play could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall and get that way  
Hi ho, alas, and also lackaday  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of his kiss  
I guess he's not for me
