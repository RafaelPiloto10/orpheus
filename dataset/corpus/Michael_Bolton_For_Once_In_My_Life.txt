For once in my life I've got someone who needs me, someone I've needed so long  
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me, and somehow I know I'll be  
Strong  
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of  
Long before I knew someone warm like you  
Could make my dreams come true  
  
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me, not like it's hurt me before  
For once I've got someone I know won't desert me, I'm not alone anymore  
For once I can say: "This is mine you can't take it"  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it
