Ma, take this badge off of me  
I can't use it any more  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
[Chorus]  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
  
Ma, take these guns away from me  
I can't shoot them any more  
There's a long black cloud following me  
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Knock, knock, knockin'  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
  
Ma, take this badge off of me  
I can't use it any more  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door
