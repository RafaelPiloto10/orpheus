I watched the shadow of her body on the wall  
As she slowly moved across the room.  
Anticipatin' Lord, I can't stand the waitin'  
As I looked through the gown she slipped into.  
  
I hear my heart beating out of time  
As I feel her body move so close to mine  
With just one touch my soul surrenders  
And once again she takes control of me.  
  
But the best is yet to come  
Lord, she's only just begun  
When we love she leaves nothing undone  
It just gets better everytime  
And the best is yet to come.  
  
I feel her breathin' gently on my shoulder  
Lying here in loves sweet after glow  
But I still feel the fire  
'Cause tonight she took me higher  
Than she had ever takin' me before.  
  
Ah, but I know the best is yet to come  
Lord, she's only just begun  
When we love she leaves nothing undone  
It just gets better everytime  
And the best is yet to come.  
  
Yeah, the best is yet to come  
Lord, she's only just begun  
When we love she leaves nothing undone  
It just gets better everytime  
And the best is yet to come...
