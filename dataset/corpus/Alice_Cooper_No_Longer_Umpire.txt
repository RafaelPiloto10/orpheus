We've been so caught up in the subject of personnel  
Playing and acting, and slaving and bathing ourselves  
  
Who lies and who tries to come over everyone  
Painting a picture to show everyone in the world  
  
Fearing is natural  
New names and faces can bring  
Build ups and barriers hiding behind everything  
  
Who lies and who tries to come over everyone  
Painting a picture to show everyone in the world.
