Got my sights, baby, set on you  
The things she said, well, maybe they're true  
  
But it's not gonna happen  
I won't let it happen  
I won't let it happen  
Not again  
  
Easy come, easy go, easily  
But that's not how I want it to be  
  
It's not gonna happen I won't let it happen  
I won't let it happen Not again  
  
Sitting all alone by the telephone  
When are you coming home  
When are you coming home  
Hey!  
  
Easy come, easy go, easily  
But that's not how I want it to be  
  
And it's not gonna happen  
I won't let it happen  
I won't let it happen  
Not again  
Not again  
Not again  
Not again
