I push to the left, you pull to the right!  
It's a stand off.  
Gainin' no ground.  
Out of the dark and into the lights!  
  
It's a breakthrough.  
Startin' with sound.  
I can't forget the look on your face!  
In shock,  
  
Startin' ta sweat.  
All wet make a bet!  
It hasn't even started yet.  
But I got a nickel that says it will!  
  
Head first!  
You'll compromise,  
You'll let us in,  
You'll spread 'em wide,  
We're divin' in head first!  
Head first!  
  
Climb on the horse and start to ride!  
Slow curves.  
Swingin' the bat.  
Up down the front and side to side!  
  
Code blue.  
We need it stat.  
I got the reason that makes you go!  
Mid air.  
  
Suspended animation.  
Layin' down on the rug,  
Start it with a little tug,  
And I got a nickel that says you will!  
  
It all starts with a kiss of death!  
Move on.  
Down to ya knees.  
In head first take a deep breath!  
  
Down there.  
So at ease.  
It all ends with an all out dive!  
This time.  
  
I think ya do.  
Say you will say ya won't.  
I don't care if ya don't.  
But I got a nickel that says you do!
