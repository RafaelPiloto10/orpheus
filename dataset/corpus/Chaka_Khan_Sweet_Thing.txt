I will love you anyway  
Even if you cannot stay  
I think you are the one for me  
Here is where you ought to be  
I just want to satisfy you  
Though you're not mine  
I can't deny you  
Don't you hear me talking baby?  
Love me now or I'll go crazy  
  
Oh sweet thing  
Don't you know you're my everything?  
Oh sweet thing  
Don't you know you're my everything?  
Yes, you are  
  
I wish you were my lover  
But you act so undercover  
I'll love you child my whole life long  
Be it right, or be it wrong  
I'm only what you make me, baby  
Don't walk away, don't be so shady  
Don't want your mind, don't want your money  
These words I say, they may sound funny, but  
  
Oh sweet thing  
Don't you know you're my everything?  
Oh sweet thing  
Don't you know you're my everything?  
Yes, you are, yes you are  
  
You are my heat  
You are my fire  
You make me weak with strong desire  
To love you child my whole life long  
Be it right, or be it wrong  
  
I just want to satisfy you  
Though you're not mine  
I can't deny you  
Don't you hear me talking baby  
Love me now or I'll go crazy  
  
You're the heat, you are the fire  
You're not mine, I can't deny ya  
Don't you hear me talking, baby?  
Love me now, or I'll go crazy  
  
You're the heat, you are the fire  
You're not mine, I can't deny ya  
Don't you hear me talking, baby?  
Love me now, or I'll go crazy  
  
You're the heat, you are the fire  
You're not mine, I can't deny ya  
Don't you hear me talking, baby?  
Love me now, or I'll go crazy  
  
You're the heat, you are the fire  
You're not mine, I can't deny ya  
Don't you hear me talking, baby?  
Love me now
