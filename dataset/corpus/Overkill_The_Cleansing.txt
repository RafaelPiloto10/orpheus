Cool muthafucka in a deep blue sea,  
I said I loose my mind.  
Cool muthafucka in through what I see,  
I said that I don't mind.  
  
He said walk on through, we been waitin' for you,  
There's a place set at the table  
Welcome, home is where the heart is,  
And since ya been gone my heart's been broke in two.  
  
Your return among the strangest see,  
Your life's gone through some changes,  
Don't recognize you  
Don't don't don't don't don't recognize  
  
Down home to the cool cool water  
Down home to the cleansing water  
  
Cool muthafucka said I know your name,  
But do ya know your god?  
Cool muthafucka said I had your pain,  
Ya, then I blew my wad.  
  
My god made love and my god made pain,  
I feel at home among the insane,  
I see sunshine in the pourin' rain,  
Welcome home oh yes I recognize you  
  
See ya been rearranged to suit,  
And you know we'll never change,  
What they put ya through  
What they put, what they put, what they put 'ya  
  
Move it to the right now.  
  
Jesus cleanse me, can you hear him?  
Jesus cleanse me now
