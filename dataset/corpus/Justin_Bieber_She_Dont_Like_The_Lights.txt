She don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark  
She don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart  
And she getting to the point where it's too much for  
And throw us all away, it's too much for  
She can't hide away 'cause the world knows who we are  
  
She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't  
She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't  
  
Don't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself  
Don't want no love in front of the camera  
  
She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't  
She don't like the lights  
  
She's giving ultimatums, she don't like this life  
She said if I loved her, I'd give it up won't think twice  
I can't do that  
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for  
Wanna throw it all away, 'cause it's too much for  
She don't wanna live this life, damn, it's my life too  
  
She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't  
She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't  
  
Don't wanna share no one else, want me to herself  
Don't want no love in front of the camera  
  
She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't  
She don't like the lights  
  
Why can I choose between the two  
One of the nights I'll run right now  
I wish she could see, how good this can be  
I hope she waits a little bit longer  
'Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side  
'Cause she gets the light that is in me  
But she don't know, she don't know  
  
She don't like the lights  
She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't  
She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't  
She don't like the lights
