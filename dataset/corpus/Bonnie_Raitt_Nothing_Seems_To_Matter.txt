Seems like such a long time, since I held you in my arms  
And felt you close and warm beside me  
Another night is getting late and I'm alone with just the ache  
And the memory of you inside me  
Darling, I've never been so blue  
I've tried to see it through, there's nothing I can do  
I won't make it on my own, so won't you please hurry home  
'Cause nothing seems to matter without you  
Last time I saw you, there was nothing we could say  
We knew it was a time for a change  
A time to think you said that night and I lied and said, "All right"  
And I left you in the morning, I watched you in the window  
And Mexico will never be the same  
It was time to be apart, but somehow it seems this heart of mine  
Will never find a way to live without you  
And now I'm out here on the road and I'm feeling bought and sold  
And tonight I just can't but think about you  
Darling, I've never been so blue  
I've tried to see it through, there's nothing I can do  
I won't make it on my own, so darling won't you hurry home  
Because nothing seems to matter without you  
No, nothing seems to matter without you
