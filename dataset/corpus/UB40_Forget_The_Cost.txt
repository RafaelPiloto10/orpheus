Multi-million dollar  
Exploration into space  
While in the name of progress  
This planet's laid to waste  
Nation takes on nation  
And is stepping up the pace  
And someone's got his finger  
On the button.  
  
[Chorus]  
Forget the cost  
We've got to choose  
We're running in a race  
That we can only lose.  
  
Rich is rich and poor is poor  
And never the twain shall meet  
East is east and west is west  
And only one shall eat  
The microchip has come of age  
And man is obsolete  
And someone's got his finger  
On the button.  
  
[Chorus]
