See the curtains hanging in the window  
In the evening on a Friday night  
A little light a-shining through the window  
Lets me know everythings alright  
  
[Chorus]  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine  
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine  
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind  
  
See the paper lying on the sidewalk  
A little music from the house next door  
So I walk on up to the door step  
Through the screen and across the floor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom  
July is dressed up and playing her tune  
When I come home from a hard days work  
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world  
  
See the smile a-waiting in the kitchen  
Food cooking and the plates for two  
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me  
In the evening when the day is through  
  
[Chorus]
