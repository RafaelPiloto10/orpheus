I see that smile  
I see that smile  
I see that smile on your face  
  
We hear you cry  
We hear you wail  
We see that smile on your face  
  
We see you laugh  
We see you dance  
We take that away every day  
  
We see you cry  
We turn your head  
Then we slap your face  
  
Bow down  
Bow down  
Bow down with your life  
  
Head down  
Head down  
Head down hide that smile  
  
Head high  
Head high  
Head high you've got to smile  
  
Head high  
Head high  
Head high you've got to smile  
  
I see you try  
I see you fail  
Some things will never change  
  
We hear you cry  
We hear you wail  
We steal that smile on your face  
  
Bow down  
Bow down  
Bow down with your life  
  
Head down  
Head down  
Head down hide that smile  
  
Head high  
Head high  
Head high you've got to smile  
  
Head high  
Head high  
Head high like a song you like
