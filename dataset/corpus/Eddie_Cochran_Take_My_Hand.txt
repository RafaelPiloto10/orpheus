Oh-oh, take my hand and walk with me  
Oh-oh, I'm so lonely that I don't know what to do  
Won't someone take my hand and walk with me  
Oh-oh, at night I sleep and in my sleep I weep  
For someone to take my hand and walk with me  
I know that I will someday find a love  
And when I do I will thank the Lord up above  
I'm so lonely that I don't know what to do  
Won't someone take my hand and walk with me  
Take my hand and walk with me
