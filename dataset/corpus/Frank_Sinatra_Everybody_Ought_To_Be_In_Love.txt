Empty rooms behind me, no more nights alone,  
A table and some chairs for two,  
Now the world will find me with someone of my own,  
The loneliness at last, is through,  
If everyone had someone just like you,  
Then everyone would feel the way I do,  
  
  
Imagine having someone always by your side.  
A bed for one can just be so cold.  
Someone you can talk to when your hands are tied,  
Someone there to have and hold.  
There's nothing more rewarding to produce (when you're in love and you hear)  
(I love you)  
  
  
(Somebody to love)  
There's nothing more rewarding to produce (when you're in love and you hear)  
(I love you)
