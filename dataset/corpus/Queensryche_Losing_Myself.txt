There's a thunder in my head,  
a roar I can't escape.  
I can't ignore this certain fate  
I'm experiencing something.  
I can't explain.  
There's a frame of reference fragile at best.  
An itching fear that's stronger than the rest.  
Follow the black ribbon into the sun.  
Push it further baby, careful with this burnout now.  
I'm losing myself in you  
and trying to get back to me.  
But I'm so far away, I'm losing myself.  
The sand in my mouth,  
the wind and heat I feel numb.  
Ten days on the road and it feels  
like where I've been ain't so bad.  
Gotta get back home to you.  
Gotta get back home to you.  
Gotta get back home.  
Throttle back slowly there's no time like now.  
Red line it baby I'm pushing to the edge now.  
I'm losing myself in you  
and trying to get back to me.  
But I'm so far away, I'm losing myself.  
I'm beating down this desert highway  
one hundred miles an hour times two.  
But I'm so far away, I'm a million miles away.  
I'm losing myself in you  
and trying to get back to me.  
But I'm so far away, I'm losing myself.  
Get me off this desert highway.  
Gotta get back to you but I'm so far away.  
I'm a million miles away.
