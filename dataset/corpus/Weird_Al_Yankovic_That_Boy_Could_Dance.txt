We all used to call him Jimmy the Geek  
He was a dumb-lookin', scrawny, little four-eyed freak  
He never used to hang around with the guys  
He'd just sit in the corner, attractin' the flies  
  
He wasn't much to look at  
He never was very bright  
But at least there was one thing that he could do all right  
That boy could dance  
  
He was kind of a jerk  
He was kind of a bore  
But the women would scream when he walked in the door  
'cause one thing I could tell you for sure  
That boy could dance  
  
Picking teams, he would always be last  
He couldn't run very far,  
He couldn't think very fast  
If he was on your side, you'd always lose  
The guy had a problem, even tying his shoes  
  
He never passed his drivers test  
He was always afraid of cars  
And he had a complexion that resembled the surface of Mars  
But that boy could dance  
  
Well, his hair was a mess  
And his clothes didn't fit  
He smelled pretty bad, and he drooled just a bit  
But you gotta admit  
Boy, that boy could dance  
  
Now that boy is much older  
He's got his own dance studio  
He's got a teeny bopper fan club  
Yeah, he's got his own TV show  
Now he owns half of Montana  
They all call him "Diamond Jim"  
And you know I'd do anything if I could be just like him  
'cause that boy could dance
