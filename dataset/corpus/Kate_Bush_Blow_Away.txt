One of the band told me last night  
That music is all that he's got in his life  
So where does it go?  
Surely not with his soul  
Will all of his licks and his r'n'b  
Blow away?  
  
Blow away, blow away  
Blow away, blow away  
Blow away, blow away  
Blow away  
  
Our engineer had a different idea  
From people who nearly died but survived  
Feeling no fear of leaving their bodies here  
And went to a room that was soon full of visitors  
  
Hello minnie, moony, vicious, vicious, buddy holly, sandy denny  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
Don't dump me back there  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
Don't dump me back there  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
I want to stay here  
  
Put out the light, then, put out the light  
Vibes in the sky invite you to dine  
Dust to dust  
Blow to blow  
Bolan and moony are heading the show tonight  
  
Hello minnie, moony, vicious, vicious, buddy holly, sandy denny  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
Don't dump me back there  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
Don't dump me back there  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
I want to stay here
