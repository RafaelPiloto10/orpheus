Sitting here all alone watching the snow fall  
Looking back at the days when we threw them snowballs  
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself  
I need you and nobody else  
I'm sorry if I pushed you away  
'Cause I need you here and I want for you to know  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
  
And I never wanna do this alone  
Baby I just need you to be here  
Here through the holidays, yeah  
I just wanna know if you feel the same way  
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby  
  
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away  
I just want you to know I miss you  
And I want you to stay  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
  
Wrapping gifts without you baby  
Is like mid December and there's no cold  
I can't do this on my own (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)  
I've changed my ways  
We keep running back and forth again  
I'm here to stay  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas
