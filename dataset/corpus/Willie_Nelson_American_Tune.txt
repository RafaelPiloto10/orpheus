Many's the time I've been mistaken and many times confused  
Yes and I've often felt forsaken and certainly misused  
Oh but I'm alright I'm alright just weary to my bones  
Still you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home so far away from home  
  
Don't know a soul who has not been battered  
Don't have a friend who feels at ease  
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered or driven to its knees  
Oh but it's alright it's alright for we've lived so well so long  
Still when I think of the road we're traveling on I wonder what's gone wrong  
I can't help it I wonder what's gone wrong  
  
And I dreamed I was dying I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
Looking back down at me smiled reassuredly  
I dreamed I was flying high up above my eyes could clearly see  
The statue of liberty sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was flying  
  
We come on the ship they call the Mayflower come on the ship that sails the
moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hours and sing an American tune  
Oh but it's alright it's alright can't be forever blessed  
Still tomorrow's gonna be another working day and I'm trying to get some rest  
That's all I'm trying to get some rest
