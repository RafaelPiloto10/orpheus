Found on hideaway.  
Somebody told me that the time was right  
To keep on ridin' and to hang on tight  
I heard the cry of a dog in the night  
But nobody told me it would be all right  
Don't let it get you down  
But nobody make a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
We took a ride down a hill that night  
The man was crazy but he wouldn't fight  
With bullets in his back and money in a sack  
We robbed a bank and we never looked back  
Don't let it get you down  
But nobody make a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
We took the bank, kept on runnin', but never too slow  
The ride was fun and you know we went to mexico  
But the action that felt all right  
Still haunts me in the night  
We took the bank, kept on runnin', but never too slow  
The ride was fun and you know we went to mexico  
But the action that felt all right  
Still haunts me in the night, alright  
Don't let it get you down  
'cause nobody made a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
They'll be lucky if we're ever found  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down) ...
