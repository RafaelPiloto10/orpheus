Life's just a pay stub on death  
Only less diligent  
And when the two collide  
It's no coincidence  
The lights are on and everybody's home  
  
The only thing suicidal here is the door  
We had a good run  
Even I have to admit  
Life's just a pay stub on death  
Only less diligent  
  
[Chorus]  
Hell or Glory  
I don't want anything in between  
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes  
Daddy said, "you gotta show the world the thunder!"  
(Oh) the thunder,  
(Oh) the thunder,  
(Oh) the thunder,  
(Oh)  
  
(Oh)  
  
We didn't come to compete  
This is a demonstration  
Even the young ones become irrelevant  
They always bring up how you changed (Oh, oh)  
Never the same person when I go to sleep  
As when I wake up, as when I wake up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Oh, whoa)  
(Oh, whoa)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He said "Bring the thunder!"  
  
The thunder  
(Oh) the thunder,  
Whoa
