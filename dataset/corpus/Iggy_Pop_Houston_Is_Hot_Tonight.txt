Bright lights, Houston is hot tonight  
Arabian sheiks and money, up in the sky  
Now I don't mind, a bloodbath, when I've got oil, on my breath  
[unknown] eye to eye, Houston is hot tonight  
  
My brain is tired of the wind  
Chicago winters, just do me in  
They've got a moon man, on the telephone  
Project, hey Houston control  
  
[unknown] eye to eye, Houston  
It's like, what's happening?  
  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight
