My pod is bigger than your pod  
My life is bigger than your life  
My mouth is bigger than your mouth  
Your age is bigger than my age  
Your height, my height  
Your weight, my weight  
  
My love is bigger than your love  
Your fist is bigger than mine  
My son is bigger than your son  
Your sun it doesn't shine, doesn't shine  
Doesn't shine, doesn't shine  
At all  
  
My big is bigger than your big  
My small is smaller than your small
