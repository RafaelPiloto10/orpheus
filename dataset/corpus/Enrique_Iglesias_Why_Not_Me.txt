Escaping nights without you with shadows on the wall  
My mind is running wild tryin' hard not to fall  
You told me that you love me but say I'm just a friend  
My heart is broken up into pieces  
'Cause I know I'll never free my soul  
It's trapped between true love and being alone  
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told  
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna love you  
If you only knew how much I love you  
So why not me  
  
The day after tomorrow I'll still be around  
To catch you when you fall and ever let you down  
You say that we're forever our love will never end  
I've tried to come up but it's drowning me to know  
You'll never feel my soul  
  
It's trapped between true love and being alone  
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told  
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor  
  
Tell me baby  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You won't ever know  
How far we can go  
You won't ever know  
How far we can go (go)  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(why not me, why not me)
