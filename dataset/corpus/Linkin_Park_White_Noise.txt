[Verse:]  
You've been taking it all this time  
You left my trust on the firing line  
As the promises break, the only mistake -  
Giving you what was mine  
Your words are clear but their meanings gone  
The notes are right but the tunings wrong  
And when you tell me again that I should give in  
I can only take it so long long long long  
  
[Chorus:]  
What!  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away!  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Fear is dancing inside your lies  
Exposing secrets that you've disguised  
And I'm biting my tongue as you become  
Victim of a compromise  
Cause I know who you really are  
Not a scratch where you can take a scar  
And it's time that you seek the truth without me  
I can only get you so far far far far  
  
[Chorus:]  
What!  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away!  
  
Throw it all away, all away (x5)  
  
What!  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away  
  
[Chorus:]  
What!  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away  
You're terrified, terrified  
You'd rather throw it all away!
