Can you feel it, love is waiting there  
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there  
  
Something has come over me  
I can't explain how full and free  
I want you to feel it  
Suddenly deep inside I have peace on my mind  
I want you to feel it  
  
On the last day that I walked the earth  
I found the answer to the question that we all search  
Where do we go from here  
  
Can you feel it, love is waiting there  
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there  
  
Come inside, now you are cold  
No colors block unopen doors  
I want you to feel it  
Suddenly deep inside, you have peace on your mind  
Tell me, can you feel it  
  
It's the last chance to take a look inside  
It's up to you to change the world for a better life  
Where do we go from here  
  
Can you feel it, love is waiting there  
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there  
Can you feel it, love is waiting there  
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there
