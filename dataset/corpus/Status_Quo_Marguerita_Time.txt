Captured my heart  
Captured my memory  
Captured a time for me  
I could see  
A time for me  
Is gonna be  
  
Deep in my heart  
Deep in my memory  
Deep in a part of me  
Heart of me  
Meant to be history  
Could it be that I'm still wondering  
  
I never knew what had happened to me  
I didn't think it was true  
That I could be just like anyone else  
I'll take my chance with you  
  
Picture a dream  
Picture a fantasy  
Picture a mood of me  
Mystery you and me a mystery  
  
Lost in a dream  
Lost in a fantasy  
Lost in what seemed to be  
Dreams to be  
Seemed to be  
Had to be  
Couldn't find no other reason  
  
I never knew what had happened to me  
I didn't think it was true  
That I could be just like anyone else  
I'll take my chance with you  
  
Lets have a drink  
It's Marguerita time  
It's Marguerita time  
After nine  
Summer time  
Any time  
You'll still always find me wondering  
  
I never knew what had happened to me  
I didn't think it was true  
That I could be just like anyone else  
I'll take my chance with you
