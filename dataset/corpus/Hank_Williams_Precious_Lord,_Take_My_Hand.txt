Precious Lord, take my hand  
Lead me on, let me stand  
I am tired, I am weak and I am worn  
Through the storm, through the night  
Lead me on to the light  
  
Take my hand  
Precious Lord  
Lead me home  
  
When my way grows unclear  
Precious Lord, linger near  
When my light is almost gone  
Hear my cry, hear my call  
And hold my hand so I won't fall  
  
Take my hand  
(Take my hand)  
Precious Lord  
Lead me home  
  
When the darkness appears  
And the night is drawing near  
And the day is almost gone  
At the river I'll stand  
So guide my feet and hold my hand  
  
Take my hand  
(Take my hand)  
Precious Lord  
And lead me home
