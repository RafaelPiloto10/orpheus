Cry cry darling that's what I do if you'd leave me with the blues  
Cry cry darling that's all I do if it's you I should lose  
For me there'd be no moonlight if ever we should part  
Cry cry darling that's what I do cause you're the one in my heart  
  
Cry cry darling my eyes will cry and never dry if you should go  
Cry cry darling when shadows creep I'll just weep all night I know  
You know how much I'd miss you if ever we should part  
Cry cry darling that's all I do cause you're the one in my heart
