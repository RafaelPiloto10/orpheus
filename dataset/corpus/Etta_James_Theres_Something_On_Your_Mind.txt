There's something on your mind  
By the way you look at me  
There is something on your mind, baby  
By the way you look at me  
And what you're thinking brings happiness  
Oh, and it bring misery  
  
Please, please, don't try to tell me  
I think, I, I understand  
No, no, don't try to tell me, baby  
'Cause I think, I, I understand  
You want me to try and forget you  
Well, I'll do, baby, I'll do the best I can  
  
You know it hurts you when you're in love with someone  
And you know that someone don't love you  
It carries a heavy burden on your heart to know  
That the someone that you're in love with  
Is in love with your best friend  
  
And I'll tell you, when someone else is rocking you  
Rocking your cradle, you know, better  
Than you can rock your cradle yourself  
Then there's only one thing for you to do  
  
You just pack your clothes turn around  
And slowly walk out of the door  
Look over your left shoulder as you go out  
Then you hang your head and you say  
  
Oh please don't try to tell me  
Uh huh, I think, I understand  
No, no, no, no please don't try to tell me  
Because you think, you think I understand  
Oh you want me to try, to try to forget you, baby  
And I'll tell you, I'll do the best I can  
  
You know after you have done all you could do  
And you can't take no more, then you go downtown  
You get your big baseball bat  
And you come back on the scene  
  
Where they both are still together  
And then you just go and kick down the door  
Now as you kick down the door you just start  
Beating the hell of everybody that you can see  
  
Everybody that comes through the door  
And just as you make up your mind that you're gonna try  
To forgive her, then out comes another one of your friends  
  
And that really blows your mind so you go and think about  
You say to yourself, baby I realize I've done wrong  
But please forgive me and with a smirky smile on her face  
Then she look up at you and she say  
  
If you ever think about me  
(Oh I think about you, baby)  
If you ever change your mind  
(Oh you're staying on my mind, baby)  
  
If you ever think about me  
(Oh I think, I think about you all the time)  
And if I ever cross your mind  
(You stay on my mind)  
  
Well, you know, you know  
You know I'm yours  
And I know, I know you got to be mine  
(Yeah)  
  
There's something on your mind, be  
I can tell by the way you look at me  
(Oh, there's something, on my mind, baby)  
There is something on your mind  
(Oh can you tell, there's something on my mind)  
By the way you look at me  
(Oh the way I look at you, you look good to me)  
  
And what you're thinking brings happiness  
(Yes, baby)  
Oh and it can bring misery  
(Yes, all right)
