Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring  
Snowing and blowing and pushing of fun  
Now the jingle hop has began  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell time and jingle bell time  
Dancing and prancing and jingle bell square  
In the frosty air  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
  
Jingle bell time it's a swell time  
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh  
Gidding up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle all around the clock  
Mix and mingle and a jingle and beats  
That's the jingle bell rock  
  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
  
Jingle bell time it's a swell time  
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh  
Gidding up jingle horse, pick up those feet  
Jingle all around the clock  
Mix and mingle and a jingle and beats  
That's the jingle bell  
That's the jingle bell  
That's the jingle bell rock
