When you lie, kiss your baby bye bye bye  
And if you're true, the whole wide world will laugh with you  
When we see nothing's wrong with you and me  
Time will tell, it might even bring a wedding bell  
  
If you think that I'm a loser  
Well you suck, 'cause you know I ain't nothin' but a user  
Of your love I can't get enough  
Girl it's true, the whole wide world is smiling with you  
  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
  
Sometimes I know, and sometimes I'm on the go  
But I'm comin' back, so don't give me no flack, yeah  
It's all you, and it's me too  
And it's your world, you's the girl, you's the girl  
Happier than shit, things that might go click with me  
Click with you, is that love? Is that love, ohhh...  
  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
  
Watch the little daisies grow, little daisies grow  
Now just push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Watch them grow, watch them grow  
As I push the little daisies and make 'em come up  
Make 'em come up, make 'em come up,  
Make 'em come up, say  
  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up  
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up
