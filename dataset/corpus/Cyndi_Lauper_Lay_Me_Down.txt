An empty street, a quiet smile  
Without steady feet  
You know the reckless kind  
Keep coming, coming back  
To the same old place  
With that wild eyed stare  
Up in your face  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay me down, let me down  
In a big old town  
Lay me down, let me down  
In a big old town  
  
He must have lost his soul  
When he found the rent  
He wrestles with control  
Still hasn't pinned it yet  
Once in, once in a while  
Loose that cigarette  
There's always some strange smile  
Underneath his breath  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Passion's fist against a wall  
The crush of a kiss, the rise and fall  
Take me there, take me there  
To that wounded sound  
It's just love's despair  
Gone and hit the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lay me down,, let me down [Repeated]
