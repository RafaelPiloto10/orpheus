Annie I see your face in a window  
Now you're a single I can't leave you out you see  
You are my friend so do me a favour  
Don't even say the whole thing's a catastrophe  
  
Wild on the town  
We had no time to write our adventures down  
We've been around  
  
Never a day goes by I don't thank you  
You paid for me to have a spanish holiday  
We drove them crazy, fell about laughing  
Swimming and drinking all the sunstroked day away  
  
Out of our heads we could wind up the dead with a word or two  
Here's to you  
  
We're going to run away from all of this to somewhere good someday  
We're going to run away from all of this to somewhere good someday  
  
I can remember when we seemed older  
Ever so bold we packed some punches now and then  
When you were going out with an airbrain  
I helped you realise and you felt better then  
Friends don't need passports  
But sometimes we need some telepathy  
You and me  
  
We're going to run away from all of this to somewhere good someday  
We're going to run away from all of this to somewhere good someday  
  
And when things aren't so good  
Don't let them get you down  
If you ever need us then you know we'll be around  
I don't just mean me  
We'll care for you  
And you know that is true  
Well you should by now  
  
Anyhow  
We're going to run away from all of this to somewhere good someday  
We're going to run away from all of this to somewhere good someday
