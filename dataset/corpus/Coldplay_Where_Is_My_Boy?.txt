Where is my boy?  
I saw you come out of a scene  
Maybe in some kind of dream  
Something that never comes  
  
Time that I take...  
See over in arms I'll raise  
I'll race in to find you  
I'll race in to find you  
  
Time stands  
I open your eyes to my world  
I see you come out of it all  
Unharmed and unscathed  
And shouting, oh  
  
Come on in  
In houses I live in  
And changes you're making  
To the state of affairs  
  
Calling "where is my boy?"  
I have seen you so often  
I cry "where is my boy?"  
Oh, have you all forgotten?  
  
And in some kind of dream  
Have I seen you before  
Oh, have I seen you before?  
Oh, where is my boy?  
  
So come all the way  
Changing your number  
Changing the house where you live  
Change your lines  
  
Have I seen you before?  
In some kind of a dream?  
In a place you've forgotten  
A place I've forgotten  
  
So where is my boy?  
When I kneel in your arms  
I flew awry  
Where is my boy?  
  
Have I seen you before?  
In some kind of a dream?  
Have I seen you before?  
In some kind of a dream?  
  
In my hands you'll fall  
Open in as it seems  
Have I seen you before?  
  
Oh baby, your arms and your legs are shattered  
Where is my boy?  
Where is my boy?  
  
I said "where is my boy?"  
Have you seen me before?  
When I look in your eyes  
Tell me "he had to go"  
  
Said "I seen you before  
In some kind of dream"  
Seems I've seen you before  
In some kind of a dream  
  
I say "where is the boy?"  
Have I seen you before?  
Yeah, I saw you before  
In some kind of a dream  
  
I say "where was my head?  
When I needed it most?"  
Oh, I stayed here before  
Yes I stay in the place I know.
