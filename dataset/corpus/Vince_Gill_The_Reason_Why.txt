Why do I, choose the things I choose,  
Why do I, always find some lame excuse,  
Why do I, not realize what I could do,  
Oh, I wish I knew the reason why,  
  
Why do you, get that sad look on your face,  
Why do you, pull away from my embrace,  
Why do you, see all my faults and my mistakes  
Oh, I wish you knew the reason why,  
  
Why do we, treat each other like we do,  
It's like we never even try,  
Why can't we, get back to the love we knew,  
Oh why oh baby why,  
  
Why do we, have to play those same old games,  
Why do we, run away from who's to blame,  
Can't they see, to lose this love would be ashame,  
Oh I wish we knew the reason why,  
Oh I wish we knew the reason why.
