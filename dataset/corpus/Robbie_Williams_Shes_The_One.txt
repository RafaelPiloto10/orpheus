We were one we were free  
And if there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
If there's somebody calling me on

When you get to where you want to go  
And you know the things you want to know  
You're smiling  
When you said what you want to say  
And you know the way you want to play, yeah  
You'll be so high you'll be flying  
  
Though the sea will be strong  
I know we'll carry on

We were one we were free  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one
