From where I stand  
I can see the world  
Getting smaller and smaller  
And there'll be no place  
  
For people like you Georgie  
Who still live in the past  
When you couldn't do things  
For yourself, you blamed it on apartheid  
  
[Chorus]  
You blamed it on the government and everybody  
Now is the time to prove yourself  
If you think affirmative action  
Is the way out... no way... no way.  
  
Constitution can be changed  
From time to time,  
But that does not mean that  
You don't need no education  
  
We are tired of people who  
Think that affirmative action is the way out  
And, is another way of putting puppets  
  
Where they don't belong  
I'm so sorry Georgie  
But the only way to get our economy  
Strong, is to have  
An educated nation  
And if you think affirmative action  
Is the way out... no way... no way.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Education is still the key  
Even though we have Affirmative action.  
  
[Chorus until fade]
