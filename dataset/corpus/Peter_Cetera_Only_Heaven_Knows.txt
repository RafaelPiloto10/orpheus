Why ask Why  
Show yourself some mercy  
Don't be shy  
You don't have to look away  
It's alright  
You don't have to know the answers  
In your heart you know you'll do  
The Very best you can  
  
Sail away tonight, on the ocean of forgiveness  
We cannot decide which way the wind will blow  
Baby close your eyes, let go of tomorrow  
Some things in life, only heaven knows.  
  
Face the sky, like I never heard you  
Live your life you don't have to be afraid  
Here inside are those who truly love you  
there's nothing you can ever do  
To make them turn away  
  
Sail away tonight...  
Us now baby  
Oohh now and don't you cry  
Say a little prayer to heaven  
And I will sing a lullaby  
  
Sail Away tonight...
