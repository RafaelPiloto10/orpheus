When I was born  
My mother died  
She said,'Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
I said,'Where you goin'?  
I'm just born  
She said,'I'll only be gone for a while'  
My mother loved to leave in style  
That's why God made the movies  
  
Well, I laid around  
In my swaddling clothes  
Until the doctor came and turned out the lights  
Then I packed my bag  
And my name tag  
I stole away into the night  
Hoping things would work out right  
That's why God made the movies  
  
Say you will! Say you will!  
Say you'll take me to your lovin' breast  
Say you'll nourish me  
With your tenderness  
The way the ladies sometimes do  
Say you won't! Say you won't!  
Say you won't leave me for no other man  
Say you'll love me just the way I am  
Say you will baby, now  
Say you will, just say you will  
  
When I was born  
My mother died  
She said,'Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
And since that day  
I've paid my way  
The notorious boy of the wild  
Adopted by the wolves  
When he was a child.  
  
That's why God  
That's why God  
That's why God made the movies
