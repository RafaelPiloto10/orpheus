I am the entertainer  
And I know just where I stand  
Another serenader  
And another long-haired band  
Today I am your champion  
I may have won your hearts  
But I know the game, you'll forget my name  
And I won't be here in another year  
If I don't stay on the charts  
  
I am the entertainer  
I'm dressed in the style  
I wear all kinds of sparkles  
I flash the crowd my smile  
But when the night is over  
And I stand without my clothes  
Perspiration stains and varicose veins  
My eyes look shot  
My belly's got a pot  
And there's a pimple on my nose  
  
I am the entertainer  
Been all around the world  
I've played all kinds of palaces  
And laid all kinds of girls  
I can't remember faces  
I don't remember names  
Ah, but what the hell  
You know it's just as well  
'Cause after a while and a thousand miles  
It all becomes the same  
  
I am the entertainer  
I bring to you my songs  
I'd like to spend a day or two  
I can't stay that long  
No, I've got to meet expenses  
I got to stay in line  
Gotta get those fees to the agencies  
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay  
So I just don't have the time  
  
I am the entertainer  
I come to do my show  
You've heard my latest record  
It's been on the radio  
Ah, it took me years to write it  
They were the best years of my life  
It was a beautiful song  
But it ran too long  
If you're gonna have a hit  
You gotta make it fit  
So they cut it down to 3:05  
  
I am the entertainer  
The idol of my age  
I make all kinds of money  
When I go on the stage  
Ah, you've seen me in the papers  
I've been in the magazines  
But if I go cold I won't get sold  
I'll get put in the back in the discount rack  
Like another can of beans  
  
I am the entertainer  
And I know just where I stand  
Another serenader  
And another long-haired band  
Today I am your champion  
I may have won your hearts  
But I know the game, you'll forget my name  
I won't be here in another year  
If I don't stay on the charts
