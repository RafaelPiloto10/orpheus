What's the matter with your life  
Did someone come and shoot your with wife  
Just as you planned  
Will you live or will you die  
Are you that butterfly  
That never lands  
Set aside these vacant rules  
Break them now and don't get fooled again  
  
Sorry  
How many times must I say  
Life is not a cake to separate  
What do I have to do  
To save you from worry  
Cut off my nose  
To spite my face  
  
When you look into these eyes  
Do you see civilized  
Or son of Sam  
Will you love or do you hate  
Why do you hesitate yeah  
  
Sorry  
How many times must I say  
Life is not a cake to separate  
What do I have to do  
To save you from worry  
Cut off my nose  
To spite my face  
  
Time is an arrow  
You are the bow  
Shoot it now to seal your own fate  
Get a life, get a love, get a new big idea  
  
What's the matter with your life  
Did someone come and shoot your with wife  
Just as you planned  
Will you live or will you die  
Are you that butterfly  
  
Sorry  
How many times must I say  
Life is not a cake to separate  
What do I have to do  
To save you from worry  
Cut off my nose  
To spite my face
