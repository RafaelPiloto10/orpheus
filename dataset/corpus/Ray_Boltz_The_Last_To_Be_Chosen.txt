The Last To Be Chosen  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Today in the school yard  
They were choosing up sides  
And one child just stood there  
With tears in his eyes  
He'd been there before  
And everyone knew  
He'd be alone  
When the choosing was through  
But high in the heavens  
The Father looked down  
And He saw what happened  
There on the ground  
And angels rejoiced  
When He said to His son,  
Watch what I do with this one  
chorus:  
The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call  
And what He does through them  
Will amaze one and all  
It won't be the hero  
That carries the ball  
The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call  
Now don't be discouraged  
And don't be afraid  
God is not worried  
With the choice that He made  
Others may laugh or doubt at the start  
But He sees what's there in your heart  
chorus  
The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call  
And what He does through them  
Will amaze one and all  
Standing for Jesus when others may fall  
The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call (repeat)
