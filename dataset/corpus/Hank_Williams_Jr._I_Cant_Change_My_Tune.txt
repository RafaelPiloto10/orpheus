Babe, I can't change my tune for you  
But I'll sing any melody you want me to  
I'll sing all the country and all of the blues  
But babe, I can't change my tune for you  
So don't ask me to  
  
But babe, I can pull some strings for you  
I'll pull them until each one is in tune  
I'll try to make things go like you want to  
But babe, I can't change my tune for you  
But I'll pull strings for you  
  
Maybe I'll write a song about you  
Even though I am just passing through  
I'll sing you all the old songs and all of the new  
'Cause babe, I can't change my tune for you  
So don't ask me to
