You know we can get away  
Because I'm calling your name  
Every day I feel this pain  
But you just turn and walk away  
  
I just can't keep hanging on  
to you and me  
I just don't know what is wrong  
with you and me  
  
Touch me and then turn away  
And put your hands into the flame  
Tell me if you feel this pain  
'Cause I don't want to be a ball and chain, no  
  
I just can't keep hanging on, to you and me  
I just don't know what is wrong  
  
Give me the respect, forgive me and forget  
We've got to get a grip, living on the edge  
I barely even know this fucking woman in my bed  
And if that's too much on my plate, then I ain't finishing my bad  
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side  
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life  
You got me wrapped up in your shit  
I'm feeling mamba fight  
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice  
You gave me what I needed, and I gave her everything she wanted  
Miss something 'bout your cleavage  
Now why can't put my fingers on it  
You're taking me the deepest  
I thought that she was coming for me  
If four women from Venus, then I guess I really got a rocket  
You've got a nose around my neck, but I'm still hanging on  
We've nearly reached the finish line, I bet we're having fun  
I spit a buzz, she sang a song  
She broke my heart, I took some garbage scan  
  
I just can't keep hanging on, with you, with me  
With you, with
