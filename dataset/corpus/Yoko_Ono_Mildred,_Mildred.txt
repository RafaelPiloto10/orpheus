Mildred, Mildred, how I love you so,  
Remember the joke you told me  
While we had our midnight tea.  
That was the funniest joke I ever heard in my life,  
I didn't tell you then 'cause I was drinking the tea.  
  
Alfred, now Alfred, you used to call me so.  
And told me how it would be nice to open a plant shop.  
That was the most sensible idea we had in our life,  
I didn't tell you then 'cause I was reading the papers.  
  
Mildred, oh, Mildred, how I love you so,  
Remember how you were angry when I talked to the box.  
You kept trying to tell me something, something about your life,  
But I didn't hear you then 'cause I was watching the box.  
  
I bought a pot of plant now  
And I'm watering it ev'ry day.  
I watched the late night talk show  
And asked the man in a suit  
Why he was laughing so when my wife was dead.  
  
He didn't reply,  
No, he didn't reply at all.  
And I burnt the box the next morning  
And buried in our garden.  
  
Mildred, oh, Mildred, how I miss you so,  
How I wish to tell you a lot of things about our life.  
But of course you aren't around, you aren't around no more  
And I hear the box still laughing in the next door apartment.
