The snow is snowing  
The wind is blowing  
But I can weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
I can't remember  
A worse December  
Just watch those icicles form  
What do I care if icicles form  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat  
Off with my glove  
I need no overcoat  
I'm burnin' with love  
  
My heart's on fire  
The flame grows higher  
So I will weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm
