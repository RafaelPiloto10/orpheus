People are so sad and I know why  
With no chance to live before you die  
You get pretty sick if you have to  
Keep it inside  
  
I wanna build a house where an ad don't scream  
I wanna live in peace-quietly  
I wanna have a place of love and safety  
People ought to live how and where they want  
People ought to have respect in front  
People ought to get along pretty O.K.  
  
So get off my dick  
I'm building it brick by brick  
Brick by brick  
  
I'm building a house where I can think  
And have some balance and dignity  
I'm building a house where no one can hurt me  
I'm building a house where the weak are strong  
I'm building a house with a real song  
I'm using faith that is immortal  
I'm building it with simplicity  
And the way that we feel, you and me  
I'm building it with what I believe in  
  
So get off my dick  
I'm building it brick by brick  
Brick by brick  
  
Now I'm looking at just a little time  
So be it I want to  
Be true to my simple heart  
And not put nothing else above it  
Brick by brick [Repeat: x4]  
Brick by brick by brick
