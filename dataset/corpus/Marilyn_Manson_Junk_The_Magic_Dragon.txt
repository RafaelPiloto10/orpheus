Junk the Magic Dragon  
  
Mellow yellow acid kiss  
Warhol painted callio-trips  
Spining, spining, spin again  
Coke, tar, crystal methane thrill  
Cash in dime for a ride  
My brain like eggs is cracked and fried  
Cash in dime for a ride  
My brain like eggs is cracked and fried  
  
Junk the magic dragon  
Lives, in my pain  
Junk the magic dragon, yeah  
Love will always end, it ends in pain  
  
Love is pain  
Pain is love  
My soul's got a love for dragon's blood  
  
Bones are pulled so tight on skin  
Like canvas tent poles or something  
I need a smile on my lips  
Oh, but it gives incentives  
  
Cash in dime for a ride  
My brain like eggs is cracked and fried  
Cash in dime for a ride  
My stone black jeans look just real fine  
  
Junk the magic dragon  
Lives, in my pain  
Junk the magic dragon, yeah  
Love will always end, it ends in pain  
  
  
Love is pain  
Pain is love  
My soul's got a love for dragon's blood
