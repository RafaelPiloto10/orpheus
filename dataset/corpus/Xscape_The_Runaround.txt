But you been sleepin' and you're creepin', babe,  
But you been creepin' and you're sleepin', baby.  
  
It's Friday night and I've been freakin' out,  
900 times, I know I called your house,  
So many times your momma cursed me out,  
But I'm not sorry.  
  
Saturday morning, I ain't slept at all,  
I smelled her perfume and your alcohol,  
They say that you and her have had a ball,  
Don't you dare lie to me.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I know I'm gettin' the runaround,  
I know that you sleep around,  
So don't try and play it down,  
I know you're givin' it, I know she's gettin' it.  
  
I grabbed my keys and I jumped in my ride,  
I may be hurt but I ain't gonna cry,  
Just want to find out what you did last night,  
Before I leave you.  
  
I found her number and I know her name,  
I gotta front this girl, make her explain,  
I can't believe she dipped into my thing,  
Yet she's getting over.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It took a lot for me to give you all my loving, yeah,  
And just to think I gave you everything for nothing.  
I tried my best to satisfy you,  
All the times that I stood right by you,  
I think that I'll be better on my own, baby.  
  
Oh baby,  
I know your givin' it, I know she's gettin' it.  
  
But you been sleepin' and you're creepin' babe  
But you been creepin' and you're sleepin' baby  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Now I can't believe that you did this to me,  
Well, you better leave.  
You go tell what's her name that it isn't a game,  
Boy you messed up your thang.
