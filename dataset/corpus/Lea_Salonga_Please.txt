Kim: Lea Salonga  
John: Peter Polycarpou  
  
John:  
I'm not here as a friend  
I have a job to do  
It's strange to find my work  
Should lead me here to you  
Chris knows all about you  
I have shown him all this  
But I think that it's time  
You know all about Chris  
  
Kim  
Please, don't you see that's all I live for?  
I have him and nothing more  
At night, everything that's not him  
Disappears behind my door  
  
John  
Please, he went crazy when he lost you  
Spoke to no one for a year  
Then he finally said "I'm home now,  
My life has to go on here"  
  
Kim, let me finish talking, please  
That was three whole years ago  
  
Kim  
Yes, yes I know  
I know how pain can grow  
When the rock you hold onto  
Is a love miles away, listen:  
  
Please, I already know the story  
Take us to the usa  
  
John  
When we finish here, you'll see him  
Chris arrived with me today!  
  
Kim  
Oh Tam! He's here!  
He is here, he's so near  
We might breathe the same air tonight!  
Your father's here  
  
Kim john  
Oh Tam it's true! I can't tell her like this  
My dream was right! I should not be the one  
You'll see him soon Chris must come see his son  
  
Please, they don't say  
Don't you see we've been in the files  
Watched over? There's a woman in love  
As we crossed here  
The wildest sea? What sustained her for miles  
Even god wants us together Chris still knows nothing of  
Can I end this journey can I end this journey  
Please? Please?
