Did you ever feel that just by jumping on a plane  
All your cares would drop away  
And you'd be born again  
  
Returning to a nature child  
Happy wild and free  
But forgetfulness is a river  
And you know where the river leads  
  
Holidays in Eden  
Life before the fall  
See no, hear no, speak no evil  
Feel no guilt, feel no guilt at all  
  
Naked through the jungle  
Mud between your toes  
Following the river  
Where the river flows  
  
The creatures of the forest bid you  
"Welcome to the dark"  
Nothing here can hurt you  
Darkness has no heart  
  
Holidays in Eden  
Paradise regained  
See no, hear no, speak no evil  
Throw your past away  
  
You wake up one morning  
Wondering who you are  
There's a map of a new country up on the wall  
All your new lovers merge into one  
You've done everything under the sun  
There's a date on the air ticket  
And the money's gone  
  
Back in your own country  
Nothing seems the same  
No one comes around at night  
Or uses your new name  
  
Hearing silent whispers  
Old friends are acting strange  
No one wants to know you now  
People say you've changed  
  
Holidays in Eden  
Life before the fall  
See no, hear no, speak no evil  
Feel no guilt at all  
  
Holidays in Eden  
Paradise and light  
Heaven loses you to this world  
Leaves you alone  
Kiss your home goodbye  
  
(She says she's lonely)
