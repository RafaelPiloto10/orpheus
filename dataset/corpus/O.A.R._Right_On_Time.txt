I know it's been a long, long year.  
God forbid you listen to me now.  
I may have laid the pressure on good,  
But since that day  
I'll never ask again.  
  
It's funny, it's come right down to this.  
I have to steal my time cause  
You won't give it up for free.  
I've been talking to the moon all night,  
But the stars won't say nothing to me.  
And though I feel it's easy  
For a man to grow up  
Much harder for a man to grow out.  
You may not appear,  
But I'm standing here my God.  
I'll never ask you.  
  
Where have you been?  
You could have told me just,  
Where have you been?  
If you know me you know.  
I won't ask why.  
They always told me  
You'd be right on my time.  
We're coming around.  
  
I know you're kind of busy right now.  
Been a day, but I haven't heard your call.  
I climbed a mountain just to get  
A better view of you.  
But I'll never ask again.  
  
It's crazy that we just can't feel the time  
And lay down for awhile.  
And let life catch your eye.  
I've been relaxing with the Wind all day.  
But the Sky won't open up for me.  
And though I feel it's easy  
For a man to stand tall.  
Much harder for a man to simmer down.  
You may not appear,  
But I'm standing here my god.  
I'll never ask you.  
  
Where have you been?  
You could have told me just,  
Where have you been?  
If you know me you know.  
I won't ask why.  
They always told me  
You'd be right on my time.  
If you give me just a minute of your day,  
I see now why you choose to stay away.  
Up here life seems more like living,  
And living mirrors love.  
And love just leaves me breathless.  
On we go.  
  
Where have you been?  
You could have told me just,  
Where have you been?  
If you know me you know.  
I won't ask why.  
They always told me  
You'd be right on my time.  
We're coming around.  
  
You act like you can't see me.  
You act like you don't know me.  
I just wish you would show me  
That you'll be right on my time
