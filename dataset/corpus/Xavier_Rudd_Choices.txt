Let me down to rest of the world  
I'm feeling cold, cold to the bones  
Let me down so I can fly, fly, fly  
Dragonfly doesn't matter  
With flowers in the sunshine  
Warming me up to the bones, lifting me up  
So I can fly  
She's says it's nothing to be said, nothing to be gained  
From the winds that blow today  
Now you have is time, walking down the slide and twisted  
Preservatives of life  
You have what you have what you have is for you  
And the future of your child  
Look there's a full moon, I'm looking at you  
Choices, you've been wrong and you've been cold  
Choices, you've been wrong, you've been cold  
Choices, you've been wrong and you've been cold  
Choices, choices  
I'm not scared, no no  
I maybe just a little scared to die  
Scared to die  
She's said this nothing to be said, nothing to be gained  
From the winds that blow today  
Now you have is time, walking down the slide and crooked  
Preservatives of life  
You have what you have what you have is for you  
For the future for your child  
Look there's a full moon, I'm looking at you  
Choices, you've been wrong, you've been cold  
Choices, you've been wrong, you've been cold  
Choices, you've been wrong and you've been cold  
Choices, choices
