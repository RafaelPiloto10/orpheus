[Verse:]  
From my head to my toes  
I can hardly believe the things that I read are not  
That it's hard, fly it in your plane and drive it in your car  
You're a superstar, yes you are,  
Signing autographs, making people laugh  
You'll go far, clever boy,  
Girls just wanna be with you, lawyers wanna deal with you.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why don't you wake up  
And stop what you're doing right now?  
You gotta be true.  
You know you don't live forever  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
Wake up right now, stop what you're doing,  
You've gotta be true,  
You know you don't live forever,  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
  
[Verse:]  
Write a book about your life,  
I can hardly believe the things that you need at home  
With your wife, you treat it like a game, but this made you pretty fame  
With perfect hair and your clothes,  
It's just another day in a life of a superstar.  
It's gotta be the way, it's the same, no matter who you are.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why don't you wake up  
And stop what you're doing right now?  
You gotta be true.  
You know you don't live forever  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
Wake up right now, stop what you're doing,  
You've gotta be true,  
You know you don't live forever,  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
  
[Bridge:]  
Take care over what you do,  
You gotta take care of what you are.  
You gotta take care of what you're not,  
You gotta take care of what you've got.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why don't you wake up  
And stop what you're doing right now?  
You gotta be true.  
You know you don't live forever  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
Wake up right now, stop what you're doing,  
You've gotta be true,  
You know you don't live forever,  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
  
It's just another day in a life of a superstar.  
It's gotta be the way, it's the same, no matter who you are.  
It's just another day in a life of a superstar.  
It's gotta be the way, it's the same, no matter who you are.
