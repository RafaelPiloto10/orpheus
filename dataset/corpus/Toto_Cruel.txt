What you've got, you had to steal  
That's the reason  
For how you feel  
Considerin' what you've done so far  
I'm rather amazed  
At where you are  
  
Lift your head up, baby  
Pull yourself together  
Nothing's worse than dying slow  
There's no reason, darlin',  
Reason whatsoever  
That we can't end this game of touch and go  
  
It's such a cruel world  
When you have to think twice,  
And you're caught up in this roundabout  
It's such a cruel world  
When your back's against the wall and there's no way out  
  
You're not giving it up, but you're giving it out  
Seems too me,  
You got a little too much doubt  
Augmentation,  
Is what you need  
Your generosity  
Looks a lot like greed  
  
You might call me crazy  
If you don't understand it  
There's no way for you to know  
You say love is hazy,  
And you don't demand it  
But can't we end this game of touch and go  
  
It's such a cruel world  
When nothin' goes right  
And the plans you made  
Start falling 'round you  
It's such a cruel world  
Well, just throw me the rope, baby  
And pull me out  
  
You've got that kind of love,  
It flows like a fountain  
But sometimes love can be unkind  
My kind of love, you know  
It's higher than a mountain  
But love can be so hard to find  
  
Lift your head up, baby  
Pull yourself together  
Nothing's worse than dying slow  
There's no reason, darlin', reason whatsoever  
That we can't end this game of touch and go  
  
It's such a cruel world  
When you have to think twice  
And you're caught up in this roundabout  
It's such a cruel world  
When your back's against the wall and there's no way out  
  
It's such a cruel world  
It's such a cruel world out there baby  
It's such a cruel world  
It's such a cruel cruel world and there's no way out  
  
Get you right  
Want to get you right  
  
Oh I  
I see darkness in your future baby  
Oh I  
In a tunnel black as night  
Oh I  
See a rich man with his hand out baby  
Oh I  
Know a seer with no sight  
Oh I  
Watch fire burn those bridges baby  
Oh I  
Feel a wrong turn into right
