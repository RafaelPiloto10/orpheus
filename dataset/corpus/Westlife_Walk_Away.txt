Here we are  
Just a little older  
Time goes by  
But did I ever tell you why  
I want you so much  
It came to me  
When you were not around  
You'll always be  
The one to understand that's why  
I can't miss your touch  
  
All my life  
I waited for someone  
And all this time  
You were the one  
So  
  
If you want a man that is here to stay  
Swearing he's forever true  
I'll never walk away  
I'll never give up on you  
And if you want a love that will save the day  
No matter what you're going through  
I'll never walk away  
I'll never walk out on you  
  
I've been a fool  
I didn't see behind  
The friend in you  
And baby don't you ask me why  
It just couldn't be love  
Cause from the start  
You would be the one  
To cure my heart  
But I just didn't look this way  
And now I can't get enough  
  
All my life  
I waited for someone  
And all this time  
You were the one, so  
  
If you want a man that is here to stay  
Swearing he's forever true  
I'll never walk away  
I'll never give up on you  
And if you want a love that will save the day  
No matter what you're going through  
I'll never walk away  
I'll never walk out on you  
  
And with a kiss you turned my world around  
The greatest rush of all was to be found  
Oh yeah  
You changed my whole life  
Colored up the dark skies  
And this I promise you  
  
If you want a man that is here to stay  
Swearing he's forever true  
I'll never walk away  
I'll never give up on you  
And if you want a love that will save the day  
No matter what you're going through  
I'll never walk away  
I'll never walk out on you
