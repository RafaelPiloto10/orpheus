TV dinners there's nothin' else to eat  
TV dinners they really can't be beat  
I like 'em frozen but you understand  
I throw 'em in and wave 'em and I'm a brand new man oh yeah!  
  
TV dinners they're goin' to my head  
TV dinners my skin is turnin' red  
Twenty year old turkey in a thirty year old tin  
I can't wait until tomorrow.... and thaw one out again oh yeah!  
  
TV dinners I'm feelin' kinda rough  
TV dinners this one's kinda tough  
I like the enchiladas and the teriaki too  
I even like the chicken if.... the sauce is not too blue.  
  
And they're mine, all mine, oh yeah  
And they sure are fine.  
Gotta have 'em  
Gimme somethin' now.
