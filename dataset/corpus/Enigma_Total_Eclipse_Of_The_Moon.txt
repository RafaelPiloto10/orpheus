Miles away from light at noon  
Total eclipse of the moon  
Many reasons to believe in life  
Just listen what it's telling you  
  
Come and have a look inside  
Total eclipse of the moon  
Don't be childish, don't be so cruel  
I'm feeling just lonely without  
Without you  
  
I can see the wide horizons  
But debts have to be paid  
Our ways will cross again someday  
Believe, and come back to you  
I'll see you soon  
  
Time doesn't say hello  
Total eclipse of the moon  
Many nights in our lives before  
I was dreaming to be just beside  
Beside you  
  
Total eclipse of the moon  
I'll see you soon
