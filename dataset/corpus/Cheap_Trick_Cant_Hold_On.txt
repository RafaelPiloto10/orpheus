You've been coming  
You've made it easy  
You've said just the thing  
  
Now I can't hold on  
To these words  
Don't mean that much to me  
Feel out in the cold  
No one to turn to  
  
It's my sunset  
My sun's set  
  
Never thought it's come to this  
Now it seems the only way, to do it right  
Never thought it'd come to this  
Just can't hold on, oh no  
  
Feel out in the cold  
No one to turn to  
There's no way out  
Just can't hold on  
  
It's my sunset  
My sun will set  
  
I've been gone, gone, gone  
Can't hold on
