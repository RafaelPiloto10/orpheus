I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes,  
I'm holding on,  
I'm still awaiting you,  
You cling to me but I remain composed,  
I'll take the blame, grow you a thornless rose  
I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes,  
I'm holding on,  
I'm still awaiting you,  
Awaiting you,  
Awaiting you  
I swallow deep but the distance grows,  
I'm struggling on to find the endless road  
You cling to me, but I remain composed,  
The moon is full, but the darkness knows  
I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes,  
I'm holding on,  
I'm still awaiting you,  
Awaiting you,
