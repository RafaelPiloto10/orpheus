Why do the babies starve  
When there's enough food to feed the world  
Why when there are so many of us  
Are there people still alone  
  
Why are the missiles called peace keepers  
When they're aimed to kill  
Why is a woman still not safe  
When she's in her home  
  
Love is hate  
War is peace  
No is yes  
And we're all free  
  
But somebody's gonna have to answer  
The time is coming soon  
Amidst all these questions and contradictions  
There are some who seek the truth  
  
But somebody's gonna have to answer  
The time is coming soon  
When the blind remove their blinders  
And the speechless speak the truth
