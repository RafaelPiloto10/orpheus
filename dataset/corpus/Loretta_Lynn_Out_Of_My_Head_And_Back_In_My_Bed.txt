Lyin' alone in this big old bed  
I got you on my mind  
I said when you left  
I could make it by myself  
But it gets harder all the time  
And I can't take it no more  
I see your face  
Every time I close my eyes  
So I'm goin' out now  
And I'm lookin' for you  
Some winter night  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin' sun comes up  
I can't stand another night  
Without holdin' me tight  
How I miss your lovin' touch  
I'm goin' searchin'  
Everywhere that a you might be  
When I find you I'm a bringin' you home with me  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin' comes  
Well I might find somebody new  
To share my misery  
But no other man  
Can do what you can  
When it comes to lovin' me  
I don't want nobody to say that I was a fool  
For bein' cool  
I won't be satisfied till you're back in my arms  
And I'm lovin' you  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin' sun comes up  
I can't stand another night  
Without you holdin' me tight  
How I miss your lovin' touch  
I'm goin' searchin'  
Everywhere that a you might be  
And when I find you  
I'm a bringin' you home with me  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin' comes  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin' sun comes up  
I can't stand another night  
Without you holdin me tight  
How I miss your lovin' touch  
I'm goin' searchin'  
Everywhere that a you might be  
FADES-  
A when I find you  
I'm a bringin' you home with me  
I want you out of my head  
And back in my bed  
Before the mornin' comes
