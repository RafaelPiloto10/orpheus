A child and a fool in one  
So sure i could need no one  
My heart always on the run to nowhere  
Now as you're holding me  
My heart is reminding me  
That now I could never be without you  
  
But how can our love succeed  
A miracle is what we need  
And so I appeal to you  
  
Keep me suspended in time with you  
Don't let this moment die  
I get a feeling when I'm with you  
None of the rules apply  
But I know for certain  
Goodbye is a crime  
So love if you need me  
Suspend me in time  
  
Wasted the time away  
Holding your love at bay  
Now i can't last a day without you  
Your smile is a thrill to see  
Your eyes hold me tenderly  
They'll shine in my memory forever
