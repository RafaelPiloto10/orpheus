Alone with my thoughts this evening  
I walked on the banks of Tyne  
I wondered how I could win you  
Or if I could make you mine  
Or if I could make you mine  
The wind it was so insistent  
With tales of a stormy south  
But when I spied two birds in a sycamore tree  
There came a dryness in my mouth  
Came a dryness in my mouth  
For then without rhyme or reason  
The two birds did rise up to fly  
And where the two birds were flying  
I swear I saw you and I  
I swear I saw you and I  
I walked out this morning  
It was like a veil had been removed from before my eyes  
For the first time I saw the work of heaven  
In the line where the hills had been married to the sky  
And all around me every blade of singing grass  
Was calling out your name and that our love would always last  
And inside every turning leaf  
Is the pattern of an older tree  
The shape of our future  
The shape of all our history  
And out of the confusion  
Where the river meets the sea  
Came things I'd never seen  
Things I'd never seen  
I was brought to my senses  
I was blind but now that I can see  
Every signpost in nature  
Said you belong to me  
I know it's true  
It's written in a sky as blue  
As blue as your eyes, as blue as your eyes  
If nature's red in tooth and claw  
Like winter's freeze and summer's thaw  
The wounds she gave me  
Were the wounds that would heal me  
And we'd be like the moon and sun  
And when our courtly dance had run  
Its course across the sky  
Then together we would lie  
And out of the confusion  
Where the river meets the sea  
Something new would arrive  
Something better would arrive  
I was brought to my senses  
I was blind but now that I can see  
Every signpost in nature  
Said you belong to me
