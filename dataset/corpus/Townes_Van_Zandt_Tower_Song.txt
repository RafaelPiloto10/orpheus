So close and yet so far away  
And all the things I'd hoped to say  
Will have to go unsaid today  
Perhaps until tomorrow  
Your fear has built a wall between  
Our lives and all what lovin' means  
Will have to go unfelt it seems  
And that leaves only sorrow  
  
You built your tower strong and tall  
Can't you see it's got to fall some day  
  
You close your eyes and speak to me  
Of faith and love and destiny  
As distant as eternity,  
Truth and understanding  
The wind blows cold outside your door  
It whispers words I've tried before  
But you don't hear me anymore  
Your pride's just too demanding  
  
The end is coming soon, it's plain  
A warm bed just ain't worth the pain  
And I will go and you'll remain  
With the bitterness we tasted  
A mother's breast, a newborn child  
A poet's tear, and drunken smile  
Can't help thinkin' all the while  
Their meaning won't be wasted
