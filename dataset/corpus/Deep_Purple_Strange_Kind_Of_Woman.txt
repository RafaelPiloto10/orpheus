There once was a woman  
A strange kind of woman  
The kind that gets written down in history  
Her name was Nancy  
Her face was nothing fancy  
She left a trail of happiness and misery  
  
I loved her  
Everybody loved her  
She loved everyone and gave them good return  
I tried to take her  
I even tried to break her  
She said I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn  
  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
I spent my money as I took my turn  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
Ooh I got a strange kind of woman  
  
She looked like a raver  
But I could never please her  
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far  
I couldn't get her  
But things got better, she said  
Saturday nights from now on baby you're my star  
  
She finally said she loved me  
I wed her in a hurry  
No more callers and I glowed with pride  
I'm dreaming  
I feel like screaming  
I won my woman just before she died  
  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
I spent my money as I took my turn  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
Ooh I had a strange kind of woman
