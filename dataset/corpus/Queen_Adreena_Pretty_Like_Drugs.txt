The world is watching as i take my last breath  
the world is watching as i get undressed  
cos im pretty like drugs  
  
the world is watching as my wings unfurl  
the world is watching the death of a girl  
cos im pretty like drugs  
  
i load the gun  
the world is watching with a pregnant pause  
the world is watching as i fuck to applause  
the world is watching as i plant the last seed  
the world is watching me watching tv  
cos im pretty like drugs  
  
i load the gun  
i wax and wain  
subject all my pain onto you baby  
cos im pretty like drugs
