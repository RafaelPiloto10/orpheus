Oi!  
All over the country  
(We want a new direction)  
I said all over this land  
(We need a reaction)  
Well there should be a youth explosion  
(Inflate creation)  
But something we can command  
  
What's the point in saying destroy  
I want a new life for everywhere  
  
We want a direction  
(All over the country)  
I want a direction  
(All over this land)  
Because this is your last chance  
  
You can't dismiss what is gone before  
But there's foundations for us to explore  
  
I said  
All around the world I've been looking for new  
  
Youth explosion!  
  
A new direction  
We want a reaction  
Inflate creation  
Looking for new!
