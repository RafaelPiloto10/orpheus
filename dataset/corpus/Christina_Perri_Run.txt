Why do I breathe  
With what's beating in my chest?  
You'd think I'd learn better now  
'Cause I can't get any rest  
'Cause I  
Keep trying  
To find happiness  
In everybody else  
  
Please move that finger  
That's been pointing to my mistakes  
I want no part  
In the feelings you worst make  
So let go  
And let me love you today  
  
And you're so damn difficult  
You'd lose a heart in your hand  
And I can't believe you'd make me work for it  
Now I understand  
Why I run as fast as I can  
  
And I can feel everything  
I can feel your emptiness  
And I don't believe  
There's a way out of this mess,  
Unless, I  
Can forgive  
All your sins  
I will not  
I'll never laugh again  
Again  
  
See right through  
My words  
See I'm just like you  
Watch me stomp on my sweet shoes  
All your lies  
All your lies  
All your lies  
  
You're so damn difficult  
You'd lose a heart in your hand  
And I can't believe you'd make me work for it  
Now I understand  
Why I run as fast as I can
