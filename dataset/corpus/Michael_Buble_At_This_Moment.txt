What did you think  
I would do at this moment  
When you're standing before me  
With tears in your eyes  
Trying to tell me that you  
Have found you another  
And you just don't love me no more  
  
And what did you think  
I would say at this moment  
When I'm faced with the knowledge  
That you just don't love me  
Did you think I would curse you  
Or say things to hurt you  
'Cause you just don't love me no more  
  
Did you think I could hate you  
Or raise my hands to you  
Now, come on, you know me too well  
How could I hurt you  
When darlin' I love you  
And you know, I'd would never,  
No, no, no, no  
  
What do you think  
I would give at this moment  
If you'd stay, I'd subtract  
Twenty years from my life  
I'd fall down on my knees  
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on  
If I could just hold you again  
  
I'd fall down on my knees  
Kiss the ground that you walk on, baby  
If I could just hold you  
Mmm  
If I could just hold you  
I would fall down  
Down on my knees  
Oh god please, let me hold you  
Let me hold you  
Again  
  
I'm gonna miss you girl  
I'm gonna miss you  
I can see the tears in your eyes baby  
I'm down, I'm down on my knees  
  
What did you think I would do, baby  
Did you think I would hurt you
