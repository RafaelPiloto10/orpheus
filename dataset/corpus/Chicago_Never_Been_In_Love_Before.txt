I've never been in love before  
Not like this you taught me more  
Hung out by myself  
Well I lived upon a shelf  
And cried 'cause I thought I could not give  
My pride would not let me live  
All my feelings disappeared  
You are lovely reason I  
Am alive you satisfy  
All my senses and you give  
Me the confidence to grow  
In a thousand different ways  
Happy just to spend the days  
Of my lifetime by your side  
I want to be  
Everything that I can  
I want so much  
To be more of a man  
I want to grow  
I want to know you better  
Each day I'll try  
To love you  
'Cause I've never been in love before  
You have a friend for life in me  
If we ever disagree  
And you have to go away  
I will set you free with joy  
'Cause your happiness is mine  
May our light forever shine  
May you always feel free  
I want to be  
Everything that I can  
I want so much  
To be more of a man  
I want to live  
I want to give my lifetime  
Each day I'll try  
To love you  
'Cause I've never been in love before
