I'm so unhappy  
What'll I do?  
I long for somebody who  
Will sympathize with me  
I'm growing so tired of living alone  
I lie awake all night and cry  
Nobody loves me  
That's why  
  
All by myself in the morning  
All by myself in the night  
  
I sit alone with a table and a chair  
So unhappy there  
Playing solitaire  
  
All by myself i get lonely  
Watching the clock on the shelf  
  
I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder  
I hate to grow older  
All by myself
