It's killing me  
I'm losing sleep  
And I'm waking up tired (of it all)  
3 in the morning  
And it's starting already  
With my name always involved  
  
I try to get rid of the baggage  
Fake friends I call them "has-been"  
Yeah they lying on stuff  
And I don't care if they don't show me love (no)  
  
So they want me to lie down  
They want me to crawl  
They want me to cry now  
But I've never fallen off  
  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Cuz in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
I'm just the same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
  
Tell me what I gotta do  
I'm tryna make it clear to you  
Not dealing with the attitude  
I'm tired of tryna make you see that I'm still me  
So I check my longitude and latitude  
You're in my way, you better move  
Knowing everyone is tryna bring me down  
Ohh baby (ohh baby)  
  
So they want me to lie down  
They want me to crawl  
They want me to cry now  
But I've never fallen off  
  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Cuz in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
I'm just the same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)
