There were times when I thought there was nothin' in this world  
There was nothin' in this world for me  
Everywhere I looked there was trouble in my life  
Trouble far as I could see  
Hey there's a man doin' alright  
What's his philosophy?  
He come over here and whispered in my ear  
You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,  
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary  
So who am I so nervous and shy  
To be brilliant and talented  
It's the light not the dark that frightens us most  
And the power lies in our head  
You playin' small doesn't help at all  
The world need the things you give  
Switch yourself on, turn the pressure on  
You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,  
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary  
There are times when I think there's plenty in this world  
There's plenty in this world for me  
Anytime I see trouble in my life  
It becomes an opportunity  
Now there's a chance to make the world dance  
You do it unconsciously  
Help this Winter turn into Spring  
You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,  
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary
