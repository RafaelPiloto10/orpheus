Start, I'm might start with this  
Just a single thought followed by words  
I hope I don't miss, miss anything  
Write you a letter but it's better that you hear me  
  
I suppose, I could sing  
Write a song to share the meaning  
Of the love for you I'm feeling  
People saying what they will, I don't care  
  
I'm hearing voices all around  
I'm hearing voices calling out  
What would they say?  
What would it change?  
  
I'm hearing voices all around  
I'm hearing voices making sounds  
What would they take?  
What would they say to me if only I was listening?  
  
Catch my 22, I'd gladly give it to somebody  
Because I only wanna be with you  
I lost and used your love  
I start to drown and you go and pull me up  
Don't you listen to what they say?  
  
I'm hearing voices all around  
I'm hearing voices calling out  
What would they say?  
What would it change?  
  
I'm hearing voices all around  
I'm hearing voices making sounds  
What would they take?  
What would they say if I was listening?  
  
Come here, there's something I should tell you  
Darling, don't fear 'cause I am going, going away  
  
Voices all around  
I'm hearing voices  
What will they say?  
What will they say?  
  
I'm hearing voices  
Voices all  
Voices all around  
I'm hearing voices all around
