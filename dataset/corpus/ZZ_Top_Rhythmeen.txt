According to Gibbons, this stands for "mean rhythm" and indicates  
the album's general mood. 'Straight from Bo Diddley Land'.  
  
Solid-silver beat machine  
Hunkin' down  
Funkin' up on Magazine  
On rhythmeen in New Orleans  
  
Drinkin' Dixie 45 with hot links  
In a silver Continental  
Wired as hell and doin' things  
That's what you get on rhythmeen  
  
Oh yeah, way up  
Oh yeah, way out  
Uh-huh, get on up  
Rhythmeen is down  
Rhythmeen thing  
Mean mean rhythmeen  
  
Can't get enough of that special sauce  
The backbeat's the big boss  
Here comes another dope fiend  
Tradin' up for rhythmeen  
  
Oh yeah, weird up  
Oh yeah, fear not  
Uh-huh, get on up  
Rhythmeen is down  
  
Leanin' on a silver Lincoln  
A Galaxy 500  
In a Mustang might Tchoupitoulas  
Rhythmeen up everything
