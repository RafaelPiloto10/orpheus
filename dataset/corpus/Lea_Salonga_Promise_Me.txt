You light up another cigarette  
And I pour the wine  
It's four o'clock in the morning  
And it's starting to get light  
  
Now I'm right where I wanna be  
Losing track of time  
But I wish that it was still last night  
  
You look like you're in another world  
But I can read your mind  
How can you be so far away  
Lying by my side?  
  
When I go away I'll miss you  
And I will be thinking of you  
Every night and day just  
  
Promise me you'll wait for me  
'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you  
And I will be home soon  
  
Promise me you you'll wait for me  
I need to know you feel the same way too  
And I'll be home, I'll be home soon  
  
When I go away I'll miss you  
And I will be thinking of you  
Every night and day just  
  
Promise me you'll wait for me  
'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you  
And I will be home soon  
  
Promise me you you'll wait for me  
I need to know you feel the same way too  
And I'll be home, I'll be home  
  
Promise me you'll wait for me  
'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you  
And I will be home soon  
  
Promise me you you'll wait for me  
I need to know you feel the same way too  
And I'll be home, I'll be home soon
