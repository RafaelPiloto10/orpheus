My nights belong to the sandman  
'Cause I sure like a dream  
My morning's belong to the wild-woods  
'Cause I like to hear the birds sing  
My soul belongs to heaven  
My feet belong to my shoes  
Oh but baby my love belongs to you  
My thoughts belong on tomorrow  
'Cause today is all but gone  
My memories belong on yesterday  
'Cause I like to recall  
My wishes belong upon a star  
'Cause I believe they come true  
But baby my love belongs to you  
My love belongs to you  
You and only you  
These words are my heart talking  
Believe me girl they're true  
Oh my wishes belong upon a star  
'Cause I believe they come true  
Oh but my baby my love belongs to you  
But baby my love belongs to you
