[Chorus]  
Let me take you on a funky ride  
All around the world  
And, if you let me get inside your mind  
Feel your spirits fly  
  
[Society of Soul]  
Oh baby, would you like to take a little ride with me  
Unleash your sexual fantasies  
It would be so nice  
relax your body next to me  
As I sing this OutKast melody  
On this funky ride  
So just relax baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Society of Soul]  
Now baby, now the smoke is in the air  
Martell and Coke has got me there  
And we wonder why you're high?  
Well baby, it's nothing but that  
Sess in your chest that got you feeling kinda crazy  
So let your spirits fly  
and enjoy the ride  
Oh yeah baby  
  
[Chorus: x5]
