Oh l'amour  
Broke my heart and now I'm aching for you  
Mon amour  
What's a boy in love supposed to do?  
  
Looking for you,you were looking for me  
Always reaching for you, you were too blind to see  
Oh love of my heart why leave me alone?  
I'm falling apart, no good on my own  
  
Oh l'amour  
Broke my heart and now I'm aching for you  
Mon amour  
What's a boy in love supposed to do?  
  
Why throw it away? Why walk out on me?  
I just live for the day, for the way it should be  
There once was a time I had you here by my side  
You said I wasn't your kind, only here for the ride  
  
Oh l'amour  
Broke my heart and now I'm aching for you  
Mon amour  
What's a boy in love supposed to do?  
  
No emotional ties, you don't remember my name  
I lay down and die, I'm only to blame  
Oh love of my heart, it's up to you now  
You tore me apart, I hurt inside-out  
  
Oh l'amour  
Broke my heart and now I'm aching for you  
Mon amour  
What's a boy in love supposed to do?
