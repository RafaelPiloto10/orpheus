My mama gave me up when I was four years old  
She didn't destroy my body but she killed my soul  
Now it's cold 'cause I'm sleeping in my back seat  
Understand the spirit's willing but my flesh is weak  
Let me speak, I never had a chance to dream  
Ten years old finding love in dirty magazines  
Miss December you remember I bought you twice  
Now I'm thirty plus and still paying the price  
Had a sister that I barely knew  
Kind of got separated by the age of two  
Same mama different daddy so we couldn't fake it  
I saw my sister's daddy beat her in the tub naked  
Take it serious the demons in the man's mind  
The same daddy with rape charges now he's doing time  
Crack followed and like daddy prison thirteen years  
Haven't her but she's traded tears for fears  
  
Shout. Shout  
Let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
So come on  
I'm talking to you  
So come on  
  
Sex was how I made it through  
Without someone to teach you love what else is there to do?  
So where I'm from they call you gay and say you ain't a man  
Show them you ain't no punk  
Get all the girls you can  
A simple plan that still haunts me even now today  
Back to seventeen and got a baby on the way  
No G.E.D. all I see is failure in my eyes  
If you listening then remember I apologize  
I was raised falling in the church  
Made mistakes heard the Lord's calling in the church  
After service on the parking lot getting high  
Wanted to be accepted so bad I was willing to die  
Even tried to tell the pastor but he couldn't see  
Years of low self esteem and insecurities  
Church taught me how to shout and how to speak in tongues  
But preacher teach me how to live now when the tongue is done, help me  
  
See I'm. See I'm  
Soul surviver. Soul survivor  
World survivor  
I just wanna let it go  
World survivor, soul survivor  
Just wanna let it go  
  
Jesus please on my knees can't you hear my crying  
You said to put it in your hands and lord I'm really trying  
You wasn't lying when you said you'd reap what you sow  
Like that night mama died  
Hard to let it go  
You adopted me  
Cared for me  
And changed my name  
But I cursed at you  
Lied to you  
Left your pain  
It's not strange I can still see it in my head  
To know for hours you were laying in that bed  
If you listening to this record,  
If it's day our night  
If my mama still living treat your mama right  
Don't be like me and let that moment slip away  
And be careful cause you can't take back what you say  
To my real mama if you listening I'm letting it go  
To my father I forgive you 'cause you didn't know  
The pain was preparation for my destiny  
And one more thing lord let my son be a better man than me
