Run out of money and runnin' out of luck  
Run into problem I never, never thought of  
It seems like I didn't run out of my dreams  
But we've got each other and tonight we're gonna leave  
  
To the borderline  
Leave all our troubles behind  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles tonight  
  
A broken promise is a broken dream  
We've all had so many, too many for me  
Impossible to have freedom when things aren't free  
But we've got each other and tonight we're gonna leave  
  
To the borderline  
Leave all our troubles behind  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles and hide  
  
To the borderline  
Leave our troubles tonight  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles  
Leavin' all our troubles  
At the borderline  
  
I want to go, I want to go  
Oh I'll go anywhere  
I want to go, I want to go away from here  
Is all I really care  
  
Runnin' away from the girl of my dreams  
Runnin' away from a life of broken dreams  
  
To the borderline  
Leavin' all our troubles behind  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles tonight  
  
To the borderline  
Leave all our troubles behind  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles  
Leavin' all our troubles  
At the borderline  
  
At the borderline
