1, 2, 3  
  
Nowhere,  
Yeah we're going nowhere fast  
Maybe this time, I'll be yours you'll be mine  
Crazy, get your ass in my bed  
Baby you'll be, just my summer boyfriend  
Summer boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's get lost you can take me home  
Somewhere nice we can be alone  
Bikini tops, coming off  
Don't be sad when the sun goes down  
You'll wake up and I'm not around  
Ive got to go oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
We'll still have the summer after all  
  
Sometimes, you might start a fight  
But I'm happy pretending we're alright (alright)  
Sun glasses, cover up my green eyes  
My martini glistens, yeah  
While checking out other guys  
Summer boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey there summer boy  
Let's go for a drive  
Take me for a ride  
Never gonna close our eyes  
  
Hey there summer boy  
I'm a busy girl  
Don't got too much time  
Hurry up before I change my mind  
  
Hey there summer boy  
I'm taking off my heels  
Lets go for a run  
Have a little summer fun  
Have a little summer fun  
Summer boy  
  
Lets get lost you can take me home  
Somewhere nice we can be alone  
Bikini tops, poppin' off  
Don't be sad when the sun goes down  
You'll wake up and I'm not around  
You've got to go oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
We'll still have the summer after all  
  
Lets get lost you can take me home  
Somewhere nice we can be alone  
I've got my summer-summer boy  
  
Don't be sad when the sun goes down  
You'll wake up and I'm not around  
I've got my summer-summer boy  
  
And we'll still have the summer after all  
  
I've got my,  
Yes I've got my,  
I've got my summer-summer boy.
