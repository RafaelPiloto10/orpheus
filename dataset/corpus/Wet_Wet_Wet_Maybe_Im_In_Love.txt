Fly, to fly like a bird,  
To heavens above,  
On the wings of love.  
Shine, to shine like the sun,  
And warm up my life,  
And make it all worthwhile, yeah  
  
Hand in my heart, it tears me apart  
When I'm away  
When I come home  
Don't wanna be on my own  
I said baby maybe I'm in love  
  
Life, to have and to hold  
To cherish the love  
That we could share together  
High, as high as the moon  
The stars in the sky  
Beyond them I'd take you and i  
  
Hand in my heart, it tears me apart  
When I'm away  
When I come home  
Don't wanna be on my own  
I said baby just maybe I'm in love  
  
Yeah, blow blow blow blow  
  
Yeah, all the way  
  
Fly, to fly like a bird  
To heavens above  
On the wings of love  
  
Hand in my heart, it tears me apart  
When I'm away  
When I come home  
Don't want to be all alone  
I said baby oh baby I'm in love  
With you  
  
I'm in love with you
