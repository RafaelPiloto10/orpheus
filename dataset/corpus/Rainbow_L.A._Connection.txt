Oh, carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest  
Forty days of cries and moans I guess  
I've failed to pass the test  
I've been sent away not a thing to say  
I'm banished from the fold  
I'm a fallen angel who's lost his wings and left out in the cold  
  
Oh L.A. connection  
Oh L.A. connection  
L.A. connection, yeah  
  
Operator place a call keep secret but it through  
Investigator knows it all he's at the window I wonder who  
I've got to cut the line and let me drift find a haven in the storm  
I got no time I need a lift to where it's sweet and close and warm  
  
I say  
Oh L.A. connection  
Oh L.A. connection  
L.A. connection  
  
Hey, carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest  
Forty days of cries and moans well I've just failed the test  
Feel I'm balanced on the brim should I lean another way  
Like a flame that's going on the dim needs blessing from the day, oh  
  
Oh L.A. connection, L.A. connection  
Oh take me away I got nothing to say  
It's got to be an L.A. connection, oh  
Oh L.A. connection, L.A. connection  
  
Oh, L.A., L.A., L.A., L.A., L.A. connection  
Connection, oh

Oh L.A., oh, L.A. connection  
L.A., L.A. inspection  
Oh L.A. connection, L.A. connection  
  
Oh I'm down, oh I'm down  
I can't take a rejection  
L.A., need an L.A. connection  
L.A., yeah, oh L.A. connection  
L.A. connection  
I'm flying away  
Take me back home, I gotta get home to L.A.

Oh, L.A. connection, L.A. connection  
Oh, oh, L.A. connection, L.A.
