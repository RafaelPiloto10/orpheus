I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
  
I'm riding home in pain again, baby  
But that don't mean shit to you  
You're currently engaged  
In an intimate conversation  
With a young groupie or two  
They say "Players only love you  
When they're playing games"  
Still, I gave my heart to you  
I should have stayed away  
Like my friends all told me to  
  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground  
Why can't I find my one and only  
  
See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow  
Make me sing real high  
When he goes down low  
But see, it ain't just a physical thing  
He's gotta treat me affectionately  
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust  
Just like every other motherfucker does  
Is this just an impossible dream, baby  
Too elusive to pursue  
It's been such a sad and windy road for me  
Just searchin' for the truth  
  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground  
Why can't I find my one and only  
  
Now you know I roll a Beamer and a Benz  
And I'm dishin' out N's  
While you trippin' on a playa  
Baller, havin' bitter conversations  
While we're rollin' on 24's  
And I know you got doubts  
Why you listen to what people talk about  
You ain't figured out why they call ya  
The heavy steady hatin' cause  
You rollin' on 24's  
See how your money flows  
You dress in designer clothes  
From head to the toe  
You ain't satisfied, well tell me  
What you lookin' for  
  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
  
Well, I'll be your one and only  
If you give me a chance  
I'll make the change for you, girl  
I know I ain't been the most faithful  
Nigga in the world  
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls  
Spittin it to ya while I roll a shisha of fire  
To kiss your lips, I desire  
Twist and Mariah, together like a  
Grip on the tire  
  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
  
Well, come on Shorty, let me make it better  
We can do whatever  
While we're sittin' on suede and leather  
Thinkin' through the city  
While we rollin' lonely  
Let's kick it in the Chi  
I know I messed up with ya, I ain't gon' lie  
I know you were feelin'  
You really know your guy  
But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high  
Let me pick the pieces up  
And put them back together cause I want to be with you  
Don't want to leave you lonely  
Ride with you like a homey, never, no phony  
Shorty, can I be your one and only  
  
Every time, oh mm  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
Why I'm looking for my one and only  
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground  
Why can't I find my one and only  
Still lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
Yeah, I'm lookin' for my one and only  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Why can't I find my one and only, ah
