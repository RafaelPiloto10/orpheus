I had another dream of you last night  
Sailing on a sea of blue  
You were grieving for someone else  
I was grieving for you  
  
Miss fantasy  
It may be you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
In between the shadow and the sun  
In between the black and blue  
From a window I heard your voice  
Telling me you were through  
  
Miss fantasy  
It may be you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
Miss fantasy  
I can see you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
And do you still tremble when I fall  
Will you still answer when I call  
Would you still love to linger up against the wall  
Everyone whispers when you go  
Into the silence of their love  
10, 000 voices crying over with the show  
  
Everybody saying shine your light  
Everybody knows it's true  
Your the queen of the underground  
Never leaving a clue  
  
Miss fantasy  
It may be you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
Miss fantasy  
I can see you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
I remember you  
  
I remember you  
  
I remember you  
  
I remember you
