I'm a fool baby, fool yeah, uh  
If I fuck up, forgive me  
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool, yeah he,  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels  
Last year we killed the game  
And left y'all browsing for the clues  
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth  
Money talks and hoes say it's... point of view  
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit  
How can you justify, I testified and there's proof in it  
Through out the years, she'd tears and spill truths  
Somehow they love a nigga better  
When he talk about is loot  
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see light through a wider scope  
And for I know this necklace really represents the news  
Still I hit the jeweler, how much racks to make me cooler  
I just play the game homie, I ain't making rules up  
Started from the bottom, same way you lace your shoes up  
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up  
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television  
Got no plans of seeing hella prison  
You can tell I'm living, right  
I'm a fool  
Never said I'm living right  
Such a fool, for you!  
  
Boy you a fool, boy you a fool  
Boy you a fool, and they like  
And they like, and they like  
Boy you a fool, boy you a fool  
Boy you a fool, and they like  
And they like, and they like  
  
Hey, I'm a fool, hunned thous to go to school  
... debt me, and my mama dared me  
Drowning in the pool  
The first to go to college  
They say knowledge is the truth  
But these hoes on campus, make a young nigga drool  
So we party skip class, get ass and talk cool  
Meanwhile she back home work hard  
I use that as my few  
So I finally graduated,  
But I'm sad to say it, I ain't learn a fucking thing  
Except the game and how to play it  
I'm a fool, no... on my shoes  
No cuts out on prove  
So fuck y'all reviews  
She told me Cole I love you roll with you before the riches  
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches  
And calling brothers niggas  
Pardon if I cross the line  
But all the time thought you was different than  
All them other niggas  
I responded to her please don't put me on a pedestal  
Cause I know better  
And I'm still a fool
