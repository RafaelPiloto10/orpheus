I got a song been on my mind  
And the tune can be sung, and the words all rhyme  
Deede-ee deet deet deet deet deet deet deedle dee dee  
  
Though it don't say much, and it won't offend  
If you sang it at school, they're liable to send you home  
Never knowin' what you're showin'  
Think you're growin' your own tea  
Good Lord  
  
Let me hear that, let me near that  
Crunchy granola suite  
Drop your shrink, and stop your drinkin'  
Crunchy granola's neat  
Sing it out  
Alright  
Da da da da  
Da da da da da  
Dee dee dee dumb  
  
I know a man was outta touch  
And he'd hide in a house and he didn't say much  
Deedle-dee deet deet deet deet deet deet deedle dee doo  
  
And like a man with a tiger outside his gate  
He not only couldn't relax, but he couldn't relate  
Now he can  
Family man  
Tried my brand  
Dig  
  
Let me hear that, let me near that  
Crunchy granola suite  
Drop your shrink, and stop your drinkin'  
Crunchy granola's neat  
Sing it out  
Alright  
Da da da da  
Da da da da da  
Dee dee dee do  
Deedle-ee dumb dumb  
I'll have a double please
