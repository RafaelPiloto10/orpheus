Don't you take it too bad  
If you're feelin' unlovin'  
If you're feelin unfeelin'  
If you're feelin' alone  
Don't take it too bad  
  
'Cause it ain't you to blame, babe  
Lord, it's just some kind of game made  
Out of all of this living  
That we got left to do  
  
And if you go searchin'  
For rhyme or for reason  
Then you won't have the time  
That it take just for talkin'  
About the places you've been, babe  
About the places you've seen, babe  
And how soft the time flies  
Past your window at night  
  
And we just can't have that, girl  
'Cause it's a sad, lonesome, cold world  
And a man need a woman just to stand by his side  
And whisper sweet words in his ears about daydreams  
And roses and playthings  
And the sweetness of springtime  
And the sound of the rain
