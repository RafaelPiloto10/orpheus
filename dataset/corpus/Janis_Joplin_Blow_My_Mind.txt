You got the mind like a child, girl,  
You got to fight like a woman.  
Well, I think you're so wild, girl,  
Like the sun in the morning.  
I'm gonna turn you on  
To where you belong  
Pull you tight  
I'm gonna show you right.  
You blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind!!!  
Pull myself together,  
Tell you who the boss is  
Now I feel like the weather  
You gotta do what the lord says.  
You blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind!!!  
Oh! Pull yourself together  
Tell you who the boss is.  
Well I feel like the weather  
You gotta do what the lord says.  
You blow my mind hey, blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind.  
You got the mind like a child, girl,  
You got to fight like a woman.  
I think you're so wild, girl,  
Like the sun in the morning.  
I'm gonna turn you on  
To where you belong  
Pull you tight  
I'm gonna show you right  
You blow my mind you blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind.
