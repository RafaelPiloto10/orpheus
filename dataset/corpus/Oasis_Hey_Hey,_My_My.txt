Hey hey, my my  
Rock and roll will never die  
Here's more to the picture than meets the eye  
Hey hey, my my  
  
You're out of the blue and into the black  
They give you this but you pay for for that  
  
And when you die, no you don't come back  
Cos your out of the blue and into the black  
  
My my, hey hey  
Rock and roll is here to stay  
  
It's better to burn out than to fade away  
My my, hey hey
