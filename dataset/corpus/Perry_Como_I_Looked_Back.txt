You looked back to see if I looked back,  
And I looked back to see if you looked back  
To see if I looked back to see  
If you were lookin' at me!  
I looked back to see if you looked back,  
When you looked back I felt my heart strings snap,  
And heard a thunder clap  
And saw the lightning striking at me!  
Then I stood still, an' you stood still,  
The world stood still, my heart stood still,  
And O' the thrill that suddenly we knew,  
The very, very moment . . .  
I looked back to see if you looked back,  
And you looked back to see if I looked back  
To see if you looked back to see  
If I was lookin' at you!  
  
Then I stood still, an' you stood still,  
The world stood still, my heart stood still,  
And O' the thrill that suddenly we knew,  
The very, very moment . . .  
I looked back to see if you looked back,  
And you looked back to see if I looked back  
To see if you looked back to see  
If I was lookin' at you!  
( . . . to see if you were lookin' at me! )  
To see if I was lookin' at you, lookin' at me,  
Lookin' at you . . . lookin' at me!
