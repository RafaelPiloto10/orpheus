We use to say our love will stay until the cows come home,  
And then the cows came home, do you know why?  
We use to say we'll love this way, till Hades freezes over,  
And then it just froze over, do you know why?  
  
We thought we had a future dancing a jig for us,  
Do you suppose our little dream got too big for us  
We use to say our love will stay,  
Forever and a night, and now forevers gone,  
Darling, do you know why? Neither do I.
