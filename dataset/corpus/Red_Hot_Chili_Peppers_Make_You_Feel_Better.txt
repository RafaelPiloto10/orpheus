She's the one she's the only one  
She's got ripped back light  
Gonna make me come  
I say, when I smile I'm a really smile  
I got dreams so wide like a country mile  
  
I said now, I'll take it  
It's better for you  
Somehow we'll make it  
Cause that's what we do  
  
Pick a star in the open sky  
I see you see me  
And that is why I  
  
Hop along to the cowboy beat  
When I feel your fire  
Jump up to meet  
  
I said now, I'll take it  
It's better for you  
Somehow we'll make it  
'Cause that's what we do  
  
Something out there  
Where love is your only friend and  
We are the ones  
That will make you feel better and  
Someone to spare  
When love is the only end and  
We are the ones  
That will make you feel better  
Oh yeah  
  
In a world that has run amok  
I've got to set my sights  
Just to get struck  
  
I walk away from the rank and file  
With a punched out mouth  
And a pack of style  
  
I say, she's the one she's the only one  
Make me search myself  
Until I'm alone, and  
  
Tell me now in a telegram  
Do the sea of stars  
Make a diagram, and  
Something out there  
Where love is your only friend and  
We are the ones  
That will make you feel better and  
Someone to spare  
When love is the only end and  
We are the ones  
That will make you feel better  
Oh yeah  
  
So alive I arrive on dust  
You can search my mind  
For the red on rust, I said  
Take me there and she really cares  
Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers  
I said  
  
I said now, I'll take it  
It's better for you  
Somehow we'll make it  
'Cause that's what we do  
  
Something out there  
Where love is your only friend and  
We are the ones  
That will make you feel better and  
Someone to spare  
When love is the only end and  
We are the ones  
That will make you feel better  
Oh yeah  
  
We are the ones (Repeat x4)  
That will make you feel better
