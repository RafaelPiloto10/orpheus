Slip n' slide, push it in  
Bitch sure got the rhythm  
I'm holding back, yeah, I got control  
  
Hooked into her system  
Don't draw the line  
Honey, I ain't through with you  
  
The harder the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue  
Well, you never know when love will come  
Gotta get it while you got it  
A little bit of everything, even when it hurts  
  
Sure feels good  
Don't draw the line  
Honey, I ain't through with you  
The harder the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue  
  
Yo mama!  
Black and blue  
Black and blue, yo mama!  
Black and blue  
Gotta, gotta, gotta, get it right  
Black and blue  
  
Don't draw the line  
Honey, I ain't through with you  
The harder the better  
We'll do it 'til we're black and blue  
  
Don't draw the line  
Baby, I ain't through with you  
The harder the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue  
  
The wetter the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue  
  
Do it 'til we're black and blue  
The wetter the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue
