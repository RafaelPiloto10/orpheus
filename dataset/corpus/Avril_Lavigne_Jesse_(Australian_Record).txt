Yeah, my boyfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive  
And he doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys  
He laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does  
He brings me mexican food from Sombrero's just because  
(Yeah, just because)  
  
And my boyfriend likes U.L. and D.H.C.  
And he's so smart and independent, I don't think he needs me  
Quite half as much as I know I need him  
I wonder why there's not another girl that he'd prefer  
  
And when I feel like giving up  
Like my world is falling down  
  
I show up at 3am  
He's still up watching Vacation, and I  
See his pretty face  
It takes me away to a better place and  
  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
  
Yeah, my boyfriend takes collect calls from the road  
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge  
He laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does  
He brings me mexican food from Sombrero's just because  
  
And when I feel like giving up  
Like my world is falling down  
  
I show up at 3am  
He's still up watching Vacation, and I  
See his pretty face  
It takes me away to a better place and  
  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine  
(I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine
