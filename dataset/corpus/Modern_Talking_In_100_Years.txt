Outside the gates of heaven  
Oh, there lives a unicorn  
I close my eyes to seven  
Oh, this world is not my home  
A broken heart in danger  
And a pillow filled with tears  
Oh, can you see the strangers?  
In the pain and in the fears  
Can you feel my heart?  
Baby don't give up  
Can you feel my love tonight?  
  
In one hundred years  
Love is illegal  
In a hundred years from now  
In a hundred years  
Love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town  
In a hundred years  
Love is illegal  
All your dreams will die  
In a hundred years  
Love is illegal  
And your hope will not survive  
  
L.O.V.E.  
Love is illegal in my heart  
Hear my heart is beating  
L.O.V.E.  
Love is illegal in my heart  
Hear my heart is beating  
  
You're looking through a fire  
Computers everywhere  
Oh, you're a shotgun rider  
Controllers here and there  
And you read old love letters  
Drowning in the sea  
Oh baby it doesn't matter  
Oh you've lost all what you feel  
Can you feel my heart?  
Baby don't give up  
Can you feel my love tonight
