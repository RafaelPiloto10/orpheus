I'm thinking back two, three years ago  
Thought of making you go eat  
Those words you said  
To me, to me, to me  
  
Watch you undress  
You're hysterical  
I might be giving you the money  
But today  
Forgive me  
  
Daddy's little girl  
Doesn't like the way I talk  
She's a spoiled little girl  
Gonna have to cut her off  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know when love is real  
Daddy's little girl  
She's so nasty in the sack  
She's a crazy little girl  
Gonna have it coming back  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know why love is not enough  
  
I wish that I was invisible  
Maybe then you'd never see me run away  
And I must confess  
I feel terrible  
But let's not listen to  
Those voices inside of me  
  
Daddy's little girl  
Doesn't like the way I talk  
She's a spoiled little girl  
Gonna have to cut her off  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know when love is real  
Daddy's little girl  
She's so nasty in the sack  
She's a crazy little girl  
Gonna have it coming back  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know why love is not enough  
  
A poster child of what we are  
Your hand, your keys  
Your brand new car  
The love we share, the melody  
The life you lead  
Daddy's little girl  
  
Daddy's little girl  
Doesn't like the way I talk  
She's a spoiled little girl  
Gonna have to cut her off  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know when love is real  
Daddy's little girl  
She's so nasty in the sack  
She's a crazy little girl  
Gonna have it coming back  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know why love is not enough  
  
Daddy's little girl  
Throwing money all around  
You had everything, girl  
I hope I never see your face around this town
