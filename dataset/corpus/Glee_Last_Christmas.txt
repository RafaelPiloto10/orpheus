Last christmas  
I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)  
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (special)  
  
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance  
But you still catch my eye  
Tell me baby  
Do you recognize me?  
Well, it's been a year  
It doesn't surprise me (Happy Christmas, Christmas)  
I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying "I love you"  
I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been  
But if you kissed me now  
I know you'd fool me again  
  
Last christmas  
I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)  
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (I'll give it someone special)

A crowded room  
Friends with tired eyes  
I'm hiding from you  
And your soul of ice  
My god I thought you were  
Someone to rely on (someone to rely on). Me?  
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A man under cover but you tore me apart (ooh oh)  
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again  
  
Last christmas  
I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)  
But the very next day (very next day)  
You gave it away (you gave it away)  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special

Gave you my heart
