Well I saw the thing coming out of the sky  
It had one long horn, and one big eye  
I commenced to shakin' and I said "ooh-wee"  
It looks like a purple people eater to me  
  
It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater  
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)  
One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater  
Sure looks strange to me (One eye?)  
  
Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree  
I said "Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me"  
I heard him say in a voice so gruff  
  
  
Well, bless my soul, rock 'n roll, flyin' purple people eater  
Pigeon-toed, under-growed, flyin' purple people eater  
(We wear short-shorts)  
Friendly little people eater  
What a sight to see (Oooh)  
  
And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground  
And he started to rock, really rockin' around  
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune  
Singin' bop boop aboopa lopa lum bam boom  
  
Well bless my soul, rock 'n' roll, flyin' purple people eater  
Pigeon-toed, under-growed, flyin' purple people eater  
  
Flyin' purple people eater  
What a sight to see (Purple people?)  
  
And then he went on his way, and then what do you know  
I saw him last night on a TV show  
He was a blowin' it out, and really knockin' them dead  
Playin' rock 'n roll music through the horn in his head
