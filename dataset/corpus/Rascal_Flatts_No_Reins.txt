She left that loser in a dust cloud  
Heart in his hand, chin on the ground  
Cried her last tear for that clown  
She can see a little clearer now  
She said, "Oh, oh, I gotta go and find me"  
Oh, oh she found the strength to break free  
  
[Chorus:]  
Like a painted wild mustang  
Flyin' out across the open range  
Finally gets to live her life that way  
No fear, no fences, nobody-no reins  
  
No reins  
  
All she's ever felt is held back  
She says, "It's kinda nice to hear myself laugh"  
She's gonna do a lot more of that  
She's makin' plans and makin' tracks  
She said, "Oh, oh I gotta go and find me"  
Oh, oh she found the strength to break free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh she's learnin' how to let go  
Oh, oh whichever way the wind blows  
Oh, oh she's learnin' how to let go  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
No reins
