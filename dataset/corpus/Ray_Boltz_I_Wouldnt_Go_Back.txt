I Wouldn't Go Back  
Words and Music by Lawrence Chewning  
I wouldn't go back, I wouldn't go back  
I wouldn't go back  
To that life I used to live  
I wouldn't go back  
I'm never going back again  
That's all behind me  
So don't you remind me  
It's all too vivid in my mind  
I wouldn't go back  
To that life I used to live  
I chose to leave it all behind  
Lead me on, lead me on  
Whatever it takes  
Oh Lord, lead me on  
I wouldn't go back  
To that life I used to live  
Before the night I knelt  
And asked God to forgive me  
Oh, the pain I felt, the tears I shed,  
The loneliness inside  
I wouldn't go back  
I wouldn't go back, not I  
I still recall that night one Fall  
How close I came to ending my life  
Just before You came  
Lying on my bed  
The ceiling over my head kept screaming,  
Who are you anyway?  
What could I say?  
Sitting in my living room  
Tears streaming down my face  
Life was such a waste 'til I met You  
Jesus! I wouldn't go back  
I wouldn't go back  
Never again, never again  
Never again, no  
I wouldn't go back  
To that life I used to live  
I wouldn't go back, I wouldn't go back  
I'll never go back  
I'll never go back  
I'm never going back again
