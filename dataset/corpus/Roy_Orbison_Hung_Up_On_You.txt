Hooked on the touch of your hand, high on how you understand  
Lost when you whispered "hello" ,something in your eyes said "don't go"  
  
I just had to stay, couldn't go away from you, you knew what to do to get me  
Hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you  
  
You knew, the first time we met that I could never forget  
You held me so close to you, I could never get over you  
  
You were so aware how to make me care and keep me  
Hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you  
  
Yeah, you got me where you wanted me, I am where I really want to be  
Hung up,hung up,hung up on you  
  
I'm so hung up on you that I don't know what I would do without you  
Oh it will take me forever to get enough of you and I can't help it if I'm  
Hung up on you,hung up on you,hung up on you baby,hung up on you  
Hung up on you,hung up on you...
