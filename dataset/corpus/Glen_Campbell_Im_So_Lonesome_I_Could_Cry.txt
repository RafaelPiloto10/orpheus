Hear that lonesome whippoorwill he sounds too blue to fly  
That midnight train is whining low I'm so lonesome I could cry  
Did you ever see a night so long when time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind a cloud to hide its face and cry  
  
Did you ever see a robin weep when leaves began to die  
It means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry  
The silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are I'm so lonesome I could cry
