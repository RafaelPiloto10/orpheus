Girl I know I been busy didn't get to talk  
But don't let your head play them games with your heart  
It's been a little crazy doing what I do  
But I just can't wait to get up with you  
  
I know it's been hard, me not being there  
Baby I don't want you thinking that I really don't care  
And I know that you're feeling like I'm being unfair  
But your love is with me everywhere  
  
When I dream I think of you, breathe I think of you  
All day I think of you give all my love to you and only you  
Swear it's true, all I do is think of you  
When I pray I think of you, far away I think of you  
All day I think of you, my heart belongs to you and only you  
Yes it's true, all I do is think of you  
  
Always say I love you before I go to sleep  
If I die before I wake then I'll take your love with me  
Every second I'm away from you feels like misery  
Cause I know where I really wanna be  
  
I know it's been hard, me not being there  
Baby I don't want you thinking that I really don't care  
And I know that you're feeling like I'm being unfair  
But your love is with me everywhere  
  
What do you do when you love someone so much  
You'd do almost anything just for one touch  
Try to make an excuse just to get away  
That's the way that I feel about you baby  
When I leave do you know what I go through  
It makes me cry every time cause I miss you  
And I hope you feel the same way too  
Cause all I do is think of you
