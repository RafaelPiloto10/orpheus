So you wanna throw our love away  
So you think we ought-a say goodbye  
And you tell me we've run out-a time  
Can't make a heart, stop on a dime  
You could always walk away  
Like you never saw my face  
If you wanted to  
You could tell yourself a lie  
Say this love ain't worth a try  
But you know isn't true  
You heart is tellin' you  
  
Chorus:  
Whoa... We gotta take a stand  
Give our love a fightin' chance  
We can talk it over baby  
Woman to man  
Give our love a fightin' chance  
A fightin' chance  
  
So you think you'll wish it all away  
Click your heels and leave it all behind  
But you don't know that in the real world  
You gotta fight to keep love alive  
There's a battle to be won  
And if bother our hearts are strong  
We can make it through  
So don't turn your back and run  
'Cause your heart's under the gun  
It's a case of do or die  
Break down the walls of pride  
  
Chorus
