I have believed I would always be free and wild.  
No promises made or broken.  
But look at me now I come to you like a child.  
Here with my arms wide open.  
I follow the song that the voice inside,  
Whispers to my soul.  
How could I not, its my heart that brought me to paradise.  
I'll be your love, I'll be your friend.  
I'll be the summer breeze that never ends.  
For the rest of your days I'll be the road that takes you home.  
Like the sun and the moon and the star that guides you on,  
I will be true to my heart.  
I promise you with this ring.  
Now I can say this is more than just wishful dreams.  
Nothing could be more real than  
Love  
Has the way of bringing you to your knees,  
Lifting you up to Heaven.  
I see the rest of my life when I look in your eyes,  
I love what I see.  
Living with you on the sunrise side of paradise.  
I'll be your love, I'll be your friend.  
I'll be the summer breeze that never ends.  
For the rest of your days I'll be the road that takes you home.  
Just like the sun and the moon and the star that guides you on,  
I will be true to my heart,  
I promise you with this ring.  
May this circle never see an end.  
Here and now I willingly place a part of you upon my hand.  
I'll be your love, I'll be a friend.  
I'll be the summer breeze that never ends.  
For the rest of your days I'll be the road that takes you home.  
Just like the sun and the moon and the star that guides you on,  
I will be true to my heart,  
I promise you with this ring.
