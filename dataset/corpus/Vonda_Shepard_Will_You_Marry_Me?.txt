I guess you sunk in, oh yeah you made it in  
Now I'm fumbling somewhere deep within  
Will I raise my glass or will you kick my ass?  
Or will we fall down laughing, laughing?  
I know love is pain, I know your life's insane  
I want you anyway, I'll probably complain  
Why would I subject myself to this kind of disaster?  
A respectable ball and chain is all you're really after  
But I'm tumbling inside this reeling feeling coming over me  
Will you ever decide? So unrevealing, will you marry me?  
Strange behavior from my savior  
You yank me up and down just like a yo-yo  
Do you love me? You're an anomaly  
Or maybe you are just unbelievably ordinary  
Why would I subject myself to this kind of disaster?  
A respectable ball and chain is all you're really after  
But I'm tumbling inside this reeling feeling coming over me  
Will you ever decide? So unrevealing, will you marry me?  
I'm tumbling inside, I'm happiest when you are next to me  
But I'm still on the outside am I obsessed or will you marry me?
