Love's the only thing I know in this life  
That's cut me deeper than the sharpest knife  
And once again here I am and I'm paying the price for a new love  
I still hurt the one I lost  
Standing here on a bridge that I can't get across  
And I can't burn but I will when I walk with a new love  
  
[Chorus]  
I believe  
It's gonna be better then ever before  
That's why I'm looking for  
A new love  
For this old heart  
A new love  
And I just can't wait to start  
I want to feel that way again  
Oh when I find a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Say I'm looking for a new love  
Somebody tell me where I find a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Love's the only thing that's ever made me cry  
Nothing's ever made me feel more alive  
That's why once again here I am  
Looking for the eyes of a new love  
  
I know that somewhere in this world tonight  
There's a guy  
(She goes high on this part and I have no clue what she says)  
I'd even look if I thought I might find a new love  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh I'm looking for a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Oh I'm looking for a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Say I need a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Oh I'm looking for a new love  
Somebody tell me where I'll find  
For this old heart of mine
