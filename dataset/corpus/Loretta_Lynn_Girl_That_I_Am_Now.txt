Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now  
Tonight I'm in his arms but he just don't seem the same  
I cheated and I'm guilty my heart can't stand this pain  
I let passions fill my mind from my heart and conscience blind  
I feel I'm mighty low and I pray he'll never know  
He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now  
[ steel - piano ]  
It almost breaks my heart when he says that he loves me  
I know that I'm not worthy and that's what troubles me  
If he do what I had done could he still feel just the same  
Or would he feel the way I do guilty and a shame  
He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now  
Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now
