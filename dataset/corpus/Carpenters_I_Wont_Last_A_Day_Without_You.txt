Day after day, I must face a world of strangers  
Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong  
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to  
Who will always care, you're always there  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
So many times when the city seems to be  
Without a friendly face, a lonely place  
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you  
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
Touch me and I end up singing  
Trouble seems to up and disappear  
You touch me with the love you're bringing  
I can't really lose when you're near  
When you're near, my love  
  
If all my friends have forgotten half their promises they're not unkind, just  
Hard to find  
One look at you and I know  
That I must learn to live without the rest  
I've found the best  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you
