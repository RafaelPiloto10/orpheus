If a love as strong as ours, couldn't make it all the way.  
Can anything make sense at all?  
If a love so deep and true, couldn't stand the test of  
time.  
Then Mount Everest could slide and Jerusalem could fall.  
Is nothing sacred anymore? Is forever just another word?  
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was  
worth fighting for?  
If we can say goodbye, if we can say goodbye.  
Is nothing sacred anymore?  
If we can say goodbye.  
Is nothing sacred anymore?  
  
I can hear the final words, every sentence that was said.  
Don't know what turned our lives around.  
It doesn't matter who was right.  
There's no justice in a dream.  
Never thought a heart could break without making any sound.  
Is nothing sacred anymore? Is forever just another word?  
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was  
worth fighting for?  
If we can say goodbye, if we can say goodbye.  
Is nothing sacred anymore?  
If we can say goodbye.  
Is nothing sacred anymore?  
  
Our love was as certain as the dawn.  
As solid and safe as any love could be.  
Our love was a star to wish upon.  
And you thought that I'd saved you.  
Could've sworn that you saved me.  
Is nothing sacred anymore? Is forever just another word?  
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was  
worth fighting for?  
If we can say goodbye, if we can say goodbye.  
Is nothing sacred anymore?  
If we can say goodbye.  
Is nothing sacred anymore?  
  
Is nothing sacred anymore? Is forever just another word?  
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was  
worth fighting for?  
If we can say goodbye, if we can say goodbye.  
Is nothing sacred anymore?  
If we can say goodbye.  
Is nothing sacred anymore?
