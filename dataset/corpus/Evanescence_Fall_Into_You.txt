Fall Into You  
David Hodges feat. Amy Lee  
  
Seems so far  
That I have gone down this road  
Only to find that it ends  
But lookin' back  
There is one thing that I know  
I can't make it all alone again  
  
'Cause I'm too weak to stand on my own  
But all I need is you  
  
[Chorus:]  
So lead me  
Guide me  
Hold me  
Hide me in love  
With all that you are  
And all that you do  
  
Hear me  
Take me  
Mold me  
Break me, oh God  
Just fill all of me  
As I fall Into you  
  
Just catch me as I fall  
But all this time  
I have felt so alone  
Losing myself in my despair  
With loving arms  
You were waiting for me to let go  
With every step  
You were there  
  
'Cause I'm too weak to stand on my own  
When all I need is you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh my child  
How I have longed  
For you to come home  
To where you belong  
All of your life  
If you could just see  
All of my joy  
When you are here with me (X2)  
  
Hear me Take me  
Mold me  
Break me, oh god  
Just fill all of me  
As I fall into you
