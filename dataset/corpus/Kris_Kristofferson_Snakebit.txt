Don't give me no more goddamn pain  
Baby, the time has turned the tide  
I didn't need no ball and chain  
I got the numbers on my side  
I... didn't want to love you  
I... swear to God it's true  
I... don't like dreaming of you, anymore.  
But i... but damn my soul, I do.  
I... ain't got all the answers  
I...'m scared to death of you.  
I... don't like takin chances, anymore.  
But I... damn my soul, I do.  
why'see, I got hit so hard, I thought I was dyin'  
Then I fell so far, I thought I could fly  
Darling from the start, if somebody's lying,  
Double-cross your heart, and don't even try.  
Because i... sure don't want to need ya  
I...'d hate to count on you  
I...'m tired of going crazy, anymore  
But i... but damn my soul, I do.  
Don't give me no more goddamn pain  
Baby, the time has turned the tide  
I didn't need no ball and chain  
I got the numbers on my side.
