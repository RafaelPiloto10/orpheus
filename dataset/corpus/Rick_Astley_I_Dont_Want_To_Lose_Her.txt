I don't wanna lose her  
I don't wanna lose her  
  
They told me that she had found somebody new  
But I don't believe it  
They said I would soon find out she was untrue  
But I just can't see it  
  
Maybe I am wrong to doubt it  
And now that I think about it  
If ever I lost her love  
I'd be nothing, nothing without it  
  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl  
After all that we've been through  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine  
(Lose that girl of mine)  
  
I couldn't imagine life without her love  
I just couldn't take it  
If you wanted to know how well I would get on  
I don't think I'd make it  
  
Maybe I just don't show her  
And now that I think it's over  
I maybe should shout about it  
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing without it  
  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl  
After all that we've been through  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine  
(Lose that girl of mine)  
  
I'm gonna make a new start  
And bring her back to my heart  
'Cause what I found out about her  
I just cannot live without her  
  
Maybe I just don't show her  
And now that I think it's over  
I maybe should shout about it  
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing without it
