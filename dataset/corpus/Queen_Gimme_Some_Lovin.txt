Hey!  
Well my temperature's rising  
And my feet left the floor  
Crazy people knocking,  
'Cause they want some more.  
Let me in baby,  
I don't know what you got  
You better take it easy.  
This place is hot.  
  
And I'm  
So glad you made it  
So glad you made it  
You gotta  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin' everyday.  
  
Hey!  
My head's a-spinning  
And I'm floating to sound  
Too much is happening  
'Cause you're not around  
It's been a hard day  
And nothing went too good  
I'm gonna relax  
Like everybody should  
  
And I'm  
So glad you made it  
So glad you made it  
You gotta  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin' everyday  
  
Hey!  
I feel so good  
Everything is gettin' higher.  
You better take some time out  
'Cause the place is on fire.  
Better stop baby  
I have so much to do.  
We made it, baby.  
And it happened to you.  
  
So glad you made it  
So glad you made it  
You gotta  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin' everyday.  
  
So glad you made it  
So glad you made it  
You gotta  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin' everyday.
