In The Beginning There Was Silence And Darkness  
All Across The Earth  
Then Came The Wind And A Hole In The Sky  
Thunder And Lightning Came Crashing Down  
Hit The Earth And Split The Ground  
Fire Burned High In The Sky  
  
From Down Below Fire Melted The Stone  
The Ground Shook And Started To Pound  
  
The Gods Made Heavy Metal And They Saw That It Was Good  
They Said To Play It Louder Than Hell  
We Promised That We Would  
When Losers Say It's Over With You Know That It's A Lie  
The Gods Made Heavy Metal And It's Never Gonna Die  
  
We Are The True Believers  
It's Our Turn To Show The World  
In The Fire Of Heavy Metal We Were Burned  
It's More Than Our Religion It's The Only Way To Live  
But The Enemies Of Metal We Can't Forgive  
  
Cause We Believe In The Power And The Might  
And The Gods Who Made Metal Are With Us Tonight  
  
The Gods Made Heavy Metal And They Saw That It Was Good  
They Said To Play It Louder Than Hell  
We Promised That We Would  
When Losers Say It's Over With You Know That It's A Lie  
The Gods Made Heavy Metal And It's Never Gonna Die  
  
We Believe In The Power And The Might  
And The Gods Who Made Metal Are With Us Tonight  
  
We're Here Tonight For Heavy Metal Are You Ready In The Hall  
They Have Chosen Us And We Have Heard The Call  
Gonna Tear The Roof Off With Out Sound  
  
Crack The Walls And Shake The Ground  
Fight Tonight For Metal One And All  
Cause We Believe In The Power And The Might  
And The Gods Who Made Metal Are With Us Tonight  
  
The Gods Made Heavy Metal And They Saw That It Was Good  
They Said To Play It Louder Than Hell  
We Promised That We Would  
When Losers Say It's Over With You Know That It's A Lie  
The Gods Made Heavy Metal And It's Never Gonna Die
