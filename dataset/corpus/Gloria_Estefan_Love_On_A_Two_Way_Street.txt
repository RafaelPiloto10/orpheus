I found love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
Love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
True love will never die  
So I've been told, but now I must cry  
It is finally goodbye, I know  
With the music softly playing  
His lips were gently saying  
I love you  
He held me in desperation  
I thought it was a revelation  
And then he walked out  
How could I be so blind  
To give up love the very first time  
To be fooled is a hurting pain  
To be loved and fooled  
Is a crying shame  
While I bear the blame  
As he laughs my name  
With the music softly playing  
His lips were gently saying  
Honey, I love you  
He held me in desperation  
I thought it was a revelation  
And then he walked out  
I found love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
Love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
I found love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
Love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway
