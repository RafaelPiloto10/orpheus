All in all, it's no one's fault,  
Excuses turn to carbon walls,  
Blame it all on chemical intercourse.  
  
The swallowed seeds of arrogance,  
Breeding in the thoughts of ten-  
Thousand fools that fight irrelevance.  
  
The full moon is dead skin,  
The one down here's wearing thin,  
So set up the ten pins,  
As the human tide rolls in,  
Like a ball that's spinning.  
  
Bombs, dropping down,  
Overhead, underground,  
It's instilled, to want to live.  
  
Bombs, dropping down,  
Please forgive, our hometown,  
In our insignificance.  
  
Turn the jukebox up, he said,  
Dancing in irreverence,  
Play V3, let the song protest.  
  
The plates began to shift,  
Perfect lefts come rolling in,  
I was alone and far away, hey,  
When I heard the band start playing,  
On the lip, late take off.  
  
Bombs, dropping down,  
Overhead, underground,  
It's instilled to want to live.  
  
Bombs dropping down,  
Please forgive, our hometown,  
In our insignificance.  
  
Feel like resonance of distance,  
In the blood the iron lies.  
  
It's instilled to want to live.  
  
Bombs dropping down,  
Please forgive our hometown,  
In our insignificance,  
Oh, in our insignificance, oh.
