It was there for the first time  
I could see it by the look in your eyes  
You're so shy, but I know you want me  
Your desire will not be denied.  
We will be together, our love has just begun  
We will be together, we will be together again.  
Wanna be in love with you, I want to be loved by you  
This feeling is all brand new  
Wanna be in love with you, I want to be loved by you  
You make my dreams come true.  
Don't you know I love the way you hold me  
I feel so safe in your arms  
It means so much the way you hold my hand  
All a part of your charm.  
We will be together, our love has just begun  
We will stay together, we will be together again.  
Wanna be in love with you, I want to be loved by you  
This feeling is all brand new  
Wanna be in love with you, I want to be loved by you  
You make my dreams come true.  
Be in love with you  
Being together tonight  
We'll together tonight  
Everybody'd searching for a love to call their own  
You will never have to be alone  
I'm so in love with you I will give you my heart  
Baby we will never be apart.  
You Regine I love you, I know what you need  
I must have you, forever, together, and ever and ever again  
Regine I need you, I need you so much  
Come a little bit closer to hold ya I gotta have ya  
Regine.
