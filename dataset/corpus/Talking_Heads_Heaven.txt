Everyone is trying to get to the bar.  
The name of the bar, the bar is called Heaven.  
The band in Heaven plays my favorite song.  
They play it once again, they play it all night long.  
  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
  
There is a party, everyone is there.  
Everyone will leave at exactly the same time.  
Its hard to imagine that nothing at all  
Could be so exciting, and so much fun.  
  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
  
When this kiss is over it will start again.  
It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same.  
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all  
Could be so exciting, could be so much fun.  
  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.
