Racing' cross the heavens  
Straight into the dawn  
Looking like a comet  
Slicing through the morn  
Scorching the horizon  
Blazing the land  
Now he's here amongst us  
The age of fire's at hand  
  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation is his task  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation bids to ask  
  
Everything he touches  
Fries into a crisp  
Let him get close to you  
So you're in his trip  
First you'll smoke and moulder  
Blister up and singe  
When ignition hits you  
The very soul of your being will cringe  
  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation is his task  
Stand by for Exciter  
Here he comes now  
Fall to you knees and repent if you please  
  
Who is this man?  
Where is he from?  
Exciter comes  
For everone  
You'll never see him  
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue  
  
He's come to make you snap out  
Of the state that you are in  
Looks around and make you  
See the light again  
So much self-indulgence  
Results in shattered eyes  
Predominant complacency  
Leads to beguiling lies  
  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation is his task  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation bids to ask  
  
When he leaps amidst us  
With combustive dance  
All shall bear the branding  
Of his thermal lance  
Cauterising masses  
melting into one  
Only when there's order  
Will his job be done  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation is his task  
Stand by for Exciter  
Here he comes now  
Fall to your knees and repent if you please  
  
Who is this man?  
Where is he from?  
Exciter comes  
For everone  
You'll never see him  
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue  
  
Racing' cross the heavens  
Straight into the dawn  
Looking like a comet  
Slicing through the morn  
Scorching the horizon  
Blazing the land  
Now he's here amongst us  
The age of fire's at hand  
  
Stand by for Exciter  
Stand by for Exciter  
Stand by for Exciter  
Stand by for Exciter
