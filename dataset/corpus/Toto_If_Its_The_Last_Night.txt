I don't know if you'll understand  
But I'm hoping that you'll follow me down to the waterway  
I'll be there if you change your mind  
Listening to the ticking of the hands on a clock working overtime  
  
[Chorus]  
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl  
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl  
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl I've seen your face
on every girl that I've held since you went away  
It's getting late and I have to know  
I'm mending the wings of a heart that was broken not so long ago  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl
