If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love  
If you're happy with me like I'm happy with you  
Old cupid just gave us a shove  
If you're thinkin' of me like I'm thinkin' of you  
Then I know what you're thinkin' of  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love.  
  
I run around in circles  
And turn in fire alarms  
I'm nutty as a fruitcake  
When you're not in my arms  
If you're meant for me like I'm meant for you  
Baby, we fit like a glove  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love.  
  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love.  
If you're countin' on me like I'm countin' on you  
Old cupid just gave us a shove  
If you're dreamin' of me like I'm dreamin' of you  
Then I know what you're dreamin' of  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love.  
  
My folks think I've gone crazy  
And I don't feel too sure  
And yet there's nothin' wrong with me  
That weddin' bells won't cure  
If you go for me like I go for you  
Baby, we fit like a glove  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love.
