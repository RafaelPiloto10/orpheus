[Chorus]  
Emotions in this game run deep  
So before these haters kill me in my sleep  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Reppin' 'til my last second through  
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Honored to be somebody they mention  
But before these niggas stop payin' attention  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure  
You'll never be somebody they need  
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed  
So tonight we gon' do it like this  
Oh, for the H-Town  
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go  
For the H-Town  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
You're now listenin' to the Dirty South trillionaire ('naire)  
Keepin' it trill in there, been here and he's still in there (there)  
Pay attention, it's the beginnin' of a new era (era)  
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer (view clearer)  
It's like Lasik but are basic  
Ebonics if you're hooked on chronic and you can taste it  
Trace it, recognize the real when ya face it  
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted  
One shot of Patron, then another one to chase it  
Put me to the test, I won't pass it I'll ace it  
Been so many places, up and down the interstate  
Cities that I've never been, wonderin' if they fin' to hate  
Step up in the spot, let 'em look me in the grill (grill)  
So they can see it for they self that I keep it trill (I keep it trill)  
I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip  
So it's all good (good) don't even trip  
Believe me it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man I've been all over the world  
Tryin' to tell 'em 'bout the trill and what we been through (through)  
What we already done and what we fin' do (do)  
What we got into, what we gettin' into (to)  
When ties 'bout to cut it closer than a Ginsu ('su)  
Roll through Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama ('bama)  
Jacksonville to Jackson, Mississippi spittin' grammar (spittin' grammar)  
From Shreveport ('port) down to New Orleans ('leans)  
And all points in between just to get the cream (cream)  
Me and my "II Trill" team on the road flippin' (flippin')  
Eight hours straight, no stops, no trippin' (trippin')  
Had to keep them heaters on 'em so it's no slippin' (slippin')  
Promote a play with show money, we were slow grippin' (slow grippin')  
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down (down)  
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town (town)  
But we always made it home okay  
And we still on the road to this day  
I gotta say it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say that you never really know  
What you got 'til it's gone and can't touch it (touch it)  
If it look too good to be true, you can't trust it (trust it)  
If you never had it (had it) then you can never miss it (miss it)  
But looks can be deceivin', so don't you get it twisted (twisted)  
Walked a lot of miles in these old school J's (J's)  
Thought of many ways, lookin' at back in the days (days)  
Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place  
How to keep your cool when you're dealin' with a hard case (with a hard case)  
And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you (the book at you)  
And it's a two-sided mirror that you're lookin' through (you're lookin'
through)  
The phone receiver's in your hand starin at your child (child)  
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile (smile)  
See that's how real life is and how it can be (can be)  
And how it's deeper then just comin' down candy (candy)  
So I'm just tryin' to play the cards that they hand me  
For those that overstood me, understand me  
It's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
