[Verse 1]  
From up above I heard  
The angels sing to me these words  
And sometimes in your eyes  
I see the beauty in the world  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, now I'm floating so high  
I blossom and die  
Send your storm and your lightning to strike  
Me between the eyes  
Eyes  
  
[Verse 2]  
Sometimes the stars decide  
To reflect in puddles in the dirt  
When I look in your eyes  
I forget all about what hurts  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, now I'm floating so high  
I blossom and die  
Send your storm and your lightning to strike  
Me between the eyes and cry  
  
Believe in miracles  
  
[Outro]  
Oh hey  
I'm floating up above the world now  
Oh hey  
I'm floating up above the world now  
  
Ooh, Oh, Oh  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
