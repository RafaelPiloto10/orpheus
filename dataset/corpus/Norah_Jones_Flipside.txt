[Verse 1]  
I tried to get high, but you wanted me low  
Good things are happening, but happening slow  
It's some kind of mystery from long ago  
  
I finally know who I'm supposed to be  
My mind was locked but I found the key  
Hope it don't all slip away from me  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Hard times, fun lines  
Moments pass by and I cry  
Rewind, step behind  
It's hard to find the flipside  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stand when you tell me to get back  
If we're all free, then why does it seem we can't just be?  
  
[Verse 2]  
You saw your reflection all over the news  
Your temperature's well past a hundred and two  
Put the guns away, or we'll all gonna lose  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Stand by, or take flight  
Eat or throw your piece pie  
Walk on, or be mine  
Moments fly by and I cry  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stand when you tell me to get back  
If we're all free, then why does it seem we can't just be?  
I can't stand when you tell me to get back  
If we're all free, then why does it seem we can't just be?
