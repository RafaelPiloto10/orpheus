My mind tells me, what will be, shall be  
Not a thing I can do about it  
'Cause in my heart, I can't do without it  
It's so cold out here like minus ten degrees  
And I'm trying to get through to you, baby  
I've got my heart on ice and it's about to freeze, yeah  
Only you can pull me through  
'Cause I want some of your unusual heat, yeah  
And I need more and more, unusual heat  
My body tells me, hold on, I gotta hold on  
But I'm so cold and hungry  
All stretched out like a month of Sundays  
I've been out of my head from that very first day  
Searchin' for somebody like you  
I've been stumblin' around, every step of the way, alright  
And only you can pull me through  
'Cause I want some of your unusual heat, yeah  
And I need more and more, unusual heat, yeah, yeah  
I need it every way, every minute of the day  
Baby, I'm yours, I'll do anything you say  
If you just give me some of your warm unusual heat, yeah  
It's so cold out here, I'm about to freeze  
But I'm still trying to get through to you  
I've got my heart on ice, oh baby please, please, please  
Only you can pull me through  
'Cause I want some of your unusual heat, yeah  
And I need more and more, unusual heat, oh  
I need it every way, every minute of the day  
Baby, I'm yours, I'll do anything you say  
If you just give me some of your warm  
Baby, won't you keep me warm with your unusual heat, yeah  
Unusual, unusual heat, yeah, yeah
