New york  
To your tall skyline I come  
Flying in from london  
To your door  
  
New york  
Lookin down on central park  
Where they say you should not wander  
After dark  
  
New york  
Like a scene from all those movies  
But youre real enough to me  
But theres a heart  
A heart that lives in new york  
  
A heart in new york  
A rose on the street  
I write my song to that city heartbeat  
A heart in new york  
Love in her eye  
An open door and a friend for the night  
  
New york  
You got money on your mind  
And my words don't make a dimes  
Worth a difference  
So heres to you new york  
  
New york  
Now my plane is touching down
