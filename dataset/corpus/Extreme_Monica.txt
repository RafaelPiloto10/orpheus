Look at monica walking in her sleep  
Look at monica running through the fields  
In her dream, so serene  
Monica, monica  
  
Hush, don't you say a word  
Did you see the smile she made today?  
  
Look at monica  
Look at monica  
  
Morning's coming ever so fast  
Shadow's reality's cast  
More like a dream that just won't last  
  
Look at monica walking in her sleep  
Look at monica running through the fields  
In her dream, so serene  
Monica, monica  
  
Please keep quiet, let her sleep  
Can't you see the smile she made today?
