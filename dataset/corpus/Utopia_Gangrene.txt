If it's dangerous, illegal, sick, strange, or obscene  
You can get it from the man if your money is green  
He says, "You can have it"  
He knows once you get it  
You won't be satisfied  
But the things that my brothers try to do to their brains  
The thought makes my blood begin to boil in my veins  
But it's a case of "We want it right when we want it"  
They can't be satisfied  
Gangrene, dying one inch at a time  
Gangrene, sell your freedom by minutes  
Flesh by the pound  
I got a mind of my own and I need to enjoy  
Something that the mercenaries can't destroy  
I don't know where to find it but 'til I get it  
I can't be satisfied  
So we take to the road like a thief on the run  
Regroup underground and find our own kind of fun  
But seems whenever we find it  
Somebody buys it  
We can't be satisfied  
Gangrene, dying one inch at a time  
Gangrene, that's all the vampires leave behind  
Fifty million kids with nothing better to do  
Than sit around like a zombie and stare at the tube  
They'll sap your strength and suck your soul and  
Feed you their trash  
'Til your mind is left blank  
And your dreams have been smashed
