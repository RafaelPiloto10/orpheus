The night is gone,  
The time has come  
To find a new day has begun,  
An' it promises to stay  
To soothe the pain of wasted years  
An' kiss away the bitter tears  
A love to light the way  
  
And from the darkness  
Comes a smile,  
That reaches out for many miles,  
Touching everyone.  
No more shadows of the past,  
Your spirit free to fly at last,  
Shining in the sun  
  
Like the rolling thunder,  
I feel the power of love,  
It's a gift from heaven  
And the Lord above  
  
We walk toward desire,  
Hand and hand  
Through fields of fire  
With only love to light the way  
On the road to Judgement Day  
  
Take it easy, take it slow,  
I'll take you anywhere you want to go,  
Places never seen before  
'Cause I love you, an' I need you,  
I'll do my best to please you,  
My love can open any door  
  
When you hear the thunder  
In your darkest night,  
I'll be there to hold you  
When the lightning strikes  
  
So don't you worry,  
You can ease your mind  
'Cause we'll be dancing  
At the end of time  
  
Who loves you, who needs you,  
Who'll do his best to please you,  
I love you, I need you  
I'll get down on my knees  
  
We walk toward desire,  
Hand and hand  
Through fields of fire  
With only love to light the way  
On the road to Judgement Day  
  
So don't you worry, baby  
On the road to Judgement Day  
Who loves you, who needs you  
On the road to Judgement Day  
  
So I love you, and I need you  
My love can open any door  
My love can open any door
