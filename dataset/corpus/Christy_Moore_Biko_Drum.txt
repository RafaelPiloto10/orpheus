And they went home on an Easter road  
On a silent night tryin' not to show  
Who goes where and who goes when  
Thinkin' some day soon they'll get it back again  
  
From the ghetto in Capetown to dig the gold  
Little boy blue can't be sold  
Under tin roof and a plastic wall  
Thinkin' someday soon we're goin' to leave it all  
  
And the renegades sing all the renegade songs  
And the ones who know hope they're doin' wrong  
The blacks and the coloreds play the Biko Drum  
Listen to the Biko Drum  
  
Transvaal Kids on a Transvaal day  
Little by little the show the way  
To a city of dreams and solid ground  
Thinkin' someday soon we're gonna come around  
  
Steve he's livin' in a prison cell  
All the friends that know hope he's doin' well  
Down here they listen to the Biko Drum  
Down here they listen to the songs he sung  
  
And the renegades sing all the renegade songs  
And the ones who know hope they're doin' wrong  
The blacks and the coloreds play the Biko Drum  
Listen to the Biko Drum  
  
Nelson listen to the people sing  
Nelson Mandela the people's king  
Twenty-five years in a white man's jail  
Twenty-five years we couldn't make him say  
  
And the renegades sing all the renegade songs  
And the ones who know hope they're doin' wrong  
The blacks and the coloreds play the Biko Drum  
Listen to the Biko Drum
