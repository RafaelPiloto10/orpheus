I was taken by surprise  
I was haunted by his eyes  
And the drink I came her for  
Doesnt matter anymore  
And the night wind falls  
With the moonlight from above  
Is it winter is it summer or is it love  
  
And its probably cold outside  
But I dont really feel it no  
Every hour that passes by  
Is another heart healer  
And you cant stop the rain from falling down  
On the new leaves of summer on the ground  
And for every bright star that falls from the sky  
Theres another  
Oh another on the rise  
  
Ive been broken  
Ive been blind  
Been afraid to look inside  
But his words were soft and warm  
What did I come her for  
An abandoned garden lost  
In bittersweet and queen annes lace  
Looked inside where a single rose grew  
There I saw loves face  
  
And its probably cold outside  
But I dont really feel it  
Every hour that passes by  
Is another heart healer  
And you cant stop the rain from falling down  
On the new leaves of summer on the ground  
And for every bright star that falls from the sky  
Theres another  
Oh another on the rise  
  
And its probably cold outside  
But I dont really feel it  
Every hour that passes by  
Is another heart healer  
And you cant stop the rain from falling down  
On the new leaves of summer on the ground  
And for every bright star that falls from the sky  
Theres another  
Oh another on the rise  
On the rise
