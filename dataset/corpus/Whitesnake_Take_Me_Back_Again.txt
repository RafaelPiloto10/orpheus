Now I smoke a lot of cigarettes,  
And I've been drinking too much wine  
You've been patient and understanding,  
I guess I went to far this time  
I cut you with my drunken words,  
So much sharper than a knife,  
But, you turned the tables on me, baby,  
Just by walking out of my life  
  
Too late to say I'm sorry,  
It won't happen anymore  
But, you don't believe a word I say  
'Cause you've heard it all before  
But, all the same,  
Won't you take me back again  
  
Don't say it's over,  
After all that we've been through  
Take some time to think about it, baby,  
While I sing my song to you  
Your suitcase by the back door,  
Packed with broken dreams,  
When night time comes to call on me,  
I'll know what loneliness means  
But, all the same,  
Won't you take me back again  
  
Take me back again, take me back again  
All I'm asking is forgiveness,  
Won't you take me back again  
Take me back again, take me back again  
All I'm asking is forgiveness,  
Won't you take me back again  
  
But, baby, all the same  
Won't you take me back again  
Take me back again, take me back again  
  
But, baby, all the same  
Won't you take me back again  
Take me back again, take me back again  
Won't you take me back again  
No, no, no, no, take me back again  
  
Don't walk away from me baby  
I beggin' you please, uh  
I beggin' you please, uh  
Take me back again  
Take me back again
