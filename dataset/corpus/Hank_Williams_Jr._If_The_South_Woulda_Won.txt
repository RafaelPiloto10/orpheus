If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made  
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States  
The day Elvis passed away would be our national holiday  
If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made  
  
I'd make my Supreme Court down in Texas  
And we wouldn't have no killers getting off free  
If they were proven guilty, then they would swing quickly  
Instead of writin' books and smilin' on tv  
  
We'd all learn Cajan cookin' in Louisiana  
And I'd put that capital back in Alabama  
We'd put Florida on the right track, 'cause we'd take Miami back  
And throw all them pushers in the slammer  
  
Oh, if the south woulda won, we woulda had it made  
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States  
The day young Skynyrd died, we'd show our southern pride  
If the south woulda won, we woulda had it made  
"Play a little dixieland boys, ah yes"  
  
I'd have all the whiskey made in Tennessee  
And all the horses raised in those Kentucky hills  
The national treasury would be in Tupelo, Mississippi  
And I'd put Hank Williams picture on one hundred dollar bill  
  
I'd have all the cars made in the Carolinas  
And I'd ban all the ones made in China  
I'd have every girl child sent to Georgia to learn to smile  
And talk with that southern accent that drives men wild  
  
I'd have all the fiddles made in Virginia  
'Cause they sure can make 'em sound so fine  
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain and see ole Clifton Clowers  
And have a sip of his good ole Arkansas wine  
  
Hey, if the South woulda won we'd a had it made  
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States  
When Patsy Cline passed away, that would be our national holiday  
If the South woulda won, we'd a had it made, olay he hee hee  
I said if the South woulda won, we would a had it made  
  
Might even be better off
