Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight.  
Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight, tonight, tonight.  
  
You got me burnin', burnin' with desire,  
You got me burnin', burnin' like a fire, oh yeah.  
  
You got me thinkin', thinkin' what I'll do,  
No doubt about it, I want it with you.  
Though you're not my first love,  
You just might be my last.  
My heart is poundin' like a drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, yeah.  
Tonight will be the first night that I've been in love with you.  
You get me so excited, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.  
Tomorrow you won't be here, and I don't expect you to.  
Tonight is all I really want, I really want from you.  
  
Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight.  
Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight.  
Tonight, tonight.  
  
Everything about you is more than everything  
You make me crazy, I'm doin' crazy things, oh yeah.  
Tonight when I first saw you I knew it had to be,  
Why'd you have to be so right for me?  
Though you're not my first love, you just might be my last.  
My heart is poundin' like a drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, yeah.  
Tonight will be the first night that I've been in love with you.  
You get me so excited, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.  
Tomorrow you won't be here, and I don't expect you to.  
Tonight is all I really want, I really want from you.  
Tonight, from you, from you.  
  
Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight.  
Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight.  
Tonight, tonight.  
  
Oh, tonight, be with ya, I'll be with ya, I'll be with ya, I'll be with ya
tonight, tonight.  
  
I'll be with ya.
