I don't want to be? I don't want to be  
A good time girl A good time girl  
  
String you along like I string my pearls  
A typical good time girl  
A good time girl  
A good time girl  
A typical good time girl  
I don't need no diamonds now  
They'd seem like broken glass  
I'd never wear a fur  
Would seem like stepping into anothers skin  
A typical good time girl like me  
  
A good time girl  
A good time girl  
A typical good time girl (repeat)  
  
A typical good time girl (repeat)
