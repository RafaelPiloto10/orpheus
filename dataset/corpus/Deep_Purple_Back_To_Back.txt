I read in the news  
That the average man  
Is uplifted five times a day  
I'm confused  
I have to confess  
My feelings never goes away  
I know it's right  
They asked the average man  
In a survey across the nation  
I can't understand the average man  
Keeps losing his concentration  
  
Oh you gotta use it  
Oh you gonna lose it  
  
I'm just begun  
When you're all done  
I see you running down the road  
Can't hear a thing  
My mind is blasted  
And my head is about to explode  
Feeling the pain  
Just more of the same  
As we rolling through the night  
Going so fast  
We're sure to hit the next town  
Before the last one's out of sight  
  
Oh you gotta use it  
Oh you gonna lose it  
  
Back to back  
One on one  
Shake it up  
Move it on  
Back to back  
One on one  
Turn it up  
Hold it down
