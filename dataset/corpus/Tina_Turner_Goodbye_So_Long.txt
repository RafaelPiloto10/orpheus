Goodbye, Baby, You're drivin' me crazy.  
You thought you had me baby, but I was infatuated,  
Things ain't what they used to be and you can't do a darn thing for me.  
Hey, ooh waa ooh waa ooh waa ooh waa  
So long  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh waa ooh waa  
So long  
I said things ain't what they used to be and you can't do a darn thing for me  
I knew you was cheatin, boy it wasn't worth me competin', now  
I ain't gone cry no more, I'm gonna let you go  
I said things ain't what they used to be, and you can't do a darn thing for me  
Chorus
