Guess I never thought again I'd hear your voice  
When you packed your bags and pulled out of Detroit  
Yeah the snow falls alone get hard to bear  
Knowin' you're down south with sunshine on your hair  
Sent a postcard from Graceland when you passed through  
Read even though we lost, I still love you  
I keep it like a locket on a chain  
I tell myself that I've moved on but only half the way  
  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're dancin' 'neath the full moonlight  
Your faded jeans across the hood  
My arms wrapped 'round you tight and good  
And I'm wiser than I was that day  
Now I'd have some words to say  
Ones that just might make you stay with me  
That's only when I close my eyes  
  
Lately I've been talkin' to God again  
And a string of things I didn't do back then  
No doubt I'm better off havin' had you  
Yeah you taught me how to love  
Taught me how to lose it too  
  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're dancin' 'neath the full moonlight  
Your faded jeans across the hood  
My arms wrapped 'round you tight and good  
And I'm wiser than I was that day  
Now I've have some words to say  
Ones that just might make you stay with me  
That's only when I close my eyes  
  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're dancin' 'neath the full moonlight  
Your faded jeans across the hood  
My arms wrapped 'round you tight and good  
And I'm wiser than I was that day  
Now I'd have some words to say  
The ones that just might make you stay with me  
That's only when I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes
