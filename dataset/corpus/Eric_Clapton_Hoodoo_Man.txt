Well, I wonder, what's exactly the matter  
Child you know the time  
Seemed like an hour  
Everything had changed  
  
But I hold up my head  
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand  
Well now, everybody tell me  
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man  
  
Well now, I buzzed your bell this morning  
You had your elevator run slow  
I buzzed your bell in, woman  
Take me on the third floor  
  
Well, I hold up my head  
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand  
Well now, everybody tell me  
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man
