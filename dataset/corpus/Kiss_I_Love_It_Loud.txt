Hey hey hey yeah, hey hey hey yeah  
Hey hey hey yeah, hey hey hey yea  
  
Stand up, you don't have to be afraid  
Get down love is like a hurricane  
Street boy, though I never could be tamed  
Better believe it, yeah  
Guilty till I'm proven innocent  
Whiplash heavy metal accident  
Rock on I want to be president  
  
Cause I love it  
  
Loud I want to hear it loud  
Right between the eyes  
Loud I want to hear it loud  
Don't want no compromise  
  
Turn it up, hungry for the medicine  
Two fisted till the very end  
No more treated like aliens  
We're not gonna take it  
No lies no more alibis  
Turn it up, got me hypnotized  
Rock on, won't be tranquilized  
  
Cause I love it  
  
Loud I wanna hear it loud  
Right between the eyes  
Loud I want to hear it loud  
Don't want no compromise  
  
Cause I love it  
  
Loud I wanna hear it loud  
Right between the eyes  
Loud I want to hear it loud  
Don't want no compromise  
  
Hey hey hey yeah, hey hey hey yeah  
  
Turn it up!  
  
Headline jungle is the only rule  
Front page roar of the nations cool  
Turn it up this is my attitude  
Take it or leave it  
  
Loud I wanna hear it loud  
Right between the eyes  
Loud I want to hear it loud  
Don't want no compromise  
  
(I love it)  
  
Loud I wanna hear it loud  
Right between the eyes  
Loud I want to hear it loud  
Don't want no compromise  
  
(I love it)  
  
Loud I wanna hear it loud  
Right between the eyes  
Loud I want to hear it loud  
Don't want no compromise  
  
Hey hey hey yeah, hey hey hey yeah  
Hey hey hey yeah, hey hey hey yeah
