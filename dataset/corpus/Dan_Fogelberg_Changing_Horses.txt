Changing horses in the middle of a stream  
Gets you wet and sometimes cold  
Changing faces in the middle of a dream  
Gets you old  
Oh, gets you old.  
  
Looking farther than you'll ever hope to see  
Takes you places you don't know  
Search for someone you can't ever hope to be  
And still you go  
Oh, still you go.  
  
Don't you think it's kind of sad to say,  
Don't you think it's gonna change?  
Makes you think you'll have to stay inside  
For a while.  
  
Changing horses in the middle of a stream  
Gets you wet and sometimes cold  
Changing faces in the middle of a dream  
Gets you old.
