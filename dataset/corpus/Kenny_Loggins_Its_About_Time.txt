I shed my skin  
And set aside this self-made darkness  
'n walk on into the light  
  
I'm sick of this prison  
I been calling my life  
I finally found out the gates of hell are locked from the inside  
Just like Moses  
Headed for the Promised Land  
We don't get to know where we're goin'  
We only know where we've been  
  
Hope  
Whenever you gotta start, ya start  
Faith  
Whatever you gotta leave, you leave  
Life  
Sometimes you're gonna hit the mark  
Love  
Sometimes you're gonna take the next best thing  
Joy  
Whatever you want to start, ya start  
Time  
Sometimes you're gonna hit the mark  
Trust  
Sometimes you gotta scream  
  
If it's about joy  
If it's about life  
If it's about love  
It's about time we get started  
If it's about trust  
If it's about hope  
If it's about us  
It's about time we get started  
  
We don't get forever  
We just get now or never  
To make the best or the worst of the time that we got  
There's power in this groove  
And I surrender to the river  
It's takin' me to  
  
I'll learn to swim  
I'm getting in  
I'm getting wet  
I may be drownin'  
But I ain't dead yet  
  
Hope  
Whenever you gotta start, ya start  
Faith  
Whatever you gotta leave, you leave  
Life  
Sometimes you're gonna hit the mark  
Love  
Sometimes you're gonna take the next best thing  
Joy  
Whatever you want to start, ya start  
Time  
Sometimes you're gonna hit the mark  
Trust  
Sometimes you gotta scream  
  
If it's about joy  
If it's about life  
If it's about love  
It's about time we get started  
If it's about trust  
If it's about hope  
If it's about us  
It's about time we get started  
  
Oh baby  
It's all right  
You only gotta face yourself  
To make it to the other side  
  
Oh baby you don't know what you'll find  
'Till you tear down those walls  
And make up your mind  
  
If it's about joy  
If it's about life  
If it's about love  
It's about time we get started  
If it's about trust  
If it's about hope  
If it's about us  
It's about time we get started  
  
I been tryin'  
Prayin' cryin  
Lord, what's it gonna take  
Step by step you go on  
Knowin' that you hold on  
It's just about time
