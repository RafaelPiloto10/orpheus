It was a cool winter's morning  
Somewhere shortly past 9:00 AM  
The armored car they wanted to heist wasn't coming  
So instead they went for the bank  
  
The fateful duo that sat in the get-away car  
Heavily sedated with thousands of round  
Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons  
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
Baptized in a firefight  
Hot blood running cold as ice  
Forty four minutes of target practice  
All hell's breaking loose  
Outgunned, watching "The Force" come to a firefight with a pocketknife  
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel  
And brought down the beast!!!  
  
This was an accident waiting to happen  
It wasn't if it would happen, it was when  
The city's people sabotaged themselves  
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense  
  
The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped  
Standard police issue guns were just not enough  
But SWAT arrived to settled the fight  
Between AK-47 and AR-15  
  
[Chorus: x2]
