The sweetest smile  
The shyest kiss  
Two wounded hearts  
Were not expecting this  
CHORUS:  
Look what love's revealing  
Something to believe in  
Time to start the healing  
For you and me  
Look what love's revealing  
  
Promises for keeping  
It's natural as breathing  
Look what love's revealing  
Willing to trust  
We'll make it through  
You reach for me  
And find me reaching too  
REPEAT CHORUS  
It's natural as breathing  
Look what love's revealing
