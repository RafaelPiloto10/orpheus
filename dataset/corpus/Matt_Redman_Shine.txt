Lord, we have seen the rising sun, awakening the early dawn  
And we're rising up to give You praise  
Lord, we have seen the stars and moon, see how they shine  
They shine for You and You're calling us to do the same  
So we rise up with a song  
And we rise up with a cry  
And we're giving You our lives  
We will shine like stars in the universe  
Holding out Your truth in the darkest place  
We'll be living for Your glory  
Jesus we'll be living for Your glory

Exploding into life like a Supernova's light  
Set Your holy church on fire

Exploding into life like a Supernova's light
