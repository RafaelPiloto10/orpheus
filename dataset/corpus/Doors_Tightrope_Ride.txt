You're on a tightrope ride  
Nobody by your side  
Well, you're all alone  
Gotta find a new home  
Don't go over the line  
You better keep on time  
Or you'll lose your mind  
On your tightrope ride  
  
Watch out don't fall  
Careful don't slip  
  
You better get your balance  
You have to feel the weight  
There are no more questions  
Or no answers today  
There are no reasons  
There are no more rhymes  
But if you can feel it, you can fly next time  
You can fly next time  
Or maybe this time  
  
Did you think we were all together  
Did you think we were all the same  
Did you think I could help you remember your name  
Remember the pain  
What's the name of the game  
  
It's a very good game  
Never stays the same  
From the mud to the sun  
You're on a tightrope ride  
We're all by your side  
But you're all alone and we're going home  
And we're by you side  
But you're all alone like a rolling stone  
Like Brian Jones  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride
