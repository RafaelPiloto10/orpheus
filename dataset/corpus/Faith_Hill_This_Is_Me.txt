Yeah, I have my addictions  
And keep my share of secrets  
And things you'll never see  
I get selfish and defensive  
And pay too much attention  
To my insecurities  
Oh I, I'm just like everybody else  
I try to love Jesus and myself  
  
I don't know what you believe  
Or what you think of what you see  
But this is a part of me  
What I do and who I am  
All of my impurities  
Are right here on my sleeve  
This is me  
This is me  
  
My heart breaks for the homeless  
I worry about my parents  
And all my bills are late  
I'm dealing with the changes  
This complicated strangeness  
Of seeing life this way  
I, I'm just like everybody else  
I try to love jesus and myself  
  
I don't know what you believe  
Or what you think of what you see  
But this is a part of me  
What I do and who I am  
All of my impurities  
Are right here on my sleeve  
This is me  
This is me  
  
I laugh at silly movies  
Tear up when I see babies  
And I'm stubborn as a stone  
I criticize my body  
I wonder if I'm ready  
To ever be alone  
Oh I, I'm just like everybody else  
I cry, just like everybody else...  
  
I don't know what you believe  
Or what you think of what you see  
But this is a part of me  
What I do and who I am  
All of my impurities  
Are right here on my sleeve  
This is me  
This is me
