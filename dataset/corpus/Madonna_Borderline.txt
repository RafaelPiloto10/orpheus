Something in the way you love me won't' let me be  
I don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free  
Stop playing with my heart  
Finish what you start  
When you make my love come down  
If you want me, let me know  
Baby, let it show  
Honey, don't you fool around  
  
Just try to understand (understand)  
I've given all I can  
'Cause you got the best of me  
  
Borderline,  
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Borderline,  
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
(Borderline)  
  
Keep on pushing me, baby  
Don't you know you drive me crazy  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me  
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see  
But then you let me down, when I look around  
Baby, you just can't be found  
Stop driving me away, I just want to stay  
There's something I just got to say  
  
Just try to understand (understand)  
I've given all I can  
'Cause you got the best of me  
  
Borderline,  
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Borderline,  
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
(Borderline)  
  
Keep on pushing me baby  
Don't you know you drive me crazy  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Look what your love has done to me  
Come on baby, set me free  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
(Borderline)  
You cause me so much pain, I think I'm going insane  
What does it take to make you see?  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Keep pushing me baby  
Keep pushing me baby  
Keep pushing my love  
  
Come on baby  
Come on darling, yeah
