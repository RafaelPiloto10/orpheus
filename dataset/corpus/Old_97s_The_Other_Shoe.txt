One old brown shoe falls in slow motion  
And the bedsprings hover right above your head  
As bed springs do, when you're beneath them  
Someone else just climbed into your bed  
By the time she thought you'd probably got to Phoenix  
She'd arranged for your shoes to be filled  
Well, you've got your pride and a blue-steel '45  
Waited for the other shoe to fall  
And you waited for the other shoe to fall  
Dig a double grave out in the meadow  
And you'll curse the rain that turns the dirt to mud  
You'll take 35 south towards Laredo  
And you'll try to find a doctor that'll prescribe an elixir  
That'll make everything better except your late wife and her lover  
By the time she thought you'd probably got to Phoenix  
She'd sealed her fate and gotten herself killed  
You've got your pride and a blue-steel '45  
Waited for the other shoe to fall  
And you waited for the other shoe to fall  
And you waited for the other shoe to fall
