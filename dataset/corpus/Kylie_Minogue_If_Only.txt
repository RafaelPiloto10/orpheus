It's in my scent  
Was something I could pick up  
I turned around  
And the whole world spun for me  
If I didn't tire of the places I wanna forget  
So we're down, we're down  
  
If every easy way in,  
Had an easy way out  
If every step, up, had no step down  
When I feel it, you can feel it  
So we're down, we're down  
  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, if only  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, only, if only  
Only, if only  
  
If some things have never been said  
If little lines in the sand could comfort me  
And erase memories I need to forget  
So we're down, we're down  
  
It's in my scent  
Was something I could pick up  
I turned around  
And the whole world spun for me  
When I feel it, you can feel it  
You can feel it  
  
If I set you free  
And you actually came back to me, take  
  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, if only  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, only, if only  
  
Oh (oh)  
If I set you free  
And you actually came back to me  
  
(If only) Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, if only  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, only, if only  
  
Only, if only  
Only, if only  
Oh (oh)
