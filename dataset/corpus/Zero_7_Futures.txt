Made a note of it  
Did you write it on your hand  
Put a name on it  
To help you understand  
  
Well do you see  
The futures holidays are for me  
Just let me know  
Where we go after the fall  
  
Like the sound of it  
Gonna hang it on your wall  
Turn and run with it  
For the sake of one and all  
Where you go, nobody knows  
  
Well do you see  
The futures holidays are for me  
Just let me know  
Where to go  
Where you go after the fall
