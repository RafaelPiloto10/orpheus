Oh, lullaby of birdland  
That's what I always hear,  
When you sigh,  
Never in my wordland could there be ways to reveal  
in a phrase how I feel  
  
Have you ever heard two turtle doves  
Bill and coo, when they love?  
That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips  
When we kiss  
  
And there's a weepy old willow  
He really knows how to cry,  
That's how I'd cry in my pillow  
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye  
  
Lullaby of birdland whisper low  
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go  
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above  
All because were in love  
  
Lullaby Lullaby
