I never knew what love could do  
Something I never knew til you came along  
You, I found you just in time  
You touched this heart of mine  
Dark clouds have all gone  
  
Now I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Beneath the sky of blue  
Yes I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Girl, now that I found you  
And when I see you smile at me  
Your love comes shining through  
Yes I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Girl, now that I found you  
  
Now you changed everything  
I feel like I got wings  
Learning how to fly  
High, higher then I've ever been  
I'm feelin' alive again  
You're the reason why  
  
Oh I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Beneath the sky of blue  
Yes I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Girl, now that I found you  
And when I see you smile at me  
Your love comes shining through  
Yes I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Girl, now that I found you  
  
Whoa oh, I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Yes I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Now that I found you  
I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Now that I found you  
  
Whoa oh, I'm walkin' in the sunshine  
Girl, now that I found you  
Now that I found you
