Still drinking on the corner  
Just don't say I didn't warn you  
Always nagging big brother  
He's only looking out for you  
  
Tony the pony  
Tony the pony  
  
You're still standing on the corner  
Just don't say I didn't warn you  
Old and jealous big brother  
You had your time and you spent it  
Crying  
  
Now, Tony the pony  
Tony the pony  
So, that's what they call you now?  
When you're free outside  
So cold and hard and in control  
And...  
There's a free ride on  
Tony the pony  
  
Oh, why do you always want to stop me  
From doing the things in life that make me happy?  
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly  
Why do you always want to stop me?  
  
Oh, I would never  
I would never  
  
But you will carry the can for anyone  
The free ride on  
Gullible Tony  
  
You're drunker quicker  
And you're sicker even quicker  
For something heavy is gonna fall on you  
Oh...  
  
And what do they call you now?  
When you're free outside  
So cold and hard and in control  
And, oh...been a lark  
There's a free ride on  
Fucked-up Tony  
  
I will never say I told you so  
Or how I knew that something bad  
Would happen to you  
I don't want to say I told you so  
Oh, but Tony, I told you so!!!  
I told you so
