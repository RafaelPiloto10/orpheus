Baby you're going Down In The Dark  
Show my lonely night is fallen and I don't have very long  
Think [I] might of broke my boil  
Within my face might burn  
You're gonna make it better for a little while  
  
Baby you're gonna die someday  
See you in your crowded wasted , then you start to fade  
That when we start singing faster  
I wouldn't wait so long  
Won't get any easier in the Dark  
  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeahh  
You Will, You Will, You Will....
