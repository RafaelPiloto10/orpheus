Take your time  
Take it easy  
Keep my little promise  
In your mind  
Making out  
Make it easy  
For all the broken pieces  
Of my heart  
  
A love like this I wasn't looking for  
I've never known a girl like you before  
  
Lonely nights  
Soft soap story  
Playing in the bedroom  
Of your mind  
Acting up  
I tried to make it happen  
Just another extra  
In your life  
  
A love like this I wasn't looking for  
I've never known a girl like you before  
  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
It hurts to say it's over  
It's sad to say it's gone  
It doesn't really matter  
Who's right or wrong  
When all is said and done  
  
A love like this I wasn't looking for  
I've never known a girl like you before, well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Making eyes  
Make it easy  
For all the broken pieces  
Of my heart  
Trying hard  
I nearly made it happen  
Playing out the bedroom of your life  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It hurts, yes it does, to say it's over  
It is over  
It's sad, it's so sad, to say it's gone, gone, gone  
It hurts, oh it hurts, to say it's over  
Yes it hurts  
It's sad to say it's gone, gone, gone  
It hurts, yes it hurts, to say it's over  
Baby it's over  
It's sad, so sad, to say it's gone, gone, gone
