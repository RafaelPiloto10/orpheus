I left the North  
I traveled South  
I found a tiny house  
And I can't help the way I feel  
Oh yes, you can kick me  
  
And you can punch me  
And you can break my face  
But you won't change the way I feel  
'Cause I love you  
Oh...  
  
And is it really so strange ?  
Oh, is it really so strange ?  
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ?  
I say NO, you say YES  
(and you will change your mind)  
  
I left the South  
I traveled North  
I got confused - I killed a horse  
I can't help the way I feel  
Oh yes, you can punch me  
  
And you can butt me  
And you can break my spine  
But you won't change the way I feel  
'Cause I love you  
Oh ...  
  
And is it really so strange ?  
Oh, is it really so strange ?  
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ?  
I say NO, you say YES  
(But you will change your mind)  
  
I left the North again  
I traveled South again  
And I got confused - I killed a nun  
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL  
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL  
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL  
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell)  
  
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ?  
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes  
And I realized, I realized  
I could never  
I could never, never, never, go back home again
