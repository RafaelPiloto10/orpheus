She sparkle like my jean  
She more than seventeen  
Seems keen in other words  
She must have been  
A former beauty queen  
Now she's a naughty girl  
Chorus  
Wild wild wild tiger woman  
(wild wild wild wild)  
You move me very fast  
But can you last another day  
Get out of the way  
Wild wild tiger woman  
(wild wild wild wild)  
You gonna break you're little fall  
They call her the wild tiger woman  
Tied to the bed  
Tied to the bed  
She's waitin to be fed  
No pay to sir aday (? )  
Can't see an ounce of reason in her head  
Don't laugh and turn away  
Chorus  
Need another girl to come and grab her by the tail  
As I was hoping that the ground would open up and take me in  
Life is so obscene and the remarks that go unseen  
Are being diminished to the earth  
Ill never find another girl  
All in the race  
Such a friendly face  
Seems clean and upper-class  
Young indecisive  
Minds are in a maze  
She lose me very fast  
Chorus
