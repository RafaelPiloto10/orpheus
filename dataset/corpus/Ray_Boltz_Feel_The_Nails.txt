They tell me Jesus died  
For my transgressions  
And that He paid that price  
A long, long time ago  
When He gave His life for me  
On a hill called Calvary  
But there's something else  
I want to know  
Does He still feel the nails  
Every time I fail?  
Does He hear the crowd cry  
Crucify, again?  
Am I causing Him pain?  
Then I know I've got to change  
I just can't bear the thought  
Of hurting Him  
It seems that I'm so good  
At breaking promises  
And I treat His precious grace  
So carelessly  
But each time He forgives  
What if He relives  
The agony He felt on that tree?  
Does He still feel the nails  
Every time I fail?  
Does He hear the crowd cry  
Crucify, again?  
Am I causing Him pain?  
Then I know I've got to change  
I just can't bear the thought  
Of hurting Him  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord  
Do you still feel the nails  
Every time I fail?  
Have I crucified you, Jesus  
With my sin?  
I'm tired of playing games  
I really want to change  
I never want to hurt You again  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
