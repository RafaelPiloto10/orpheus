Look me over closely  
Tell me what you see  
The lady likes to look her best  
Before she pours the tea  
You said I'm [?]  
That makes the evening sun go down  
Oh look me over closely  
Tell me what you find  
But don't be over anxious  
I'm not the marryin' kind  
I'm a poor in a storm  
You'll harbor where it's warm  
In my arms you will hide  
From the great big world outside  
Oh but when you come and see me  
Don't try to change my ways  
You'll have a part within my heart  
And there you'll always stay  
There's room for all  
Not for all  
But don't blame me  
If you fall  
So look me over closely  
And then make up your mind  
But darling please remember this  
I'm holding you before we kiss  
So look me over closely  
Because I may be the marryin' kind  
Oh well I may be the marryin' kind  
Oh well I may be the marryin' kind  
Oh
