If one kiss led to another, baby  
I'm ready to forgive you honey  
There's a light that shines between us  
And it's worth the crying, lady  
  
I was falling on sharp stones then  
And my bones were cracking daily  
No more weeping and lying now  
And I'm holding you forever  
And I'm holding you forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from the push and shove  
Let us blend together  
Find us and forgive us  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from the push and shove  
Let us blend together  
Find us and forgive us  
  
Time they say, is the great healer  
But I believe in chemicals baby  
When the waves come crashing in  
We are closer now than ever  
We are closer now than ever  
  
There was a cold space between us  
Still we bridged that chasm lady  
Desire love and friendship  
We are sanctified together  
We are sanctified together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
Love love Lord above  
Love love Lord above  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love
