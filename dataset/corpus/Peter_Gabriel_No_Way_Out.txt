Saw a group of people forming  
Round a figure lying down  
And someone runs to make a phone call  
And the man kneels on the ground  
The man kneels on the ground  
The man kneels on the ground  
There's a tightening in my chest,  
I know that I'm drawn in  
Oh god let it not be, you  
  
Don't leave us  
Don't leave like this  
Don't leave me here again  
I'm not quitting on you  
There's no one else  
You're not quitting on us  
No running out  
  
The color in your shirt is darkening,  
Against the paleness of your skin  
I remember how you held the goldfish  
Swimming around in a plastic bag  
Swimming around in a plastic bag  
You held it up so high  
In the bright lights of the fair  
It slipped and fell  
We looked everywhere  
  
Don't leave us (your eyes are bright, your blood is warm)  
Don't leave like this (your heart is strong, you're holding on)  
Don't leave me here again (I feel your pulse, I hold your hand)  
I'm not quitting on you  
There's no one else  
You're not quitting on us  
There's no way out  
No way out  
Don't leave us  
Don't leave like this  
Don't leave me here again (I feel your pulse, I hold your hand)  
I'm not quitting on you  
There's no one else  
You're not quitting on us  
No running away, no way out
