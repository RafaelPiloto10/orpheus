It's about time  
It's about time that you start looking my way  
And I even gave you my last dime  
Even told you what to say  
It's about time  
It's about time that you start looking my way  
And I even gave you my last dime  
Even told you what to say  
  
Oh I never had the nerve to approach you baby  
'Cause I didn't think that you would ever look at me that way  
I known you for so long I seen all your lovers come and go  
I know exactly how to please you  
But I'm afraid that you'll say no  
  
It's about time  
It's about time that you start looking my way  
And I even gave you my last dime  
Even told you what to say  
It's about time  
It's about time that you start looking my way  
And I even gave you my last dime  
Even told you what to say  
  
You told me about the nights  
That you spent with her down by the lake  
I wanted to tell you stop  
How much could my poor heart take  
I started burning up inside, how I long so for you  
Just to feel your sweet caresses  
Is all I ever want to do  
  
It's about time  
It's about time that you start looking my way  
And I even gave you my last dime  
Even told you what to say  
It's about time  
It's about time that you start looking my way  
And I even gave you my last dime  
Even told you what to say  
  
I don't know why  
I couldn't tell you that I care for you  
And now I cry tears of joy  
As I let you know that it's about time  
That it's about time  
  
It's about time  
It's about time that you start looking my way  
And I even gave you my last dime  
Even told you what to say  
It's about time  
It's about time that you start looking my way  
And I even gave you my last dime  
Even told you what to say
