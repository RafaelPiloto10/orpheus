There's me looking down at my shoes  
The one smiling like the sun that's you  
What were you thinking?  
What was the song inside your head?  
There's us going on about a band  
Working out how we'd play our hands  
I lay there dreaming later, all alone in my bed  
If I was stupid maybe careless so were you  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
I'll keep everything I shared with you  
And that's enough there's us  
Freeze frame, I'm not about to cry  
It's to late for us to change, why try?  
I've got a camera tucked away inside my heart  
If I'm a loser or just unlucky, so are you  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
I'll keep everything I shared with you  
And that's enough there's us  
Somewhere between then and now  
I looked away when you said we'll never change  
And if you think what might have been  
You'll lose today and we've got songs to play  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
I'll keep everything I shared with you  
And that's enough there's us  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
I'll keep everything I shared with you  
And that's enough there's us  
Some love is not really love at all  
There's us  
Some love is not really love at all  
There's us
