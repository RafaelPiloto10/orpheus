Delight  
See our faces are both shining  
And I've never felt so wanted  
Than when you cling with arms and legs  
  
I tremble  
You crush my burning lips like ashes  
With so much skin to travel over  
While my head spins (and you knew it would)  
  
And oh, what a storm!  
And oh, what a storm!  
  
We shelter in our skin storm  
  
I feel  
Feel your breath burn on my body  
You touch my senses, tingling brightly  
Slip-and-sliding into heaven  
  
Love could be a wonderful emotion  
With such a rush of pleasure motion  
When I'm dancing on our skin  
  
And oh, what a storm!  
And oh, what a storm!  
  
We shelter in our skin storm  
  
And oh, what a storm!  
And oh, what a storm!  
  
We shelter in our skin storm
