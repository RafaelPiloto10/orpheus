They say that you're a run around lover  
Tho' you say it isn't so  
But if you put me down for another  
I'll know, believe me  
I'll know  
'cause the night has a thousand eyes  
And a thousand eyes can't help but see  
If you aren't true to me  
So remember when you tell those  
Little white lies that the night  
Has a thousand eyes  
One of these days you're gonna be sorry  
'cause your game i'm gonna play  
And you'll find out without really trying  
Each time that my kisses stray  
That the night has a thousand eyes  
And a thousand eyes will see me through  
And no matter what i do  
I could never disguise  
All those little white lies  
'cause the night has a thousand eyes  
So remember when you tell those  
Little white lies that the night  
Has a thousand eyes
