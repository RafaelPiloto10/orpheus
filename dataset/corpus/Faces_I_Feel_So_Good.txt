I got a letter  
It come to me by mail  
My baby's coming' home  
I hope that she don't fail  
  
[Chorus]  
Because I feel so good  
I feel so good  
You know I feel so good  
Feel like ballin' the jack  
  
I drove into town to that old station  
Just to meet her old train  
My baby said she's a-comin' home  
I hope that she won't fail  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel so good, I hope I always will  
Feel just like I just got out of jail  
Way off behind the hills  
  
[Chorus]
