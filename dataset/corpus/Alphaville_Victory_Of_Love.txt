Waiting  
For a change in the weather  
I'm waiting for a shift in the air  
Could we get it together, ever  
Hoping for your return, hoping for your sweet, sweet  
Return  
Hello  
Is this heaven calling  
Hello, hello, is somebody there, she must be somewhere  
And then she says hello, hello, hello  
She's really an angel  
She stands in the sunshine  
She's closing her eyes, she starting to dream,  
She's pulling the strings  
She's dreaming a strange dream  
  
Where nothing is grey  
Then she takes me away and she's pulling the strings  
When she's playing with love  
She's playing with love  
Counting  
I count every second  
And I'm standing  
I stand in the rain, I walk up that lane  
Which leads to the sunshine  
She stands in the sunshine  
She's closing her eyes  
Then she takes me away and she's pulling the strings  
When she's playing with love  
She's playing with love
