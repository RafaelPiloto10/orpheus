Look at the man in the corner  
He's sitting all alone  
His blankets are made out of cardboard  
And his pillows are made out of stone  
Every face tells a storcy  
It never tells a lie  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie  
See the man walking on the water  
See the light in his eyes  
He came into the world with a message to tell  
He came into the world to die  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie  
You're always telling stories  
You're always telling me lies  
You're always telling stories, why?  
So think of yourself in the water  
Seeing your days flashing by  
It's too late to see what you wanted to be  
You've spent all your time, you must die  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie, oh  
You're always telling stories  
You're always telling me lies  
You're always telling stories, why?  
Why don't you step down  
And make it work out right  
I'm trying to get to you with my warning  
Been here for nearly half the night  
Look it's nearly four in the morning
