Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene  
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest  
Well you know what I mean  
Fifty eight that was great  
But it's over now and That's all  
Somethin' harder's coming up  
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall  
Gonna hit ya grab you hard  
Make you feel ten feet tall  
  
Well I hope this baby's gonna come along soon  
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon  
With the temperature down  
And the jukebox blowin' no fuse  
And my musical life's feelin'  
Like a long Sunday School cruise  
And you know there's one thing  
Every single body could use  
Yeah listen to me baby  
Let me tell you what it's all about  
Modern times rock and roll  
Modern times rock and roll  
  
Get you high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes  
Get a hair piece on your chest  
And a ring through your nose  
Find a nice little man who says  
He's gonna make you a real big star  
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants  
Think you should go far  
Everybody in this bum sucking world  
Gonna know just who you are  
Look out  
  
Modern times rock and roll
