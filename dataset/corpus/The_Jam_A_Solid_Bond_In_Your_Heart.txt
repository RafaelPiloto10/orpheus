Feel is a word I can't explain  
At least not in words that are plain  
Make it easy to express  
But Ill try to do my best  
To hit you where it counts  
I just want to build up  
A solid bond in your heart  
(Yeah) A solid bond in your heart (aha)  
  
I'm fueled by the idea  
That this world was made to share  
But it never seems to work out  
And all we seem to share  
Is doubt and misery  
Please let me try to build  
A solid bond in your heart heart  
  
Aah, I just want to build up  
A solid bond in your heart heart  
Its what's missing from this life  
And the trust you need to ignite  
Any dream worth holding dear  
When that dream is so near  
  
You gotta try and try to get it back  
Push it to the limit and build  
A solid bond in your heart
