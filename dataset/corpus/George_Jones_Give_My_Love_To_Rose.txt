I found him by the railroad tracks this morning  
I could see that he was nearly dead  
I knelt down beside him and I listened  
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said  
He said, "They let me out of prison back in Frisco"  
For 10 long years I've paid for what I'd done  
I was trying to get back to Louisiana  
Just to see my Rose and get to know my son  
Won't you tell them I said thanks, for waiting for me  
And tell my boy to help his mama at home  
Tell my Rose to try to find another  
For it ain't right that she should live alone  
Mr., here's the bag with all my money  
It won't last them long the way it goes  
God bless you for finding me this morning  
Now don't forget to give my love to Rose  
Give my love to Rose, won't you Mr.  
Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes  
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him  
And don't forget to give my love to Rose
