Now me, I work at Harold?s Super Service  
We specialize in service all the way  
And there's only one thing that really bugs me  
Is that big ol' guy in his stripped down Model A  
At Harold?s Super Service, we do grease jobs  
We fix thirty or forty flats every day  
And just about the time we get real busy  
Here comes that guy in his stripped down Model A  
And he says, ?Gimme 50 cents worth of regular  
Check my oil too, if you don't mind  
Put some air in my tires, won't you, mister?  
Wash my windows too, if you got time?  
Last night, I dreamed I died and went to heaven  
To that Mighty Super Service in the sky  
And I was satisfied of pumpin' gas forever  
For the angels in the sweet, by and by  
Now the pearly gates was just around the corner  
You could see the new ones comin? every day  
And I was changin? plugs on Moses? magic carpet  
When, up through the clouds, there came this Model A  
He says, ?Gimme 50 cents worth of regular  
Check my oil too, if you don't mind  
Put some air in my tires, won't you, mister?  
Wash my windows too, if you got time?  
He says, ?Gimme 50 cents worth of regular  
Check my oil too, if you don't mind  
Put some air in my tires, won't you, mister?  
Wash my windows too, if you got time?
