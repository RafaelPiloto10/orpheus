You know like a body in the ground  
Will your show ever grow?

And rolling out for mine working so hard for such a long time  
And life yes it's here and gone so pedal to the Hammer

Been to a tomb and I'm rolling a whole new style  
But the people are holding on too

Your ego's so big that you miss the whole thing  
And dang my crib the people wanted more
