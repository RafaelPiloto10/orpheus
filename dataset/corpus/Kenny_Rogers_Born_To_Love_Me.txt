Not many say she's pretty 'cause they don't realize  
That beauty is often hidden from another's eyes  
But in the quiet moments her beauty starts to shine  
And every night I'm thankful that she's mine, that she is mine  
  
'Cause she was born to love me in her gentle way  
Born to love me each and every day  
Born to love me, born to hold me tight  
Born to love me every night, every night  
  
I learned it doesn't matter what other people see  
It's what I feel for her and what she feels for me  
She made my life worth living because she's understood  
That love is made for giving, she's so good, she's so good  
  
And she was born to love me in her gentle way  
Born to love me each and every day  
Born to love me, born to hold me tight  
And she loves me every night, every night  
  
And she was born to love me in her gentle way
