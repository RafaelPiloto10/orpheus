Every path you take  
Every move you make  
It can change your life  
  
But with every breath you take  
All the tears you've wasted  
You think failure's kind  
  
Angels over you now  
Bribes you to see this out  
Cuz your not the only one  
  
Look up your almost done  
This life it can be won  
Just pull it out of you,  
And shine like the brightest sun  
  
Because here's our time  
So stop your crying  
Just live your life  
I'll be by your side  
  
Well if you're as kind  
And an open mind  
We will make it  
Make it through this life  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Because here's our time  
So stop your crying  
Just live your life  
I'll be by your side  
  
Well if you're as kind  
And an open mind  
We will make it  
Make it through this life
