Underworld, the queen of pearls  
Catches the light that's in your eyes.  
She has desires, and has to get higher,  
Trying to love the whole world.  
Mother of pearl  
She's a charity girl,  
Giving herself away  
To some body and soul.  
Paradise if you pay the price  
Inlaid with love she satisfies.  
She has to pray alone everyday,  
Lying in wait for the whole wide world.  
Mother of pearl  
She's a charity girl,  
Giving herself away  
To some body and soul.  
Black see-through  
Dressed to kill and cast her spell,  
Sequins of fire for her love's desire,  
She's drifting away from her open shell.  
Mother of pearl  
She's a charity girl,  
Giving herself away  
To some body and soul.
