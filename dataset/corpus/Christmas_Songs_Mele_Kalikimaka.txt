Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say,  
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day,  
That's the island greeting that we send to you  
From the land where palm trees sway,  
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright,  
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night,  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way  
To say "Merry Christmas to you."
