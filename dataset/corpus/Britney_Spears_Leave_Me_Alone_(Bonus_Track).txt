Hmm  
Oh oh  
They all say  
I'm ridiculous  
But I've got news for them  
I've got news for us  
  
I'm freaking pissed off  
What's up wit them  
I'm freaking pissed off  
Leave...  
Leave!!!  
  
Chorus::  
Leave me alone  
Let me live my life in peace  
Leave me alone  
What can't you just be  
Normal  
Not those freaking paparazzi people  
Leave me alone  
I'm private  
I've learned my lesson  
So there's no stripping to see  
Yeah  
Leave me alone  
  
Myself  
I am personal  
You don't need to bring me  
To see  
What i have done  
It's not my fault  
You just give me space  
Leave me  
Leave me  
  
Chorus::  
  
Yes  
Leave me  
Leave me  
Leave me  
  
Chorus:: 2x
