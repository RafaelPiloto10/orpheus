I've been down  
I've been cryin' in the dead of night  
I've been tryin', i've been tryin'  
To find the time to make it right  
It's gonna be a long cold winter  
Long cold winter without your love  
  
I've been walkin'  
I've been freezin'  
Freezin' from a love i left behind  
I've been searchin', i've been searchin'  
Can't find my peace of mind  
It's gonna be a long cold winter  
Long cold winter without your love  
  
I've been down ooo, i've been down yea  
Baby baby baby ooo i'm freezin'  
I'm freezin', i'm freezin', i'm cold  
So so so cold  
It's gonna be a long cold winter  
Long cold winter without your love yea
