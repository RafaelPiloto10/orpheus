Half a day from nowhere  
Hurrying to get there  
Ninety miles an hour  
In two Plymouth wagons  
The Avis lady gave us a smile  
Tom's getting uptight  
Max'll will make it all right  
Ken's asleep in back  
Artie's reading a map  
That's takin' us where we're heading to  
We should be there soon  
There's a sign up ahead  
Wash my face and get fed  
And that voice in my head  
Keeps sayin' I'm lonely  
But I'm only payin' my dues  
Holiday Inn Blues  
Had a reservation, best accommodations  
We get the word, they never heard  
We were comin' by at all  
See what they can do for me  
Only got one room free  
Little bit confined  
But if you guys don't mind  
We'll put you up in our bridal suite  
The view can't be beat  
And a fine view they got  
Of a new parking lot  
And I can't repeat what's in my mind  
As I lay back resigned  
And I kick off my shoes  
Holiday Inn blues  
Time to put a show on  
Gettin' time to go on  
People call for more  
We do two encores  
Take our bows and we're feelin' fine  
We got to unwind  
Want some coffee, but then  
This town closes at ten  
Looks like I'm gonna spend  
One more night by the light  
Of the late show  
And Charlie Chan's crew  
Holiday Inn blues  
Holiday Inn blues  
I feel so down  
Holiday Inn blues  
What am I gonna do?
