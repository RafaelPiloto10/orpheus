You're my love  
You're my angel  
You're the girl of my dreams  
And I'd like to thank you  
For waiting patiently  
  
Daddy's home - daddy's home - to stay  
  
How I've waited for this moment  
To be by your side  
Your best friend wrote and told me  
You had tear drops in your eyes  
  
Daddy's home - daddy's home - to stay  
  
It wasn't on a Sunday  
(Monday and Tuesday went by)  
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon  
(All I could do was cry)  
But I made a promise  
That you treasure  
And I made it back home to you  
  
How I've waited for this moment  
To be by your side  
Your best friend wrote and told me  
You had tear drops in your eyes  
  
Daddy's home - daddy's home - to stay.....  
Daddy's home - to stay.....  
I'm not a thousand miles away
