(Hello, hello, hello)  
  
Yoko's cutting keys in Soho  
I've been there and I should know oh face it  
I'll stick up for Aunty Sally  
Worzel's just a dirty scally fragrant  
Mia Farrow's patching marrows down at the place where all the face fit  
Robin Cousins doing dozens on a little pudding so he rakes it  
  
I'm the reserection  
I may steal your soul  
I am fairly evil  
I live for rock and roll  
  
Shirley Bassey's playing Lassie up a pole in Tallahassee hates it  
Norris Mcwhirter's doing furters in a little place how's he fake it  
It's another appetiser I can go and buy a Tizer laced fit  
I don't know where I've been but I know where I've been is near a lake  
  
I am an erection  
I may steal your soul  
I am fairly evil  
I live for rock and roll  
  
(Sock it to me daddy)  
  
I am an erection  
I may steal your soul  
I am fairly evil  
Only for rock and roll  
  
(Dance dance)  
(yeah yeah)  
  
(Hello, hello)
