Silver bells  
Silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city.  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
  
Silver bells  
Silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city.  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of street lights  
Even stop lights blink of bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And above all this bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells  
Silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city.  
Ring-a-ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
Soon it will be Christmas day
