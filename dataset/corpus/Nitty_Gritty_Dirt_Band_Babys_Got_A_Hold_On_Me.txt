Sittin' on the front porch tryin' to keep still  
Baby's lookin' finer than a fifty dollar bill  
Pretty blue eyes and it isn't hard to see  
That baby's got a hold on me  
  
Long blond hair down the middle of her back  
She's got the keys to her daddy's Cadillac  
Got every little thing that I'm ever gonna need  
Baby's got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on, got a hold on me  
Got a hold on, baby's got a hold on me  
  
We've got a full tank of gas, lookin' for a thrill  
A three day weekend, lot of time to kill  
Put the top down but we're never gonna freeze  
'Cause baby's got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on, got a hold on me  
Got a hold on, baby's got a hold on me  
Hold on...  
  
Well, the full moon's shinin' on a Carolina night  
Drivin' my girl across the interstate line  
Got a preacher waitin' and that's how it's gonna be  
'Cause baby's got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on, got a hold on me  
Got a hold on, baby's got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on, got a hold on  
Got a hold on, baby's got a hold on me  
Baby's got a hold on me  
Baby's got a hold on me  
Baby's got a hold on me
