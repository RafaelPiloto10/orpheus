Said the world to the sun, "i must turn away,  
Cause my face is so ugly, I feel so ashamed  
Tell me where does the world go to hide?  
  
All the people down here, they fight everywhere  
They destroy and they poison  
They don't even care  
So where does the world go to hide?  
  
Nobody cares what will happen to me  
And nobody cares if I cry  
There must be a reason to carry on  
But the pain is so bad I could die  
  
Said the sun to the people, "now who is to blame?  
But like scared little children they all ran away  
But where can the world go to hide?  
  
Tell me where can the world go to hide?
