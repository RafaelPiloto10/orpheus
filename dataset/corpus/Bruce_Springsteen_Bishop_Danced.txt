Bishop danced with a thumbscrew woman  
Did a double-quick back flip and slid across the floor  
The Catholic traffic flowed freely 'cross the river  
And fiddlestick fiddled quick out the front door  
Oh baby dumpling, mama's in the back tree  
If the bow breaks mama might fall  
Little sad and only, baby don't be lonely  
Mama knows 'rithmatic, knows how to take a fall  
Mama knows 'rithmatic, knows how to take a fall  
  
And the kids are crying "Flapjacks, make 'em fat", early in the mornin'  
Little Jack, grab your hat, hear the breakfast call  
Muskrat, bat a cat, kick him in the fireplace  
There's someone in the kitchen blowing "Dinah" on their horn  
There's someone in the kitchen blowing "Dinah" like they're born  
  
Well maverick daddy got one-eyed bridge  
She glides like a monkey-mule kicking on the back slide  
Over hill, over hill, daddy don't you spill now  
Papa got a switch stick, he's pumping little Bill  
Papa got a switch stick, he's pumping little Bill  
And Billy, he's crying "Tomahawk, tomahawk, daddy better duck now"  
The Mohawks, the Mohawks, they're still out there in the woods  
Monatuk, Ocanuk, runnin' through my dreams now  
With fire on their fingertips and Indian screams  
With fire on their fingertips and feathers made of moonbeams  
  
Well early in the morning the cannoneer cried  
"I seen the sailor's warning in the western sky"  
Well mountain man, if you can, cut me down a fir tree  
Branches full of candlesticks for baby and me  
And my darling cried, she said "Honey, the weathervane  
Lately it's been pointing the way to heaven  
Scatterbrains, scatterbrains, watch out where you fall  
Champagne, champagne, a round for all the old choir boys  
They're busting off the altar chasing Dinah through the hall  
They're busting off the altar chasing Dinah through the hall
