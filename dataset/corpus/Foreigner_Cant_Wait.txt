I've been on this road a long time  
I've been travellin' for days  
But it seems I'm getting nowhere  
I just can't find my way  
I've been following directions  
But they must be out of date  
And I can't, and I can't, and I can't, no I can't  
Decide which road to take  
  
See I've got to find my baby  
Cause we need to work things out  
I've got to see that woman  
I cannot do without her!  
  
You know I can't wait, can't wait another moment  
I can't wait, I can't wait another heartbeat  
No I can't wait, can't wait another moment  
I couldn't wait another heartbeat  
I can't wait until midnight  
  
And the nights go on forever  
These days I get no sleep  
And I miss her more than ever  
Inside where love runs deep  
Oh I know I'm going to find her  
Cause I'm following this star  
And I can't, and I can't, no I can't turn back  
Oh lord, I've come so far  
  
And I'll know she'll whisper in my ear  
'Bout all the things I've missed  
She's got that way about her now  
I never could resist  
  
And now I can't wait, can't wait another moment  
No I can't wait, I can't wait another heartbeat  
I can't wait, can't wait another moment  
I couldn't wait another heartbeat  
I can't wait until midnight  
  
No I can't wait  
I can't wait another moment  
I couldn't wait another heartbeat  
I can't wait until the midnight  
  
Now I can't wait  
No no no can't wait  
No no no  
Can't wait  
No no no  
Can't wait
