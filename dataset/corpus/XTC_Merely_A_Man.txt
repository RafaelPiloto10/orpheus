Higher.  
  
I'm a king, yes, I'm a head of state.  
But I'm the kitchen boy who'll wash your dirty plate.  
I had no message and the message was,  
We're all Jesus, Buddha, and the Wizard of Oz.  
  
I'm merely a man,  
And I bring nothing but love for you.  
I'm merely a man,  
And I want nothing that you can't do.  
  
And you know it's true.  
That with logic and love we'll be lifting humanity higher.  
Higher.  
  
I'm all religious figures rolled into one,  
Gaddafy Duck propelled from Jimmy Swaggart's tommy gun.  
Don't promise rainbows with some golden pot,  
In fact what I can offer I know you've already got.  
  
I'm merely a man,  
And I bring nothing but love for you.  
I'm merely a man,  
And I want nothing that you can't do.  
  
And you know it's true.  
That with logic and love we'll have power enough,  
To raise consciousness up and for lifting humanity higher.  
Higher!  
  
And you know it's true.  
We should chase superstition and fear from our hearts,  
If we're going to survive and take levels of sanity higher.  
Kick it up...higher.  
  
I'm merely a man,  
And I bring nothing but love for you.  
I'm merely a man,  
And I want nothing that you can't do.  
  
And you know it's true.  
That with logic and love we'll have power enough,  
To raise consciousness up and for lifting humanity higher.
