You hiss and groan  
And you constantly moan  
But you don't ever go away  
And that's because all you need is me.  
  
You roll your eyes  
Up to the skies  
Mock horrified  
But you're still here  
All you need is me  
  
There's so much destruction  
All over the world  
And all you can do is complain about me  
  
You bang your head against the wall  
And say you're sick of it all  
Yet, you remain  
'Cause all you need is me  
  
And then you offer your one and only joke  
And ask me "What will I be,  
When I grow up to be a man"?  
  
Me? Nothing!  
  
There's a soft voice  
Singing in your head  
Who can this be?  
I do believe it's me  
  
There's a naked man standing  
Laughing in your dreams  
You know who it is  
But you don't like what it means  
  
There's so much destruction  
All over the world  
And all you can do is complain about me  
  
I was a small fat child in a welfare house  
There was only one thing I ever dreamed about  
Fate has just handed it to me  
  
Whoopee!  
  
You don't like me but you love me,  
Either way you're wrong  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
  
You don't like me but you love me,  
Either way you're wrong  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
