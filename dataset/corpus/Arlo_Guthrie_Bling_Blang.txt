You get a hammer and I'll get a nail  
And you catch a bird and I'll catch a snail  
You bring a board and I'll bring a saw  
And we'll build a house for the baby-o  
CHORUS  
Bling, Blang, hammer with my hammer  
Zingo, Zango, cutting with my saw  
Bling, Blang, hammer with my hammer  
Zingo, Zango, cutting with my saw  
I'll grab some mud and you grab some clay  
So when it rains it won't wash away  
We'll build a house that'll be so strong  
The winds will sing my baby a song  
CHORUS  
Run bring rocks and I'll bring bricks  
A nice pretty house we'll build and fix  
We'll jump inside when the cold wind blows  
And kiss our little baby-o  
CHORUS  
You bring a ladder and I'll get a box  
Build our house of bricks and blocks  
When the snowbird flies and the honeybee comes  
We'll feed our baby on honey in the comb  
CHORUS
