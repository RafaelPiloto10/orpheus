I've got some good news, can't wait to tell you.  
I realized I missed you, since we've been apart.  
I just needed time,  
To make up my mind,  
But I'm in love with you with all my heart.  
I've got some good news.  
  
I got some bad news, I don't know how to break to you.  
I found someone new since we been apart.  
I had too much time,  
An' he took you off my mind,  
An' I'm in love with him with all of my heart.  
I got some bad news.  
  
An' I guess all is fair in love an' war:  
Someone wins,  
But someone wins more.  
You never know what time will do.  
All I know is I've got some good news.  
I've got some bad news.
