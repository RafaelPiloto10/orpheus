[Chorus - 2x]  
All my niggas stay alive in this dirty game  
Niggas working 9 to 5 in this dirty game  
But all my niggas gone survive in this dirty game  
Because we pack a 45 in this dirty game  
[Z-Ro]  
Everyday my mind is set on money making ways  
Even kick in doors, I can't be broke in money making days  
I can't get no job in a white man's world that's why I live so raw  
I can't watch my children starve homeboy so watch me break the law  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Ramon noodles, t.v. dinners ain't no way to live  
Rather be holding slab while grabbing grain rolling airport load for sive  
In the streets of Houston Texas hustlers living in the cuts  
On a mission chasing paper got no time for gold digging hoes get off my nuts  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
I'm turning suicidal in my older age, this game'll freeze you to death  
And eveyrday I face the coldest stage  
Tell me does every nigga that's thugging got to struggle to bubble  
And so I'm ready to laugh successfully you don't want no troule  
Cause I'm living more rugged than rougher than the rockiest road  
I'm paronoid for life, got to keep a glock in the load  
Am I addicited to caine (watch that tooting line)  
Could it be a nigga that's hard to locate is somebody you could find  
Z-Ro, certified platinum on a million dollar paper chase  
Pulling up next to the police and blowing this weed in they face  
But they try to blow my high when I'm on this hyper toiliking weed  
But I'm gonna slice skills with hands that'll make you vomet and bleed  
Aunte be worrying about me so I'm trying to get her to smile  
But I know she know I'm wanted dead or alive  
Got to keep my mind on my money making maneuvers cause my hustle is strong  
A lot of fools get lazy now they hustle is gone  
But I'm a hustler for life  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro talking]  
Nigga hell yeah, know what I'm saying  
Bridgemont Texas baby coming straight at you  
Motherfucking 199 motherfucking 7  
For real we ain't even gone play with you nigga  
We coming so motherfucking real  
Bridge man hustlers on the corner selling cheese  
Trying to stack g's, got to pay my motherfucking bills nigga
