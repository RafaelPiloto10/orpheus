If I should stay  
I would only be in your way  
So, I'll go but I know  
I'll think of you  
  
Each step of the way  
And I will always love you  
And I will always love you  
Bittersweet memories,  
  
That is all I am taking with me  
So goodbye, please don't you cry  
'Cause we both know I'm not what you need  
And I will always love you  
And I will always love you  
  
I hope life treats you kind  
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of  
And I wish you joy and happiness  
But above all, I wish you love  
  
And I will always love you  
And I will always love you  
And I will always love you
