Well, I'm looking at you  
And I'm wondering what you're gonna do  
Looks like you got no friends  
No one to stick with you till the end  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep 'em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good  
  
Yes, you think you're all right,  
And now you're lonely every night  
Well, you need a friend  
Someone on whom you can always depend  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep 'em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good  
  
Yes, you need some advice  
Well, let me put it to you nice  
I said you need a friend  
Someone who'll stick with you to the end  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep 'em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good
