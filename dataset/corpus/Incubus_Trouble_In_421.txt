The evening began as a positive swaret  
And my abode was 4-2-0 G.  
But little did I know that in the very next apartment  
There'd be trouble on the brew for me!  
Ubiquitous I wish I could be  
Because the clock cuts short my own day!  
  
One hundred things to do before I rest my sore ass  
Upon the cushion that supports my array!  
Can this be?  
Trouble!  
So if I may, slip you a tip.  
You'd best stay away from 4-2-1.  
Trouble!  
  
So get high the green way.  
So get by the green way, yes!  
I knocked upon their door  
In hopes of bidding them their welcome  
And instead I was caught by an eye.  
His pupil was wide open  
  
Kinda like a liquor barn at 3:00.  
It was indoubadoubly dose derived.  
It was then that they took me  
And shined their light between my eyes.  
  
He said "What are ya new?  
Why are you here? What's the catch?  
Why not explain in clear? Why you're peaking around?"  
I wish I could've just kept to my own.  
  
My hospitality has been too well spent and I've paid my rent!  
I should've kept my thoughts, on who might've been inside  
So that my mind could sit and delude my pride!  
I beg my common sense to keep my  
Neighbor out away from my front door  
  
Until I find a way  
To hide myself from those in 4-2-1, one  
..one away from the good one.
