And you know it's time to go  
Through the sleet and driving snow  
Across the fields of mourning  
Light in the distance  
  
And you hunger for the time  
Time to heal, desire, time  
And your earth moves beneath  
Your own dream landscape  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
On borderland we run  
  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
Tonight  
A high road  
A high road out from here  
  
The city walls are all come down  
The dust, a smoke screen all around  
See faces ploughed like fields that once  
Gave no resistance  
  
And we live by the side of the road  
On the side of a hill  
As the valley explode  
Dislocated, suffocated  
The land grows weary of its own  
  
Oh, oh, oh on borderland we run  
And still we run  
We run and don't look back  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
Tonight  
Tonight  
  
I'll be there tonight I believe  
I'll be there somehow  
I'll be there tonight  
Tonight  
  
The wind will crack in winter time  
This bomb-blast lightning waltz  
No spoken words, just a scream  
  
Tonight we'll build a bridge  
Across the sea and land  
See the sky, the burning rain  
She will die and live again  
Tonight  
  
And your heart beats so slow  
Through the rain and fallen snow  
Across the fields of mourning  
Light's in the distance  
  
Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep  
For tonight, at last  
I am coming home  
I am coming home
