All babies together, everyone one a seed  
Half of us are satisfied, half of us in need  
Love's bountiful in us, tarnished by our greed  
Oh when will there be a harvest for the world? A nation planted so concerned
with gain  
As the seasons come and go greater grows the pain  
Far too many feeling the strain  
Oh when will there be a harvest for the world?  
  
Gather every man  
Gather every woman  
Celebrate your lives  
Give thanks for your children  
Gather everyone  
Gather all together  
Overlooking none  
Hoping life gets better for the world  
When will there be a harvest for the world?  
  
Dress me up for battle when all I want is peace  
Those of us who pay the price come home with the least  
Nation after nation turning into beasts  
Oh when will there be a harvest for the world?
