My mom and daddy both say  
I must be crazy to be this infatuated  
But I know you know  
We got something special never felt before  
You get me going just looking at you  
And the feeling's not hard to recognize so  
Alright I'll come out in the open with it  
Will you walk out with me.  
  
Cause you're the first girl I've ever loved  
Tell me do you feel the same way  
Well I'll show you I'm not like all the rest  
Cause I know who I am  
  
Your skin is smooth as silk and your eyes like stars  
You're just like a picture book standing there  
But I can't go on  
No, I can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way that I do  
  
I'll be so careful I'll hold you like china  
I'll promise not to hurt you I'll hold you like china  
You won't feel nothing, I'll hold you like china  
Cause I know it's your first time  
  
Your mum and dad don't like me  
And they tell me every time I call around to see you  
I don't know why  
Cause I always straighten my tie and comb my hair  
I know your brother thinks that  
I'm a limp wristed wimp from the other side of town  
I know he's got me wrong  
Because I'm really not like that, I'll tell you why  
  
You're the first girl I've ever loved  
Tell me do you feel the same way  
Well I'll show you I'm not like all the rest  
Cause I know who I am  
  
I remember the very first time I held your hand  
And that was the last time you were so close to me  
But I can't go on  
No, I can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way as I do  
  
I'll be so careful I'll hold you like china  
I'll promise not to hurt you I'll hold you like china  
You won't feel nothing, I'll hold you like china  
Cause I know it's your first time  
  
I know you know and now I want to, I want to tell everybody  
I know you know and now I want them all to see
