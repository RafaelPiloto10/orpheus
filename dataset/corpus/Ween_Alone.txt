When the life inside no doubt has died  
And you've turn your head away  
You tried to pay, but at the end of the day, it's you again, alone  
  
Alone, confined the mess in your mind  
When you can't relate to them  
You've reaped and sown, but little is known by those who aren't alone  
  
Why should a man learn not again what he has learned before?  
He's overcome but must succumb to what he's living for  
  
He tried and tried all those survived he missed, he's fallen short  
The little known, his heart of stone, will make him feel alone
