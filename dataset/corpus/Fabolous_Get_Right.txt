You're lookin' just a little too hard at me  
Standin' just a little too close to me,  
You're sayin' not quite enough to me,  
You're sippin' just a little too slow for me  
No doubt you're playing real cool homie  
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?  
Tripping (tripping) a little more than I should be  
So let yourself go and get right with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right  
Before the night is up,  
We can get right, we can get right, we can get right,  
I'm about to fill you're cup, we can get right,  
Before the night is up,  
We can get right, tonight, we can get right  
  
You're lips, talking bout I play too much,  
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants,  
My hips, moving oh so slow, (so slow)  
Bar tab looking like a condo, (condo)  
All I need is you here right by my side  
Take whatever you want, baby let's ride,  
And whatever you won't do, let me decide,  
Just put you're name on the dotted line,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge:]  
So much we've got to say, but so little time,  
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind,  
(don't leave this love behind)  
Baby, take my hand, I'll show you why  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right  
Before the night is up,  
We can get right, we can get right, we can get right,  
I'm about to fill you're cup,  
(we can get right,  
Before the night is up,  
We can get right, we can get right)
