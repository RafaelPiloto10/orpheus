Maybe it's just those same old things  
Maybe it's just a waste of time  
This reminds me so much of the day you said goodbye  
And as you walked away still I would not admit  
you were right, you were right  
But then now it's a different state of things  
Maybe it's more than I can take  
'Cause it seems like the world's against me now  
And I need someone to show me how  
But I still can't admit you were right, you were right  
and I was wrong  
Maybe I could change  
Maybe I could change the world  
Maybe I could change myself  
Maybe I could change the world  
Maybe I could have your love  
I've been holding my hopes so high  
But can't you help me now, my arms are so tired  
And maybe they made the world that way  
Maybe it's just a waste of time  
Just like me, they turn the other way  
And just like me, can't bring themselves to say  
Now I know the mistakes that I have made  
And if I try and if it's not too late  
Then I can maybe admit you were right,  
you were right, and I was wrong
