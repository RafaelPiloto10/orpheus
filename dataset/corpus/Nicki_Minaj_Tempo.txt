Cymphonique, I'm in the house  
A. K. A. Little miss Swagger  
This for my soldier girls  
Where all my soldier boys?, tempo  
  
You the one, yeah the one  
The only one my heart beats for  
I don't know how to call it  
Crazy how you've got me going  
You're not the average one  
Your swagger, your style  
You got me caught in a dream  
Let me sleep, I don't wanna wake up  
I see you in the corner of my eye  
Sometimes I just don't understand why  
  
Because you change up my  
You change up my  
I don't know what you done to me  
Make my heart wanna skip a beat and I like it  
  
You change up my  
You change up my  
I don't know what you done to me  
Make my heart wanna skip a beat and I like it  
  
Where you at, where you at, where you at?  
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back  
Where you at, where you at, where you at?  
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back  
  
You the truth, you the one  
You're a star, yes you are  
The way you dress, the way you shine  
Mama warned me about your kind  
I see you in the corner of my eye  
Sometimes I just don't understand why  
  
You change up my  
You change up my  
  
I don't know what you done to me  
Make my heart wanna skip a beat and I like it  
  
You change up my  
You change up my  
I don't know what you done to me  
Make my heart wanna skip a beat and I like it  
  
[Nicki Minaj:]Why you doing this, why you doing this to me?  
I am Lewinsky, I don't be doing this for free  
I mean I am her, I mean I am her  
I just came out of the fly fly, flying spur  
I mean I was just looking for a shh to the D-boys  
Stay around the key like the key to the keyboard  
Anyway I'm back, I had to jump off that  
Just jumped off the beach, I'm back on track  
Ha ha ha ha ha, had to laugh on this one  
You know I had to go and show my ass on this one  
Linked up with Cymphonique, Little miss Swagger

Get the wizard of oz, got me clicking my feet  
Cause he got my heart skip skip, skipping a beat  
  
[Cymphonique:]You change up my  
You change up my  
I don't know what you done to me  
Make my heart wanna skip a beat and I like it  
  
That's why you're my soldier boy  
That's why I'm your soldier girl  
I don't know what you done to me  
Make my heart wanna skip a beat and I like it
