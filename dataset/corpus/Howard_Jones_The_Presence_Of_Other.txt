This time, it's different  
Be sure, I mean it  
Can't go on trading on ideas that I just don't own  
A life with some meaning, a life with some sense  
I want, to blame you  
Give you, my power  
I keep it all on the inside, keep it locked in the dark  
I keep it all on the inside, keep it locked in the dark  
People telling me it's not my responsibility  
But it is my problem and it's my life, my life  
I must believe the solutions, to the problems, are in my hands  
  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it presents  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
  
Slow down, just talk  
Sit down, right here  
Must be an answer to the question of birth and death  
A world with some meaning  
A world with some peace  
Inside, it's turbulent, outside, reflects it  
Hear you knockin' on the inside  
Hear me breathe answer please  
Hear you knockin' on the inside  
Hear you breathe answer me  
People telling me what they think that I should be  
Only thing that I can be is myself, myself  
I must believe in my choices to create value out of everything  
  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it presents  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it offers  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
  
This time, it's different  
I'm sure I mean it  
Slow down, just listen  
It's my life, it's my life
