Don't wanta walk unless I'm walkin' with you  
Don't wanta talk unless I'm talkin' to you  
Don't wanta be lonesome, don't wanta be blue  
Baby, that's how much I love you  
  
Don't wanta cry unless I'm cryin' for you  
Don't wanta sigh unless I'm sighin' for you  
Don't wanta be found with somebody new  
Baby, that's how much I love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I built my whole world around you  
Darlin', don't ever break my heart  
I'm so glad that I found you  
And in my life, you'll always play a part  
  
Don't want to live unless I'm livin' with you  
Don't want to give unless I'm givin' to you  
Don't want to be lonesome, don't wanta be blue  
Baby, that's how much I love you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't wanta live unless I'm livin' with you  
Don't wanta give unless I'm givin' to you  
Don't wanta be lonesome, don't wanta be blue  
Baby, that's how much I love you  
  
Baby, that's how much I love you
