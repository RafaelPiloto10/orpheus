Judds, Bye Bye Baby Blues  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh, I'm missin' you  
I've got those bye-bye, bye-bye baby blues  
Ooh ain't much to do  
Just sing those bye-bye, bye-bye baby blues  
  
Havin' the blues, hatin' to loose  
Guess I got a lot to learn  
All of my friends have lost now and then  
I guess it's just my turn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me the first, hurt you the worst  
And time is your best friend  
But when you're this sad and hurtin' this bad  
How do you love again?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bye-bye, bye-bye baby blues
