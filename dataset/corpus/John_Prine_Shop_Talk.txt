I seen you in your pajamas  
Drinking coffee at the house of pies  
You was flipping for the check  
And talking like your tongue was paralyzed  
You were saying something  
That I don't understand  
Bout looking other places  
While you're holding my hand  
Let's stop  
Let's not  
Talk shop  
In front of all these guys  
Chorus:  
Let's not  
Talk shop  
Shop talk  
Shop talk is talking something  
That you don't realize  
Loose lips sink ships, shake hips  
Bad tips draw spies  
I want you when I can get you  
But you only want me on the rise  
Well I thought I had your number  
But your number's too loud  
Now you're standing on the table  
And we're drawing a crowd  
Let's stop  
Let's not  
Talk shop  
In front of all these spies
