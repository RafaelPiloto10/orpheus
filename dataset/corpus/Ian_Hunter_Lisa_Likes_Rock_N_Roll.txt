There's a wango-tango  
At the peppermint inn  
I'm gonna be there  
Shakin' my thing  
Be bop a lula  
Little Peggy Sue  
We both got company  
Don't know what to do  
But that's alright  
Yeah that's OK  
In the middle of the night  
Here's Lisa  
  
[Chorus]  
Lisa likes rock 'n' roll,  
She plays it every day.  
Down by the drugstore  
Everybody ??  
She turnin' on the radio,  
She's shootin' up the stereo,  
Puttin' on a video,  
She's sayin' let's go let's go  
  
Lisa won't marry me,  
She says she's only four.  
Her mum don't like me,  
She says I'm too mature.  
Down at the disco,  
I go solo  
And the girls don't want to know,  
I've been too slow.  
And that's alright,  
And that's OK,  
In the middle of the night.  
Here's Lisa.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when you see her  
You wish you could ?? her.  
Ain't no one can beat her.  
She goes yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah,
