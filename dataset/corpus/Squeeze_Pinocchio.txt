Swallow me say swallow me  
Take me to your nest of china dolls  
Call me up your closest friend  
Join me in my neighbourhood patrol  
Happy me say happy me  
Chinese whispers bounce from ear to ear  
The night is young I feel so old  
See the stars above the night's so clear  
I used to come home late and lie, lie, lie  
She used to see through that but still I tried  
I couldn't cover up the tracks I'd made  
That's how it used to be but not today  
  
Race around I race around  
Focused on the here and now with you  
Every smile's a valentine  
What harm can a little loving do  
Fall about then fall about  
Drunk on love I can't stand on my feet  
Before I try please take my hand  
I've so many words left I should eat  
  
Tickle me please tickle me  
Laughter climbs the walls above our bed  
This night we have is built on love  
Help me so I do not lose the thread  
  
Swallow me say swallow me  
Happy me say happy me  
Race around I race around  
Fall about then fall about  
Tickle me say tickle me  
Love me do sing love me do
