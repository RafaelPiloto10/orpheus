From a distance, the world looks blue and green,  
And the snow capped mountains white.  
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream,  
And the eagle takes to flight.  
From a distance, there is harmony,  
And the echo through the land.  
It's the voice of hope,  
It's the voice of peace,  
It's the voice of every man.  
From a distance, we all have enough,  
And no one is in need.  
And there are no guns, no bombs and no diseases,  
No hungry mouths to feed.  
From a distance, we are instruments,  
Matching in a common band,  
Playing songs of hope,  
Playing songs of peace,  
There is the song of every man.  
God is watching us, God is watching us,  
God is watching us, from a distance,  
Ohh God is watching us....... From a distance.  
From a distance, you look like my friend, even though we're at war.  
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend, what all this fighting is for?  
It's the hope of?, it's the love of all, it's the heart of every man.  
It's the hope of?, it's the love of all, it is the song of every man.  
Oh.. God is watching us, God is watching us..... From a distance
