Show me the way  
To make you feel right  
Never hesitate  
To give some room for me  
Show me the way  
Into your heart tonight  
And I'll be there for you  
My love...girl, anytime  
So many times it seems  
Through thick and thin we've been  
Bumpin' around, messin' ground  
Almost have called it quits  
But love is always on top of it all  
Thicker and stronger we go  
'Coz we made a vow to show us  
How we're for one another  
You know how much  
I care for all the things you are  
I'm so devoted to you  
Show me the way  
To make you feel right  
Never hesitate  
To give some room for me  
Show me the way  
Into your heart tonight  
And I'll be there for you  
My love...girl, anytime  
If you'll just close your eyes  
And maybe realize  
We're runnin' around, losin' ground  
Leaving your cares behind  
But life's full of uncertainties  
Stress in big quantities  
We make mistakes, losin' our faith  
But babe it's never too late  
If we just focus to live and love  
We will conquer the pain  
And have everything to gain  
Show me the way  
To make you feel right  
Never hesitate  
To give some room for me  
Show me the way  
Into your heart tonight  
And I'll be there for you  
My love...girl, anytime  
If you care, if you're aware  
I'm pourin' myself on you  
If you dare this love we'll share  
Send away the blues babe  
Big inside my heart  
There's just one name, it's you  
Babe babe, babe  
(Just show me the way)  
RAP:  
Uhh uhh uhh uhh  
Come on baby  
Just show me the way  
U gotta give me some direction once a while in a day  
I can't do this alone-ac
