I was trying hard to win  
Save the world and be the king  
I was out there in the race  
Trying hard to force the pace  
Fool's gold fooled me too  
Bright and shiny looked brand new  
Fool's gold broke my heart  
Shone so brightly then fell apart  
I was locked in bitter strife  
Fighting monsters all of my life  
I was out to break the pledge  
Force myself across the edge  
Fools gold bitter sting  
Broken promise hollow ring  
Fool's gold cast the die  
Broken promise empty lie
