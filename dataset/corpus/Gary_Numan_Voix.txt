I don't like young girls  
I don't like boys  
I like some bitch to scare me  
I like that noise  
I don't like secrets  
I don't like God  
I don't like people  
When they say I'm things I'm not  
I don't need opinions and rumours  
I don't need a voix in the dark  
I don't need to listen to strangers  
I don't need to tear out my heart  
One stranger  
One heartbeat  
One love is  
Forever  
One picture  
One morning  
One tear lasts  
Forever  
I like this motion  
I like this heat  
I like this breathing  
And I know I like this beat  
I like your whispers  
I like your screams  
I like your lies  
And I'm sure I'd like your dreams  
You don't need opinions and rumours  
You don't need a voix in the dark  
You don't need to listen to strangers  
You don't need to tear out your heart  
I'll show you pictures  
I'll make you cry  
I'll show you things you've done  
And then I'll ask you why  
I don't need heroes  
I don't need this name  
I don't need favours  
And I know I don't need fame  
We don't need opinions and rumours  
We don't need a voix in the dark  
We don't need to listen to strangers  
We don't need to tear out our hearts  
One reason  
One secret  
One lie is  
Forever  
One nightmare  
One rumour  
Your shame is  
Forever
