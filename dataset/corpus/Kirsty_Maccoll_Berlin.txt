Berlin  
Love the sight and love the sound  
I wish that I could stick around  
Berlin  
You never laid a mark on me  
Well you're no gent if you know what I mean  
Berlin  
Come and get your body fried  
And see the wall electrified  
Berlin  
No rewards and no regrets  
They're bricked up till the kids forget  
Berlin  
Climb at night and see the lights  
Take your aim and set your sights  
Berlin  
Give me the reason  
There is no answer  
You ask her why  
She is a strange dancer  
Come and get your body fried  
And see the wall electrified  
Berlin  
Give me the reason  
There is no answer  
You want a reason  
Blood is a reason  
No rewards and no regrets  
They're bricked up till the kids forget  
Berlin  
Five nights I nearly ...  
... yourselves in ...  
And watch the boys as they go by  
Berlin  
Give me the reason  
There is no answer  
You ask her why  
She is a strange dancer  
Love the sight and love the sound  
I wish that I could stick around  
Berlin  
Give me the reason  
There is no answer  
You want a reason  
Blood is a reason  
You never laid a mark on me  
Well you're no gent if you know what I mean  
Berlin
