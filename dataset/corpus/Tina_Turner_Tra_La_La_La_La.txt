Walking along

'Cause I'm so blue

Baby, here without you

Oh, singing  
(Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)  
Tra, la, la, la, la  
(Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)  
Tra, la, la  
(Tra, la, la, la, la, la, tra, la, la, la, la, la, la)  
Now I love you so  
(I love you so)  
And no, no, no, nobody knows  
(Nobody knows)  
The way you make me feel  
(You make me feel)  
Oh, I get such a thrill  
(I get such a thrill)  
Oh, I keep on singing  
(Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)  
Tra, la, la, la, la

Tra, la, la  
(Tra, la, la, la, la, la, tra, la, la, la, la, la, la)  
I feel so bad  
(Feel so bad)  
I'm here all alone  
(Here all alone)  
I'm hoping that you  
(Hoping that you)  
Hurry back home  
(Hurry back home)  
Oh, I keep on singing  
(Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)  
Tra, la, la, la, la  
(Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)  
Tra, la, la
