Oh, rain, well, in your dreams, rain, right  
Go up and rain when you're flying  
You don't know what you don't know  
You know what you don't know  
And you know what you know  
Why rain?  
But you're evil  
I have deep confidence in me  
Rain, but sure is rain  
I won't go away from you  
Oh, I am the devil, I am rain  
The devil hides in you, to play again  
Oh yeah God  
Sometimes I'll sleep on it  
This life I would maybe think to hang it up in the cupboard  
And hope for something better  
But alright... Now it fades away into nothing, baby, baby, baby
