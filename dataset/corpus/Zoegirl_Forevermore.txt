Oh, God, in Your perfection Your love confounds the wise  
Sinners are made heroes, and the humble lifted high  
Unchained hearts are singing out  
Songs that reach the sky  
  
Lift up your eyes to the One who reigns  
Lift up your hands, oh sweet surrender it brings  
Forevermore, You are holy  
Forevermore, You are worthy  
  
In Your light we see light, in Your eyes we shine  
You give strength and justice, and the broken are made right  
Sinners, saints, and angels sing  
Songs that reach the sky  
  
All my life, all that I hope  
It rests inside Your plan  
Your love, Your grace, Your truth alone  
Forevermore will stand  
  
You have called me Your redeemed  
And hidden me in the shadow of Your wings  
Peace like a river  
Joy like a fountain flows wherever You go
