A little baby told God,  
'Hey, I'm kinda scared,  
Don't really know if I wanna go down there,  
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball  
But that's a great big place, and I'm so small.  
  
Why can't I just stay here with you?  
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too? '  
And God said, 'Oh child, of course I do,  
But there's somebody special that's waiting for you  
  
So hush now, baby, don't you cry  
Because there's someone down there waiting  
Whose only goal in life  
Is making sure you're always gonna be all right  
A loving angel, tender, tough, and strong  
Come on, child, it's time to meet your mom  
  
Now, when she's talking to you  
Make sure you listen close  
Because she's gonna teach you everything  
You'll ever need to know  
  
Like how to mind your manners  
To love and laugh and dream  
And she'll put you on the path  
That'll bring you back to me  
  
So hush now, little baby, don't you cry  
Because there's someone down there waiting  
Whose only goal in life  
Is making sure you're always gonna be all right  
A loving angel, tender, tough, and strong  
Come on, child, it's time to meet your mom
