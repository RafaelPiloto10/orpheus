ANSWER ME OH MY LOVE  
JUST WHAT SIN HAVE I BEEN GUILTY OF  
TELL ME HOW I CAME TO LOSE YOUR LOVE  
PLEASE ANSWER ME MY LOVE  
  
YOU WERE MINE YESTERDAY  
I BELIEVED THAT LOVE WAS HERE TO STAY  
WON'T YOU TELL ME WHERE I'VE GONE ASTRAY  
PLEASE ANSWER ME MY LOVE  
  
IF YOU'RE HAPPIER WITHOUT ME  
I'LL TRY NOT TO CARE  
BUT IF YOU STILL THINK ABOUT ME  
PLEASE LISTEN TO MY PRAYER  
  
YOU MUST KNOW I'VE BEEN TRUE  
WON'T YOU SAY THAT WE CAN START ANEW  
IN MY SORROW NOW I TURN TO YOU  
PLEASE ANSWER ME MY LOVE
