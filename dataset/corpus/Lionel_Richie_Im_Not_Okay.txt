My heart's your heart  
My love your love  
And I am not okay  
Unless you're okay  
  
I've seen what you're facing  
Please don't be alarmed  
If you need me just call me  
You're never alone  
Hey, I'm barely sleepin'  
I'm barely eating  
Until the rain turns into change  
  
My heart's your heart  
My love your love  
And I am not okay  
Unless you're okay  
And my mind is your mind  
An my soul is your soul  
And I am not okay  
Unless you're okay  
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, oh yeah  
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, oh yeah  
  
I'm headed wherever you're going  
And I mean that from my heart  
In the end you'll see that I've been there from the start  
I'm not walking away  
Not talkin' just to say  
Your pain's my pain  
And, uh, your gain's my gain  
  
I wanna be right here  
To make sure your tears don't form a river  
I'm gonna be right here  
Until you're vision becomes clearer  
I ain't sleepin'  
I'm not eatin'  
Until the rain turns into change  
  
My heart's your heart  
My love your love  
And I am not okay  
Unless you're okay  
And my mind is your mind  
An my soul is your soul  
And I am not okay  
Unless you're okay  
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, oh yeah  
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, oh yeah
