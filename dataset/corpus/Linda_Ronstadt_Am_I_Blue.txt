Am I blue, am I blue?  
Ain't these tears in my eyes telling you?  
Am I blue? You would be too  
If each plan with your man just fell through  
  
Was a time, I was his only one  
Now I'm the sad and lonely one  
Ooh, was I gay till today?  
Now he's gone and we're through, am I blue?  
  
Was a time I was the only one  
Now I'm the sad and lonely one  
Ooh, was I gay till today?  
Now he's gone and we're through, am I blue, am I blue?  
  
Ooh ho, am I blue?
