When you're up against a struggle that shatters all your dreams  
And your hopes have been cruelly crushed by Satan's manifested schemes  
And you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fears  
Don't let the faith you're standing in, seem to disappear  
  
Praise the Lord, He can work through those who praise Him  
Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise  
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seems to bind you  
Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you  
When you praise Him  
  
Now Satan is a liar and he wants to make us think, that we are paupers  
When he knows himself we're children of the King  
So lift up the mighty shield of faith for the battle must be won  
We know that Jesus Christ has risen so the work's already done  
  
Praise the Lord, He can work through those who praise Him  
Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise  
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you  
Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you  
When you praise Him  
  
Praise the Lord, He can work through those who praise Him  
Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise  
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seems to bind you  
Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you  
When you praise Him  
  
Praise Him, praise Him  
When you praise Him  
When you praise Him  
When you praise the Lord
