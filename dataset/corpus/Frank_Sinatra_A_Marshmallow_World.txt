It's a marshmallow world  
In the winter  
When the snow  
Comes to cover the ground  
It's the time for play  
It's a whipped cream day  
I wait for it all year round  
Those are marshmallow clouds  
Being friendly  
In the arms  
Of the evergreen trees  
And the sun is red  
Like a pumpkin head  
It's shining  
So your nose won't freeze  
The world is your snowball  
See how it grows  
That's how it goes  
Whenever it snows  
The world is your snowball  
Just for a song  
Get out and roll it along  
  
It's a yum-yummy world  
Made for sweethearts  
Take a walk  
With your favorite girl  
It's a sugar date  
What if spring is late  
In winter  
It's a marshmallow world  
  
The world is your snowball  
See how it grows  
That's how it goes  
Whenever it snows  
The world is your snowball  
Just for a song  
Get out and roll it along  
It's a yum-yummy world  
Made for sweethearts  
Take a walk  
With your favorite girl  
It's a sugar date  
What if spring is late  
In winter  
It's a marshmallow world  
In winter  
It's a marshmallow world  
In winter  
It's a marshmallow world
