Red rain is coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
Pouring down all over me  
  
I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream  
I cannot make a single sound as you scream  
It can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch  
We touch, this place is so quiet, sensing that storm  
  
Red rain is coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
Pouring down all over me  
  
Well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town  
They tell you that this rain can sting, and look down  
There is no blood around, see no sign of pain  
Hay ay ay no pain  
Seeing no red at all, see no rain  
  
Red rain is coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
Pouring down all over me  
  
Red rain  
Ohhhh  
Putting the pressure on much harder now  
To return again and again  
Just let the red rain splash you  
Let the rain fall on your skin  
I come to you defenses down  
With the trust of a child  
  
Red rain is coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
Pouring down all over me  
  
And I can't watch any more  
No more denial  
It's so hard to lay down in all of this  
  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
I'm bathing in  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain is falling down  
Red rain is coming down all over me  
I'm begging you  
  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain coming down  
  
Over me in the red red sea  
Over me  
Over me  
Red rain
