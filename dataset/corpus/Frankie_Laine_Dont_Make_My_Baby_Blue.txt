I know that I can't keep her  
Now she's in love with you (ah ah ah)  
But I just wanna say  
I won't be far away  
So don't make my baby blue  
  
I know your reputation  
They say you can't be true (ah ah ah)  
But I'll be standing by  
So you just better try  
And don't make my baby blue  
  
Ooh that little girl's an angel  
And it hurts to  
Set her free  
So you better take  
Good care of her  
'Cause she still means  
The world to me  
  
I'm gonna step aside now  
Just like she wants me to (ah ah ah)  
But even though I'm gone  
I'll still be looking on  
So don't make my baby blue  
  
But even though I'm gone  
I'll still be looking on  
So don't make my baby blue  
No don't make my baby blue
