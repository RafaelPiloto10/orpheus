In cuttin' and haulin' in frost and in snow  
We're up against troubles that few people know  
It's only by courage and patience and grit  
And eatin' plain food that we keep ourselves fit  
The hard and the easy we take as they come  
And when ponds freeze over we shorten our runs  
To hurry my haulin' with spring coming on  
I near lost me a mare out on Tickle Cove Pond  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
I knew that the ice grew weaker each day  
But still took the risk and kept haulin' away  
One evening in April, bound home with a load  
My mare showed some halting against the ice road  
She knew more than I did as matters turned out  
Been lucky for me had I joined her in doubt  
She turned round her head with tears in her eyes  
As if she was sayin', you're risking our lives  
  
All this I ignored with a whip-handle blow  
For man is a stupid dumb creature you know  
And the very next moment the pond gave a sigh  
And up to our necks went poor Kitty and I  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
And if I had taken wise Kitty's advice  
I ne'er would have made that shortcut on the ice  
Poor creature she's dead, poor creature she's gone  
I'll ne'er get my mare out of Tickle Cove Pond  
  
I raised an alarm you could hear for a mile  
And neighbors showed up in a very short while  
You can always rely on the Oldfords and Whites  
To render assistance in all your bad plights  
To help a kind neighbor is part of their lives  
The same can be said for their children and wives  
And with the rope fastened around the mare's breast  
William White for a shanty song made a request  
There was no time for thinkin', no time for delay  
Straight from his heart came this song right away  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond  
  
Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White  
Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might  
Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can  
And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond
