Maybe it's because I'm only starting  
That I think it won't take too long  
Maybe it's because I can see you laughing  
That I think you've got it wrong  
Maybe I could be like Robin Hood  
Like and outlaw dressed all in green  
Someone said what's he gonna turn out like  
And someone else said never mind  
Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old  
As all the cats I'd ever seen  
I grew my hair and bought a suit  
Of shiny white or was it cream  
I shook and shivered danced and quivered  
And stood on a mountain top  
  
No one came from miles around and said  
Man your music is really hot  
  
Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak  
My throat was tired and worn  
My pretty face just looked out of place  
As they poured on the scorn  
I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king  
He said my boy we'll have some crazy scenes  
There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about  
He must've been the king of queens  
Well I could write a million songs about the things I've done  
But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung  
There's a law for the rich and one for the poor  
And there's another one for sing  
It's die young and live much longer  
Spend your money and sit and wonder  
  
No one came for miles around  
And said man your music is really funky  
  
I believe that I must tell the truth  
And say things as they really are  
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth  
Could I ever be a star  
Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'  
Everyone's shouting out loud  
It's only the glitter and shine that gets through  
Where's my Robin Hood outfit  
Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye  
No one ever cared enough to say goodbye  
The money's good and the time you have  
Fun and games galore  
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten  
And you wonder what you did it for  
  
No one came from miles around  
And said man who's he?
