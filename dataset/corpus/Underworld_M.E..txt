(anatano yume ni watashi wo tamoteru)  
Can you hold me in your dreams  
(watashi wo kanjiru koto ga dekiruno  
Watashi ga anata wo kanjiru youni)  
Can you feel me like I feel you  
(anatano yume ni watashi wo tamoteru)  
Can you hold me in your dreams  
(anatano yume ni watashi wo tamoteru)  
Can you hold me in your dreams  
(watashi wo kanjiru koto ga dekiruno  
Watashi ga anata wo kanjiru youni)  
Can you feel me like I feel you  
Goodbye mother earth  
Goodgoodbye mother earth  
Can you feel me like I feel you  
I don't want to kill time  
I want it to live  
I'm not wasting this life  
I'm letting it in  
You  
Just rip off the planet  
And take what you want  
I'm  
Coming to get you  
If you give up  
Beautiful destination  
What's it worth  
Beautiful destination  
Goodbye mother earth  
I  
Am all that surrounds you  
The earth and the sky  
You  
You're the mouth and the money  
That's bleeding me dry  
Why  
I am not a spirit of the world  
I heal the spirit of the world  
I am not a spirit of the world  
Goodbye mother earth  
(kocchi da)  
Its a beautiful destination  
(kocchi da)  
For what its worth  
(kocchi da)  
A beautiful destination  
(kocchi da)  
Goodbye mother earth  
Its a beautiful destination  
For what its worth  
Its a beautiful destination  
Goodbye mother earth  
Its a beautiful destination  
For what its worth  
Its a beautiful destination  
Goodbye mother earth
