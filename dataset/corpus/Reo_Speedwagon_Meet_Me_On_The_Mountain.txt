I remember it well, that day last spring,  
When the snow lay deep on the mountain trails.  
It was winter's last showin' and our last fling  
Before returning to our lives in the valley.  
  
We pretended we were lost in the wilderness,  
And I pretended to be your guide.  
Our love was a play and you were the actress.  
We were two lonely people living out a dream.  
  
Oh, baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter is dying  
And the snow lay deep on the mountain trails.  
Maybe it's the spring putting thoughts in our heads.  
But baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter lays her head to rest.  
  
As the morning came, the feelings faded.  
They melted away with the dew.  
And if it hurt, I never felt it,  
'Cause I knew that you'd be leavin' me soon.  
  
Come on, baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter is dying  
And the snow lay deep on the mountain trails.  
Maybe it's the spring putting thoughts in our heads.  
But baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter lays her head to rest.
