Walk like a man  
And talk like a man  
Walk like a man baby  
You can call me your man  
  
A little girl asked me what am I gonna do  
When I get old and blue and worn clear through  
And I said by that time I'm gonna be in my prime  
I'm gonna strut like a cock until I'm 99  
  
I'm gonna walk like a man  
And talk like a man  
Walk like a man baby  
You can call me your man  
  
Sometimes I feel it's getting late  
In life all that settling down can wait  
Till my routine days all seem the same  
Right now I've got to get on out  
I've gotta make my day  
  
I'm gonna walk like a man  
And talk like a man  
Walk like a man baby  
You can call me your man  
  
Walk like a man  
And talk like a man  
Walk like a man baby  
You can call me your man
