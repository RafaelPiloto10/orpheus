Just one more mornin, I had to wake up with the blues.  
Pulled myself out of bed, yeah, put on my walkin shoes.  
And went up on the mountain, to see what I could see.  
The whole world was fallin, right down in front of me.  
  
'Cause I've a hunger for the dreams I'll never see, yeah, baby.  
Ah, help me baby, or, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah.  
  
Pull myself together, put on a new face.  
Climb down off the hilltop, baby, get back in the race.  
  
Lord, cause I've a hunger for dreams I'll never see, yeah, babe.  
Lord, help me baby, or, this will surely be the end of me, yeah.  
  
Pull myself together, put on a new face.  
Climb down off the hilltop, baby, and get back in the race.  
  
'Cause I've a hunger for the dreams I'll never see, yeah, baby.  
Ah, help me baby, or, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah.
