There she stood in the street  
Smiling from her head to her feet  
I said "Hey, what is this"  
Now baby, maybe she's in need of a kiss  
I said "Hey, what's your name baby"  
Maybe we can see things the same  
Now don't you wait or hesitate  
Let's move before they raise the parking rate  
  
All right now baby, it's all right now  
All right now baby, it's all right now  
  
I took her home to my place  
Watching every move on her face  
She said "Look, what's your game baby  
Are you tryin' to put me in shame?"  
I said "slow don't go so fast,  
Don't you think that love can last?"  
She said " Love, Lord above,  
Now you're tryin' to trick me in love"  
  
All right now baby, it's all right now  
All right now baby, it's all right now
