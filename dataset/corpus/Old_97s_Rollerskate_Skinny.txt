Rollerskate skinny and the terrible two's  
How can you have everything and nothing to lose?  
You and nobody see eye to eye  
You're gonna wake up with a ghost instead of a guy  
Bulletin board on the wall of a church  
Soaking up the city from a top-step perch  
You're gonna break down on a midnight date  
You're gonna curse this town, you're gonna run late  
You're pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
You're pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
Do you want to meet up at the Pickwood Bowl?  
We could knock nine down and leave one in the hole  
Wouldn't be here if the Athenia hadn't sunk  
Or if dear 'ol dad hadn't got so drunk  
Every other day is a kick in the shin  
Every other day it's like the day just went  
But you make it alright, you make it okay  
You make me sorta glad that I waited till today  
You're pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
You're pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
Rollerskate skinny and the terrible two's  
Two years in and it's time to choose  
Love feels good when it sits right down  
Puts its feet up on the table it and sends a bowl around  
Ain't nobody gonna see eye to eye  
With a girl who's only gonna stand collarbone high  
Rain's gonna come in fair-sized drips  
We're gonna go to heaven wearing paper-hat ships  
You're pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
You're pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
I believe in love but it don't believe in  
I believe in love but it don't believe in me  
I believe in love but it don't believe in me  
No it don't believe in  
Don't believe in
