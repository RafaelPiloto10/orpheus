Baby  
I can be your sweet baby  
When things get crazy  
Make sure you come and save me (save me)  
  
Lil' miss fast car  
I can really get far  
And don't break my heart  
Let's make out (Let's make out! Let's make out!)  
  
[Chorus]  
You can come take me away  
There's no pressure play all day  
Hold me tight and don't let go!  
Mmm Papa love you  
Mmm Papa love you  
You love it when I'm freakin' out  
Things get rough and there's no doubt  
You will always be there for me  
Mmm Papa love you  
Mmm Papa love you  
  
Stuck in  
The middle of it all  
To many people around me  
Can you hear me call?  
I look this way  
And you're not there  
If you dont mind  
My soul out there  
  
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papi  
Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi  
Mmm Luvi, Mmm Luvi, Mmm Papi  
  
(You will always be there for me)  
(You will always be there for me)  
  
You love it when I'm freakin' out  
Things get rough and there's no doubt  
You love it when I'm freakin' out  
Things get rough and there's no doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now see!  
I'm mommy!  
And that make you Papi!  
And that makes us Luvi!  
  
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa [Repeat: x3]
