Let me ride out on a tear  
Past your chin to Africa  
Once more to the she-lion's den  
Where I was at home back then  
Inbetween your tender long legs  
Searching snow from just last year  
Never does the snow appear  
Let me ride out on a tear  
In the clouds there is no bliss  
A big bird gently slides his head  
Back into a secret crevice  
Inbetween your tender long legs  
Searching sand from just last year  
Never does the sand appear  
Hunger connects  
Just like an insect  
Asleep you never sense  
Right as it bites  
Nowhere can it be good so  
The finger slips to Mexico  
Then down it sinks into the sea  
Hunger has no mercy
