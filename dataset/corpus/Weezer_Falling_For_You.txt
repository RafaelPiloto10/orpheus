Holy cow! I think I've got one here  
Now just what am I supposed to do?  
I've got a number of irrational fears  
That I'd like to share with you  
  
First, there's rules about old goats like me  
Hangin' 'round with chicks like you -but I do like you-  
And another one: you say "like" too much  
  
But I'm shaking at your touch  
I like you way too much  
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you  
'N I'd do about anything to get the hell out alive  
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you  
  
Holy moly, baby, wouldn't you know it?  
Just as I was bustin' loose  
I gotta go turn in my rock star card  
And get fat and old with you  
'Cause I'm a burning a candle you're a gentle month  
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder  
And I do like you - you're the lucky one  
No! I'm the lucky one  
  
Holy Sweet goddamn! You left your cello in the basement  
I admired the glowing the stars  
And tried to play a tune'  
  
I can't believe how bad I suck, it's true  
What could you possibly see in little ol' 3-chord me?  
But it's true - you like me, I like you too  
I'm ready, let's do it baby
