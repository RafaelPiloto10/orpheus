I'm going under, I'm suffocating,  
Drowning, but I'm holding on  
What keeps me breathing?  
Don't have an answer,  
Drowning, but I won't let go  
  
Away now No way out  
  
I've been walkin', a lonesome highway  
I felt as though I had no home  
My bed's been taken, by another  
I made the bed, now lie alone  
  
Give it away now Motherfucker, now keep it away  
  
Away now No way out  
  
Give it away now  
  
Away now, No way out  
  
I'm going under, I'm suffocating,  
Drowning but I'm holding on  
What keeps me breathing?  
Don't have an answer,  
Drowning but I won't let go  
  
Give it away now
