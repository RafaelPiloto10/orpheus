Get the idea cross around the track  
Underneath the flank of thoroughbred racing chasers.  
Getting the feel as a river flows.  
Would you like to go 'n shoot the mountain masses?  
And here you stand no taller than the grass sees.  
And should you really chase so hard.  
The truth of sport plays rings around you.  
  
Going for the one

Get in the way as the tons of water  
Racing with you crashing through the rudder.

I don't feel low.  
N'should I really chase so hard.  
The truth of sport plays rings around you.  
Going for the one.

Going for to  
Listen in time  
Taken so high  
To touch to move  
Listen to life  
Touching touch time  
Travel twilight  
Taken so high  
Taking your time  
Turn on to love  
Turnstile to one

Listen in time  
Taken so high

Tender timing  
Rocking rolling  
  
Moments decide.  
Moments delight.  
Moments in flight.  
Talk about sending love.
