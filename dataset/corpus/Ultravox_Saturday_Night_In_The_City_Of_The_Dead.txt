While a fat guy zips by, bony in a Zodiac  
Picking out trouble, maybe looking for a heart attack  
All-night boys in the Piccadilly arcade  
(???) trawling for some rough trade  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Can't you feel the time bomb ticking in your head?  
Too many memories are burning in your bed  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Dead in the dole queue, face like a statue  
Laugh like a maniac, walk like a king too  
Spiked hair, don't care, hot spam outlaw  
Rad man (?) rips it out, you're buzzing like a chainsaw  
(Chorus)  
High-rise reptile sucking on a cigarette  
Ripped suit, zip boots, dancing like an insect  
Tottenham Court Rolexes the excuses (?) in the wind hide  
The city's pretty dead but I'm still alive  
(Chorus)  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Saturday night  
(Repeat and fade)
