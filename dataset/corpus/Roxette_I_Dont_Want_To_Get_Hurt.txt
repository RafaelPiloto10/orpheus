In everything I see you appear with me, how come? How come?  
And everything I do involves you too. We are like one.  
In my life there has been so many changes  
And I don't want to be left out in the rain  
  
I don't want to get hurt, I've done my time.  
All I want from you is to tell the truth.  
I don't want to get hurt no more this time.  
I don't want to go blind and find it's falling apart all the time  
  
In the middle of a dream you are there for me, your face, your lips.  
But there's no way you can tell 'cause I hide it really well, so well.  
In my life there has been loving and lying  
And I don't need another reason to cry  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to go blind and find I'm falling apart one more time.
