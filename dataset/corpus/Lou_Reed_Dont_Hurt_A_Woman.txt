I was angry  
I said things I shouldn't say  
But please don't turn your back  
Sometimes I get so upset  
But I take it all back  
Please don't go  
I know I was wrong  
Sometimes I don't know what comes over me  
But I try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
Don't hurt a woman  
I was angry  
I said things I shouldn't say  
I must have lost control  
Sometimes something clicks in my head  
And I'm not myself anymore  
That wasn't me  
You can't believe everything you see  
Let's make believe I never said a word  
And I'll try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
Try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
Try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
I'll try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
Cause I lovin' you  
So long
