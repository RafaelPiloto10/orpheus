Making believe that you still love me  
It's leaving me alone and so blue  
Still I'll always dream, but I'll never own you  
Making believe, its all I can do  
  
Can't hold you close when you're not whit me  
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine  
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime  
Loving you and making believe  
  
Making believe I never lost you  
But my happy hours are so few  
My plans for the future will never come true  
Making believe what else can I do
