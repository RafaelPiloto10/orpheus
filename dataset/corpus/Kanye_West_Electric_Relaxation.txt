You got to  
  
[Chorus:]  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
All day long man, we back in town  
  
[Consequence]  
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized  
So won't you hook a chew scorns, she tellin you buy  
Street poetry is how ya boy get paid  
And I wear no Escalade, metallic, black or beige  
Yo when I walk up in the club you know I do not pay  
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy he got something to say  
  
[Kanye West]  
Aiiyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam  
And where the glocks don't jam, so where we pop them scrams  
See I showed you on the champions how we get down  
So don't twist ya lips, I'm like Bobby Brown  
You got B2k on all your bedroom wall  
But if you be with Kan, gonna work ya walls  
Straight from the South side of dem Chi-town streets  
The top three in the game, with these here beats  
  
[Consequence]  
And if you talk about him, aiiyo I take you out  
Either with the nine or the tech's in his mouth  
And let that dime gettin friendly than the orgie's at eight  
But y'all niggaz don't shine so you couldn't relate  
  
[Chorus:]  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (You couldn't relate)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yo Quence, you couldn't relate)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
  
[Consequence]  
Quence without the game, now he's back to ball  
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall  
You starin at my Rolls' cold way to long  
But I ain't scared of robbers, why I wear tephlon  
I took her on the ave and she expect me to trip  
But I made up with no style while I bought me some kicks  
So if you want the drama holler at ya boy  
  
[Kanye West]  
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy  
The G-500 is my favorite toy  
'Cause it don't look like a thug or a hood  
But he keep dem gorilla's so we still be good  
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A  
And the N-Y-E, out N. Y. C  
I'ma still rep the gold, no matter where I go  
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm sayin I'm cold  
Hate when niggaz leave the city and switch up they reps  
On the real homie, I don't get down like that  
I'ma milk the game, 'til we all can eat  
  
[Consequence]  
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep  
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak  
'Cause that shit'll have me zonin for a couple of weeks  
  
[Kanye West]  
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show  
'Cause that's the best way to get a nigga with dough  
Then fake a pregnancy, then call the attorney-a  
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than ikea furniture  
  
[Consequence]  
Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D  
Menace, Skates to Lou and 'em Puffs from L. B  
They know the Consequence be wearin gold and ice  
'Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice  
Ey shorty let me tell you 'bout the rules of my Nikes  
It seems they always keep on movin, I don't hear nuthin twice  
  
[Chorus:]  
So relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Don't hear nuthin twice)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Don't hear nuthin twice)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Calm down)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah!)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah!)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (It's the are. O. C.!)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Uhh)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah)  
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Uh-huh, yeah)  
All day long man, we back in town  
  
[Repeat 'til end]  
Relax yaself or we'll whack ya down
