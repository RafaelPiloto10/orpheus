All the dreams  
You can't live without  
All the love that you made  
You can't live without  
If you look at the grief in your heart  
And the dreams that you had are all gone  
You'd better stop it now  
You just can't take it hard  
You'd better stop it now  
You just can't take it so hard, right now  
All the praise  
You can't live without  
All the highs in the days you can't live without  
When you look to the right and the one  
Who was saying goodbye is now gone  
You'd better stop it now  
You just can't take it hard  
You'd better stop it now  
You just can't take it so hard, right now  
All left behind  
I'm not here to find and amaze you  
All left my mind  
I'm not here to try and appraise you now  
I didn't wanna hold you up  
You know I wanna hold you  
But never wanna hold you up  
I didn't wanna call  
All the love you can't live without  
All above you can't live without  
Well you look to the right and the one  
Who was saving your love for a song  
Is telling you she's gone  
Right now, oh now  
You'd better stop it now  
You just can't take it so hard, right now  
You'd better stop it now  
Or she's gone  
Well she's gone
