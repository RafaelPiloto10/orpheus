Man by himself lives in a world a world of his own  
But there's no one who can live in the world all alone  
For it takes all kinds of people  
It doesn't matter where they come from  
Yes it takes all kinds of people  
The good, the bad, and everyone  
  
On the way up, a man can walk over his friends  
What goes up comes down  
One day he may need them again  
For it takes all kinds of people  
It doesn't matter where they come from  
Yes it takes all kinds of people  
The good, the bad, and everyone  
  
There'll come the day when everyone passes him by  
What will he say when nobody answers his cry?  
That it takes all kinds of people  
It doesn't matter where they come from  
Yes it takes all kinds of people  
It may take some time  
But each man will find  
That he needs all kinds of people  
That he must believe in people  
Yes it takes all kinds of people  
To make a world
