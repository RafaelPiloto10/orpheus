You took my love and ran away  
What did you expect me to say  
I gave you everything I could  
But you weren't giving up, baby  
What you should  
I Sho do...Need You  
I Sho Do...Want You  
I'm in need of what you've got  
It makes my blood boiling hot  
You told me baby, A long time ago  
That you'd never, ever leave me  
Never, no more  
I Sho Do...Need You  
I Sho Do...Want You  
I Sho Do...Wish For You  
I Sho Do...Walk the Floor All Night Long  
When you see me, baby standing alone  
Come and help me baby, Cause I'm out on my own  
You see it ain't easy in the streets  
But what you've got baby, could help me to my feet  
I Sho Do...Need You  
I Sho Do...Want You  
I Sho Do...Wish For You  
I Sho Do...Walk the Floor All  
Night Long
