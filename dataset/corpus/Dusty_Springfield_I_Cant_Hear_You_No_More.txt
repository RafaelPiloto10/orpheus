Here you are again  
Tellin' me you're sorry, baby  
Tellin' me you wanna come on back home  
Where you belong  
  
There you go again  
Lyin' and alibiin'  
Singin' that same old worn out song  
Here it comes now  
  
I can't hear you no more  
I've heard it all before  
You ain't a reachin' me no how  
No way, no time until dooms day  
  
I can't hear you no more  
I can't hear you no more  
  
You walked out on me  
Once too often baby  
And I can't take no more of your jive  
And that's the truth  
  
I ain't about to let you  
Run me into the ground  
I'm not gonna throw away my youth  
No not hardly  
  
I can't hear you no more  
I've heard it all before  
You ain't a reachin' me no how  
No way, no time until dooms day  
  
I can't hear you no more  
I can't hear you no more  
  
You ain't a reachin' me no how  
No way, no time until dooms day  
I can't hear you no more  
I can't hear you no more  
  
You gotta speak out louder  
You gotta speak out louder  
'Cause I can't hear you no more  
I can't hear you no more  
Just a little bit louder
