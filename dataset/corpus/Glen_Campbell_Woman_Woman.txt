Woman oh woman have you got cheating on your mind on your mind  
There's something wrong between us that your laughter cannot hide  
And you're afraid to let your eyes meet mine  
And lately when I love you I know you're not satisfied  
Woman oh tell me woman have you got cheating on your mind on your mind  
I've seen the way men look at you when they think I don't see  
And it hurts to have them think that you're that kind  
But it's knowing that you're looking back that's really killing me  
Oh woman oh tell me woman have you got cheating on your mind on your mind  
  
A woman wears a certain look when she is on the move  
And a man can always tell what's on her mind  
I hate to have to say it but that look's all over you  
Oh woman oh tell me woman have you got cheating on your mind  
Oh woman oh tell me woman have you got cheating on your mind
