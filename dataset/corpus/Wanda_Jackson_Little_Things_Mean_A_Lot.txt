Blow me a kiss from across the room  
Say I look nice when I'm not  
Touch my hair as you pass my chair  
Little things mean a lot  
Give me your arm as we cross the street  
Call me at six on the dot  
A line a day when you're far away  
Little things mean a lot  
Don't have to buy me diamonds and pearls  
Champagne, sables and such  
I never cared much for diamonds and pearls  
But honestly honey, they just cost money  
Give me your hand when I've lost the way  
Give me your shoulder to cry on  
Whether the day is bright or gray give me your heart to rely on  
Send me the warmth of a secret smile  
To show me you haven't forgot  
Now and forever , that always and ever  
Little things mean a lot
