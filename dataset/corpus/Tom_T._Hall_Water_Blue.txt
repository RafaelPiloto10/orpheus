My teardrops remind me that I'm water blue  
A conscience too healthy for all I've been through  
The sun shines and I think that I should improve  
But I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
Whiskey in water and salt in my tears too many long nights for too many years  
They say I'll forget you but I never do I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
[ dobro - sax ]  
As blue as an ocean as blue as a lake thinking about you and all my mistakes  
All I ever wanted was my job and you now I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
I'm heartsick and I'm water blue
