You hit the street, you feel them staring  
You know they hate you you can feel their eyes a glarin'  
Because you're different, because you're free  
Because you're everything deep down they wish they could be  
[Chorus:]  
You're lookin back (lookin back) they're lookin back (lookin back)  
Too many people lookin back  
You're lookin back (lookin back) they're lookin back (lookin back)  
Too many people lookin back  
They watch the news, see young men dying  
They watch them bleedin' and listen to them lyin'  
And if they're normal if they can see  
They just reach out and change the channel on the TV  
[Chorus]  
When they could vote, and end the war  
They're much too busy fittin' locks upon the back door  
Give you a foxhole, a place to hide  
Cause when the war come the cops'll be on their side  
[Chorus]
