After the fire is over  
After the ashes cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be is for you  
After the stillness finds you  
After the winds of change  
All that is good and true between us  
This will remain the same  
Slowly, slowly  
We turn the pages of life  
Growing, knowing  
It comes at quite a price  
After the fire is over  
After the ashes cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be here for you  
After your time of wondering  
Along this lonely road  
There will be many voices calling  
Mine will say welcome home  
Slowly, slowly  
We turn the pages of life  
Growing, knowing  
It comes at quite a price  
After the fire is over  
After the ash is cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be here for you  
I will be here for you
