Young and wild with a madness  
I wouldn't listen  
I thought I knew just exactly  
The way life would be, you see  
You came along and you showed me  
Just what I was missing  
You opened my eyes with your sweet love  
Oh, then I could see  
  
They said it wouldn't last  
We proved them wrong  
We learned to fly above the storm  
Cause we've always known that we belong  
And we're better together  
If we got our backs against the wall  
Somehow we survive through it all  
Knowing I'll be there if you should fall  
Oh, we're better together, all right, yeah yeah  
  
Running alone, I was searching  
While you were there waiting  
Lessons in love I was learning  
Were all right with me, you see  
You changed my world and you gave me  
Aw, the kiss you were saving  
Oh, we had each other to fight for  
Oh, when no one believed  
  
They said it wouldn't last  
We proved them wrong  
We learned to fly above the storm  
Cause we've always known that we belong  
And we're better together  
If we got our backs against the wall  
Somehow we survive through it all  
Knowing I'll be there if you should fall  
Yeah, we're better together  
  
Ooh it gets so lonely out there  
Oh, playing my solitaire  
  
Oh, Mustang  
All right  
Wait a minute  
Young and wild with a madness  
This time I listened, baby  
You opened my eyes with your sweet love  
Ooh, yeah, you set me free

So much better, girl, we're better together  
Better together, all right  
Listen  
Let's get together, let's get together, all right  
Let's get together, well  
Let's get together, let's get together right now  
It's just, it's just better that way
