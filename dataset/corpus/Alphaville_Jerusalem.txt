Standing on the empty bridge  
Watching river's waves go by  
Feeling mellow, lighting a cigarette  
Silver moon floats through the night  
  
Eris, princess of the isles  
Disperse your sparkling traces  
Lead me on to the house of love  
Where the gods may turn my eyes  
  
To jerusalem we pray, it's time to meet you there  
Let's take love to Jerusalem, oh yeah  
Let's take love  
You might be the one I'm waiting for  
  
I think we've met somewhere for sure  
Chasing shadows leaves you feeling blue  
This situation needs a cure  
New assassins, new messiahs  
  
Keepers of the balanced law  
Strangest lovers of the fire  
Which ignates the halo of our souls  
To Jerusalem we pray, it's time to meet you there  
  
Let's take love to Jerusalem, oh yeah  
Let's take love  
Big yellow cadillac, carry me back home  
On glory roads of pure delight  
  
We head out for the stars
