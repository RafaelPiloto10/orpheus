Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world  
You noticed I'm the kind of girl who loves her diamonds and white pearls  
So tempt me to jet set away in London  
To sip on some tea, you surprise me with gifts from Tiffany  
Ooh (La la la la la la la la)  
I love the way we livin' boy  
But my daddy say, "You don't need that boy"  
So let's run away, let's run away (way, way)  
Momma say I'm too young for love  
And lovin' you is all I'm thinkin' of  
My heart tells me that you're the one  
It's the feeling you give, it is  
  
Pure bliss  
Like you've got the key to my heart  
Simple as a touch and a kiss  
Never knew a feeling like this  
Pure bliss, pure bliss  
Nobody can tear us apart  
Baby it's as good as it gets (Kiss kiss kiss kiss)  
Loving you will never be hard  
This is pure bliss  
  
I remember, when the pilot closed the door  
Said it's time for lift off, you said, "What'd you choose me for?"  
Don't ever wonder  
'Cause you deserve the best  
Once you reach the top you'll never question why you left  
My world is yours  
What you waitin' for?  
Let's run away  
Let's run away  
Our friends, say we're crazy  
But we can't listen baby  
They've never had it like this  
They don't know what it is  
  
Pure bliss  
Like you've got the key to my heart  
Simple as a touch and a kiss  
Never knew a feeling like this  
Pure bliss, pure bliss  
Nobody can tear us apart  
Baby it's as good as it gets (Kiss kiss kiss kiss)  
Loving you will never be hard  
This is pure bliss
