Their shadows danced closer on the honky tonk walls  
As the band plays the last verse to that goin' home waltz  
And they'll start to peril 'neath the parking lot moon  
And some cars and a pickup won't be picked up 'til noon  
  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
It's an after hours merry-go-round  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
There's a whole lot of love lost and found  
  
I wish I could say now that I've learned it all  
From my observations as a fly on the wall  
But if lonesome's a crime oh, I'm guilty as sin  
'Cause tomorrow I'll pickup my ol' pickup again  
  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
It's an after hours merry-go-round  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
There's a whole lot of love lost and found  
There's a whole lot of love lost and found
