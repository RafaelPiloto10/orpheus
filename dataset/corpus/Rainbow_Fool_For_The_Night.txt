I know just what you're thinking  
I know just how you feel  
Something sometimes inside you  
Say can't believe it's real  
So you're gonna play the game  
All the faces and the names  
And you know you're never gonna change  
  
Fool for the night  
And you don't believe it  
Fool for the night  
And you just can't see it  
  
Running through the shadows  
Like a phantom in the night  
And as the curtain raises  
You get ready for the fight  
Say you want to even up the score  
Don't know what you're doing it for  
Too much but you still need more  
  
Fool for the night  
And you don't believe it  
Fool for the night  
And you just can't see it  
  
I ain't gonna try and tell ya  
You know the story oh so well  
Everybody's out to buy and sell ya  
You're gonna wind up by yourself  
Oh here it comes again  
No it's never gonna end  
I must be dreaming  
  
Fool for the night  
Fool for the night  
Oh here it comes again  
I ain't gonna try and tell ya  
You know the story oh so well  
Everybody's out to buy and sell ya  
You're gonna wind up by yourself  
Oh here it comes again  
And I know it's never gonna end  
I must be dreaming  
  
You love the night life  
All the neon and the noise  
And underneath the spotlight  
You keep rocking with the boys  
So you're gonna get it while you can  
But you're never gonna understand  
Nobody really gives a damn  
Fool for the night and you don't believe it  
Fool for the night why don't you see it
