Good Christian men rejoice  
With heart and soul and voice!  
Give ye heed to what we say  
News! News!  
Jesus Christ is born today!  
Ox and ass before Him bow  
And He is in the manger now  
Christ is born today!  
Christ is born today!  
  
Good Christian men, rejoice  
With heart and soul and voice  
Now ye hear of endless bliss  
Joy! Joy!  
Jesus Christ was born for this  
He hath ope'd the heav'nly door  
And man is blessed evermore  
Christ was born for this  
Christ was born for this  
  
Good Christian men, rejoice  
With heart and soul and voice  
Now ye need not fear the grave:  
Peace! Peace!  
Jesus Christ was born to save  
Calls you one and calls you all  
To gain His everlasting hall  
Christ was born to save  
Christ was born to save
