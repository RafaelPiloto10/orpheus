It's a tedious existence laying your love on the line  
Resistance is useless she can leave at any time  
I must confess that in my quest I felt depressed and restless  
But this Casanova's roving days are over more or less  
  
With love  
  
She broke my heart and made me sad  
You foolish boy you lost what you had  
  
My Mademoiselle I must make my farewell  
You see Senor I know she don't want me no more  
I'd like to make that Fraulein mine, mein Fraulein  
So I'll depart sweetheart and leave you with this line  
  
With love  
She says she won't be back no more  
With love  
She says she's leaving for sure  
  
My Mademoiselle I'll say farewell  
No matter where you are, Au Revoir  
'Til we meet again, Auf Wiedersehn  
  
She wrote it on a letter  
But it didn't make him feel any better  
With love  
She says goodbye, adios, farewell  
  
There are those who will spend a lifetime of leisure  
'Til the leisure finally takes control  
And they'll spend their life in search of pleasure  
Never knowing the treasure that they own  
  
There are those who will spend a lifetime in hard labor  
'Til the labor breaks both body and soul  
And they will learn to love their neighbor  
And be assured of what they own
