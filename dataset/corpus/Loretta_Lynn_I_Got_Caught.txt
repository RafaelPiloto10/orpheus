You're standin' there a sayin' I'm no good  
And I'm so ashamed I'd die if I could  
But you're no better than I am or have you given this one thought  
The only thing that's different I got caught  
All the nights you left me all alone  
And the only arms close to me was my own  
And now you're blame on me but it's not all my fault  
The only thing that's different I got caught  
Yeah I got caught but honey you're a pro  
There's not a thing about cheatin' you don't know  
That same old line you sell is the same old line I bought  
The thing you've got away with I got caught  
[ guitar - steel ]  
Yeah I got caught but honey you're a pro...  
Yeah the thing you've got away with I got caught
