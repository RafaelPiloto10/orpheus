And I have seen wonders  
And I have seen miracles  
Oh, I have seen some things  
It's all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain  
  
And I have seen sadness  
And I have seen time run out  
I've even seen men cry  
It's all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain  
  
And my memories  
I can't give them away  
So it's easy  
Like a long long sleep  
  
I'm so tired  
Now it's my time to die  
Welcome home  
Welcome home  
  
No exhibition  
No screaming war songs  
No conversation  
No more opinions here  
  
And I have seen new wars  
And I have seen things  
That you wouldn't believe  
And I have seen my days  
It's all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain
