You said that your love was just for me  
That's why I've got to be yours  
You told me the day will never come  
When you would walk out and leave  
'Cause you know that  
  
[Chorus]  
True love is hard to find  
'Cause you know that  
True love is hard to find  
Everybody knows  
True love is hard to find  
Hard to find  
Very hard to find  
I say (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love is hard to find  
  
You told me that you know I would have to travel all over  
You would take care of my business for me  
Darlin', all I ask of you  
Is to leave those business alone and save it just for me  
Yes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And glory fills my heart with joy from heaven  
With love for you  
Darlin', I always think of you  
Always have my arms filled with love for you  
'Cause you know that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just because I know  
True love is hard to find  
I believe in love  
True love is hard to find  
Everybody should know that  
True love is hard to find  
You know that  
True love is hard to find  
I say (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love is hard to find  
Hard to find  
True love (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love is hard to find
