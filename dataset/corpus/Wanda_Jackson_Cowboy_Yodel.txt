There's a cowboy that I know ridin' in the rodeo  
He's a feller that I'm fondest of  
I love him and he loves me and that's the way it ought to be  
But he drives me crazy when we're makin' love cause he always starts to yodel
(yodel)  
Well he always squeezed me at night while the moon was shinin' bright  
And I knew I was under his spell  
He was gazin' in my eyes and I was breathing pretty sighs  
Then like Tarzan he'd let out a great big yell And he started into yodel
(yodel)  
Well when he led me down the isle I wore such a pretty smile  
And my handsome cowboy wore a buckskin suit  
When the parson said will you promise always to be true  
My lover smiled and gently cleared his throat and he started to yodel (yodel)
