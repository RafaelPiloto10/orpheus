In the constellation of Cygnus  
There lurks a mysterious, invisible force  
The Black Hole  
Of Cygnus X-1  
  
Six Stars of the Northern Cross  
In mourning for their sister's loss  
In a final flash of glory  
Nevermore to grace the night...  
  
1  
Invisible  
To telescopic eye  
Infinity  
The star that would not die  
  
All who dare  
To cross her course  
Are swallowed by  
A fearsome force  
  
Through the void  
To be destroyed  
Or is there something more?  
Atomized, at the core  
Or through the Astral Door,  
To soar...  
  
2  
I set a course just east of Lyra  
And northwest of Pegasus  
Flew into the light of Deneb  
Sailed across the Milky Way  
  
On my ship, the 'Rocinante'  
Wheeling through the galaxies,  
Headed for the heart of Cygnus  
Headlong into mystery  
  
The x-ray is her siren song  
My ship cannot resist her long  
Nearer to my deadly goal  
Until the Black Hole,  
Gains control...  
  
3  
Spinning, whirling,  
Still descending  
Like a spiral sea,  
Unending  
  
Sound and fury  
Drowns my heart  
Every nerve  
Is torn apart...  
  
To be continued...
