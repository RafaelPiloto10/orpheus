Say, do you remember that guy Larry next door  
Well, he always was the neighborhood clown  
Like the time he pulled my pants off  
And he took those color pictures  
  
And posted copies all over town  
Or the time that he dumped toxic waste on my lawn  
Or those wacky prank phone calls from midnight till dawn  
What a crazy kid Larry was, always foolin' around  
  
Boy, what a joker  
What a funny, funny guy  
I'll never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
  
Say, do you remember when I lost all my hair  
'Cause Lar' gave me that Nair shampoo  
And hey, how 'bout the day he put Ben Gay inside my jockstrap  
And filled my toothpaste tube up glue  
All those wedgies he gave  
All those shoestrings he tied  
All those brownies he made with the Ex-Lax inside  
Oh, Lar', I swear, it was a laugh a minute with you  
  
Boy, what a joker  
What a funny, funny guy  
I'll never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
  
You know I couldn't help but laugh  
Even though he treated me like slime  
Remember when he cut my car in half?  
Well, he really got me good that time!  
  
Say, do you remember when I broke in Larry's house  
Late at night and tied his mouth with a rag  
Then I dragged him by his ankles to the middle of the forest  
And stuffed him in a big plastic bag  
  
If the cops ever find him, who knows what they'd say  
But I'm sure if ol' Lar' were still with us today  
He would have to agree with me  
It was a pretty good gag  
  
Oh boy, what a joker  
What a funny, funny guy  
I'll never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
  
Oh boy, what a joker  
What a funny, funny guy  
I'll never forget about Larry  
No matter how I try  
No matter how I try  
  
Oh, I remember Larry
