You keep me waiting  
I don't mind waiting  
I don't wait for everyone  
This is a one-time situation  
You say you need me  
I believe you need  
But you're fooling no one  
This is a one-time situation  
  
What does it matter  
Who's been taken in  
Ah, what does it matter  
When you've got two hearts  
Aching to begin  
  
Here's the opportunity  
Come and take it to the nth degree  
Don't be nervous, I don't have to be  
Tied up in promises  
Ooh, tied up in words that cut too deep  
Tied up in promises we could never keep  
I don't want to let you down  
Don't make me let you down  
  
I get a feeling  
A head-to-toe feeling  
There's something special going on  
This is a one-time situation  
Take my affection  
Give me love or rejection  
Honey, do what must be done  
This is a one-time situation  
  
What does it matter  
Who's been taken in  
Ah, what does it matter  
When you've got two hearts  
Aching to begin  
  
Here's the opportunity  
Come and take it to the nth degree  
Don't be nervous, I don't have to be  
Tied up in promises  
Ooh, tied up in words that cut too deep  
Tied up in promises we could never keep  
I don't want to let you down  
Don't make me let you down  
  
This is a one-time situation  
This is a one-time situation  
  
Don't get me tied up  
Don't get me tied up
