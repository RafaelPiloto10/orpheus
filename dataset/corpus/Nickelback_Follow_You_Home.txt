Well, you can dig me up a grave  
And try and stick me in the ground  
Well, you can tie me to the bed  
And try and beat me half to death  
But you can never keep me down  
Well, you can stick me in a hole  
And you can pray all day for rain  
You can shoot me in the leg  
Just to try to make me beg  
And you can leave me there for days  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I'll stay alive  
Just to follow you home, yeah  
And I will survive, mmm  
'Cause you're my Mississippi princess  
You're my California queen  
Like the duchess of Detroit  
And every city in between  
You can slap me in the face  
And you can scream profanity  
Leave me here to die alone, but  
I'll still follow you home  
I'll still follow you home  
  
You can make a couple calls  
And tell your brothers I'm in town  
Put a bounty on my head  
And tell my parents that I'm dead  
And hope to hell I'm never found  
You can steal me the keys  
To your daddy's Cadillac  
You can tamper with the brakes  
Call it a mistake  
And pray I'm never coming back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
C'mon, mmm, oh  
  
(You can dig me up a grave  
And try and stick me in the ground  
You can tie me to the bed  
And try and beat me half to death  
But you can never keep me down)  
  
And I will survive  
'Cause you're my Mississippi princess  
You're my California queen  
Like the duchess of Detroit  
And every city in between  
You can slap me in the face  
And you can scream profanity  
Leave me here to die alone, but  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home
