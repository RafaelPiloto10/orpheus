What do the neighbors say  
When they hear us scream at night  
Do they talk about a love all in tatters  
What do the neighbors know  
About the heart and soul  
The fire down below that really matters  
They can never guess in the silences  
That all I want is you  
And the sexy hurricane we got here, oh, babe  
  
All I want is you  
I don't want a man who says "Good morning, dear", no, I don't  
(All I want is you, all that I want is you)  
(All I want is you, nobody else, no one but you)  
  
Let 'em listen at the door  
Let 'em listen through the floor  
Let 'em go ahead and draw the wrong conclusion  
So chase me 'round the room  
Make me crazy like the moon  
They can never guess in the silences  
And all I want is you  
And the sexy hurricane that we share (We share, yeah)  
  
All I want is you  
I don't want a man who tiptoes up the stairs, no, I don't  
(All I want is you, all that I want is you)  
(All I want is you, nobody else, no one but you)  
  
They can never guess in the silences  
That all I want is you (All I want is you)  
And the sexy hurricane that we share, oh uh oh  
  
All I want is you  
I don't want a man who tiptoes up the stairs (He's gonna fall)  
All I want is you  
And your freight train  
Whistlin' over my track, oh uh oh  
All I want is you  
And your Mack truck loving  
Jumping me, Jack  
Oh uh oh, Jack  
  
(All that I want)
