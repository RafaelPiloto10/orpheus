(Duncan)  
I give you stars and sunshine  
A rainbow at your feet each time you rise  
So dry your eyes  
The house of yesterday is crumblin' at my feet  
But I don't mind, I had my time  
I am but yesterday  
And you my child, tomorrow  
There's nothing I can give you  
For you have more than me  
You are the truth within your youth  
I watch you dance and playing  
The little prince of all that you survey  
Each night, each day  
I am the good old days,  
And you my child, tomorrow  
If I have any future  
It is within your eyes  
Each time you smile  
My child, my child  
The hand of life will rock you  
I brought you forth  
And then my task was through  
I give to you  
This wondrous view  
I am but yesterday  
And you my child, tomorrow  
And you my child, tomorrow  
And you my child, tomorrow
