Flat on my back  
In a lonely sprawl  
I stare at the ceiling  
Because I can not fall  
Asleep tonight  
No not at all  
Head lights flash  
Across my bedroom wall  
Crying eyes open  
Because I can not fall  
In love with you  
  
No not at all  
Walk away and taste the pain  
Come again some other day  
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid  
Funny how the price gets paid  
  
Busted in two  
Like a brittle stick  
I can not drink  
Because my throat constricts  
Lovesick from you  
That will never do  
Open my mouth  
I couldn't make a sound  
I could not scream  
I could not shout  
It out to you  
Nothing to do  
  
Walk away and taste the pain  
Come again some other day  
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid  
Funny how the price gets paid  
  
This may come as a shocking surprise  
I have to take a walk  
I have to kiss it goodbye  
Goodbye my love  
Goodbye my love  
I am not alive  
  
Walk away and taste the pain  
Come again some other day  
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid  
Funny how the price gets paid
