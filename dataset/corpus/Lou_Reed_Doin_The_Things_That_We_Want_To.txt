The other night we went to see Sam's play  
Doin' the things that we want to  
It was very physical it held you to the stage  
Doin' the things that he want to ...  
  
The guy's a cowboy from some rodeo  
Doin' the things that we want to  
The girl had once loved him, but now she want to go  
Doin' the things that we want to ...  
  
The man was bullish, the woman was a tease  
Doin' the things that we want to  
They fought with their words, their bodies and their deeds  
Doin' the things that we want to  
When they finished fighting, they excited the stage  
Doin' the things that we want to  
I was firmly struck by the way they had behaved  
Doin' the things that we want to ...  
  
It reminds me of the movies Marty made about New York  
Doin' the things that we want to  
Those frank and brutal movies that are so brilliant  
Doin' the things that we want to  
'Fool For Love' meet 'The Raging Bull'  
Doin' the things that we want to  
They're very inspirational, I love the things they do  
Doin' the things that we want to ...  
  
There's not much you hear on the radio today  
Doin' the things that we want to  
But you still can see a movie or a play  
Doin' the things that we want to  
Here's to 'Travis Bickle' and here's 'Johnny Boy'  
Doin' the things that we want to  
Growing up in the mean streets of New York  
Doin' the things that we want to  
  
I wrote this song 'cause I'd like to shake your hand  
Doin' the things that we want to  
In a way you guys are the best friends I ever had  
Doin' the things that we want to ...
