We play these parlour games  
We play at make believe  
When we get to the part where I say that I'm going to leave  
Everybody loves a happy ending but we don't even try  
We go straight past pretending  
To the part where everybody loves to cry  
  
[Chorus]  
Indoor fireworks  
Can still burn your fingers  
Indoor fireworks  
We swore we were safe as houses  
They're not so spectacular  
They don't burn up in the sky  
But they can dazzle or delight  
Or bring a tear  
When the smoke gets in your eyes  
  
You were the spice of life  
The gin in my vermouth  
And though the sparks would fly  
I thought our love was fireproof  
Sometimes we'd fight in public darling  
With very little cause  
But different kinds of sparks would fly  
When we got on our own behind closed doors  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's time to tell the truth  
These things have to be faced  
My fuse is burning out  
And all that powder's gone to waste  
Don't think for a moment dear that we'll ever be through  
I'll build a bonfire of my dreams  
And burn a broken effigy of me and you  
  
[Chorus]
