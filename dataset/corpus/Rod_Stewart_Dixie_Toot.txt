Sitting on my back door wondering which way to go  
The sun's shining on my back and it hurts (child)  
The FM station plays another bad 45  
And it's been so long since I had a good time  
It's been so long since I had a good time  
  
Never wrecked my head on a bandstand  
in the trombone or clarinet line  
When I come in heat on Bourbon Street for Mardi Gras  
When those for a cryin' just stay behind in the bar  
'Cause it's been so long since I had a good time  
Yeah it's been so long since I had a good time  
  
I'm gonna lose control of my powers  
I might even lose my trousers  
Smash some glass, act like trash if I want  
Wear a skirt be a flirt if I want  
'Cause it's been so long since I had a good time  
This prodigal man from Dixieland needs a good time  
right now, show me a good time right now  
  
You better take it while you can  
You gotta get it while you can  
  
And when the Man Upstairs he calls me  
He'll say "It's your turn son to come"  
Don't play the blues down in old Toulouse for me  
Let sleighbells ring and children sing in the street  
And tell all of my friends that I had a good time  
Open up the sky won't you ride me high  
Let's have a good time  
And if I'm late at heaven's gate blame a good time  
And when the angels sing I will join in  
Let's have a good time really  
  
I took my luck, I didn't give a fuck, I had a good time  
Tell all my friends only all my best to have a good time  
Goodbye
