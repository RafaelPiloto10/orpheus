Well she got her daddy's car  
And she cruised to the hamburger stand now  
Seems she forgot all about the library  
Like she told her old man now  
And with the radio blasting  
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now  
  
And she'll have fun, fun, fun  
Till her daddy takes the t-bird away  
(Fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the t-bird away)  
  
Well the girls can't stand her  
'Cause she walks, looks, and drives like an ace now  
(You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace)  
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race now  
(You look like an ace now, you look like an ace)  
A lotta guys try to catch her  
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now  
(You drive like an ace now, you drive like an ace)  
  
And she'll have fun, fun, fun  
Till her daddy takes the t-bird away  
(Fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the t-bird away)  
  
Well you knew all along  
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now  
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)  
And since he took your set of keys  
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now  
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)  
  
But you can come along with me  
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now  
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)  
  
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away  
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away  
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)
