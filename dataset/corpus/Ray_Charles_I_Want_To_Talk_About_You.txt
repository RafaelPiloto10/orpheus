Don't tell me  
About a night in June  
Or a shady lane  
Beneath the velvet moon  
  
Don't tell me  
Cause I wanna talk about you  
  
Don't mention that waterfall  
Or that grassy spot  
Where crickets softly call  
  
Please don't tell me  
Cause, baby  
I wanna talk about you  
  
The moon and the stars  
The objects on Mars  
Are things that  
We've talked of before  
  
But your love for me  
Was the question  
And your answer  
Threw back Heaven's door  
  
So tell me  
Your love will be sincere  
Then, my darling  
You need never fear  
  
Cause I love you  
And I wanna talk about you  
About you  
  
So don't tell me  
Because I wanna talk about you
