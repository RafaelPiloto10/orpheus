Oh yeah  
7 am, thinking ?bout you  
Wondering  
If the thoughts I'm feeling  
You're feeling too  
Like a new born child  
Soft to the touch  
Baby is it possible  
To love someone so much  
I wish I may  
I wish I might  
Be that certain someone  
You wish for every night  
If you knew what I knew  
You wouldn't say what you said  
(Say what you said)  
If you knew what I knew  
We?d be together instead  
(Together instead)  
Of you breaking my heart  
(Breaking my heart)  
Over things that aren't true  
My lady, yes, my lady  
(My lady)  
If you knew what I knew  
Time passes by  
The only tears I cry  
Are filled with disillusion  
And fears I have inside  
Like a lost soul  
I feel like I'm all alone  
(All alone)  
If only I could feel your pain  
Within your heart of stone, woh oh  
I wish I may  
I wish I might  
Be that certain someone  
You wish for every night  
If you knew what I knew  
You wouldn't say what you said  
(Say what you said)  
If you knew what I knew  
We?d be together instead  
(Together instead)  
Of you breaking my heart  
(Breaking my heart)  
Over things that aren't true  
My lady, yes, my lady  
If you knew what I knew  
Then you wouldn't have to go away  
If you knew what I knew  
Then you would be here to stay  
Right by my side always  
(Always)  
If you knew what I knew  
You wouldn't say what you said  
(Say what you said)  
If you knew what I knew  
We?d be together instead  
Of you breaking my heart  
(Breaking my heart)  
Over things that aren't true  
My lady, yes, my lady  
(My lady)  
If you knew what I knew, my, baby  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew, my, baby  
We would be together instead  
If you knew what I knew, my, baby  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew, my, baby  
We would be together instead  
Girl if you knew  
(Say what you said)  
If only you knew, my baby  
We would be together instead  
(Girl if you knew)  
If you knew what I knew, my baby  
(You know you will always)  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew, my baby  
We would be together instead  
(Girl if you you knew)  
If you knew what I knew, my baby  
(Say what you said)  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew, my baby  
We would be together instead  
(Girl if you you knew)  
If you knew what I knew, my baby  
(Say what you said)  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew, my baby  
We would be together instead
