Shall I go, shall I stay  
107 light years away  
Many times, so many doubts  
But no reason to talk about  
  
Mission is over, mission is done  
I will miss you, children of the sun  
But it's time to go away  
Goodbye milky way  
  
For a better world without hate  
Follow your heart, believe in fate  
Only visions and the mind  
Will guide you to the light  
  
Mission is over mission is done  
I will miss you children of the sun  
But it's time to go away  
Goodbye milky way  
  
Mission is over, mission is done  
I will miss you children of the sun  
I go home until someday  
I say goodbye, goodbye milky way  
  
In 5 bilions years the  
Andromeda galaxy will collide with our milky way  
A new gigantic Cosmic world will be born
