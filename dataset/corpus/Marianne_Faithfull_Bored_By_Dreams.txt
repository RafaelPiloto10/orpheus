Things are never what they seem  
Play a part most of the time.  
What is yours cannot be mine  
And I'm bored by dreams.  
  
Bored by dreams.  
I can't say the words I mean  
Make myself go through the line.  
Does the payment fit the crime  
If I'm bored by dreams ?  
  
Take me through the steps my love,  
Shall we dance again ?  
I was older then,  
Now we are the same.  
  
Lasse des raves.  
Rave qui brille dans le noir  
Brillera bien, tu peux le croire.  
Toujours dire la v
