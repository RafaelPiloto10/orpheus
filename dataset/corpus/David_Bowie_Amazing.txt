I'm lazy  
You're crazy, girl  
Stay by my side  
  
I'm scared you'll  
Meet someone  
In whom you'll confide  
  
[Chorus]  
Life's still a dream  
Your love's amazing  
Since I found you  
My life's amazing  
  
I pledge you  
You'll never be blue  
There's too much at stake to be down  
  
My nightmare  
Rooted here watching you go  
Divine in both, our lives  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My life's a roll  
Go go go  
And it's amazing
