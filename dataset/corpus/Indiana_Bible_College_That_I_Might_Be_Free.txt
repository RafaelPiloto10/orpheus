[Verse:]  
Hanging there for all to see  
You gave up everything for me  
They pierced Your side, You hung Your head  
You took the pain for me instead  
With wounded hands, and wounded feet  
You gave me life abundantly  
You saw beyond what they could see  
You died that I might be free  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You she'd your blood with agony  
Sustained for all eternity  
The cross You held, the pain You felt  
Was to be unparalleled  
Across Your back, the stripes You bore  
You healed my heart like none before  
You saw beyond what they could see  
You died that I might be free  
  
[Chorus:]  
That I might be free, You suffered the cross  
The sacrifice You made, gave life for all today  
That I might be free, You laid down Your life  
You paid the price for me and all humanity  
Yeah  
  
[Bridge:]  
Three days You rose again, tore the veil end to end  
Defeated death when You rolled that stone away  
Came back with victory, walking triumphantly  
You died and rose again for me
