Kidnap the Sandy Claws  
Lock him up real tight  
Throw away the key and then  
Turn off all the lights  
  
First we're going to set some bait  
Inside a nasty trap and wait  
When he comes a-sniffing  
We will snap the trap and close the gate  
  
Wait, I've got a better plan  
To catch this big red lobster man  
We'll pop him in a boiling pot  
And when he's done we'll butter him up  
  
Kidnap the Sandy Claws  
Throw him in a pot  
Leave him there for ninety years  
Then see if he talks  
  
But Mr. Ogey Bogey Man  
Can take the holding over then  
He'll be so pleased, I do declare  
That he will cook him rare  
  
I say that we take a canon  
Aim it at his door and then  
Knock three times, and when he answers  
Sandy Claws will be no more  
  
Your so stupid now  
If blow him up to smithereens  
We may loose some pieces  
And then Jack will be  
  
Kidnap the Sandy Claws  
Tie him in a bag  
Throw him in the ocean then  
See what makes him sad  
  
Because Mr. Ogey Bogey
