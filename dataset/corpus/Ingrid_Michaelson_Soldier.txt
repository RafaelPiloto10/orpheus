I don't believe in anything but myself  
I don't believe in anything but myself  
But then you opened up a door, you opened up a door  
Now I start to believe in something else  
  
But how do I know if I'll make it through?  
How do I know? Where's the proof in you?  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
But it can be won  
  
I sit in the back of a bus watching the world grow old  
Watching the world go by all by myself  
I took a faith full leap and packed up all my things and  
All my love and gave it to somebody else  
  
But how do I know if I'll make it through?  
How do I know? Where's the proof in you?  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
But it can be won, but it can be won  
But it can be won, but it can be won  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
(And so it goes)  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
(The war is won)  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
(And so it goes)  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
(The war is won)  
But it can be won, but it can be won
