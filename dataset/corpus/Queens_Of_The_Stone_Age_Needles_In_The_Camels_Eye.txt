Those who know  
They don't let it show  
They just give you one long life  
And you go, oh oh, oh oh  
  
Goes to show  
How winds blow  
The weather's fine  
And I feel so so-so, so  
  
Birds of prey  
With too much to say  
Oh what could be my destiny  
Another rainy day  
  
Why ask why?  
For by the by and by  
All mysteries are just more  
Needles in the camel's eye  
  
Those who know  
They don't let it show  
They just give you one long life  
And you go, oh oh, oh oh  
  
Why ask why?  
For by the by and by  
All mysteries are just more  
Needles in the camel's eye
