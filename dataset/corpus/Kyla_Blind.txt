There's no one stirring on my street tonight  
There's no one leaning on my window pane  
No one to ascertain, or just apologize to  
There's no one to kill my anxiousness again  
  
And if you can please take these arrows from my side  
Their poison marks are like a tattoo of my pride  
I'm guilty, so guilty, dead guilty  
  
(chorus)  
Blind, I'm blind  
You know I'm blind baby, say it isn't right  
So blind, I'm blind  
I'm certifiable but I'm on time  
  
No priest in midnight black can cure my itching flea  
This case of stricken lust has really got a hold on me  
  
And if you can please take this sword back from my side  
It's poison mark is like a tattoo of my pride  
I'm guilty, so shoot me, I'm guilty  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
I need divine intervention, Your divine intervention  
You're divine, You're the vine, I'm the branch  
You're the vine, I'm the fig leaf  
You're the branch, You're divine  
  
I'm blind (I'm deaf and dumb and that's not all)  
You know I need a dose of Your spirituality  
I'm blind (I'm deaf and dumb and that's not all)  
  
I can see now my eyes are opening  
I'm deaf and dumb and that's not all  
I'm deaf and dumb to it all
