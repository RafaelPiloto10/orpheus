Chances are you'll find me  
Somewhere on your road tonight,  
Seems I always end up drivin' by,  
  
Ever since I've known you  
It just seems you're on my way,  
All the rules of logic don't apply  
  
I long to see you in the night,  
Be with you till morning light...  
  
I remember clearly  
How you looked the night we met,  
I recall your laughter and your smile,  
I remember how you made me  
Feel so at ease,  
I remember your grace, your style...  
  
And now your all I long to see,  
You've come to mean so much to me...  
  
Chances are I'll see you,  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight.  
  
You'll be smilin' like the night we met,  
Chances are I'll hold you,  
And I'll offer all I have  
  
You're the only one I can't forget,  
Baby your the best I've ever met...  
  
And I'll be dreamin' of the future,  
And hopin' you'll be by my side  
  
And in the morning I'll be longing,  
  
For the night...  
  
For the night...  
  
Chances are I'll see you,  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight...  
You'll be smilin' like the night we met...  
Chances are I'll hold you,  
And I'll offer all I have,  
You're the only one I can't forget...  
Baby your the best I've ever met.
