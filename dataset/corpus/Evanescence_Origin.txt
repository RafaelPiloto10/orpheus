Long lost words whisper slowly to me  
Still can't find what keeps me here  
And all this time I've been so hollow inside  
  
(And I know you're still there)  
  
Watching me  
Wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you  
Loving you  
I know I'll find you somehow  
  
Hunting you  
I can smell you  
alive  
Your heart pounding in my head  
  
Calling me  
Killing me  
I won't let you pull me down  
Saving me  
Raping me  
Watching me  
  
(Watching me  
Wanting me  
I can feel you hold me down  
Fearing you  
Loving you  
I won't let you hold me down)  
  
Watching me  
Wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you  
Loving you  
I won't let you hold me down
