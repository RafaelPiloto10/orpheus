Beating with life you promised life,  
Security, happiness.  
Unfortunate son cornered,  
Cowering in the pit of  
Circling panes of glass that  
Surround and reveal the ever present "It".  
  
"It" is my move, my every look,  
Interpreting gestures,  
Informing other  
What's undercover and  
Lurking beneath my mask  
Of this year's featured model.  
Is this too much?  
Close your eyes.  
Care to look inside? I am I!  
  
What may appear  
Might easily be explained,  
But given the situation  
Of info saturation,  
What you feel can never go away.  
  
Steering perception? I am!  
Inviting contradiction? I am!  
It's my insistence  
You keep your distance  
From the glare behind my stare.  
So this is the way  
The game is played.  
You can leave now...  
But I think you'll stay. I am I!
