Everybody's busy decorating Christmas trees  
And outside icicles hanging from the eaves  
And the snowlakes are flyin' just as far as I can see  
But it won't seem like Christmas to me  
No it won't seem like Christmas you'll be there and I'll be here  
So I'll decorate a heartache with my tears  
So have a merry merry Christmas wherever you may be  
Oh but it won't seem like Christmas to me  
No it won't seem like Christmas what Christmas without you  
I'll be lonely but my darling I'll be true  
So have a merry merry Christmas wherever you may be  
Oh but it won't seem like Christmas to me  
No it won't seem like Christmas to me
