In my mind I'm going to carolina  
Can't you see the sunshine  
Can't you just feel the moon shining  
Aint it just like a friend of mine  
It hit me from behind  
And I'm going to carolina in my mind  
  
Karen shes a silver sun  
You best walk her way and watch it shining  
Watch her watch the morning come  
A silver tear appearing now I'm crying aint I  
I'm going to carolina in my mind  
  
There aint no doubt it no ones mind  
That loves the finest thing around  
Whisper something soft and kind  
Hey babe the skys on fire I'm dying well aint I  
I'm going to carolina in my mind  
  
In my mind I'm going to carolina  
Can't you see the sunshine  
Can't you just feel the moon shining  
Aint it just like a friend of mine  
To hit me from behind  
And I'm going to carolina in my mind  
  
Dark and silent late last night  
I think I might have heard the highway calling  
Geese in flight and dogs that bite  
Signs that might be omens say I going going  
I'm going to carolina in my mind  
Now with a holy host of others standing round me  
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon  
And it seems like it goes on like this forever  
You must forgive me  
If I'm up and going to carolina in my mind  
  
In my mind I'm going to carolina  
Can't you see the sunshine  
Can't you just feel the moon shining  
Aint it just like a friend of mine  
To hit me from behind  
And I'm going to carolina in my mind  
Going to carolina in my mind  
Going to carolina in my mind
