On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you  
And hold you close to me, all night long.  
So many lover's games I could play with you  
And on that hand I see no reason why it's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
But on the other hand, There's a golden band  
To remind of someone who would not understand  
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man  
But the reason I must go is on the other hand  
  
In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died  
When I looked into your eyes I found myself  
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive  
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else  
  
[Chorus]
