What must I do to take a holiday  
Show me a bill that they can make me pay  
Tell me a story  
And maybe I'll believe it  
  
Me I'm just a lucky guy  
Young and free  
Too hard to cry  
  
Lorna from my school she's 21  
She's good looking and a married girl so  
Tell me a story  
Tell me stories  
And man I ain't complaining  
  
Me I'm just a lucky guy  
Young and hard  
Too tough to cry  
  
Standing in a show  
The lights ain't low  
They're shining down on me  
And I like, I like it  
Just like I like I like it  
I'm taking like I find it  
  
What did they do to chill the joy away  
What did they do to say you had to pay  
And pay  
And pay  
Tell me stories  
You know I never can believe them  
Never ever  
  
Me I'm just a lucky guy  
I'm young and free  
Too dumb to cry  
  
What must I do to take a holiday  
Show me a bill that they can make me pay  
Tell me a story  
And maybe I'll believe it  
  
Me I'm just a lucky guy  
I'm Young and free  
Too hard to cry
