(feat. Tommy James)  
  
Now I don't hardly know her  
But I think I could love her  
Crimson and clover  
  
Ah  
Well if she come walkin' over  
Now I been waitin' to show her  
Crimson and clover  
Over and over  
  
Yeah  
My mind's such a sweet thing  
I wanna do everything  
What a beautiful feeling  
Crimson and clover  
Over and over  
  
[Instrumental break]  
  
Crimson and clover, over and over  
[Repeat to fade]
