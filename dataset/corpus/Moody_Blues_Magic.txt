When I look in your eyes  
I can't see why  
There's no reflection of me  
When I look in your heart  
Let it be the start  
Work your magic on me  
  
When I look in your eye  
I can't see why  
It's all a mystery to me  
When I ask you to look inside and tell me why  
Nothing can change what will be  
  
Baby work your magic on me  
Baby work your magic on me  
I'm in a state of permanent confusion  
Without your love  
Without your love  
Baby work your magic on me  
  
When I look in your mind  
Is there a reason why  
It's all an illusion to me  
I was lost in the game  
That only two can play  
When you work your magic on me  
  
Baby work your magic on me  
Baby work your magic on me  
I'm in a state of permanent confusion  
Without your love  
Without your love  
Baby work your magic on me  
  
What kind of love is this you're talking about  
It's got no reason got no easy way out  
What kind of love as got a hold of me  
What kind of love  
What kind of love  
What kind of love  
Baby work your magic on me  
  
When I look in your eye  
I can see why  
There's no reflection of me  
I should have known from the start  
That you would steal my heart  
If you work all your magic on me  
  
Baby work your magic on me  
Baby work your magic on me  
I'm in a state of permanent confusion  
Without your love  
Without your love  
I know I want to be with you tonight  
Baby work your magic on me
