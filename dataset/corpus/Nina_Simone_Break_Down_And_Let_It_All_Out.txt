Break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
I've held back my tears  
Just as long as I could  
But now my eyes can see  
It's all over for you and me  
And holding back ain't gonna do no good  
I'm gonna break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
I've hidden my heart too many times before  
Now my aching heart knows that we're apart  
And I can't hide it anymore  
So I'm gonna break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
I remember when you used to love me and oh how sweet it was...  
But it's not enough just to remember, 'cause  
What good is the past?  
Once upon a time...  
All those old memories can set my heart at ease  
So before I lose my mind...yeah  
I'm gonna break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
My eyes are open and now I see it's all over for you and me  
Break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
Now my aching heart knows that we're apart  
Break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out  
All those old memories can set my heart at ease  
Break down and let it all out  
Break down and let it all out...
