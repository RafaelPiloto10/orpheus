You say you gotta go now  
Well that's ok  
Run away  
Like some lost child  
  
You say I never cared much  
That's no lie  
Run away  
Don't waste your time  
  
You never listen  
You never did  
But before you walk away  
There's just one thing I've got to say  
  
Stay  
Why won't you stay  
Run away  
Like some black rose  
  
You say I never loved you  
So you're taking sides  
But when there seems no reason  
It's just jealousy and pride  
  
You never listen  
You never did  
But before you walk away  
There's just one thing I've got to say  
  
Stay  
Why won't you stay  
Run away  
Like some black rose  
  
But bfore you walk away  
There's just one thing I've got to say  
Stay  
Why won't you stay  
Run away  
Like some black rose  
  
Kisses over oceans like scarlet coloured knives  
The universal wheel that dominates our lives  
Run away  
Like some black rose  
  
  
Repeat 3 times
