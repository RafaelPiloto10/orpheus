Let's go get stoned  
Let's go get stoned  
  
When your baby won't let you in  
Got a few pennies, a bottle of gin  
Just call your buddy on the telephone  
  
Let's go get stoned  
Let's go get stoned  
Let's go get stoned  
  
When you work so hard all the day long  
And everything you do seems to go wrong  
Just drop by my place on your way home  
Let's go get stoned  
  
It ain't no harm  
You're takin just a taste  
But don't blow your cool  
And start messing up the place  
  
It ain't no harm you're faking just a nip  
But make sure you don't fall down bust your lip  
  
Let's go get stoned  
Let's go get stoned
