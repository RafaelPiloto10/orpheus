Oh it's crying time again  
Youre gonna leave me  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
I can tell by the wayyou hold me, darling  
That it wont be long  
Before it's crying time  
Oh they say that absence makes  
The heart grow fonder  
(fonder)  
And that tears are on their way  
To make love grow  
(grow)  
Well, my love foryou could never,  
Never, never, never grow no stronger  
(stronger)  
If I live to be a hundred,  
And I say a hundred years old  
Oh you say that youve found someone  
You love better  
That's the way it's happened  
Every time before  
(before)  
And as sure as the sun comes out tomorrow  
(tomorrow)  
Crying time will start  
When you walk out  
When you walk out my door  
Oh it's crying time again  
Youre gonna leave me  
(I can feel it now)  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
(I can feel it now)  
(I can see it baby inyour eyes)  
I can tell by way you hold me, darling  
That it wont be long before it's crying time  
No it wont be long before it's crying time!
