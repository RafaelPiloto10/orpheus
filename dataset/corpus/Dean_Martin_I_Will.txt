I don't want to be the one to say I'm gonna miss you but I will  
I don't want to say I'm gonna cry my eyes out baby but I will  
I'm not ashamed for you to know how much I really love you so  
'Cause it was such a thrill  
And just remember when you're gone there'll be that someone sad who loves you
still  
  
You will look at him and see me smiling back at you  
I know you will (You will)  
And you will find yourself repeating things we used to do  
I know you will (You will)  
  
Don't wonder if you want to come back just come running home to me  
And let me feel that thrill  
'cause I'm the one who told you  
I would love you dear forever and I will  
  
Oh, I will  
Yes, I will  
  
Don't wonder if you want to come back just come running home to me  
And let me feel that thrill  
'Cause I'm the one who told you  
I would love you dear forever and I will  
'Cause I'm the one who told you  
I would love you dear forever and I will  
(I will)
