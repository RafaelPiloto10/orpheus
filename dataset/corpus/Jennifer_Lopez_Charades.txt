Break it, you buy it  
Nothing's for free  
Especially my body  
Especially me  
Break it, you bought it  
I pray that you don't  
Don't do what all guys do  
Do what all guys do  
  
Just forgetting to be social  
When you turn to dishonest  
Think that running the street's worthy  
That just turns months into weeks into days  
I ain't wanna be cordial  
I'm just speaking to your conscience  
  
You want to take it but I won't give it away  
Leave me in a mess I never made  
Tryin' to play a game I never learned  
No one ever wins a love charade  
  
You think that you're the only that ever say  
You love me when it's over  
  
Break it, you buy it  
This one's on me  
Don't start a riot  
Don't cause a scene  
Start up a fire  
Pray that you don't  
Don't do what all guys do  
Do what all guys do  
  
Just forgetting to be social  
When you turn to dishonest  
Think that running the street's worthy  
That just turns months into weeks into days  
I ain't wanna be cordial  
I'm just speaking to your conscience  
  
You want to take it but I won't give it away  
Leave me in a mess I never made  
Tryin' to play a game I never learned  
No one ever wins a love charade  
  
You think that you're the only that ever say  
You love me when it's over  
  
You shoulda took your time  
Did it right when you had me, baby  
You shoulda took your time  
Shoulda took your time (when you had me)  
You shoulda took your time  
Did it right when you had me, baby  
She was playing games, all those love charades  
  
You want to take it but I won't give it a away  
Leave me in a mess I never made  
Tryin' to play a game I never learned  
No one ever wins the love charade  
  
You think that you're the only that ever say  
You love me when it's over
