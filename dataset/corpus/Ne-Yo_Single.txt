Everybody in the club right now  
Tell the DJ to turn it loud  
Baby girl this your favorite song,  
This for girls who got their on car,  
This for girls who got their on crib,  
This for girls who got their on shh,  
  
If you came here by yourself tonight  
Cause he wouldn't pick up the phone  
He was supposed to bring u here tonight  
Couldn't find him so you came alone  
  
It don't matter cause your here now  
And the music your enjoying  
So for the next couple minutes  
Baby I'ma be your boyfriend  
  
[Bridge]  
Pretty mama if your single, single  
(You don't gotta be alone tonight)  
So while the DJ play this single, single
