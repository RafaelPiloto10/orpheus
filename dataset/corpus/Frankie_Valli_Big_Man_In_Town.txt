Big man in town...  
  
Each day as I grow older,  
The nights are getting colder.  
Some day the sun will shine on me.  
Money, I don't have any:  
I'm down to my last penny,  
But, darling, don't cry over me:  
  
I'll be a big man in town (honest, honey)  
I'll be a big man in town (promise, darling)  
I'll be a big man in town, just you wait and see:  
You'll be proud of me.  
  
They think that I'm a rover,  
But my roving days are over.  
Someday your folks will welcome me.  
I went away a small man,  
But I'll come home a tall man.  
Then what a pretty bride you'll be.  
  
I'll be a big man in town (honest, honey)  
I'll be a big man in town (promise, darling)  
I'll be a big man in town, just you wait and see:  
You'll be proud of me.  
  
I'm gonna make it, just wait and see.  
I'm gonna make it, just wait and see.  
Just wait and see,  
Girl, I'm gonna make it, just wait and see.
