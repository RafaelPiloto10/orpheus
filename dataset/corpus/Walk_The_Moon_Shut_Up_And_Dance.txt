Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
We were victims of the night,  
The chemical, physical, kryptonite  
Helpless to the bass and faded light  
Oh we were born to get together,  
Born to get together.  
  
She took my arm,  
I don't know how it happened.  
We took the floor and she said  
  
Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,  
My discotheque, Juliet teenage dream.  
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.  
I knew we were born to be together,  
Born to be together  
  
She took my arm,  
I don't know how it happened.  
We took the floor and she said  
  
Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
Deep in her eyes,  
I think I see the future.  
I realize this is my last chance.  
  
She took my arm,  
I don't know how it happened.  
We took the floor and she said  
  
Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance!  
  
Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
Oh oh oh shut up dance with me  
Oh oh oh shut up dance with me
