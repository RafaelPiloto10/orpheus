Who put the palm over my blond?  
Who put all the tar on the morning sand?  
Who took everything from where it once was  
And put it where it was last seen?  
  
Fontainebleau, they painted it green  
Fontainebleau, for the well-to-do  
At the Fontainebleau.  
  
There's a palace in the gravy  
That's holding on and on and on  
Even after all the blue-haired ladies  
And the wheelchairs are gone.  
  
I guess the reason I'm so scared of it  
Is I stayed there once and I almost fit  
I left before I got out of it  
People were drownin' in their own  
  
Fontainebleau  
Fontainebleau, was that me?  
Fontainebleau, well I guess I'll see  
Fontainebleau.  
  
Fontainebleau, where the surfer works  
Fontainebleau, 'til the break of day  
Fontainebleau, 'cause it takes a shark  
Fontainebleau, to catch a wave at the Fontainebleau.
