Here we are alone again  
In your arms again  
And it keeps on better  
Well I don't need  
To read your mind  
?Cause when I look in your eyes  
I can almost see forever  
  
But before you go too far  
Before I fall too fast  
Baby you should know  
I need love that's gonna last  
You gotta promise to be here  
Through the laughter and the tears  
Lemme know that you're mine  
Everyday, every night ?cause  
  
There's just no other way to love me  
Take my heart  
Take my soul  
Baby never let me go  
No, there's just no other way to love me  
That's the way  
It should be  
If you're gonna fall in love with me  
?Cause there's just no other way to love me  
  
Let me show you how much I care  
And baby I swear  
I'll be right there when you need me  
But I gotta know  
That you'll always be true  
That you're gonna see this through  
And give your heart completely  
  
I wanna feel it when we kiss  
Believe it when we touch  
Don't just say you love  
?Cause words are not enough  
I wanna see it in your eyes  
Believe it deep inside  
I gotta know you'll be here  
Every day, every night  
  
I will never ask for mere that I'll give to you  
Gonna give my everything  
But I gotta know that your heart is true  
Everyday, everyday  
Every night, every night  
For the rest of my life
