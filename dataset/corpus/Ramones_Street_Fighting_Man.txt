Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy  
'Cause summer's here and the time is right  
For fighting in the street, boy  
But what can a poor boy do  
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
'Cause in sleepy London town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man, no  
Hey, think the time is right for a palace revolution  
But where I live the game to play is compromise solution  
Well, then what can a poor boy do  
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
'Cause in sleepy London town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man, no  
Hey, said my name is called disturbance  
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants  
Well, what can a poor boy do  
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
'Cause in sleepy London town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man, no
