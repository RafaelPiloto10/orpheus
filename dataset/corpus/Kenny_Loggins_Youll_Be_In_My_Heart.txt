Come stop your crying,  
It will be all right  
Just take my hand and hold on tight  
I will protect you from all around you  
I will be here don't you cry  
  
For one so small, you seem so strong  
My arms on hold you, keep you safe and warm  
This bond between us can't be broken  
I will be here, don't you cry  
  
'Cause you'll be in my heart  
Yes, you'll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
You'll be in my heart  
No matter what they say  
You'll be here in my heart  
Always  
  
Sometimes we can't express the way we feel  
You learn to trust but you can't explain  
We may seem different but deep inside us  
We're not that different at all  
  
'Cause you'll be in my heart  
Yes, you'll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
No matter what happens  
There's one thing I know  
We've got each other  
To help us grow  
You'll see in time  
I know  
I know  
  
When destiny calls you, you must be strong  
I may not be with you, so you gotta hold on  
You'll see in time  
I know  
  
We'll always be together 'cause...  
  
You'll be in my heart  
Always you'll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
Oooh You'll be in my heart  
No matter what they say  
You'll be here in my heart always  
Always  
Always  
For always in all ways  
You'll be in my heart  
Always in all ways  
  
Whenever you call  
If you ever need me  
I'll be there beside you  
My little
