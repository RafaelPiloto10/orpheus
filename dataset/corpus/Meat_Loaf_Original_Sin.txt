I've been looking for an original sin.  
One with a twist and a bit of a spin.  
I've done all of the old ones.  
Till they've all been done in.  
  
Now I'm just looking  
Then I'm gone with the wind  
Endlessly searching for an original sin.  
You can dance forever.  
  
You got a fire in your feet.  
But will it ever be enough?  
You know it'll never be enough.  
You can fly and never land.  
  
And never need to sleep.  
But will it ever be enough?  
You know it'll never be enough.  
Not enough to make the nightmares go away.  
  
Not enough to make the tears run dry.  
Not enough to live a little better everyday.  
Everything that they taught us.  
Was nothing but lies.  
  
Everything thing they brought us.  
Was nothing but bribes.  
But it'll all be over now  
All I wanted was a piece of the night.  
  
I never got an equal share.  
When the stars are out of sight.  
And the moon is down  
The natives are so restless tonight.  
  
I've been looking for an original sin.  
One with a twist and a bit of a spin.  
I've done all of the old ones.  
Till they've all been done in.  
  
Now I'm just looking  
Then I'm gone with the wind  
Endlessly searching for an original sin.  
You can lose yourself in pleasure.  
Till your body's going numb.  
  
But will it ever be enough?  
You know it'll never be enough.  
You can always take whatever.  
You conceivably could want.  
  
But will it ever be enough?  
You know it'll never be enough.  
Not enough to make the nightmares go away.  
Not enough to make the tears run dry.  
  
Not enough to live a little better everyday.  
Everything that they taught us.  
Was nothing but lies.  
Everything thing they brought us.  
  
Was nothing but bribes.  
But the lies are over now  
All I wanted was a piece of the night.  
It neve rhad to get so dark.  
  
When the stars are out of sight  
And the moon is down  
The natives are so restless tonight.  
I've been looking for an original sin.  
  
One with a twist and a bit of a spin.  
I've done all of the old ones.  
Till they've all been done in.  
Now I'm just looking  
For an original sin.  
  
I've been looking for the ultimate crime.  
Infinite victims, infinitesimal time  
And I'm so guilty for no reson or rhyme.  
So now I'm just looking.  
  
And killing some time  
Endlessly searching for the ultimate crime.  
I've been looking for an original sin.  
One with a twist and a bit of a spin.  
  
I've done all of the old ones.  
Till they've all been done in.  
Now I'm just looking  
Then I'm gone with the wind  
Endlessly searching for an original sin.  
  
I'm applying for a license to thrill.  
Going out on the edge  
Moving in for the kill.  
They'll be hell to pay someday.  
So put it all on the bill.  
Cause we'll always be paying!  
  
And paying until  
We're beyond expiration.  
With a license to thrill.
