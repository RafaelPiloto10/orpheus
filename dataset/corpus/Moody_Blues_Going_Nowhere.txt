Once more I've loved I've laughed and I've lost  
Now I'm alone left counting the cost  
Once more sweet child of middling years  
Basted again in bitter-sweet tears  
I will survive the solitude  
But come alive  
Although the new  
  
Somebody tell me you love me  
Somebody tell me you care  
I've got a heart full of giving  
Going nowhere (going nowhere)  
  
Daylight will come and steal the night sights  
Starlight on black replaced with gray light  
Now I must go and set my best pace  
Running all day in the human race  
But now I know the good news  
Before you win you have to lose  
  
Somebody tell me you love me  
Somebody tell me you care  
I've got a heart full of giving  
Going nowhere going nowhere  
  
How much longer must I travel on  
Looking for someone to help me sing my song  
How much longer will it be  
I need to find someone  
For the love  
From me  
  
Somebody tell me you love me  
Somebody tell me you care  
I've got a heart full of giving  
Going nowhere (going nowhere)
