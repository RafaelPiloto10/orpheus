Comin' back on  
Comin' back strong  
Turnin' back on  
Takin' the heat out in the street  
Baby too long  
Can you tell me how much fire  
Will it take to get us higher  
Hearin' the news, singin' the blues  
You gotta choose  
Stand up and fight, do it tonight  
What can you lose  
In a world of fading treasure  
Love is the greatest pleasure  
So let's go up, forget about down  
'Cause in this town, it's gonna get rough  
And what goes down, is up to us  
So let's go up, baby let's go up  
When it gets hot, like it or not  
You want to run  
Though it's so warm here in my arms  
You won't get burned  
In a world of fading treasures  
The pleasure of your treasures  
Can not be measured up  
Ooh, I can't free a person from their charms  
But I'll tell you this for sure  
If nothing is ventured  
Then nothing is gained, let's go
