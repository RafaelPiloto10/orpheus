When you were mine  
I was still playing  
And promises that I made  
Were just words I was saying  
I was playing you for a fool  
Breaking love's precious rule  
  
I did you so wrong  
Guess you knew all along  
That I had my boss lie for me  
To say I was working late  
My friends alibied for me  
When I'd slip out to meet a date  
But, baby, now I see  
I was only cheating me  
Before you go  
I just want you to know  
  
That I've had a change of heart  
I've had a change of heart  
I see what I put you through  
And I'll make it up to you  
I've had a change of heart  
I've just got to show you  
How differently I feel  
That I can be true to you  
That my love is real  
  
But my past will forever haunt me  
If you say that you don't want me  
I'm down on my knees  
  
I'm beggin' you please, won't you?  
Have a change of heart  
Please have a, have a change of heart  
I see what I put you through  
I'll make it up to you  
  
Please have a change of heart  
Please have a change of heart  
Please have a change of heart
