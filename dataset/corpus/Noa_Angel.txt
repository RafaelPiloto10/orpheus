Angel with a broken wing  
Never leaves the ground  
Angel, trying hard to sing  
But she can't make a decent sound.  
  
Angel with a broken wing  
Feeling so alone  
Angel, she's tried everything  
But she can't find her way back home.  
  
So she wanders in disguise  
With a longing in her eyes  
And she looks up to the skies  
But there's nothing there but grey  
She looks down and turns away...  
  
Angel with a broken wing  
In our neighborhood  
Angel, look how things turn bad  
When you're so busy being good  
  
So she wanders in disguise  
With a longing in her eyes  
And she looks up to the skies  
But there's nothing there but grey  
She looks down and turns away...  
  
Angel with a broken wing  
Feeling so alone  
Angel, she's tried everything  
But she can't find her way back home.  
No, she can't find her way,  
Her way back home.
