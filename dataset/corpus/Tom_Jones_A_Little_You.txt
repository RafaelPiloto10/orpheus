There's a little truth in  
Every lie you tell me  
A little good in all the bad  
You do, yes  
So instead of running away  
Why don't you listen  
When I say  
All I want is just a little you  
  
I've been wanting you to say  
The words, I love you  
A little love is gonna make  
All my dreams come true, oh  
So instead of running away  
Why don't you listen to me  
When I say  
All I want is just a little you  
  
Ooh, there's nothing in this  
World I couldn't do  
If you would only say  
You love me true  
'Cause, baby, all I want is  
A little you  
Through the day and through  
The nighttime too  
Just a little you  
  
There's a little truth in every  
Little lie that you tell me  
A little good in all the bad  
You do, yes  
Instead of running away  
Why don't you listen to me  
When I say  
That all I want is just a little you  
Oh, child,  
I said all I want  
Is just a little you
