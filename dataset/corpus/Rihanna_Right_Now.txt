Tomorrow way too far away  
And we can't get back yesterday  
But we young right now  
We got right now  
So get up right now  
'Cause all we got is right now  
  
Tomorrow way too far away  
And we can't get back yesterday  
But we young right now  
We got right now  
So get up right now  
'Cause all we got is right now  
  
Baby tonight I need you  
And I feel it when I see you  
Wherever you wanna go  
Whenever baby I'm yours  
  
Tomorrow way too far away  
And we can't get back yesterday  
But we young right now  
We got right now  
So get up right now  
'Cause all we got is right now

So close I can taste you  
Ain't escape I can take you  
Can't fight the feeling  
Got me feel feeling

Something you wanted to do all your life  
There's no more waiting tonight is the night  
And it can't be wrong not if it feels this right  
Turn it up, scream it loud, yeah

And we can't get back yesterday  
But we young right now  
We got right now
