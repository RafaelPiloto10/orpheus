Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind  
Have you ever wondered why  
When everything goes wrong  
Nobody stops to lend a hand  
Nobody seems to care  
Then she looks you in the eye  
And suddenly you're strong  
And very soon you realise  
That you didn't care about love  
  
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind  
Your ears are deaf, your mouth is dumb, your eyes are blind  
Listen to me and very soon I think you'll find  
Somebody wants to help you, somebody seems to care  
And very soon you've forgotten that you didn't care about love  
  
Does it hurt to realise  
You've been acting very strange  
Refusing to take the love she gives  
Pretending you don't care  
Did it take you by surprise  
To discover how you'd changed  
How you forgot to remember  
That you didn't care about love  
  
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind  
Your ears are deaf, your mouth is dumb, your eyes are blind  
Listen to me and very soon I think you'll find  
Somebody wants to help you, somebody seems to care  
And very soon you've forgotten  
That you didn't care about love  
  
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind  
Your ears are deaf, your mouth is dumb, your eyes are blind  
Listen to me and very soon I think you'll find  
Somebody wants to help you, somebody seems to care  
And very soon you've forgotten  
That you didn't care about love
