After all the tears I've cried  
You'd think I would give up on love  
Get off this line  
But maybe I might get it right this time  
  
I was there as passion turned to pain  
Sunshine turned to rainy days  
Yet here I am  
Ready to begin once again  
  
All my life I've been a dreamer  
Dreamin' dreams that always broke in two  
But I still believe in love  
And I love believing  
Maybe you can make my dreams come true  
  
Here content with who I am  
I'm reachin' out my hand to him  
Once again  
At least I know I've made myself a friend  
  
All my life I've been a dreamer  
Dreamin' dreams that never quite came true  
But I still believe in love  
And I love believing  
I'll keep on dreaming  
Because I still believe in love  
  
I still believe in love  
And me  
And you  
I still believe in love
