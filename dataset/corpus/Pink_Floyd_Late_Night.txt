When I woke up today  
And you weren't there to play  
Then I wanted to be with you  
When you showed me your eyes  
Whispered love at the skies  
Then I wanted to stay with you  
Inside me I feel alone and unreal  
And the way you kiss will always be  
A very special thing to me...  
  
When I lay still at night seeing  
Stars high and light  
Then I wanted to be with you  
When the rooftops shone dark  
All alone (I) saw a spark  
Spark of love just to stay with you  
Inside me I feel alone and unreal  
And the way you kiss will always be  
A very special thing to me...  
  
If I mention your name  
Turn around on a chain  
Then the sky opens for you  
When we grew very tall  
When I saw you so small  
Then I wanted to stay with you  
Inside me I feel alone and unreal  
And the way you kiss will always be  
A very special thing to me...
