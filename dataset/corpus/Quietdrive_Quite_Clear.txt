Evicted from the ocean  
So far that I can see that  
Evicted from the ocean  
So far that I can see that  
  
Passing by  
My untrained eyes  
Searching for  
Your sentiment  
Made me see  
Six moves ahead  
Why can't I  
Make since of this  
  
You went away  
You went away  
You went away  
Why didn't you  
You went away  
I wouldn't stay  
I couldn't change  
  
Chorus  
But it's not quite clear  
And it's not quite dead  
What went on that night  
In my pain in my head  
And I never got  
To see you again  
Anymore  
  
I've been told  
That I was wrong  
Why can't we  
Be us again  
  
You went away  
You went away  
You went away  
Why didn't you  
You went away  
I wouldn't stay  
I couldn't change  
  
Chorus  
  
You could come stay  
What'd you say when  
I was lost  
But you expected  
I would come back home  
Would come back home  
What'd you think when  
I was lost  
But you pretended  
I was lost  
But you pretended I  
Would come back home  
  
Chorus  
  
Evicted from the ocean  
So far that I can see that  
Evicted from the ocean  
So far that I can see that
