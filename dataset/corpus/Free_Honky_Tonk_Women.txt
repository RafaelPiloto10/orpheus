I met her, just a barroom queen in Memphis  
She tried to make me upstairs for a ride  
She had to carry me right across her shoulder  
'Cause I just can't seem to drink her off of my mind  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl  
  
I met her either say in New York City  
I had to put up a one heck of a fight  
The lady said she'd covered me with roses  
She broke my nose and then she broke my mind  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl  
  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl  
  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl  
  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl
