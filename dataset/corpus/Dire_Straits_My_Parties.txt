Well this is my back yard  
My back gate  
I hate to start my parties late  
Here's the party cart  
Ain't that great ?  
That ain't the best part baby  
Just wait  
That's a genuine weathervane  
It moves with the breeze  
Portable hammock honey  
Who needs trees  
It's casual entertaining  
We aim to please  
At my parties  
  
Check out the shingles  
It's brand new  
Excuse me while I mingle  
Hi, how are you  
Hey everybody  
Let me give you a toast  
This one's for me  
The host with the most  
  
It's getting a trifle colder  
Step inside my home  
That's a brass toilet tissue holder with it's own telephone  
That's musical doorbell  
It don't ring, I ain't kiddin'  
It plays America the beautiful and tie a yellow ribbon  
  
Boy, this punch is a trip  
It's o.k. in my book  
Here, take a sip  
Maybe little heaven on the fruit  
Ah, here comes the dip  
You may kiss the cook  
Let me show you honey  
It's easy, look  
You take a fork and spire 'em  
Say, did you try these ?  
So glad you like 'em  
The secret's in the cheese  
It's casual entertaining  
We aim to please  
At my parties  
  
Now don't talk to me about the polar bear  
Don't talk to me about ozone layer  
Ain't so much of anything these days, even the air  
They're running out of rhinos  
What do I care ?  
Let's hear it for the dolphin  
Let's hear it for the trees  
Ain't runnin' out of nothin' in my deep freeze  
It's casual entertaining  
We aim to please  
At my parties
