Oh you're a holiday, such a holiday  
Oh you're a holiday, such a holiday  
  
It's something I thinks worthwhile  
If the puppet makes you smile  
If not then you're throwing stones  
Throwing stones, throwing stones  
  
Ooh it's a funny game  
Don't believe that it's all the same  
Can't think what I've just said  
Put the soft pillow on my head  
  
Millions of eyes can see  
Yet why am I so blind  
When the someone else is me  
It's unkind, it's unkind  
  
Yet millions of eyes can see  
Yet why am I so blind  
When the someone else is me  
It's unkind, it's unkind  
  
Ooh you're a holiday, every day , such a holiday  
Now it's my turn to say, and I say you're a holiday  
It's something I thinks worthwhile  
If the puppet makes you smile  
If not then you're throwing stones  
Throwing stones, throwing stones
