There in your eyes, I see  
That you want to be free  
There by your side, I'll be  
If you still want me  
  
Please think about it (Think about it)  
I need your love  
I'm no good without it (Think about it)  
Please think about it (Think about it)  
Give me your love  
I can't live without it  
  
Oh no  
Never leave my side  
Baby please decide  
I'm in love with you  
I hope you want me too  
  
Don't go  
Say there's nothing wrong  
Stay where you belong  
I'll be good to you  
That's all I wanna do  
  
Please think about it (Think about it)  
I need your love  
I'm no good without it (Think about it)  
Please think about it (Think about it)  
Give me your love  
I can't live without it  
  
Oh no  
Never leave my side  
Baby please decide  
I'm in love with you  
I hope you want me, too  
  
Don't go  
Say there's nothing wrong  
Stay where you belong  
I'll be good to you  
That's all I wanna do  
  
So, if you have to go  
I won't stand in your way  
But, if you decide to stay  
I will be your guide  
  
Please think about it (Think about it)  
I need your love  
I'm no good without it (Think about it)  
Please think about it (Think about it)  
Give me your love
