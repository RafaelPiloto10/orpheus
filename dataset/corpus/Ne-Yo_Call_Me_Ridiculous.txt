I never said that every choice I made everyone was gonna like.  
I never said that satisfying the masses was how I would live my life.  
I never once did I say all of my decisions would be right.  
I never said I would ignore my heart and listen with just my mind.  
  
Hmm, and I know it looks like I've gone crazy.  
But in the way of love and what it does, I'll be crazy for us.  
  
So call me a fool, call me insane.  
Tell me that loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
I don't mind, no I don't mind.  
Forget the rules, I'm over the game.  
Baby yeah loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
Then call me ridiculous. Call me ridiculous.  
  
Everyone knows what I'm suppose to do.  
Everybody says I'm out my mind to feel what I feel for you.  
(Feel what I feel for you.)  
Everybody needs to mind their own, to this love I'm not brand new. (Brand  
New)  
Oh, see I know when it's real love, though they think I don't have a clue,  
Oooh I do.  
  
Hmm, and I know it looks like I've gone crazy.  
(I know it looks like I'm crazy.)  
But in the way of love and what it does, I'll be crazy for us.  
  
So call me a fool, call me insane.  
Tell me that loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
I don't mind, no I don't mind.  
Forget the rules, I'm over the game.  
Baby yeah loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
Then call me ridiculous. Call me ridiculous.  
  
For seeing something inside of you that no one else can see.  
That's why they don't understand me, no.  
It's so stupid. (Stupid) Idiot, blind to it.  
Say what will I don't mind, baby that's what it'll be.  
(That's what it'll be.) Long as it's always "we".  
Ridiculous that's me. Oh whoa oh, ridiculous that's me.  
Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa oh.  
  
So call me a fool, call me insane.  
Tell me that loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
I don't mind, no I don't mind.  
Forget the rules, I'm over the game.  
Baby yeah loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
Then call me ridiculous.  
  
So call me a fool, call me insane.  
Tell me that loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
I don't mind, no I don't mind.  
Forget the rules, I'm over the game.  
Baby yeah loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
Then call me ridiculous. Call me ridiculous.
