Somebody help me  
I'm feeling low  
I've been down for so long  
Don't know which way to go  
Drowning in sorrow  
In deep misery  
Someone throw me a line  
I'm clean out of time  
Lord I've got to break free  
  
You came along like a sun in the night  
Took me out of the shadows  
Into the light!  
  
Caught in a crossfire  
Of heartache and pain  
Searching so many years  
Thro' a river of tears  
Always shot down in flames  
  
You came along like a sun in the night  
Took me out of the shadows  
Into the light!  
  
[Chorus]  
Now these are the best years  
Truly the best years of my life  
The best years of my life  
  
Bad luck and trouble  
Everyday of my life  
Every lonely lonely night  
Like a cold hearted twist of the knife  
  
You came along like a sun in the night  
Took me out of the shadows  
Into the light!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somebody help me  
I'm feeling low  
I've been down so long  
Babe I've got to let go  
  
You came along like a sun in the night  
Took me out of the shadows  
Into the light!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeats Til Fade]  
The best years of my life
