We say I love you and we're so sincere  
I look in your eyes and it becomes quite clear  
You want what I want, you need what I need  
When I turn to leave  
You plead, and plead, and plead, and plead, and plead  
We're so sincere  
We're so sincere  
We're so sincere  
We're so sincere  
  
Now I'm sure I'm right and I'm so sincere  
You convince me I'm wrong with a single tear  
You want me so badly, you can't live without me  
When I turn to leave  
You bleed, and bleed, and bleed, and plead, and plead  
  
We're so sincere  
We're so sincere  
We're so sincere  
We're so sincere  
  
We're livin' so fast we're not living at all  
Two sparrows tied together will always fall  
We know we love each other so there's nothin' to prove  
But I'm gonna smother if somebody don't move  
  
We're so sincere  
We're so sincere  
We're so sincere  
We're so sincere
