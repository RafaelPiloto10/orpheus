Shine  
I won't sleep again until I sleep with you  
I won't dream again until I dream again with you  
My love  
  
One look in your eyes and I see  
The light shining through  
I truly believe in the magic of all that you do  
  
Give me hope  
When I need it  
Give me peace  
When I feel it  
Give me life  
When I breathe it  
Give me dreams  
Keep me dreaming  
  
One look in your eyes and I know  
It's right for me and you  
  
Feel the love shine  
Feel the love shine  
Do you feel the love shine?  
Feel the love shine

All good people  
  
Your flame is the fire that burns in the night  
Guiding me through  
Drawn out of the darkness and into the light you bring me to  
  
Give me hope  
When I need it  
Give me peace  
When I feel it  
Give me life  
When I breathe it  
Give me dreams  
Keep me dreaming  
  
One look in your eyes and I know  
That it's right for me and you  
  
Do you feel the love shine?  
Feel the love that shines  
Do you feel the love shine?  
Feel the love that shines  
Do you feel the love?  
  
I won't dream again until I dream again with you

All good people got to feel the love  
I won't sleep again until I sleep again with you  
  
One chance in a million  
To find a true love between two  
Taken by the powers of what you believe  
Knowing you can't lose  
  
Give me hope  
When I need it  
Give me peace  
When I feel it  
Give me life  
When I breathe it  
Give me dreams  
Keep me dreaming  
  
One look in your eyes and I know  
It was meant for me and you  
  
Do you feel the love shine?  
Feel the love that shines  
Do you feel the love shine?  
Feel the love that shines  
Do you feel the love shine?  
I won't dream again until I dream again with you  
Do you feel the love shine?  
I won't sleep again until  
1234567  
Do you feel the love shine?  
Beyond the sun  
Beyond the sky  
These very questions lie  
Starlight  
Loving, in a lifetime  
  
It was the first time candlelight  
Something happens in your lifetime  
It's the dance we all go through  
Bring it in now  
Bring it in true  
Bring it in fast  
Bring it right through  
Right through  
  
Feel the love shine
