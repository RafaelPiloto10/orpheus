Everytime I Came Around  
She Made Her Body Go Down  
Her Physical Was So Crazy  
She Could Make A Blind Man See  
Ooh  
  
Before Then We Got Seperated  
She Was Gone Before I Could Say shit  
And I aint Looking For No Replacement  
Noo-Whoa Whoa Whoa  
If I Gotta Almost Search The Whole Club  
Trying To Get To Her Before she's Sobers Up  
Let Me See You Throw Your hands Up  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa

Under The Strobe Lights  
Looking Like A Star

But Everyone Started Rushing Me  
Looking Through The Crowd

Trying To Get To Her Before she's Sobers Up  
Let Me See You Throw Your hands Up  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa
