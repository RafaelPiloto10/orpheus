Caught out running  
With just a little too much to hide  
Maybe baby  
Everything's gonna work out fine  
Please read the letter  
I pinned it to your door  
It's crazy how it all turned out  
We needed so much more  
  
Too late, too late  
A fool could read the signs  
Maybe baby  
You'd better check between the lines  
Please read the letter, I  
Wrote it in my sleep  
With help and consultation from  
The angels of the deep  
  
Once I stood beside a well of many words  
My house was full of rings and  
Charms and pretty birds  
Please understand me, my  
Walls come falling down  
There's nothing here that's left for you  
But check with lost and found  
  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
  
One more song just before we go  
Remember baby  
All the things  
We used to know  
Please read my letter  
And promise you'll keep  
The secrets and the memories and  
Cherish in the deep  
  
Ah...  
  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote
