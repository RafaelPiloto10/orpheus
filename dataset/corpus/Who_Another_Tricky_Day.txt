You can't always get it  
When you really want it  
You can't always get it at all  
Just because there's space  
In your life it's a waste  
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call  
  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
We all get it in the end  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
We go down and we come up again  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
You irritate me my friend  
(This is no social crisis)  
This is you having fun  
(No crisis)  
Getting burned by the sun  
(This is true)  
This is no social crisis  
Just another tricky day for you  
  
You can always get higher  
Just because you aspire  
You could expire even knowing.  
Don't push the hands  
Just hang on to the band  
You can dance while your knowledge is growing  
  
(It could happen anytime)  
You can't expect to never cry  
(Patience is priceless)  
Not when you try to fly so high  
(Just stay on that line)  
Rock and roll will never die  
(This is no social crisis)  
  
Another tricky day  
Another gently nagging pain  
What the papers say  
Just seems to bring down heavier rain  
The world seems in a spiral  
Life seems such a worthless title  
But break out and start a fire y'all  
It's all here on the vinyl  
(No crisis)  
  
You can't always get it  
When you really want it  
You can't always get it at all  
Just because there's space  
In your life it's a waste  
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call  
  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
Gotta get used to waiting  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
You know how the ice is  
(Just gotta get used to it)  
It's thin where you're skating  
(This is no social crisis)  
  
Just another tricky day for you fella
