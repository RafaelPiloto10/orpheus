Turn your face down,  
it's your chance to meet the man.  
When you saw that,  
tha' nightstick hit his head.  
Saw it fall, on his skull,  
you heard the sound that it made.  
Impressed by the sound,  
he's impressed with himself.  
  
You stand in the way,  
you're the next one down.  
Call it like you see it,  
no muted witness.  
You stand in the way,  
you're the next one down.  
It just might break,  
it just might break down.  
  
It's in the way,  
that you stand up for right,  
that's why the old guard's shaking.  
It lets them know you're there.  
It lets them know,  
that you can't ignore, what you saw.  
Lifting weights of conscious.  
Story of tragic miscarriage.  
  
You stand in the way,  
you're the next one down.  
Call it like you see it,  
no muted witness.  
You stand in the way,  
you're the next one down.  
It might just break,  
just might break,  
break down.  
It just might take more than you have got.  
  
Forgotten something,  
aright you have got.  
Stopping for nothing.  
It might take more than you have got.
