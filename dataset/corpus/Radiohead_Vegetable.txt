I never wanted anything like this  
I worked hard, tried hard  
I ran around in domestic bliss  
I fought hard, died long  
Every time you're running out of here  
Every time you're running I get the fear  
  
I never wanted any broken bones  
Scarred face, no home  
Your words surround me and asphyxiate  
And I burn all hate  
  
Every time you're running out on me  
Every time you're running I can see  
  
I'm not a vegetable  
I will not control myself  
I spit on the hand that feeds me  
I will not control myself  
  
The waters spray, the waters run all over me  
The waters spray, the waters run  
And this time you gonna pay  
  
I'm not a vegetable  
I will not control myself  
I spit on the hand that feeds me  
I will not control myself
