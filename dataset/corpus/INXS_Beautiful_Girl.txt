Nicky's in the corner  
With a black coat on  
Running from a bad home  
With some cat inside  
Now where did you find her  
Among the neon lights  
That haunt the streets outside  
Stay with me  
  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
She wants to go home  
  
From door way to door way  
Street corner to corner  
With neon ghosts in the city  
And she sings  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
  
She's so scared  
So very frightened  
Anything could happen  
Right here tonight  
  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
She wants to go home  
  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)
