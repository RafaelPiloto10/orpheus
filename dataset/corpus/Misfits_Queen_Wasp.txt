Go, go, go, go  
Vampire girl gonna strike to kill  
Gonna kiss your vertebrae  
With the kiss of poisoned love  
Well, I'm a king and you're a queen  
  
Queen wasp go  
Dive in warrior wasps  
Queen wasp go  
  
Go, go, go, go  
Human-looking from the thorax up  
Human stomach and a tiny waist  
My God we're living the life of  
My God we're wasting what I hold  
  
Queen wasp go  
Dive in warrior wasps  
Queen wasp go  
  
Gotta want to see it, baby  
Put the stinger in your back, baby  
Hot stinger in burning, baby  
Human arms and a head of your love  
Think nothing about eating your love  
Think nothing, I'm a king and you're a queen  
  
Queen wasp go  
Dive in warrior wasps  
Queen wasp go  
  
Go, go, go, go  
Go, go, go, go  
Go, go, go, go
