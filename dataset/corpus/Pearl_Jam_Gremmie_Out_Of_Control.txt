Every beach has a clown who thinks he knows it all (hang-ten outta santa fe
when surf comes out tomorrow lets go)  
And he's always practicing his cowabunga call (cowabunga)  
But he'll never scramble when the big waves start to roll  
Cause there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
The kids always know that gremmie's talk is cheap (ride the hula-han over the
pipeline bonsai to the saddle bowl)  
Oh they just try to ignore this ugly creep (cowabunga)  
His board is always full of dings  
Cause he's always doing stupid things  
And there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control
