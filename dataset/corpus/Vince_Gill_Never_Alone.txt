You were like a lost kid looking for home  
You found what you wanted right in my arms  
  
If you walk out on me  
Just leave your memory  
Just take my sympathy and go  
I love you so you're never alone  
  
If you find another one turns your head  
And you can't understand why it hurts so bad  
  
If you walk out on me  
Just leave your memory  
Just take my sympathy and go  
  
If you walk out on me  
Just leave your memory  
Just take my sympathy and go  
I love you so you're never alone  
  
Girl you're never alone  
Never alone
