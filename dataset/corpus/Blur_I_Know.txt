What you want to be is what I am  
How you want to feel is how I feel  
But nothing stays the same when I am here  
Just waiting for it all to disappear  
  
[Chorus]  
I know, I know, I know it'll come between us  
I know, I know  
  
I'd like to get into that pretty head  
Just to see, to see if you are dead  
And it would amuse me just to see how  
How you feel about me and this crowd  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What you want to be is what I am  
How you want to feel is how I feel  
But nothing stays the same when I am here  
Just waiting for it all to disappear  
  
[Chorus: x4]
