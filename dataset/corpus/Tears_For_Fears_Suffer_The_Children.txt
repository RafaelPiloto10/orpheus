It's a sad affair  
When there's no one there  
He calls out in the night  
And it's so unfair  
At least it seems that way  
When you gave him his life  
  
And all this time he's been getting you down  
You ought to pick him up when there's no one around  
And convince him  
Just talk to him  
'cause he knows in his heart you won't be home soon  
He's an only child in an only room  
And he's dependent on you  
  
And it seems so strange  
That at the end of the day  
Making love can be so good  
But the Pain of birth  
What is it worth  
When it don't turn out the way it should
