Its NOT very far away  
It takes about half a day  
To get there  
If we travel by my, dragonfly  
No its not in spain  
But all the same (haha)  
You know  
Its the name  
And the winds just, riggghhtt  
hang on my darlin'  
Hang on TO ME if you wanna go  
Your love puts its all right on the shelf  
When you gimme that Spanish Castle Magic  
Some spanish castle magic  
when the clouds are really low  
And they overflow LIKE cotton candy  
And battlegrounds  
Red and Brown  
But its all in your mind  
Don't waste your time  
On little things like  
Heyyy  
Hey, Hey, Hey  
hang on my darlin'  
Hang on TO ME if you wanna go  
Your love puts its all right on the shelf  
When you gimme some Spanish Castle Magic  
Ooohh spanish castle magic
