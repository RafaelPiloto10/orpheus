I got a feelin' called the blues,  
Since my baby said good-bye  
Lawd I don't know what l'll do  
All I do is sit and sigh  
That last long day she said goodbye  
Well Lawd, I thought I would cry  
She'd do me, she'd do you,  
She's got that kind of lovin'  
Lawd, I love to hear her  
When she calls me sweet daddy  
  
Such a beautiful dream  
I hate to think it's all over  
I lost my heart it seems  
I've grown so used to you somehow  
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now  
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
But she don't care about me  
  
Lawd I tried and tried to keep her satisfied  
But she just wouldn't stay  
So now that she is leavin'  
This is all I say...
