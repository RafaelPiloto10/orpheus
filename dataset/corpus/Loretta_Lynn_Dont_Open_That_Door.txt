Oh, I hear familiar sounds down the sidewalk  
Gettin' closer with every step he takes  
Lord, I'm so afraid that if I look out the window  
I'll be tempted to repeat an old mistake.  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't open that door  
To an old memory,  
When he said goodbye  
I locked it up tight  
And threw out the key.  
I've stood here before  
Lord I can't stand no more  
Won't go there again  
Heart don't let him in  
Don't open that door.  
  
The stronger me has found the will to fight it  
But now he's gone and the weaker side's in tears  
Lord, it took so long to put the hurt behind me  
If I don't look back the past can't find me here.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Won't go there again  
Heart don't let him in  
Don't you open that door
