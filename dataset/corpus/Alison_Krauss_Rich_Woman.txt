I got a woman with plenty of money  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
called my baby late last night  
She told me, daddy, everything was all right  
  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
  
I don't have to worry 'cause she's real fine  
I know my baby and she's all mine  
She give me a Cadillac, a diamond ring  
She told me, daddy, don't you worry 'bout a thing  
  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
  
She's all mine and I'm so glad  
She's the best woman that I ever had  
She's all mine and I'm so glad  
She's all mine and I'm so glad  
She's all mine and I'm so glad  
  
Ah, stop your train  
Ah, mama, stop your train
