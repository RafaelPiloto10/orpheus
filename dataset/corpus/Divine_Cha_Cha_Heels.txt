I'm all dressed up and ready to fall in love.  
Are you ready heels? Stop stomping!  
  
Here I am looking for crime I'm looking for some action  
What I have a million times will give you satisfaction  
So don't you mess around with me you won't know what to do  
'Cause I'll put on my cha cha heels and walk all over you.  
  
Chorus  
Gimme gimme cha cha heels.  
All I want is cha cha heels  
Gimme gimme cha cha heels  
If I don't get my cha cha heels  
I'll walk all over you.  
  
Dressed up just for trouble to do what must be done  
I'm gonna burst your bubble, the fun has just begun  
So don't you mess around with me you won't know what to do  
'Cause I'll put on my cha cha heels and walk all over you.  
  
(chorus)  
  
I'm all dressed up and ready to fall in love!  
I'm all dressed up. Gimme Gimme Gimme!  
  
Going back to Boise I'm itching for a fight  
I'm looking for a lover who loves my dynamite  
So don't you mess around with me you won't know what to do  
'Cause I'll put on my cha cha heels and walk all over you.  
  
(chorus)  
  
Are you ready heels? Stop stomping!
