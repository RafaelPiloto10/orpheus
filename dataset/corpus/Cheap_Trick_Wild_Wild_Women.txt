Lookin' out for something special  
Something crazy to call my own  
Worked all week  
Now that it's over  
Yes I'm ready to bring it on  
Driving to me  
It'll be easy  
After all that's what it's for  
If the fire's too hot  
Get out of the kitchen  
Or do it do it do it on the floor  
  
So get out now  
Before it's too late  
Don't bring me down  
Don't you wait too long  
  
Wild wild women  
Make the world go round  
Wild wild women  
Wild wild girls  
  
Kick your heels  
Set in motion  
After all they never stop  
Feels so good  
Must be illegal  
That's no reason to call the cops  
She goes crazy  
In the corner  
Like some forward flash  
No problems  
No headaches  
No troubles  
That's the best  
  
So come on now  
Before it's too late  
Don't bring me down  
Don't you wait too long  
  
Wild wild women  
Never slow me down  
Wild wild women  
Wild wild girls  
  
So get out now  
Before it's too late  
Don't bring me down  
Don't you wait too long  
  
Wild wild women  
Got a hold on me  
Wild wild women  
Wild wild girls  
Wild wild women  
Make the world go round  
Wild wild women  
Wild wild girls  
Will wild women  
Never slow me down  
Wild wild women  
Will wild girls
