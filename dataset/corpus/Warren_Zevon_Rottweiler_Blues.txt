Got a Glock in the bedside table  
Machine gun leaning by the bedroom door  
Kevlar vest in the closet  
Well, I wear it when I go to the store  
  
Shadows on the window  
Rustling in the hedge  
Faces at the peephole  
Footsteps on the ledge  
  
If you come calling  
He'll be mauling with intent to maim  
Don't knock on my door  
If you don't know my Rottweiler's name  
  
Halogen lights in the driveway  
Guardian Angels living next door  
One hundred pounds of unfriendly persuasion  
Sleeping on the Florida porch  
  
Slackers in the market  
Bangers in the mall  
Skinheads on the golf course  
Hunting for their balls  
  
If you come calling  
He'll be mauling with intent to maim  
Don't knock on my door  
If you don't know my Rottweiler's name  
  
Well, he's dreaming about an intruder or two  
And the promise of burglar blood  
He's yearning to chew on a gangster tattoo  
And to hear the proverbial sickening thud  
  
Shadows on the window  
Rustling in the hedge  
Faces at the peephole  
Footsteps on the ledge  
  
If you come calling  
He'll be mauling with intent to maim  
Don't knock on my door  
If you don't know my Rottweiler's name
