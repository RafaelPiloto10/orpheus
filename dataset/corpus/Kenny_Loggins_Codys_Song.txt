When you feel afraid,  
When you lose your way, I'll find you,  
Just try to smile, and dry your eyes,  
I will bring back the moon into your skies.  
And ever you will, remember darling, I'll be there to:  
  
Say to you  
I'll promise you  
I'll promise to  
Comfort you and say to you  
Darling, I'll be there just for you.  
  
There's so much to learn,  
And when you want me  
Then I'll show you,  
And through the years,  
You'll always be  
The lullaby in the heart of the child in me.  
  
Whenever you will, remember darling  
I'll be there to  
  
Say to you  
I'll promise you  
I'll promise to  
Comfort you and say to you  
Darling, I'll be there just for you.  
  
Hold it, feel it,  
Music is in your heart.  
When you need it,  
Just keep listening,  
Let it sing, let it sing.  
  
Though you've grown away  
No matter how you'll change  
I'll know you.  
And when you tire of life alone,  
There will always be one sure way back home  
  
Just turn on the quiet,  
And you close your eyes  
And listen inside  
(unconditional)  
(unconditional)  
(unconditional)  
  
I'll be there to sing to you,  
I promise you  
I promise to  
Comfort you  
And sing to you.  
  
And darling, I'll be there,  
Anytime, and anywhere,  
Cody I'll be there just for you.
