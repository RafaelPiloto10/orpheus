You and I, we are strangers by one chromosome  
Slave to the hormone, body and soul  
In a struggle to be happy and free  
Swimming in a primitive sea  
  
You and I, we must dive below the surface  
A world of red neon, and ultramarine  
Shining bridges on the ocean floor  
Reaching to the alien shore  
  
For you and me - Sex is not a competition  
For you and me - Sex is not a job description  
For you and me - We agree  
  
You and I, we are pressed into these solitudes  
Color and culture, language and race  
Just variations on a theme  
Islands in a much larger stream  
  
For you and me - Race is not a competition  
For you and me - Race is not a definition  
For you and me - We agree  
  
Reaching for the alien shore  
  
You and I, we reject these narrow attitudes  
We add to each other, like a coral reef  
Building bridges on the ocean floor  
Reaching for the alien shore  
  
For you and me - We hold these truths to be self-evident  
For you and me - We'd elect each other president  
For you and me - We might agree  
But that's just us  
  
Reaching for the alien shore
