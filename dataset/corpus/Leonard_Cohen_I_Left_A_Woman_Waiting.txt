I left a woman waiting  
I met her sometime later  
She said, I see your eyes are dead  
What happened to you, lover?  
What happened to you, my lover?  
What happened to you, lover?  
What happened to you?  
  
And since she spoke the truth to me  
I tried to answer truthfully  
Whatever happened to my eyes  
Happened to your beauty  
Happened to your beauty  
What happened to your beauty  
Happened to me  
  
We took ourselves to someone's bed  
And there we fell together  
Quick as dogs and truly dead were we  
And free as running water  
Free as running water  
Free as running water  
Free as you and me  
The way it's got to be  
The way it's got to be, lover
