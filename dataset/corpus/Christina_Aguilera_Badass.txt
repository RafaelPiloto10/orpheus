Ooohhhhh!  
I could feel it from the start,  
Couldn't stand to be apart.  
Something about you caught my eye,  
Something moved me deep inside!  
Don't know what you did boy but  
You had it and I've been hooked ever since.  
I told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friend  
I told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense.  
Everytime I see you everything starts making sense.  
  
Just do your thang honey!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you  
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do  
(What you do).  
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon.  
You got soul, you got class.  
You got style with your bad ass - oh yeah!  
Ain't no other man it's true - all right -  
Ain't no other man but you.  
  
Just do your thang honey!  
  
Never thought I'd be all right. No, no, no!  
Till you came and changed my life. Yeah, yeah, yeah!  
What was cloudy now is clear! Yeah, yeah!  
You're the light that I needed.  
You got what I want boy, and I want it!  
So keep on givin' it up!  
  
Tell your mother, your brother, your sister, and your friend.  
And the others, your lovers, better not be present tense.  
Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no one else's!  
  
Oooooooo, oh!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you  
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do  
(What you do).  
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon.  
You got soul, you got class. You got style your bad ass - oh yeah!  
Ain't no other man it's true - all right -  
Ain't no other man but you.  
  
Break it down now!  
  
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other! (other)  
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover!  
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other!  
Ain't no other man but you!  
  
Ohhhh!  
  
You are there when I'm a mess  
Talk me down from every ledge  
Give me strength, boy you're the best  
You're the only one who's ever passed every test  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you  
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do  
(What you do).  
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon.  
(You're the kinda guy, a girl finds oooo yeahh)  
You got soul, you got class.  
You got style your bad ass - oh yeah!  
Ain't no other man it's true - all right -  
Ain't no other man but you.  
  
And now I'm tellin' you, so ain't no other man but you.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you  
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do  
(What you do).  
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon.  
You got soul, you got class.  
You got style your bad ass - oh yeah!  
Ain't no other man it's true - all right -  
Ain't no other man but you.
