I saw what you did that's untold  
Glass of wine in her hand  
I knew she would make her connection  
At her feet was a full loose man  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you just might find  
You'll get what you need.  
You'll get what you need  
Well I went down to the demonstration  
Just to get my best share of abuse  
Singing 'were gonna bounce our frustration  
And if we don't, we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse'  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you just might find  
You'll get what you need.  
You'll get what you need  
Well I went to the Chelsea drugstore  
Just to get your prescribtion filled  
I was in line with Mr. Jimmy  
And man, man did he look ill  
We decided that we should get a cola  
My favorite flavor cherry red  
I sang my song to Mr. Jimmy  
And he said one word to me and that was 'dead'  
And I said to him  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you just might find  
You'll get what you need.  
You'll get what you need.  
I saw what you did in Reception  
In a glass was a bleeding man  
She was practice in the arts of deception  
You can tell by the blood stains on her hands  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you might find  
You'll get what you need.  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you might find  
You'll get what you need.  
You'll get what you need
