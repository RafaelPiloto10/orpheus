(Dolly Parton)  
  
She's been there, God knows, she's been there  
She has seen and done it all  
She's a woman, she know how to  
Dish it out or take it all  
Her heart's as soft as feathers  
Still she weathers stormy skies  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
A kaleidoscope of colors  
You can toss her around and round  
You can keep her in you vision  
But you'll never keep her down  
She's a lover, she's a mother  
She's a friend and she's a wife  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
Gentle as the sweet magnolia  
Strong as steel, her faith and pride  
She's an everlasting shoulder  
She's the leaning post of life  
She hurts deep and when she weeps  
She's just as fragile as a child  
And she's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
  
She's a sparrow when she's broken  
But she's an eagle when she flies  
Oh, bless her, Lord  
She's an eagle when she flies
