If I had wings  
Like Noah's dove  
I'd fly  
Across the water  
To that man I love  
Fare you well  
Oh, honey  
Fare you well  
  
One of these mornings  
In the drizzling rain  
All around my heart  
Was an aching pain  
Fare you well  
Oh, honey  
Fare you well  
  
If I had listened  
To what my mama said  
I'd of stayed at home  
In momma's bed  
Fare you well  
Oh, honey  
Fare you well  
Fare you well  
Oh, honey  
Fare you well  
  
One of these mornings  
It won't be long  
You'll call my name  
And I'll be gone  
Fare you well  
Fare you well  
Fare you well
