Pardon me, you left your tears on the jukebox  
And I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine  
I don't mean to pry, it's just that I  
Noticed you goin' out of your mind  
It looks like were two of a kind  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's fall to pieces together  
Why should we both fall apart  
Let's fall to pieces together  
Right here in each other's arms  
  
Alone is much better together  
When the worst is still yet to come  
So let's share the rest, of the tears that are left  
From two hearts that just came undone  
Why should we go crazy alone
