Don't it feel good to feel  
Don't it feel good  
Now that you know what's real  
Don't it feel good  
You see the love in your brother's eyes  
You've never seen before  
And you're not afraid to cry  
Don't it feel good  
  
Don't it feel good to be  
Don't it feel good  
Now that we all agree  
Don't it feel good  
Learning to know is what helps us show  
We've always been the same  
And when the walls come tumbling down  
Don't it feel good  
  
Don't hide it, it's there within you  
You've found it, if you've ever been you  
So take it with you  
  
Don't it feel good to see  
Don't it feel good  
Now that you know you're me  
Don't it feel good  
You realize that your time is now  
It's always been your own  
And you've got nowhere to go  
Don't it feel good  
  
Get it, get it, get it on  
Get it, get it, get it on
