I live in the light of the bright silver moon  
I'll take you off sailing from midnight till noon  
I'll show the Sea of Tranquility  
You can have any flavor you happen see  
  
I live in the shade of a forest of green  
In the wildest of woodlands that you've ever seen  
There's rabbits and quail and tender young snails  
As brown as the seaweed on old rusty nails  
  
There's fireflies dancing in the cool evening breeze  
There's love and romancin' as nice as you please  
There's otters and frogs and spotted ground hogs  
And wiley old weasels in rotted out logs  
  
There's rivers of rainbow and grey mountain trout  
And little dark holes where the varmints hang out  
There's foxes and hares in traps and in snares  
And lots of bald eagles so you'd better take care  
  
So if you've got the time and you'd like to pass by  
Come down around midnight and give us a try  
We'll show you the Sea of Tranquility  
You can have any flavor you happen to see
