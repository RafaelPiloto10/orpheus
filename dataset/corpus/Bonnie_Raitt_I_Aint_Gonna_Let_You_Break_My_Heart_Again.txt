There ain't no use in me trying to tell you how I feel  
'cause what I feel ain't what you're feeling  
I don't know what we did wrong  
I just know if you come home  
I ain't gonna let you break my heart again  
  
There ain't no use in me trying to find out where you've been  
Where you've been ain't where I'm going  
'cause if I ask you where you've been  
The hurting starts and it don't end  
So I ain't gonna let you break my heart again, no  
I ain't gonna let you break my heart again, no no  
  
Tears don't become me  
Pain ain't my friend  
It seems like you enjoy my crying, baby  
You always said that I was strong  
But I believe that you were wrong  
Lately, God knows, I have been trying  
  
There ain't no use in you trying to kiss away the hurt, baby  
'cause it hurts where it's deep down inside of me and it's hiding  
If you decide you're coming home  
You walk in, it won't be like before  
'cause I ain't gonna let you break my heart again, no  
Ain't gonna let you break my heart again, no no
