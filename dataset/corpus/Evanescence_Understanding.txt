"You hold the answer deep within your own mind  
Consciously, you've forgotten it  
That's the way the human mind works  
Whenever something is too unpleasant, too shameful  
For us to entertain, we reject it  
We erase it from our memory  
But the imprint is always there"  
  
(Can't wash it all away  
Can't wish it all away  
Can't hope it all away  
Can't cry it all away)  
  
The pain that grips you  
The fear that binds you  
Releases life in me  
In our mutual shame we hide our eyes  
To blind them from the truth that finds a way from who we are  
  
Please don't be afraid  
When the darkness fades away  
The dawn will break the silence screaming in our hearts  
My love for you still grows  
This I do for you  
Before I try to fight the truth my final time  
  
"We're supposed to try and be real  
And I feel alone, and we're not together  
And that is real"  
  
Can't wash it all away  
Can't wish it all away  
Can't cry it all away  
Can't scratch it all away  
  
Lying beside you  
Listening to you breathe  
The life that flows inside of you  
Burns inside of me  
Hold and speak to me  
Of love without a sound  
Tell me you will live through this  
And I will die for you  
Cast me not away  
Say you'll be with me  
For I know I cannot bear it all alone  
  
"You're not alone, honey  
Never, never"  
  
Can't fight it all away  
Can't hope it all away  
Can't scream it all away  
It just won't fade away  
  
Can't wash it all away  
Can't wish it all away  
Can't cry it all away  
Can't scratch it all away  
  
Can't fight it all away  
Can't hope it all away  
Can't scream it all away  
Oh, it all away  
Oh, it all away  
  
"But the imprint is always there  
Nothing is ever really forgotten"  
  
"God, please, don't hate me  
Because I'll die if you do  
Because I'll die if you do  
Because I'll die if you do  
Because I'll die if you do  
  
Because I'll die if you do"
