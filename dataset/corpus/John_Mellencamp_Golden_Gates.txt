Ain't no golden gates gonna swing open  
Ain't no streets paved in natural pearl  
Ain't no angel with a harp come singin'  
Leastways not that I know of in this world  
  
In these days of uncertain futures  
Who knows what the masters might do  
They got their big deals goin' on, goin' on  
Got nothing to do with me and you  
  
If I could I'd get us a big suite  
Overlooking the park  
Only promise I know to be true  
Are the promises made from the heart  
  
I don't need to see the whole thing go down  
I don't need to see another lonely man  
I don't need to see a woman crying for the savior  
Holding on to some moneyman's hand  
  
Who can I call to make my reservations  
Forever thrown in the dark  
The only promises I know to be true  
Are the promises made from the heart  
  
I don't believe in the authorities  
They ain't gonna take care of me and you  
I don't have all the strength that I need  
To love the way that I want to  
  
The only promises I know to be true  
Are the promises made from the heart
