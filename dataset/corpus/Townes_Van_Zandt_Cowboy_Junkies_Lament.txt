Baby hit the back door breathin' real heavy  
Said the boys in the alley wouldn't leave her alone  
Mama did her make-up in a terrible hurry  
She finally got ready but the boys were gone  
Mama don't you worry, night's aproachin'  
There's a hole in heaven where some sin slips through  
Close your eyes and dream real steady  
Maybe just a little will spill on you  
  
The dark don't lie  
And dreams come true  
Could be a few will see you through  
  
Old lady Rose, lookin' down her nose  
At lonely Miss Lily hiding in the hall  
Lily's just praying for the trial to be over  
Rosy's just waitin' for the ax to fall  
Show me off on the way to town  
The sky's still shiny and the earth's still brown  
Tell the judge I'm ready for the vases  
Gonna dance in their faces  
When the guitar sounds  
  
It won't be long  
I won't be gone  
I've been leaning toward the shadows all along  
  
Those in the know say how it goes  
You plan on reapin' you better sow  
You plan on sleepin' you better keep movin'  
Sleepin' ain't allowed around here you know  
Tell me please when the rollin's over  
Me and my baby gonna have some fun  
Bury our backs in a bed of clover  
Smile in style while the sun goes down  
  
Snake eyes cry  
And boxcars sigh  
Seven's stuck in the middle just wonderin' why  
  
The dark don't lie  
And dreams come true  
All it takes is one or two  
Maybe just a few will see you through  
Maybe just a few will see you through
