If I close my eyes  
I can almost hear my mother  
Callin', "Neil, go find your brother  
Daddy's home, and it's time for supper  
Hurry on"  
  
And I see two boys  
Racin' up two flights of staircase  
Squirmin' into Papa's embrace  
And his whiskers warm on their face  
Where's it gone  
Oh, where's it gone  
  
Two floors above the butcher  
First door on the right  
Life filled to the brim  
As I stood by my window  
And looked out on those  
Brooklyn Roads  
  
I can still recall  
The smell of cookin' in the hallways  
Rubber drying in the doorways  
And report cards I was always  
Afraid to show  
  
Mama'd come to school  
And as I'd sit there softly crying  
Teacher'd say, "He's just not trying  
He's got a good head if he'd apply it"  
But you know yourself  
It's always somewhere else  
  
I built me a castle  
With dragons and kings  
And I'd ride off with them  
As I stood by my window  
And looked out on those  
Brooklyn Roads  
  
Thought of going back  
But all I'd see are strangers' faces  
And all the scars that love erases  
But as my mind walks through those places  
I'm wonderin'  
What's come of them  
  
Does some other young boy  
Come home to my room  
Does he dream what I did  
As he stands by my window  
And looks out on those  
Brooklyn Roads
