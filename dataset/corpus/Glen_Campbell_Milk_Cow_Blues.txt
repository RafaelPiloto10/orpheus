This was the first blues I ever learnt from  
Bob Wells and the Texas Playboys  
called the Milk Cow Blues  
  
Yeah  
Well I did woke up this mornin'  
And I looks out my door-oor  
Hey, I could tell my milkcow  
I could tell by the way she lows  
So if you see... my milk cow  
Well drive, drive, help her back ho-ome  
Cause I ain't had no milk and butter  
Long since the cow's been go-one  
  
Play your Harmonica Steve, yeah  
Well I tried everythi-ing woman  
Just to get alo-ong with you  
And now I'm goin' to tell you  
What I'm gonna do-oo  
Well you know I'm gonna stop a-cryin'  
I'a a-gonna leave you alo-one  
If you don't think I'm leavin', honey  
Count the days I'm gone  
'Cause you're gonna nee-ee-ee-eed  
Your lovin' daddy's help some day  
And you will definitely be sorry  
'Cause you treat your man the wrong way-ay-ay-ay  
  
Play your fiddle Carl, yeah, ah-ah  
Don't you fiddle it son, make it feel good, yeah  
  
Play T.J. - from Chicago  
Well, just treat your man right, woman  
Day by day-ay  
And get out your little prayer book  
Get down on your knees and pray  
'Cause you're gonna nee-ee-ee-eed  
A lovin' daddy's help some day-ay  
And you are goin' to be sorry  
You just treat your old man the wrong way-ay
