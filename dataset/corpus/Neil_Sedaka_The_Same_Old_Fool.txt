I haven't changed, I'm still the same old me,  
Yes I'm still the same old fool I used to be.  
  
I thought this heart of mine would never miss you,  
I thought this heart of mine would never cry.  
I told myself I'd get along without you,  
But I realise I told myself a lie.  
  
I'm still the same old fool I used to be,  
I think of you and suddenly I'm helpless.  
I haven't changed, I'm still the same old me,  
Yes I'm still the same old fool I used to be.  
  
Although you've got the kind of love that hurts me,  
Oh what I'd give if we could start again.  
If I could hold you close for just a moment,  
I'd gladly let you break my heart again.  
  
I'm still the same old fool I used to be,  
I think of you and suddenly I'm helpless.  
I haven't changed, I'm still the same old me,  
  
Yes I'm still the same old fool I used to be,  
Yes I'm still the same old fool I used to be.
