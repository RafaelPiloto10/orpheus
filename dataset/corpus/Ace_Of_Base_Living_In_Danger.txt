Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing  
You can do what you want, you can live in a dream  
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down  
  
You're living your life in peace and in harmony  
You making your own decisions  
That's how it's got to be for you and me  
So many people are running around and 'round  
Without no sense of logic  
  
I see li-es  
In the eyes of a stranger  
Whoa  
You'll be living in danger  
I see li-es  
In the eyes of a stranger  
Whoa  
You'll be living in danger

In the eyes of a stranger  
Whoa  
You'll be living in danger  
  
Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing  
You can do what you want  
You can live in a dream  
Get up, get in, get the rhythm,get down  
  
Keep moving your feet  
Don't go wasting your time  
Everybody's moving, yeah they're getting in line  
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down  
  
I see li-es  
In the eyes of a stranger  
Whoa  
You'll be living in danger  
  
People are the same today as they used to be  
The same expectations  
So high no one can reach that high  
Not I nor you get satisfied today  
We'll never get enough  
  
I see li-es  
In the eyes of a stranger

Oh so much danger, oh so much danger

Look into the eyes of a stranger,  
In the eyes of a stranger,  
You'll be living, in danger
