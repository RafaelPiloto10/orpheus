Rationalize values it's so easy to succeed  
Keeping your eyes on the prize excess  
  
Camped outside laissez faire  
People understand me there  
Don't talk to me we'll get along just fine  
  
Blowin' out your mores  
Herny Ford tradition plays on  
Idel minds left the emergency brake on too long  
Underneath the city lies the ruin of mankind  
  
The excavation was a financial success  
With artifacts of gold  
The arrowheads went straight to the Smithsonian  
The rest was melted down and sold  
  
Substantial gains  
Minimal losses are tolerable  
As long as the machine keeps running fine  
  
Cannibals  
Functioning on pheromones  
Rational thought lost to instinctual
