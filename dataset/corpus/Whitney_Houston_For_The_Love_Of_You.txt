Hey baby  
I'm looking for you  
Drifting on a memory  
Ain't no place I'd rather be  
Than with you, loving you  
Day will make a way for night  
All we'll need is candlelight  
And a song soft and long, well  
  
Glad to be here alone  
With a lover unlike no other  
Safe to see a new horizon  
Slowly coming into view  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be living for the love of you  
All that I'm giving is for the love of you  
  
Lovely as a ray of sun  
That touches me when the morning comes  
Feels good to me, my love and me  
Smoother than a gentle breeze  
Flowing through my mind with ease  
Soft as can be well when you're loving me  
  
Love to be  
Riding the waves of your love  
Enchanted with your touch  
It seems to me  
We can sail together in and out of mystery  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Paradise I have within  
Can't feel insecure again  
You're the key and this I see  
Now and then I lose my way  
Using words to try and say  
What I feel yeah love is real ooh  
I might as well  
Sign my name on a card  
Which could say it better  
Time will tell  
Cause it seems that I've done  
Just about all that I can do do do  
  
[Chorus]
