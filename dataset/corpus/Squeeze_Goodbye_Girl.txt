I met her in a poolroom  
Her name I didn't catch  
She looks like something special  
The kind who'd understand  
The room was almost spinning  
She pulled another smile  
She had the grace like pleasure  
She had a certain style  
  
Sunlight on the lino  
Woke me with a shake  
I looked around to find her but she'd gone  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
  
She took me to a motel  
A room on the second floor  
A kettle and two coffees  
A number on the door  
She said I hardly know you  
Agreed we kissed goodnight  
I knew that in the morning  
Somehow I'd wake to find  
  
Sunlight on the lino  
Wakening me with a shake  
I looked around to find her but she'd gone  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
  
I lost my silver razor  
My clubroom locker keys  
The money in the waistcoat  
It doesn't bother me  
My wife has moved to Jersey  
So mud is not the word  
If you ever see her  
Say hello goodbye girl  
  
Sunlight on the lino  
Woke me with a shake  
I looked around to find her but she'd gone  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl
