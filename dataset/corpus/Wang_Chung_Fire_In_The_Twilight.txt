Hot on the run from the grip of the power game,  
The man who leads the way, the man who leads the way.  
Shell in its box from his home that they'll never tame,  
The man who leads the way, the man who leads the way.  
  
He is burning, burning in the twilight.  
He is turning, turning to face us.  
He is burning, fire in the twilight.  
He is turning, turning to lead us away, away, away,  
Lead us away, away, away.  
  
Taking a break from the role of the everyday boy,  
The man who leads the way, the man who leads the way.  
Is he for real or is he back to the old way boy,  
Can he lead the way, oh can he lead the way.  
He's searching, but he's lonely, and he's hurting, but he's only,  
Waiting for a chance just in time to live a life.  
Does he need ya, does he want ya,  
Does he listen to what you say?  
Is he only waiting for the simple way?  
  
He is burning, burning in the twilight.  
He is turning, turning to face us.  
He is burning, fire in the twilight.  
He is turning, turning to lead us away, away, away,  
Lead us away, away, away.
