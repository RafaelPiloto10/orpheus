Haven't got a worry  
Haven't got a care  
Haven't got a thing to call my own  
Though I'm out of money  
I'm a millionaire  
I still have my home in San Antone  
  
When I greet my neighbor with a hi y'all  
I'm as welcome as a king upon a throne  
But when I feel like braggin'  
I just up and say  
I'm a native son of San Antone  
  
Well I travel around the country on my merry way  
I've been to crowds and felt I was alone  
But when I feel like braggin'  
I just up and say  
I'm a native son of San Antone  
  
And there's a sweet somebody by the Alamo  
Someday she's goin' to be my very own  
And we'll buy a high chair in a year or so  
For our little home in San Antone  
  
Well I haven't got a worry  
Haven't got a care  
Haven't got a thing to call my own  
And though I'm out of money  
I'm a millionaire  
I still have my home in San Antone  
  
And there's a sweet somebody by the Alamo  
Someday she's goin' to be my very own  
And then I'll build a high chair in a year or so  
For our little home in San Antone  
  
I'm a native son of San Antone  
For our little home in San Antone
