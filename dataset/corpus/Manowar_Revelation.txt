Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand  
Judgement passed delivered by his hand  
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand  
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.  
What was written foretold in dreams,  
In visions apocalypse now seen.  
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed  
Drink the wine of his anger  
Die with the beast.  
  
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds.  
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.  
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky  
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.  
Know the end is coming, heed this sign  
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.  
  
Revelation, the chosen saved  
Earth be cleansed in a blaze.  
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows  
Hail, fire and blood fall on satans throne.  
  
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame  
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues.  
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand  
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man.  
Know the end is coming, heed this sign  
By the morning star he four horsemen ride.  
  
Revelation, the chosen saved  
Earth be cleansed in a blaze.  
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows  
Hail, fire and blood fall on satans throne.  
  
Revelation, the chosen saved  
Earth be cleansed in a blaze.  
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows  
Hail, fire and blood fall on satans throne.
