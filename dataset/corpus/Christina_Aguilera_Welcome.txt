Whoa, oh  
  
Welcome to the greatest show  
Greatest show on earth  
You've never seen before  
Here, the fairytale unfolds  
  
What's behind the smoke and glass?  
Painted faces, everybody wears a mask  
Are you selling them your soul?  
Well, you'll be left out in the cold  
  
Is it all blue skies  
Fun and games until you fall?  
Then you're left without anyone at all  
You're riding on a shooting star  
With a smile upon your face  
But soon the shine fades  
  
And you're left out all alone  
Wondering where did they all go?  
Oh  
  
Been jaded, hated  
Who'll be around when the limelight's faded?  
Been shut down, pushed out  
Made to smile when I wanted to frown  
  
Always taking a bow  
Always working the crowd  
Always making new grounds  
Always playing the clown  
Who'll be sticking it out?  
Who'll be staying around  
When the lights go down?
