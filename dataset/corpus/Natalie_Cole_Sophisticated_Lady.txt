Sophisticated lady, sophisticated lady  
  
She's a different lady with a different style  
  
She stands tall and steady like the eiffel tower  
  
She is hip to politics but loves her jazz  
  
She's got lots of rhythm she's got lots of class  
  
Everybody knows how she got her name, yeah  
  
Oh, ha, she wears knee length dresses with her high heel steppers  
  
She's not no back stabber but she's sure a pleaser  
  
She talks quiet and gentle, she acts very cool  
  
She sticks close to her lover, she obey god's rules, woh

Everybody knows how she got her name  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah----  
  
Woh--, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
She's the kind of person that you'd like to meet  
  
'cause she's always smiling and she's always neat  
  
She can start a fire in the coldest man  
  
She's a hip slick sister known throughout the land, oh
