You're always pretending to be  
Someone who prefers to be free  
You think you can fool me with your lyin' eyes  
But what is this game that you play  
When all that your trying to say  
Is that your lonely, in need of a friend  
  
Oh yeah sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do  
  
And can't you see that it's true  
There's someone as lonely as you  
Trying so hard, so hard to get through  
And why can't everyone see the way that it really should be  
Why hide your feelings and suffer the pain  
  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do  
  
You know that sorrow is a woman  
You know she'll make you feel sad  
You know that sorrow is a woman  
  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do
