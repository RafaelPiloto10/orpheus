It's been a minute since I saw you boy  
Like some medicine to hear your voice  
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around  
See you haven't lost your sense of style  
And you still could melt me with your smile  
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside  
  
It's funny how things could change  
But still remain the same  
Isn't life just a crazy game  
Baby, here I go again  
  
[Chorus]  
I look into your eyes and then  
My heart remembers when  
And I realize I've never gotten over you  
Everytime I hear your name  
It's like the sunshine through the rain  
And I realize it's happenin'  
Baby, here I go again  
  
Here I go again  
  
Still remember how you make me weak  
How I fought to find the words to speak  
I just can't escape the memories  
I tried but I just can't break free  
But I closed the door on what we had  
But these feelings just keep comin' back  
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that  
  
It's funny how things could change  
But still remain the same  
Isn't life just a crazy game  
Baby, here I go again  
  
Sweet lovin' is my ting  
So you know mi got fi swing  
That's why yuh request it again  
Without a doubt yuh want to spend  
And to experience it again  
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then  
So make me light it up again  
Reignite the flames again  
'Cause you really miss 'dem days when we used to chill  
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Nigril  
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill  
Not to mention the way you are within  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's funny how things could change  
But still remain the same  
Isn't life just a crazy game  
Baby, here I go again  
  
[Chorus]
