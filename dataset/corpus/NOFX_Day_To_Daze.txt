I trusted you at least I thought I could  
I tried to believe when you said  
I got a better job I can pay you back  
Real soon. No! I don't do those drugs no more  
I know my luck has changed my lifestyle  
Has rearranged I'm on my feet  
  
You'll never change your ways  
Living from day to daze  
Why don't you fade away  
  
I've heard all this before  
When you were sleeping on my floor  
You said only for a day  
But as those 3 weeks passed  
My patience didn't last nor my food
