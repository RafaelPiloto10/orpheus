When we were young they would break our hearts  
You and I had to go undercover  
We knew in time we would be pulled apart  
We found a way we could hold on to each other  
Gave our souls to another world  
Sealed in blood with a sacred vow  
Now we've forgotten but beneath all this  
A part of you and me is still there now  
Go on and sing  
Go on and dance  
It'll all come back if you just give it a chance  
Don't you remember me?  
We had a secret society  
Refresh your memory  
We were the secret society  
I never see you in the waking world  
We make an effort to avoid each other  
But every night we penetrate the veil  
Where everybody acts like sister and brother  
You never speak the words in broad daylight  
They're much too delicate and too naive  
But everybody's been a witness sometime  
It doesn't change it if you don't believe  
So go on and sing  
Go on and dance  
Someday soon you'll hear that little bell ring  
And you'll remember me  
We have a secret society  
Not just a memory  
We are the secret society  
You've got to come with me  
You're in the secret society  
Until eternity  
We are the secret society (It's no secret
