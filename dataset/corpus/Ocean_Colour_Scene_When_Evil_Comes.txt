I don't like this  
Anymore than you  
In fact I'm scared  
At the top of the stairs in the dark  
Throw away all the dreams you had  
Slow and broke  
And just for you  
You were barely there  
Hey little girl  
Where's your momma gone?  
Has she left you scared  
At the top of the stairs in the dark  
It's too late for come backs  
And I've been wrong before  
Now I need, I need no more  
Except for you makin' up the sides  
It's too late for come backs  
And I've been wrong before  
Now I need, I need no more  
Except for you makin' up the sides  
Evil is when evil comes  
At the top of the stairs  
At the top of the stairs  
And in the dark  
The world won't listen  
And it gets this scared  
Standing there  
At the top of the stairs in the dark  
Come on baby  
Let's lose this fear  
And let's stand here  
Where it's always fair and never dark
