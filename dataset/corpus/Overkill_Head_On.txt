What's the sense of running blind  
If you never know where you go  
What's the sense of a suicide  
If the crash is all you know  
I'm a right down, lower than the low  
Collecting other people's sins  
What's the sense if you got to go  
If you don't know where you been  
A classic indication, march out of time  
A standard application, you're not the kind  
I'm coming  
Blessed retribution, head on, never stall  
Running head on to the wall  
Unholy damn solution, head on, never fall  
Running head on to the wall  
All the promises that you made  
Made you right with what you did  
All the freedoms that you trade  
On the block for the highest bid  
I'm an up here higher than high sight  
On a self-inflicted grin  
With a back door larger than life light  
So you can see where you been  
A classic indication, march out of time  
A standard application, you're not the kind  
I'm coming  
Blessed retribution, head on, never stall  
Running head on to the wall  
Unholy damn solution, head on, never fall  
Running head on to the wall  
c'mon now baby shine a light on me  
Can you see me just a little bit?  
Cleanse you of the sorrow and your misery  
Wash away the pain with a hit  
Tell me what you're waiting for?  
c'mon little lazy take a walk with me  
Will you reach out, will you take my hand?  
C'mon little lazy will you let it be  
Or will you walk to the promised land?  
Tell me what you're waiting for?  
c'mon now baby shine the light on me  
Can you use me just a little bit?  
C'mon little lazy will you walk with me?  
We'll wash away the pain and the shit  
Blessed retribution, head on, never stall  
Running head on to the wall  
Unholy damn solution, head on, never fall  
Running head on to the wall
