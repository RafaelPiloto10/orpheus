I look at you and see  
My life that might have been  
Your face just ghostly in the smoke.  
They're setting fire to the cornfields  
As you're taking me home.  
The smell of burning fields  
Will now mean you and here.  
  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
But I know that this will never be mine.  
  
Ooh, the thrill and the hurting  
The thrill and the hurting  
I know that this will never be mine.  
  
I want you as the dream  
Not the reality  
That clumsy goodbye kiss could fool me  
But I'm looking back over my shoulder  
At you, happy without me.  
  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
But I know that this will never be mine.  
  
Ooh, the thrill and the hurting  
Will never be mine.  
The thrill and the hurting  
It will never be mine.  
It can never be  
The thrill and the hurting  
Will never be mine.
