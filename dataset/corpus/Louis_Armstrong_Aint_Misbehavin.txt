No one to talk to  
All by myself  
No one to walk with  
I'm happy on the shelf  
Ain't misbehavin'  
Savin' all my love for you  
  
I know for certain  
The one I love  
I'm through with flirtin'  
It's just you that I've been thinkin' of  
Ain't misbehavin'  
Savin' all my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner  
In that old corner  
Don't go nowhere  
What do I care?  
Your kisses are worth waitin' for  
Believe me  
  
I don't stay out late  
Nowhere to go  
I'm home about eight  
Just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin'  
Savin' all my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner  
In that old corner  
Don't go nowhere  
What do I care?  
Your kisses are worth waitin' for  
Believe me  
  
I don't stay out late  
Nowhere to go  
I'm home about eight  
Just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin'  
Savin' all my love for you  
Ain't misbehavin'  
I'm savin' all my love for you
