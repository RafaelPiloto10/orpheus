I saw you yesterday with another girl  
When you looked my way  
I just pretended I didn't see you  
What else can I do  
  
Chorus  
You were all I've wanted  
'Cause you just don't seem to care  
You took me for granted  
And I don't think it is fair  
But my heart keeps telling me  
That you'd be there for me  
And I'll just wait and understand  
  
When you looked my way  
I just pretended I didn't see you  
What else can I do  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
But my heart keeps telling me  
That you'd be there for me  
So I'll just wait and understand  
  
Ooh...
