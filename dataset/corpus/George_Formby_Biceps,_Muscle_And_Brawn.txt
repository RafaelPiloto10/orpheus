Why am I forgotten, by the girl I love, because my clothes hang on me like a
sack.  
I know I'm not athletic and look a bit pathetic, and wear most of my chest
upon my back.  
The nation's got an A1 plan, and I might turn into a man,  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
  
I'd grow spinach on my chest, where the birds could build a nest  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
In competitions, exhibitions, Catch as Catch Catch,  
I would win some lovely cups and saucers to match.  
The girls would all love my physique, I'd let them see it twice a week,  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
  
My ribs at knock knock, wouldn't play or rattle on a windy day,  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
Hercules was far from slim, but I could show them more than him  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
In competitions, exhibitions, Catch as Catch Catch,  
I would win some lovely cups and sauces to match.  
  
The ladies "white hope" I would be, they'd hope to see much more of me  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
I'd look swell when out of doors, in my fifty bob plus fours,  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
  
My photo in the press you'd see, to show what "bile beans" did for me  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.  
In competitions, exhibitions, Catch as Catch Catch,  
I would win some lovely cups and sauces to match.  
I'd have strength to carry on and something good to sit upon,  
If I'd Biceps, Muscle and Brawn.
