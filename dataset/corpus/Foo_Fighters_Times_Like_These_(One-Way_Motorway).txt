I... I'm a one way motorway  
I'm a road that drives away and follows you back home  
I... I'm a street light shining  
I'm a wild light blinding bright burning off alone  
  
It's times like these you learn to live again  
It's times like these you give and give again  
It's times like these you learn to love again  
It's times like these, time and time again  
  
I... I'm a new day rising  
I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight  
I... I'm a little divided  
Do I stay or run away or leave it all behind?  
  
It's times like these you learn to live again  
It's times like these you give and give again  
It's times like these you learn to love again  
It's times like these, time and time again  
  
It's times like these you learn to live again  
It's times like these you give and give again  
It's times like these you learn to love again  
It's times like these, time and time again
