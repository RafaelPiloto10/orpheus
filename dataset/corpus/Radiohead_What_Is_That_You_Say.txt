No longer caught up  
Big church wall  
Makin' some noise with a pair of drums  
Lying your thoughts out over the sky  
Spinning around as you gaze at the sun  
(What is that you say?)  
Why don't you talk to me?  
(What don't you talk to me?)  
What is that you say?  
(What is that you say?)  
Wrapping your fingers 'round my neck  
I see the grass is still when we made our beds  
I see the thin weed boy ride at this edge  
I see the holy Jesus and the Pharoah and the Venus  
And the ghost of you and me  
Gagged and given up for dead  
(What is that you say?)  
Why don't you talk to me?  
(What don't you talk to me?)  
What is that you say?  
(What is that you say?)  
Wrapping your fingers 'round my neck  
There's something up there but I  
Don't know what the hell it is  
There's something up there  
As you guessed  
Like the sun  
(What is that you say?)  
Why don't you talk to me?  
(What don't you talk to me?)  
What is that you say?  
(What is that you say?)  
Wrapping your fingers 'round my neck
