I'm gonna pick up the pieces  
And build a Lego house  
When things go wrong we can knock it down  
  
My three words have two meanings  
There's one thing on my mind, it's all for you  
  
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm  
And if you're broken I'll mend ya  
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in  
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall  
  
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before  
And I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind, I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
Don't hold me down,  
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take  
  
And if it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm  
And if you're broken I'll mend ya  
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
