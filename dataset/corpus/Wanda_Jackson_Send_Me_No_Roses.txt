(Send me no roses what I need most is you)  
Oh without fail everyday since you went away  
The doorbell rings you're sending roses again  
In my room all petals fall but darling that's not all  
  
I read your card then tears began to fall  
Send me no roses please no more roses  
Roses are red I know but through my tears they look blue  
Send me no roses please no more roses  
Your roses can't hold me what I need most is you  
  
Send me no roses...
