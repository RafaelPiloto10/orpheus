There's something strange in the old corral  
There's a breeze, though the wind has died  
Though I'm alone in the old corral,  
Seems there is someone at my side  
  
[Chorus]  
Empty saddles in the old corral,  
Where do ya ride tonight?  
Are ya roundin' up the dogies,  
The strays of long ago,  
Are ya on the trail of buffalo?  
Empty saddles in the old corral,  
Where do ya ride tonight?  
Are there rustlers on the border,  
Or a band of Navajo  
Are ya headin' for the Alamo?  
Empty guns covered with rust  
Where do ya talk tonight?  
Empty boots covered with dust  
Where do ya walk tonight?  
Empty saddles in the old corral,  
My tears would be dried tonight  
If you'll only say I'm lonely,  
As ya carry my old pal  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
  
There is no smoke, still the fires burn,  
There's no song, still I hear guitars,  
There is no dust, still the ghosts return  
Softly to vanish through the bars  
  
[Chorus]
