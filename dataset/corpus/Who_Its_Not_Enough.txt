It's not enough  
Whatever you give  
  
A little bit more  
You always need  
A little more man  
A little more seed  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
Whatever I give  
It's never enough  
  
I gave you cash  
I gave you love  
All that I heard  
Was "It's Not Enough"  
  
I work so hard  
It gets so tough  
Whatever I give  
Never feels like enough  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
Whatever I give  
It's never enough  
  
When I'm on my knees  
I keep taking your stuff  
Make sure that you know  
It's never enough  
  
You said you'd go as far  
As to turn to my friend  
Who once warned me of you  
Said you'd hasten my end  
Because I have lent  
Every ounce of my juice  
My essence is spent  
  
You'll always want  
A little more pink  
I'll always need  
A little more ink  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
Whatever I give  
It's never enough  
  
However I praise  
However I puff  
Though you may smile  
It won't be enough  
  
Right at the end  
When I start to bluff  
An' the lift's going down  
An' I start acting tough  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
Whatever I give  
It's never enough  
  
I'll find someone else  
To finish filling me up  
I'll smile and admit  
You were never quite enough  
  
Like Brigitte Bardot  
In Godard's Les Mepris  
I can't love you enough  
To make you complete  
You appear in my dreams  
With some new courtier  
You need me there to see  
What you need to convey  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
Whatever I give  
It'll never be enough  
  
No hysterical scene  
You will never play rough  
I'm the one who will scream  
But it won't be enough  
  
It's never enough  
It's never enough  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
Whatever I give  
It'll never be enough  
  
I'll never hold you  
How can I scold you?  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
Whatever I give  
It'll never be enough
