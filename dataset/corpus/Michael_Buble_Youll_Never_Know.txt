You'll never know just how much I love you,  
You'll never know just how much I care.  
And if I tried  
I still couldn't hide  
My love for you  
You ought to know  
For haven't I told you so  
A million or more times?  
  
You went away and my heart went with you  
I speak your name in my every prayer  
If there is some other way  
To prove that I love you  
I swear I don't know how  
You'll never know if you don't know now.
