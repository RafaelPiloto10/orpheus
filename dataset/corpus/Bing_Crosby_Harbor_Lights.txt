I saw the harbor lights  
They only told me we were parting  
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me  
I watched the harbor lights  
How could I help if tears were starting  
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silv'ry sea  
  
I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more  
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore  
  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart is whisp'ring  
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me  
  
I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more  
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore  
  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart is whisp'ring  
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me
