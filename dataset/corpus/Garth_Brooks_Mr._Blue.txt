Our guardian star lost all it's glow  
The day that I lost you  
It lost all its glitter the day you said no  
And its grey stars turned to blue  
Like him I am doubtful that your love is true  
So if you decide to call on me  
Ask for Mr. Blue  
I'm Mr. Blue  
When you say you love me  
Then prove it by going out on the sly  
Provin' your love is untrue  
Call me Mr. Blue  
I sleep alone each night  
Wait by the phone each night  
But you don't call  
And I won't hurt my pride  
Call me mister  
I won't tell you  
When you paint the town  
A bright red to turn it upside down  
I'm painting it too  
But I'm painting it blue  
I sleep alone each night  
Wait by the phone each night  
But you don't call  
And I won't hurt my pride  
Call me mister  
I won't tell you  
When you paint the town  
A bright red to turn it upside down  
I'm painting it too  
But I'm painting it blue  
Call me Mr. Blue  
Call me mister
