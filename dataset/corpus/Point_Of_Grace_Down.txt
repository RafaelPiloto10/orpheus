Curiosity can get the best of me  
As I try to conceive the inconceivable  
All philosophy is escaping me  
As I try to believe the unbelievable  
I want to believe  
Without a single question  
Oh Lord hear my confession  
Chorus  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
Though I don't know everything  
And I believe that I could never truly figure it out  
'Cause You are so much more than me  
Above me - beyond me  
So far over my head but I still see You  
And I am finally making sense of it all  
As the wisdom of this fool begins to fall, fall, fall  
Down  
The story of my soul seems like a broken road  
And how I'm standing here is unbelievable  
Keep me lost in the mystery - down here on my knees  
The only way that I can reach what seems unreachable  
I want to believe  
Without a single question  
Oh Lord hear my confession  
Chorus
