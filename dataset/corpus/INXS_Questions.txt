How do you know when it's time for you to go  
How can you stop when you don't know how to start  
How can you go back when you don't know why you're here  
How can you see when your eyes begin to fade  
How will you hear when you've heard it all before  
How do you do all the things you want to do  
  
How much can you take when you've taken all you can  
Hoe can you act when you've never seen the script  
How can you choose when you don't know which is right  
How far can you go if you've been there before  
How can you shine if you've never seen the sun  
How does a child become a man without a child  
How can you heal someone that doesn't want to heal
