Your private life drama baby leave me out  
(repeat 3 times)  
J'ai les glands with your theatrics  
Your acting's a drag  
It's o.k. on TV 'cause you can turn it off  
But don't try me  
Yes your marriage is a tragedy  
But it's not my concern  
I'm very superficial I hate anything official  
  
[Chorus:]  
Your private life drama baby leave me out  
(repeat 3 times)  
(backup chorus)  
You've been lying to someone and now me  
Stop  
(repeat 3 times)  
  
Your sentimental gestures only bore me to death  
You've made a desperate appeal now save your breath  
Attachment to obligation through guilt and regret  
Shit that's so wet  
And your sex life complications are not my fascinations  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You asked me for advice I said use the door  
But you're still clinging to somebody you deplore  
And now you want to use me for emotional blackmail  
I just feel pity when you lie, contempt when you cry  
  
[Chorus]
