I've Been Dreaming For So Long  
To Find The Meaning  
To Understand  
The Secret Of Life  
Why Am I Here  
To Try Again  
  
Will I Always  
Will YouAlways  
See The Truth,  
When It Stares You In The Face  
Will I Ever  
Will I Never Free Myself  
Breakin' These Chains  
  
Chorus  
Give My Heart Give My Soul  
I'd Turn It Back It's My Fault  
Your Destiny Is Forlorn  
Have to live till it's undone  
Give My Heart Givr My Soul  
I'd Turn It Back  
And Then at last  
I'll be on my way  
  
I've Been Living For So Long  
Many Seasons Passed Me By  
I've Seen Kingdoms Through Ages  
Rise And Fall  
I've Seen It All  
  
I've Seen The Horrors  
I've Seen The Wonders  
Happ'ning Just In Front Of My Eyes  
Will I Ever,  
Will I Never Free Myself By Making It Right?  
  
Chorus  
  
Jillian  
Our Dream Ended Long Ago  
All Our Stories  
And All Our Glories  
I Held So Dear  
We Won't Be Together For Ever and Ever  
No More Tears  
I'll Always Be Here  
'Till The End  
  
"Voices" Jillian  
  
Chorus
