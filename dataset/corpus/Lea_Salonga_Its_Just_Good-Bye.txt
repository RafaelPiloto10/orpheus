The sweetest songs fade to echoes in the wind  
The best of times must end, so a new day can begin  
And the dreams we dream that seem so real at night  
Must meet the morning light and vanish from our sight  
  
[Chorus]  
It's just good-bye, remember  
Time was never our friend  
We walked the road together and we came to the end  
It's just good-bye, now I won't tell you not to cry  
But I swear that what we had won't die  
Cause it isn't over, it's just good-bye  
  
I close my eyes and I still can see your face  
I know the truth of us, can't be bound by time or space  
And the joy we shared, the magic that we've known  
Is something that we own, though we may be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's just good-bye  
It doesn't really matter why  
I know what we had can never die  
Cause I'll always love you  
Yes, I'll always love you  
So, it's just good-bye
