I'm stalking a fan  
He lives in a high rise block  
And here I am  
He shouldn't have turned my rock  
He's brushing his teeth  
He doesn't look bad from this far  
I'm hailing a cab  
And I'm gonna follow his car  
Wherever he goes  
I won't be too far behind  
Just hanging around  
Driving him out of his mind  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
I'm stalking a fan  
He used to write all the time  
How lovely I am  
He really made me feel fine  
But how they forget  
He needed a wake-up call  
And he will regret  
Having been so shallow  
He made me believe  
That I was some kind of myth  
So here I am  
How could he treat me like this?  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Wherever he goes  
I won't be too far behind  
Just hanging around  
Driving him out of his mind  
I'm stalking a fan  
He's gone to the record store  
To buy a cd  
By some other girl not me  
He's taking her home  
Getting her out of her box  
And putting her on  
And dancing around in his socks  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Getting her out of her box  
Treachery  
And dancing around in his socks  
Treachery  
Treachery  
And dancing around in his socks  
Treachery  
Driving him out of his mind
