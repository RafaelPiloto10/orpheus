Before you started tokin  
You used to have a brain  
But now you don't get even the simplest of things  
I can draw a little picture  
  
Or even use my hands  
I try to explain but you just don't understand  
Man you're really losin' it  
And you've really done a lot of junk now  
  
But you keep abusin' it  
What in the world happened to you  
It's bad enough you do it to yourself  
But taking someone with you well you know that's something else  
  
I say I'm not that kind of person  
I'm not that kind of man  
I try to explain but you just don't understand  
I might be sympathetic or cut a little slack  
  
If I thought that you were willing to give a little back  
But you do it in the morning  
You do it in the night  
You lie to refrain from just facing your life  
  
So I'll see you man tomorrow  
You'll be gackin' up again  
I'll see you in a coffin by the time your wad is spent  
I think of all the times that I tried to lend a hand  
  
I try to explain but you just don't understand  
  
[Chorus]
