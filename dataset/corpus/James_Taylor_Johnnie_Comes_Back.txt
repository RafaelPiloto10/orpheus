All last week and half of today, Johnnie has been a good little girl.  
Trying to keep her devils at bay, watching her health return.  
But she always comes back for more, hanging her head and banging my door,  
Johnnie comes back again.  
I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, "Please give me some medicine,
man."  
Oh Johnnie comes back again.  
Where'd she get that tear in her eye?  
Whoever said she could leave me, where'd she learn to say good-bye?  
She's been watching too much T.V., she only shows up for meals,  
my medicine chest and my automobiles. Johnnie comes back again.  
I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, "Please give me some medicine,
man."  
Oh Johnnie comes back again.  
  
Me, I'm just an evil demon, I'm playing on her weakness,  
counting on her sickness to bring her home again.  
  
To use me up and to rob me blind, I guess it shouldn't surprise me.  
Fighting and flashing like a fish on a line, my God, she must despise me.  
But she always comes back again, now it won't be long 'til she's gone again,  
Johnnie comes back again.  
  
I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, "Please give me some medicine,
man."  
Oh Johnnie comes back again.
