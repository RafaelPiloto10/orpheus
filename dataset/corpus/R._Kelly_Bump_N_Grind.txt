My mind is tellin me no but my body my body's tellin me yes  
I (baby) don't want to hurt nobody  
But there is something that I must confess........... (chill)  
  
[Chorus: repeat 4x]  
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind  
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind  
  
See I know just what you want and I know just what you need girl  
So baby bring your body to me (bring your body here)  
I'm not fooling around with you baby  
My love is true (with you) with you is where I want to be, girl see  
I need someone someone like me to satisfy your every needs  
  
[Chorus 4x]  
You say he's not treating you right  
Then lady spend the night now  
I'll love you like you need to be love (girl why don't you try some of me)  
No need to look no more because I've opened up in my door  
You'll never feel another love you see  
I need someone, someone like me girl to make love to you baby constantly  
  
[Chorus 4x]
