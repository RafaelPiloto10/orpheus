While horsemen ride across the green  
And Snow White still remains unseen.  
Pegasus, the winged horse,  
Relays his messages by Morse.  
And like some pirate sailor  
We crossed the Spanish Main  
And brought our magic carpet  
To a marble staircased plain.  
  
While Handel plays his melody  
Doctors cause uncertainty  
And though I know the lifeguard's brave  
There is no one for him to save.  
And like some pirate sailor  
We crossed the Spanish Main  
And brought our magic carpet  
To a marble staircased plain.  
  
Cock Robin views his frozen feet  
And wraps them in a winding sheet  
And calls out for his favourite drink  
The Persian that's as warm as mink.  
And like some pirate sailor  
We crossed the Spanish Main  
And brought our magic carpet  
To a marble staircased plain.
