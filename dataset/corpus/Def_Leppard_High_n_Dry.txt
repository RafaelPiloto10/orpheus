Saturday, I feel right  
I been drinking all day  
Yes I got a date, a midnight ride  
I had to get it away  
  
Yeah, I'm not a loner, I'm not a fool  
Don't need a reason, reason to be cool  
I got my whiskey, I got my wine  
I got my woman, and this time the lights are going out  
(saturday night) high  
(saturday night) high 'n' dry  
(saturday night) I'm high  
(saturday night) high 'n' dry  
  
Ow, I feel bad, I feel mean  
I'm up and down and in between  
On the bottle, I'm on the line  
I'm up and feeling fine  
  
Oh take me high  
Saturday, kickin' out, her train was comin' to me  
I gotta move, number one  
Saturday night on the run  
(saturday night) high  
(saturday night) high 'n' dry  
(saturday night) got my whiskey  
(saturday night) got my wine  
(saturday night) got my woman  
(saturday night) high 'n' dry  
You gotta try me tonight
