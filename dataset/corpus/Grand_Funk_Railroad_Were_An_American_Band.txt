Out on the road for forty days  
Last night in Little Rock, put me in a haze  
Sweet, sweet Connie was doin' her act  
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact  
  
Up all night with Freddie King  
I got to tell you, poker's his thing  
Booze and ladies, keep me right  
As long as we can make it to the show tonight  
  
We're an American Band  
We're an American Band  
We're comin' to your town  
We'll help you party it down  
We're an American band  
  
Four young chiquitas in Omaha  
Waitin' for the band to return from the show  
A feelin' good, feelin' right and it's Saturday night  
The hotel detective, he was outta sight  
  
Now these fine ladies, they had a plan  
They was out to meet the boys in the band  
They said, "Come on dudes, let's get it on!"  
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down  
  
We're an American Band  
We're an American Band  
We're comin' to your town  
We'll help you party it down  
We're an American band  
  
We're an American band  
We're an American band  
We're comin' to your town  
We'll help you party it down  
We're an American band
