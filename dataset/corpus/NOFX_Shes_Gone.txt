A blackened wick is what remains  
The flame was blown out just recently  
Although the candle hadn't burned down to the stick  
It won't be lit again, the day won't be so bright  
  
We don't know what she may have been  
All we know is what she left behind  
An apartment cluttered with children's toys,  
Photos of good times  
  
In the bedroom, there's sheets on the windows  
There's a four poster bed for a reason  
There's a box on the floor full of secrets  
It won't be opened  
  
Here older boys and girls would play  
All inhibitions were left behind  
As the door would close, her face begin to shine  
This was her finest hour, this was her finest time  
  
Now, she's gone, and it's not gonna be alright, not for me  
  
She's gone but not forgotten, she's still here  
In all those years she touched so many lives  
Who's gonna watch the little girl she left behind?  
  
Carol Anne stands alone in the school yard  
All the other children have gone  
After waiting for hours,  
She can't understand why her mother left her  
  
In the darkness she sees definition  
In the silence, she hears someone calling  
After nightmares, she lies in bed screaming  
But there's no one listening, there's no one  
Now, she's gone, and it's never gonna be alright not for me she's gone
