And I won't make love to you  
And I feel love, feel love  
  
Jailhouse gets empty  
Rudy gets plenty  
The baton stick gets shorter  
Rudy gets taller  
Can't fight against the youth  
Cause we're strong and they're the rude rude people  
Can't fight against the youth  
Cause we're strong and the rude rude people  
  
Baby get down  
When I was a youth in 1983  
It was the best day of my life, had the eighty nine vision  
We didn't fuss or no fight  
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife  
My vision  
It was playin' on my guitar, on my guitar  
  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
  
When the rhythm, playin'  
I know that I'm gonna be there yeah  
Bud Gaugh will be singing there  
And Eric Wilson will be bangin' up there, yea  
Oh and we'll be all singin', with version, with version  
Reggae version  
Version, version, version oh  
  
What has been told to the wise and up-rooted  
It's gonna be revealed unto babes and Sublime  
Rudy Rudy Rudy  
Can't fight against the youth, right now  
Them are rude, rude people  
Can't fight against the resistance, oh right now  
Them are rude, rude people  
  
We gonna rule this land among children  
We gonna rule this land  
  
Cause when that rhythm it was playin' on my guitar  
On my guitar  
  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
  
Oh when I was a youth it was the best day  
It was the best day of my life  
We had the eighty nine vision  
  
We didn't fuss or no fight  
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife  
When that rhythm, it was playin' on my guitar  
On my guitar  
  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
I had to be there  
Had to be there  
  
Jailhouse gets empty  
And Rudy gets plenty  
Baton stick gets shorter  
Rudy gets taller, taller  
And fight against the youth  
Cause we're strong, them are rude, rude people  
Can't fight against the youth
