I'm coming apart at the seams.  
Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams.  
Like buzz, buzz, buzz.  
Doc, there's a hole where something was.  
Doc, there's a hole where something was.  
  
Fell out of bed.  
Butterfly bandage,  
But don't worry.  
You'll never remember,  
Your head is far too blurry.  
Put him in the back of a squad car  
Restrain that man  
He needs his head put through a cat scan.  
Hey editor, I'm undeniable  
Hey Doctor, I'm certifiable  
Oh, I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine  
What a match,  
I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet  
  
[Chorus]  
So boycott love  
Detox just to retox  
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life  
And perfect boys  
With their perfect lives  
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy  
  
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)  
  
Oh,  
  
Little girl  
You got my staring odd, oh  
Or was it just a telescopic camera nod  
Painted doors in the highway  
Truck stop stalls  
Lot-lizards scales to deny my rules  
All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk, when you leave the
room  
  
I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine  
What a match,  
I am half doomed and you're semi-sweet  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)  
  
Detox just to retox  
Detox just to retox  
Detox just to retox  
Detox just to retox  
So boycott love  
Boycott love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Wants to hear you sing)  
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy  
Whoa
