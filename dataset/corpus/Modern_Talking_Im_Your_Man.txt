Call me good, call me bad,  
Call me anything you want to baby,  
But I know, that you're sad,  
And I know I'll make you happy with the one thing that you never had,  
Baby, I'm your man.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you know that, Baby I'm your man.  
You bet,  
If you gonna do it, do it right(right) do it with me.  
If you gonna do it, do it right(right) do it with me.  
If you gonna do it, do it right(right) do it with me.  
If you gonna do it, do it right(right) do it with me.

Wanna take you, wanna make you,

Everybody knows where the good people go,  
But where we're goin' baby,  
Ain't no such word as no..............  
I'm your man  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you know that, baby I'm your man.  
Alright!

If you gonna do it, do it right(right) do it with me

First class information  
Sense your inspiration,  
With some stimulation,  
Weee can do it right.  
(ooooh)  
(Music)  
So now it's time, of the guys  
Can have mine.  
I ain't askin' for no sacrifice  
Baby our friends do not need to know.  
Got a real nice place to go.  
Listen, I don't need you to care,  
And I don't need you to understand,  
All I want is for you to be there,  
And when I turn 'em down  
If you want me  
I'm your man......... I'm your man  
  
If you gonna do it, do it right(right) do it with me,  
If you gonna do it, do it right  
  
I'll be your boy, I'll be your man  
I'll be the one who understands.  
I'll be your first, I'll be your last.  
I'll be the only one you ask.  
I'll be your friend, I'll be your toy.  
I'll be the one who brings you joy,  
Iu'll be your hope, I'll be your pearl.  
I'll take you half around the world.  
(oooo ooo oooh)  
I'll make you rich, I'll make you poor.  
I'm your maaaaaaaaaannnnnnnn.......  
I'll be your boy, I'll be your man  
I'll be the one who understands!  
(Repeat until the end of the song)
