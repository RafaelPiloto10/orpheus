Daisy, Daisy,  
Give me your answer do  
I'm half crazy,  
All for the love of you  
It won't be a stylish marriage  
I can't afford a carriage  
But you'll look sweet  
Upon the seat  
Of a bicycle built for two  
  
Michael, Michael  
Here is your answer true.  
I'll not cycle  
Over the world with you.  
If you can afford a carriage,  
There won't be any marriage.  
'Cause I'll be damned,  
If I'll be crammed  
On a bicycle built for two!
