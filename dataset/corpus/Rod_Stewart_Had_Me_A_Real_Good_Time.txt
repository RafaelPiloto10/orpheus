Carry on, yea  
  
Thought I was lookin' good  
So I cycled 'cross the neighborhood  
Was invited by a skinny girl  
Into her high class world  
  
Left my bicycle under the stairs  
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs  
Made my way across the crowded room  
I had nothing to lose  
  
My reception wasn't very keen  
So turning on a friendly grin  
Stood on the table with my glass of gin  
And came straight to the point  
  
I was glad to come  
I'll be sad to go  
So while I'm here  
I'll have me a real good time  
  
I was glad to come  
I'll be sad to go  
So while I'm here  
I'll have me a real good time, oh  
  
Dancing madly round the room, yeah  
Singing loudly and sorta' out of tune  
Was escorted by a friendly slag  
'Round the bedroom and back  
  
Wandered up across to the door  
Missed my step and I fell on the floor  
Said one word and I was asked to leave  
Kinda' wish I was dead  
  
I was glad to come  
And I'll be so sad to leave  
So while I was here  
I'll had me a real good time  
  
Oh my  
The skinny girl made it clear  
That she only came here for the beer  
That's the thing, oh yea  
The vicar, he simply reeked of gin, oh God  
On my way home I happened to fall off my bicycle, good party  
  
I was glad to come  
But I was also glad to get home, yea
