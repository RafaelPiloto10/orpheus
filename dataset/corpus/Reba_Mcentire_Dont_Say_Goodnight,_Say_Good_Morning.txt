Thought we could make it on our own  
Looks like we didn't get too far  
Love has found its way back home  
Guess time just couldn't change  
The way we are  
  
That old feeling comes so easy  
When your body's close to mine  
I think our crazy hearts have finally made their  
Always one more time  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't say good night, say good morning  
We can make it this time if we try  
Don't say good night, say good morning  
And in the morning  
Never say goodbye  
  
The night's ours and we're alone  
I know I've wasted too much time  
Chasing rainbows that I could never run out  
I've come back to make you mine  
  
Don't let the morning come too early  
Don't leave me here to face the day  
Take me in your arms and never let me go  
And don't let the feelings slip away  
  
[Chorus: x2]
