There ain't no hidden treasure, in this pot of gold you see.  
Ain't no way you're going to make, no silk purse outta me.  
  
Well I'm never ever gonna change your ways, I'll take you as you are.  
You got something that I want, and that's a way to start.  
  
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.  
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.  
  
I told you that I loved you, right from the very start.  
Now don't you make me start again, baby and open up my heart.  
  
Well I know that I'm no angel, can say my first time out.  
But you can count on what I've got, 'cause what I've got's enough.  
  
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.  
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.  
  
When it's cold I want it hot, I've always wanted what it not.  
But when it comes to loving you, I'm yours no matter what you do.  
  
Oh, you're my baby, I'm your man, this is not an angel's plan.  
  
Can't you see it, it's a fact, loving you is where it's at.  
  
(What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.  
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.)  
  
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.  
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.  
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.  
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.
