I tried to get over you  
I tried to find something new  
But all I could ever do  
Was fill, my time, with thoughts, of you  
  
I tried to go somewhere old  
To search for my pot of gold  
But all I could ever hold  
Inside, my mind, were thoughts , of you  
  
I hear your music and it's driving me wild  
Familiar rhythms in a different style  
I hear your music and it's driving me wild  
Again ohhh  
  
Don't want to let you take me down  
Don't want to get hurt 2nd time around  
Don't want to walk that lonely road again yeahh  
Ohh love you yeah  
  
I hear your music and it's driving me wild  
Familiar rhythms in a different style  
I hear your music and its driving me wild again ohhh  
Don't want to let you take me down  
Don't want to get hurt 2nd time around  
Don't want to walk that lonely road again  
Don't want to let you take me down  
Don't want to get hurt 2nd time around  
Don't want to walk that lonely road again  
I don't want to walk that lonely road  
Oh no
