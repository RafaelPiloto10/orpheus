Oh darling, will you ever change your mind  
I've been feeling left behind  
Like a shadow in your light  
Like a shadow in your light, in your light  
  
Ah honey won't you say that I'm the one  
And if you think you're gonna run  
Well you know  
  
I'm gonna be around you, all about you  
Always by your side  
I'm gonna dream about you, scheme about you  
Love you all the time  
I'm gonna catch you lady, catch you lady yeah  
  
The news is all over town  
You better not let me down  
Keep telling me you're feeling good  
As good as you ever could  
Please tell me that you'll never go, ah ah no no  
Tell me that you'll never go, never go  
  
Ah lately, I'm like a watch that's overwound  
And I've got both feet off the ground  
Because you see  
  
I'm gonna be so busy, oh my pretty  
Love you night and day  
And through the rain and shine  
I'll make you mine  
I'll love you come what may  
I'm gonna catch you lady, catch you lady  
Catch you lady uh huh  
I'm gonna catch you lady, catch you lady  
Catch you lady uh huh
