Hey, oh  
Hey yeah  
Hey baby, hey baby  
  
The phone is ringing  
And I'm running late  
I've no time to get it  
'Cause I'm expecting you at eight  
  
Heard your voice on the message  
I'm surprised you called  
Said you're all tied up  
And you ain't comin' at all  
  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
You're just gonna make me crazy  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
If you're not gonna love me right, oh  
  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
At all  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
At all  
  
Another box of roses outside on my porch  
Twelve long excuses none of them stop the hurt  
Where's this going, do you really care?  
Is this real love, I don't know anymore I swear  
  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
Baby don't make me crazy  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
If you're not gonna love me right, yeah  
  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Oh baby  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
I really want you, oh baby  
  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
If you're not gonna love me right  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby just make me crazy  
  
Baby, I want you here  
If you're not here it makes me feel like  
I can't trust you  
You make me crazy if you really love me  
You see  
  
Oh, I get confused when you hold me next to you  
I want to go further, oh baby yes I do  
I just can't hold on to something that won't last  
So we'd better slow down, and maybe not go so fast  
Maybe not go so fast  
  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
You're just gonna make me crazy  
(If you're not gonna love me right)  
If you're not gonna love me  
Baby don't love me, baby don't love me, baby don't love me  
If you're not gonna love me right  
  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby, don't love me at all  
You're just gonna make me crazy  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby, don't love me at all  
You're just gonna make me crazy  
  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love me  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love me  
  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love me  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
If you're not gonna do it right  
  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
If you're not gonna do it right  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
If you're not gonna do it right  
  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love me  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love, baby don't love me
