You're climbing up the ladder on this shaking monkey tree.  
Dreams are coming true that are just far beyond belief.  
You're facing every storm that's blowing right into your face.  
What happened was it's waiting that you're falling in disgrace.  
  
You really never know.  
But life will always go  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.  
  
Your heading for tomorrow for the better days in life.  
But you can only make it if you stand the test of time.  
  
You really never know.  
But life will always go  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.  
  
Just put a china in your pocket  
Keep it in there as long as you can.  
Take the magic and just lock it.  
Where you'll still find the boy inside of man, inside of man, inside of man.  
  
You really never know.  
But life will always go  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.  
  
Well, you know sometimes life doesn't go straight.  
It doesn't go left.  
It doesn't go right.  
Sometimes it just goes nowhere.  
But in the end,  
Life goes around.  
  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.  
  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.
