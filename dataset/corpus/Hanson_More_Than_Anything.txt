[Chorus]  
I love you more than anything  
Than anything, I do.  
And I'd give anything and everything  
I have just to be with you  
  
These feelings I hold inside are emotions  
I cannot hide  
These feelings will not subside  
I'd give anything when I look into your eyes  
I see something special about you  
And when I hold your hand  
You seem to understand that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I think of life without you  
It brings me right down to my knees, yeah  
'Cause I can't enjoy life without you  
You're my strength, the thing that keeps me holding on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, I'd do things that can't be done  
I'd fly to the moon and around the sun, oh  
If you just say that I'm the one  
I'd do anything, anything, well, well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd give anything  
You know I'd do anything for you  
I love you more than anything  
More than anything
