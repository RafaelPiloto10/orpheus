Today don't look so bad, compared to tomorrow.  
If time is all we have, then we're living on borrowed.  
Yesterday's for fools who try to remember.  
The good old days weren't always that much better.  
  
Cynical.  
Well, I ain't nothing but a Cynical.  
It don't take much to be a Cynical.  
All you need is love.  
All you need is what to be a...  
  
And whatever you do, someone's done it first.  
Though it's sad but true, this is just another verse.  
If you can't take it with you, then what's the use?  
I never saw a you-haul being pulled behind a hearse.  
  
Looks like my brighter side has gotten a bit darker.  
I must have stepped over my 4-leaf clover.  
'cause someone drank my half-filled cup of water.
