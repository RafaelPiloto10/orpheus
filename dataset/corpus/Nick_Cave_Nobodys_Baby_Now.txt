I've searched the holy books  
I tried to unravel the mystery of Jesus Christ, the saviour  
I've read the poets and the analysts  
Searched through the books on human behaviour  
I travelled this world around  
For an answer that refused to be found  
I don't know why and I don't know how  
But she's nobody's baby now  
  
I loved her then and I guess I love her still  
Hers is the face I see when a certain mood moves in  
She lives in my blood and skin  
Her wild feral stare, her dark hair  
Her winter lips as cold as stone  
Yeah, I was her man  
But there are some things love won't allow  
I held her hand but I don't hold it now  
I don't know why and I don't know how  
But she's nobody's baby now  
  
This is her dress that I loved best  
With the blue quilted violets across the breast  
And these are my many letters  
Torn to pieces by her long-fingered hand  
I was her cruel-hearted man  
And though I've tried to lay her ghost down  
She's moving through me, even now  
I don't know why and I don't know how  
But she's nobody's baby now  
She's nobody's baby now  
Nobody's baby now  
She's nobody's baby now
