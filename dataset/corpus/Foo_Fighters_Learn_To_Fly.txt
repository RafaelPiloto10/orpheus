Run and tell all of the angels  
This could take all night  
Think I need a devil to help me  
Get things right  
  
Hook me up a new revolution  
'Cause this one is a lie  
Sat around laughing and  
Watched the last one die  
  
I'm looking to the sky to save me  
Looking for a sign of life  
Looking for something help me burn out bright  
  
I'm looking for a complication  
Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying  
Make my way back home  
When I learn to fly (high)  
  
Think I'm done nursing patience  
It can wait one night  
Give it all away  
If you give me one last try  
  
We'll live happily ever trapped  
If you just save my life  
Run and tell the angels  
That everything's all right  
  
I'm looking to the sky to save me  
Looking for a sign of life  
Looking for something help me burn out bright  
  
I'm looking for a complication  
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying  
Make my way back home  
When I learn to fly (high)  
Make my way back home  
When I learn to...  
  
Fly along with me  
I can't quite make it alone  
Try to make this life my own  
Fly along with me  
I can't quite make it alone  
Try to make this life my own  
  
I'm looking to the sky to save me  
Looking for a sign of life  
Looking for something help me burn out bright  
  
I'm looking for a complication  
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying  
Make my way back home  
When I learn to...  
  
Looking to the sky to save me  
Looking for a sign of life  
Looking for something help me burn out bright  
  
I'm looking for a complication  
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying  
Make my way back home  
When I learn to fly high  
Make my way back home  
When I learn to fly  
Make my way back home  
When I learn to...
