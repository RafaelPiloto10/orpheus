I don't have plans and schemes and I don't have hopes and dreams.  
I don't have anything since I don't have you.  
I don't have fond desires and I don't have happy hours.  
I don't have anything since I don't have you.  
I don't have happiness and I guess I never will again.  
When you walked out on me in came old misery,  
And he's been here since then.  
I don't have love to share and I don't have one who cares.  
I don't have anything since I don't have you.  
You, you...
