As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playing  
That old song about the wild, wild side of life.  
As I listen to the words you are saying,  
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you say in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women,  
It's not true that only you, men, feel the same.  
From the start most every heart that's been broken  
Was because there always was a man to blame.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.
