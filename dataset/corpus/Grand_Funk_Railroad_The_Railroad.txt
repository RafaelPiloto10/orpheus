Up each morning at five o'clock,  
Seem like the noon-day sun ain't never gonna' stop.  
The work is hard in a railroad yard,  
Hey, hey, gotta' make it today to punch a time card.  
Workin' on the railroad.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,  
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.  
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,  
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.  
  
Dirt and sweat, runnin' down my back,  
Workin' on the railroad.  
Work all day long up and down the railroad tracks.  
Workin' on the railroad.  
I'm a God fearing man, and with many I stand,  
Workin' on the railroad.  
And with God we've been working, all hand in hand.  
Workin' on the railroad.  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,  
Workin' on the railroad.  
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.  
Workin' on the railroad.  
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,  
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.
