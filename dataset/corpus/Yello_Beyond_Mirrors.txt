The age of science has failed  
To explain our universe in rational terms.  
  
Consequently the power of magic  
Has gradually emerged from our conscious minds  
To fathom the unfathomable.  
  
Our most distinguished scientists  
Reluctantly admit that mankind is nothing  
But some billion creatures,  
Sitting on a piece of solar driftwood floating in space.  
  
Magic is the art of influencing the course  
Of events by the intervention  
Of spiritual forces or some other occult device.  
  
According to Arthur C. Clarke  
Any sufficiently advanced technology  
Is indistinguishable from magic.  
  
Early civilization often mistook  
The unexplainable world around them to be magic.  
  
Rupert Sheldrake in his book  
Seven experiments that could change the world  
Has stated that scientists' attitude  
Toward their experiments affect  
The results of their experiments.  
  
There is no such thing as a definite  
Fact in science and therefore the irrationality of magic  
Plays an important part in our rational world.  
  
Werner Heisenberg, the leading 20th century  
Physicist has stated that mass  
Is a physical interpretation of energy.  
  
Religious organizations have understood the power of magic  
And therefore monopolized the interpretation  
Of the supernatural to control the human mind.  
  
The universe as a whole is beyond explanation.  
  
Only at the end of the 20th. century  
The Roman-Catholic Church admitted,  
That the great visionary Galileo Galilei was in fact correct.  
  
The second millennium has come to an end.  
Scientists have to admit that the universe is magic.
