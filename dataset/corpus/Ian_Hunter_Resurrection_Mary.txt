In 1935, I was living in paradise, I had a friend up in Cicero  
We used to go out to the track, we'd knock a few whiskeys back  
I'd lose my shirt and then I would lose my way home  
I was driving my Stutz Black Hawk through Justice in the dark  
When suddenly the blood froze in my veins  
She was standing by the road in an incandescent glow  
My heart stood still, my foot slammed on the brakes  
She said, "Please, please would you dignify my wish?  
I'm trying to get to Heaven, could you tell me where that is?"  
On a wild Chicago night, with a wind howling white  
I caught my first sign of Resurrection Mary  
I was trembling like a leaf, I was scared beyond belief  
After all my conscience ain't that clear  
I used to work for Mickey Finn, I did the numbers for Big Jim  
Perhaps my day of reckoning lies here  
I said, "Please, please, I would dignify your wish  
But when it comes to Heaven, I'm just a little bit amateurish  
On a wild Chicago night, with a wind howling white  
I cheated time with Resurrection Mary  
And I felt tears form in my eyes for the first time, I felt something  
Deep inside and the first time I saw angels high in the air  
For the first time in my life, and I said, "Mary, go to the light  
It's gonna be alright"  
I got down on my knees, I said, "Sweet Mary, please dignify  
These wishes before you run", will you tell him I've reformed?  
Will you tell him I'm reborn? She closed her eyes  
And then she spoke in tongues  
I said, "Please, please, tell me what he said", she said  
"You must die the day before the devil knows you're dead"  
On a wild Chicago night with a wind howling white  
I waved goodbye on a wild Chicago night
