Mr. Guder  
Say! Mr. Guder  
May I have a moment with you  
Because there is something I've got to say  
And please don't let it scare you away  
  
Mr. Guder  
Say! Mr. Guder  
I have seen you go through a day  
You're everything a robot lives for  
Walk in at nine and roll out the door at five  
  
You reflect the company image  
You maintain their rules to live by  
Shine your shoes let's keep a neat haircut  
Now that you're wearing a coat and tie  
  
Mr. Guder  
Say! Mr. Guder  
Some day soon may realize  
You spend your life just playing a game  
Where no ones wins but everyone stays the same

Some day soon may realize

Where no ones wins but everyone stays the same  
The sa-a-a-me  
  
Please!  
Play your game!  
Stay the same!
