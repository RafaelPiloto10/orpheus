open-minded educated popular and medicated now and you still won't make it
filled with silent indignation blind with hopeless expectation now and you
still won't make it so you're afraid that they will think ill of you get a
load of me now and if you're scared they couldn't care less of you get over
yourself now it's fame and popularity i'll never understand if it feels like
this is what you need you'll never understand innocence and innuendo
confidence and acquiescence now and you still won't make it self-consciousness
is not a virtue everyone is looking at you now you may never make it
