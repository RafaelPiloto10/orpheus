Should I just ride in and steal you away  
Don't know what else to do  
I got a desperado love for you  
  
They say you belong to another man  
The first time we met I knew  
That I'd have a desperado love for you  
  
I know that it breaks every law  
To feel the way I'm feelin'  
But I want your love so desperately  
I don't see the wrong in stealin'  
  
So hold on I'm gonna shoot for the heart  
Like desperadoes do  
I got a desperado love for you  
  
It's so wrong to take what isn't mine  
And head out for the border  
But I can't look at you and have  
Respect for law and order  
  
So hold on I'm gonna shoot for the heart  
Like desperadoes do  
I got a desperado love for you  
I got a desperado love for you
