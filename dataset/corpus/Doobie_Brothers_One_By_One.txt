Where and why I'm destined to go  
Right here and now that's all I know  
On either side future or past  
Neither is real both fade so fast  
So one by one given these moments to live  
Just as one by one they're taken away  
So one by one I'm taking each day in my stride  
And one by one the memories stay  
Good times are still there to find  
When times are their worst  
Keep your eyes open wide  
'Cause through it all are moments that shine  
And moments that glow  
I wanna be there for mine  
So one by one given these moments to live  
Just as one by one they're taken away  
So one by one I'm taking each day in my stride  
And one by one the memories stay  
Even when you're close to a dream  
It can still let you down, still let you down  
You'll always have a chance to give up  
So why do it now  
So one by one given these moments to live  
Just as one by one they're taken away  
So one by one I'm taking each day in my stride  
And one by one the memories stay
