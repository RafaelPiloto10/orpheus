[Chorus]  
I'm gonna creep up on you  
I'm gonna creep up on you  
I'm gonna creep up on you  
I'm gonna gonna  
  
The writing on the wall showed the scandal  
Pointed out the victim of the vandal  
The lady was upset by the angle  
Scratch your back and hot to handle

Soon you're gonna weep in your sleepless surrounding  
'Cause I'm the one taking you down for grounding  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Little lady let me take a little bit of your love
