So much killing  
Too much anger inside  
So much living  
Not enough people living right  
Too much hatred  
Too much emptiness  
I've got too much in me  
To go without a fight  
  
Tonight  
All we need is (one love)  
That's all that we need  
'Cause I know (one love)  
Has given to me  
There's so much  
We can learn from each other  
If we just find that one love.  
  
Too much heartbreak  
Too much drowning inside  
Feels like an earthquake  
Every time that you step outside  
Too much crying  
Too much ugliness  
We've got to come together  
It's time for you and I  
  
So much talking  
So much locked up inside  
We should be listening  
Why do we build these walls so high?  
There's no escaping  
Everyone's working to survive  
We can win this thing together if we try  
  
Tonight  
All we need is (one love)  
That's all that we need  
'Cause I know (one love)  
Has given to me  
There's so much  
We can learn from each other  
If we just find that one love.  
  
Let's find a minute to breathe  
Before we run out of air  
Holding on, falling down  
This world is falling apart  
One love is all we need  
That's what we need is (one love)  
That's all that we need  
'Cause I know (one love)  
Has given to me  
There's so much  
We can learn from each other  
If we just find that one love.  
  
All we need is (one love)  
That's all that we need  
'Cause I know (one love)  
Has given to me  
There's so much  
We can learn from each other  
If we just find that one love  
If we just find that one love  
  
All we need  
(One love, that's all that we need)  
All we need  
(One love, that's all that we need)  
One love, one love, one love, one love  
One love, one love, one love, one love
