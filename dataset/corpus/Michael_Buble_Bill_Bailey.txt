Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?  
She moans the whole night long.  
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent  
I know that I've done you wrong.  
  
I remember that rainy evenin'  
I drove you out with nothin' but a fine tooth comb  
I know that I'm to blame, well ain't that a shame,  
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home.
