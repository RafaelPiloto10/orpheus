Deep down inside  
I know I still love him  
But he'll never know  
Cause I'll never tell  
  
I'll confide that I'm thinking of him  
And wishing him well  
I can't walk up to him and say to him  
  
Baby, what you been doing  
I still love you like I did  
You know, nothing's really changed here  
But being the way I am  
I keep it hid  
  
Lately I've seen  
That look in his eyes  
That just breaks my heart  
He needs me so  
To lean on at this moment  
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say  
  
Baby, what you been doing  
I still love you like I did  
You know, nothing's really changed here  
But being the way I am  
I keep it hid  
  
Maybe someday I'll throw off my foolish pride  
This ain't so good  
Watching him die this way  
Cause he's the same guy inside  
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say  
  
Baby, what you been doing  
I still love you like I did  
You know, nothing's really changed here  
But being the way I am  
I keep it hid
