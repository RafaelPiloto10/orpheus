Where do you go when you think about me?  
What do I do when I think about you?  
  
Skyline  
Passion  
City streets that I adore  
Shadows  
By me grow  
Rent collectors at my door  
  
You got your religion  
I got my addictions  
We got dirty dishes in the sink  
Looking from the window  
Kissing in the kitchen  
Fall so hard that I don't have to think  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave  
  
Mindless  
Game shows  
Flicking through the multi-screen  
Twilight  
Time is slow  
Fall so hard that I could scream  
  
You got your religion  
I got my addictions  
Fall so hard that I don't have to think  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave  
  
All the things that I adore  
Ones I've chosen to ignore  
Rent collectors at my door  
I can't take it anymore  
  
Where do you go when you think about me?  
What do I do when I think about you?  
  
You got your religion  
I got my addictions  
We got dirty dishes in the sink  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave
