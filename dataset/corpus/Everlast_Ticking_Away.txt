Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay  
Yo I've been walkin' round in the streets of these cities  
I've flipped a few whiskies, I've rode a few kitties  
I made a few dollars, I bought a few bottles  
I popped a few collars then rocked a few models  
I've pushed a few buttons, left all you cats guessing  
It's ? Garcia, bia, who you stressin'  
I'm ?, bout to drop blessings  
I had to kill Whitey, word to the almighty  
I'm tailor-made and I'm custom-fitted  
Can't none of y'all cats do it like I did it  
I might come sing it, I might come spit it  
And if you want to take it, try to come get it  
You'll get your wig splitted, get your grill busted  
I'm crazy like the Beastie Boys were still dusted  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you don't stop  
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay  
A tock tick and you don't quit, hit it  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you don't stop  
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay  
A tock tick and you don't quit, hit it  
Yo, off the dummy's instrumental, I spit heavy metal  
Never been from the ghetto, keep it mad fundamental  
Became a night devil, ? rebel  
Add some bass, add some treble, pump up my level  
Cause mad motherfuckers done bit my steeze  
And the game has got biters like dogs got fleas  
And all you dick riders get up off your knees  
Drinkers turn your bottles up, smokers burn your trees  
Learn your A be see's, mind your P's and Q's  
Fuck around, get shot up, wind up on the news  
Yo, it's ? Garcia, he a singin' the blues  
Rockin' shiney jewels and some brand new shoes  
I love my mama cause she ain't raised no fools  
My golden rule is stay holdin' the tool  
What you doing to your people's comes back on you  
Don't know when the grim reaper wants to rendezvous  
It's like  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you don't stop  
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay  
A tock tick and you don't quit, hit it  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you don't stop  
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay  
A tock tick and you don't quit, hit it  
I hear mad motherfuckers say they're ready to die  
Acting like they don't care but I swear they lie  
Tell you now if they had to look death in the eye  
They beg and they plead and they scream and they cry  
When the reaper calls, you all will fall  
You all will fall when the reaper calls  
When the reaper calls, you all will fall  
You all will fall when the reaper calls  
I hear a lot of motherfuckers say they down for the kill  
Most of them are just clowns but they swear they will  
Spend a lot of time being down, keepin' it real  
But I pay more attention to the ones that keep still  
You all will fall when the reaper calls  
When the reaper calls, you all will fall  
You all will fall when the reaper calls  
When the reaper calls, you all will fall  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you don't stop  
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay  
A tock tick and you don't quit, hit it  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking away  
A tick tock and you don't stop  
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay  
A tock tick and you don't quit, hit it
