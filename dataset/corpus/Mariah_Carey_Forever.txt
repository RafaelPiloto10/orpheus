Those days of love are gone  
  
Our time is through  
  
Still I burn on and on  
  
All of my life  
  
Only for you  
  
  
From now  
  
Until forever  
  
And ever my darling  
  
Forever  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
  
As long as I shall live  
  
I'll hold you dear  
  
And I will reminisce  
  
Of our love all through the years  
  
  
From now  
  
Until forever  
  
And ever my darling  
  
Forever  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
  
If you should ever need me  
  
Unfailingly, I will return to your arms  
  
And unburden your heart  
  
And if you should remember  
  
That we belong together  
  
Never be ashamed  
  
Call my name  
  
Tell me I'm the one you treasure  
  
  
Forever  
  
And ever, my darling  
  
Forever  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
  
Forever  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
Forever  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
Forever  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
Forever  
  
You will always be the only one  
  
Forever  
  
You will always be the only one...
