My love, leave yourself behind  
Beat inside me, leave you blind  
My love, you have found peace  
You were searching for release  
  
You gave it all  
You gave into the call  
You took a chance and  
You took a fall for us  
  
You give thoughtfully, loved me faithfully  
You taught me honor, you did it for me  
  
Tonight you will sleep for good  
You will wait for me my love  
  
Now I am strong (Now I am strong)  
You gave me all  
You gave all you had and now I am home  
  
My love, leave yourself behind  
Beat inside me, leave you blind  
My love, look what you can do  
I am mending, I'll be with you  
  
You took my hand and added a plan  
You gave me your heart  
I asked you to dance with me  
  
You loved honestly  
Did what you could release  
  
I know in peace you go  
I won't relieve this love  
  
Now I am strong (Now I am strong)  
You gave me all  
You gave all you had and now I am home  
  
My love, leave yourself behind  
Beat inside me, I'll be with you
