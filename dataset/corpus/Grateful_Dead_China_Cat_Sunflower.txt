Look for a while at the China Cat sunflower,  
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun.  
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono,  
Like a crazy quilt star gown through a dream night wind.  
  
Crazy cat peekin' through a lace bandanna,  
Like a one-eyed Cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack.  
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle,  
To a double-E waterfall over my back.  
  
Comic book colors on a violin river cryin' Leonardo,  
Words from out a silk trombone.  
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls,  
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee.
