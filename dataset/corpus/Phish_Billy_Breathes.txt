Tumbling greens, a pick-up screams alone above the square  
Whoa, sing softly  
Above the trees where Billy breathes we float upon the air  
Whoa, oh  
  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
  
Silent scenes in motion means, I'll wake you when we're there  
Whoa, sing softly  
Time, it seems, in broken dreams, to sleep beside the stair  
Whoa, oh  
  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs  
Softly sing sweet songs
