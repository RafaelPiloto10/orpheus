She looks around  
There are snowflakes on the ground  
Here comes another lonely Christmas  
Stars in the night  
There is one there shining bright  
Shine bright for me this lonely Christmas  
  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I want to be with you  
I wanted to say to you  
How much I need to be with you  
  
Christmas time comes once a year  
She knows this time he won't be near  
  
She phones her mum  
Says this time she cannot come  
Don't worry I'm with friends this Christmas  
Dad gets upset  
But in time he soon forgets  
Here comes another lonely Christmas  
  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I want to be with you  
I wanted to say to you  
How much I need to be with you  
  
Christmas time comes once a year  
She knows this time he won't be near  
  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I want to be with you  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I need to be with you  
  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I want to be with you  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I need to be with you
