Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their joyous strains.  
  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
  
Shepherds, why this jubilee  
Why your joyous strains prolong  
What the gladsome tidings be  
Which inspire your heavenly song?  
  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
  
Come to Bethlehem and see  
Christ whose birth the angels sing  
Come, adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.  
  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
  
See Him in a manger laid  
Whom the choirs of angels praise  
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid  
While our hearts in love we raise.  
  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!...
