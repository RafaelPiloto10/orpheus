Well Portland Oregon and sloe gin fizz  
If that ain't love then tell me what is  
Well I lost my heart it didn't take no time  
But that ain't all. I lost my mind in Oregon  
In a booth in the corner with the lights down low  
I was movin' in fast she was takin' it slow  
Well I looked at him and caught him lookin' at me  
I knew right then we were playin' free in Oregon  
Next day we knew last night got drunk  
But we loved enough for the both of us  
In the morning when the night had sobered up  
It was much too late for the both of us in Oregon  
Well sloe gin fizz works might fast  
When you drink it by the pitcher and not by the glass  
Hey bartender before you close  
Pour us one more drink and a pitcher to go  
And a pitcher to go [repeat]
