Instructions from the manual could not have been much more plain the blues are
still required the blues are still required again  
Past territorial piss-posts past whispers in the closets past screamin' from
the rooftops we live to survive our paradoxes  
  
Men here of the secret they pass in upholstered silence they only exist in
crisis they only exist in silence past territorial  
Piss-posts past whispers in the closets past screamin' from the rooftops we
live to survive our paradoxes we'll live to survive  
Our paradoxes
