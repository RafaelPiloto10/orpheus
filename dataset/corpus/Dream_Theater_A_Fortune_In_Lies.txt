I can remember when,  
In the unity of our five-day sessions  
Not even once did we hear the siren song  
What kind of imagination  
Asleep in some lyrical coma  
Who's vain futile memory  
Could have been so wrong?  
  
You can make a fortune in lies  
You can keep a giant alive  
You can ride the red  
Until everybody smiles  
  
A trifling euphoria  
Was such an untimely religion  
Maybe your life can explain  
The reason for my indecision  
Here is a poor man  
The heart of this monster creation  
He said we both will be heroes  
And I was led into temptation  
  
You can make a fortune in lies  
You can keep a giant alive  
You can ride the red  
Until everybody smiles  
  
Can you show me your gold and your silver?  
A hero in frozen water  
  
"For the first time in a long time  
Everything was right in my world  
And then I woke up"  
  
Now you've made a fortune in lies  
And you kept a giant alive  
You rode the red  
You rode the red
