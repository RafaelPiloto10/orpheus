I walk around pretending you were never here  
But the smell of you is everywhere  
I ache so bad for you I want to shed my skin  
Try and keep my thoughts from turning into you  
  
I'm not angry anymore  
I'm not angry  
I'm not angry anymore  
  
There is no wound as deep as a lovers betrayal  
No touch as tender as your lover's hand  
You were so generous with both I nearly died  
Took all my dignity 'til there was nothin' left inside  
  
I'm not angry anymore  
I'm not angry  
I'm not angry anymore  
  
I just want to forget you  
Erase you, replace you with  
Forgiveness, forgiveness  
  
I ache so bad for you I want to shed my skin  
Try and keep my thoughts from turning into you  
  
I'm not angry anymore  
I'm not angry  
I just want to forget you  
Erase you, replace you with  
Forgiveness, forgiveness  
  
I'm not angry anymore  
I'm not angry  
I'm not angry anymore
