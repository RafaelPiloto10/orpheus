All alone in this world am I  
Not a care for this world have I  
Only you keep my eyes open wide  
Yes it's true  
I live for you  
  
Not a thing in this world do I own  
Only sadness from all that is grown  
In this darkness I wait for the day  
Yes it's true  
I live for you  
  
For many years I wait  
For many tears I wait  
  
All this time my thoughts return to you  
Give my love, that is all I can do  
Wait in line till I feel you inside  
Yes it's true  
I live for you  
  
For many years I wait  
For many tears I wait  
  
All this time my thoughts return to you  
Give my love, that is all I can do  
Wait in line till I feel you inside  
Yes it's true  
I live for you
