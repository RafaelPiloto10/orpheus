[Kool Keith]  
Yeah! We gettin ready to smear peanut butter in the crowd  
and throw mayonnaise all down your ears  
You know what? We got some jams for you boy  
Yo, the meltdown on em, check it out  
  
A lot of rappers, think they can rap and then do that  
Who dat Jumpin on my testicles, my black scrotum  
Show em that they style is cold butt, doo doo  
Like a baby's heiny, a stinky funky boo boo  
Kickin with more rounds, hi pops all sounds  
Get with the drift, what I'm sayin? Slayin  
Bringin MC's to the program  
Not like H-Town, soft on a slow jam  
I kick it wicked with the funky style lick it  
Suck it, jump on the jock just like a groupie woopi  
I make MC's look bad like Charlie Brown and Snoopy  
Your mother act wild, sister act goofy  
DJ's go wild and act retarded, illiterate  
Put me in the mix, well consider it, oh yeah  
I'm down to step and throw a gun in your face  
Hijack all that shit, spray your station with mace  
I got my things in effect, all plans down  
The boys ready, stupid crazy with they masks down  
I walk around, okay, you think I'm jokin?  
Just go to sleep and see what happen, remember  
Where could I be, when you're lonely for Tony  
Take him outside, on the highway for a ride  
Remember when the detectives come, you don't remember anything
