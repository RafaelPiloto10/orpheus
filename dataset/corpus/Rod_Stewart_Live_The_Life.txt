You wrote it in your email that you're sad and lonely  
'Cause a girl in college has stolen your heart  
And so my estimation of the situation  
Is I bet you can't stand being apart  
  
Listen son you gon to find a sense of perspective  
Ain't no use to bury your weight in the sand  
Although I kinda like your evolution of spirit  
You know you got to fall before you learn how to stand  
  
Nobody's gonna know what it's like  
To walk a mile in your shoes  
Such most sayin it's a wonderful world  
But you make it it's up to you  
  
Let yourself fly, let yourself cry  
And years will disappear in a blink of an eye  
There's music in your head , and it holds your plans  
Then handle be heaven wenches in your heart  
So love the life you live  
And live the life you love  
  
Everybody here has been asking about you  
When's that boy of yours gonna be coming home  
And when I hear the bells ringing down at the school yard  
Kinda reminds me of when you were young  
  
You know you gotta polarize your concentration  
I know that girl of yours gonna understand  
Never underestimate the power of affection  
When you got the world in the palm of your hands  
  
Don't go looking for the pot of gold  
Or the light miracle mile  
Hundred has lost in your home backyard  
Be talking it could take a while  
  
Walk down the aisle, with that big old smile  
Collect your diploma with your head up high  
Study with your soul, 10 weeks left on  
We'll always remember, let the good times roll  
Another life you live  
And live the life you love  
  
Nobody's gonna know what it's like  
To walk a mile in your shoes  
Such most sayin it's a wonderful world  
But you make it it's up to you  
  
So walk by the lake hand in hand  
Try and see the sunset in the far away land  
Tell her you love her don't be afraid  
And keep every promise that you ever made  
And love the life you live  
Live the life you love  
Love the life you live  
Live the life you love  
  
You gotta love it  
You gotta love it  
Make the most of it  
You only got one chance  
So take it with your hands  
Love the life you live
