If you feel the whole world is against you  
And you're irritated about what someone said  
Remember  
You control the thoughts that you are thinking  
It's a choice you make and it's all inside your head  
  
When you're late for work and stuck in traffic  
And you feel like Michael Douglas in "Falling down"  
And then some stupid driver makes you go ballistic  
Just kick back, relax  
And ignore that screaming down  
  
So, Love this life  
Love this life, fill it up with sunshine  
A happy thought  
Is all you need to keep the clouds away  
  
Love this life  
Love this life, fill it up with sunshine  
A little sunshine  
And everything is gonna go your way  
  
When you check the mirror in the morning  
You look pale and old and your waist's  
Hard to define  
And then your Doctor Slim is giving you a warning  
And you accept you'll never work for Calvin Klein  
  
So, love this life...  
  
Why do we worry about tomorrow today when  
Everyday proves us wrong about the worries we  
Had yesterday [x2]  
  
In 5 billion years or more the sun stops burning  
And this world will be a cold and lonely place  
And although our mother earth will keep on turning  
She will have to cope without the human race  
So it's time to love this life and seize the day  
  
So love this life...  
  
So love this life  
Love the ones that do not even deserve it  
And if you can't  
Just forgive them for the things they've done  
Love this life  
Love this life and let your troubled soul shine  
A little shine  
And everything is gonna go your way
