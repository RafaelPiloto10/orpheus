Hey grace, oh, night is you know a couple of hours a day for nothing  
If you can hope you can hold on to your heaven  
Remember it when you said once you tell  
'cause what you don't know, you don't know, it gets you in trouble  
Sometimes you know you don't know - find your way  
But now watching over you now, I'll get you over  
If you don't pretend you know what you don't know, you don't know again  
I'm gonna walk back in your arms  
If I'm only invited back again
