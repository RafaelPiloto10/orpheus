How many times have I read farewell lines  
In the things that you never seemed to say?  
How many times have I read those last lines  
And wondered why it ended this way?  
Words of goodbye and all those loving lines  
I must have been blind  
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name  
Both have changed with the passing of time  
How you would write about the bright lights  
And your words always clouded up my eyes  
How you would write about the bright lights  
It's a wonder that I never realized  
Our race was run now and another's just begun  
I must have been blind  
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name  
Both have changed with the passing of time  
When your letters stopped the tears that I fought  
How they came in the flood of memories  
When your letters stopped the tears that I fought  
How they ran like the rivers to the seas  
Each sunny day, you slip further away  
I must have been blind  
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name  
Both have changed with the passing of time
