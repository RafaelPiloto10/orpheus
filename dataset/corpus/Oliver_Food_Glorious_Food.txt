Is it worth the waiting for,  
If we live till eighty-four  
All we ever get is gruel,  
Every day we say our prayers  
Will they change the bill of fair?  
Still we get the same old gruel  
There's not a crust not a crumb  
Can we find can we beg can we borrow or cadge,  
But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill,  
When we all close our eyes and imagine,  
  
Food glorious food  
Hot sausage and mustard  
While we're in the mood cold jelly and custard  
Pease pudding and saveloys  
What next is the question?  
Rich gentlemen have it boys  
In-Di-Gestion  
  
Food glorious food  
What is there more handsome  
Gulped swallowed or chewed  
Still worth a kings ransom  
What is it we dream about?  
What brings on a sigh?  
Piled peaches and cream about six feet high  
  
Food glorious food  
Were anxious to try it  
3 banquets a day  
Our favourite diet  
Just picture a great big steak fried, roasted or stewed  
Oh food marvelous food wonderful food magical food fabulous food beautiful
food  
Glorious food
