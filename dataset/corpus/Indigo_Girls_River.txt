It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
Putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
  
But it don't snow here  
It stays pretty green  
Gonna make a lot of money  
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene  
And I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
  
I wish I had a river so wide  
I would teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
'cause I made my baby cry  
  
You tried hard to help me  
And you put me at ease  
Then loved me so naughty  
Made me weak in my knees  
And wish I had a river  
That I could skate away on  
  
I'm so hard to handle  
I'm selfish and i'm sad  
Now I lost the best baby  
That I ever had  
And I wish I had a river  
That I could skate away on  
  
I wish I had a river so wide  
I could teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river  
That I could skate away on  
Cause I made my baby say goodbye  
  
It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
Putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
But I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
  
God I wish I had a river so wide  
I'd teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I made my baby say goodbye
