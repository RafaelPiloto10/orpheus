Finally got a ride, some old broad down from Santa Fe  
She was a real go-getter  
She drawled so sweetly, "I think, child, that things'll get better"  
"Yes, I read the Bible", she said, "I want to know of you"  
  
We pulled off the highway, night black as a window  
Hey, I think I've got a live one  
Hey, I think I've got a live one, Yeah, Yeah  
I think I've got a live one  
  
Felt like I was hit by a dieselor a greyhound bus  
She was no baby-sitter  
"Get up, sugar, never thought you'd be a quitter"  
I opened the back door, she was greedy  
  
I ran through the desert, she was chasin  
No time to get dressed ,so I was naked , stranded in Chihuahua  
  
Alone raped and freezing  
Alone cold and sneezing  
Alone down in Mexico  
Alone
