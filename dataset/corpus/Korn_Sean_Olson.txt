What's your lie?  
Warm glance, a fake smile.  
Eyes meet, your mind runs wild.  
This game you play I like in a way.  
  
You expect to grab a child (grab a child)  
You think I'm innocent not wild.  
Take me let's see how much I'm tamed.  
  
Everybody listen while I think of all I know,  
How to live for sure - body wall into my precious soul.  
I'll show you fears, pleasure pain is my control.  
Let your body lay in there, warm flesh to your fear.  
  
Warm lips, a big smile.  
Hatred runs through your insides.  
This game you play - intimidation each day.  
  
You think it's all a lie (all a lie)  
They want to destroy your life.  
Anger twisted your life into pain  
  
I wish I could take control.  
I wish I could let go.  
I wish I could break this mould.  
Inside I'm so fucking cold.  
  
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming on you... (x4)
