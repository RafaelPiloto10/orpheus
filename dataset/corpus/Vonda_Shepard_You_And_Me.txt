Part of me wants to break the ice  
And part of me wants to roll the dice  
Exactly how it stands  
Part of me wants to roll the dice  
And part of me wants to leave them curled up in my hands  
  
Where they will be safe and no one will know  
How I really feel and I'll never be real  
And I'll roll with the punches that I'll never feel  
And I'll have a heart that no one can steal  
  
[Chorus]  
It's you and me and you're nowhere to be found  
I'm rolling on the ground  
It's me and you and I'm nowhere to be found  
  
Part of me wants to break these chains  
And part of me wants to keep them locked up tight  
Part of me wants to stop these rains  
And part of me wants them to fall all night  
  
Fall on my head just to wake me up  
Anything to drench my half-empty cup  
And I'm sorry baby I've had enough  
I'm tired of your promised tearing me up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You will be safe and no one will know  
How you really feel and you'll never be real  
And you'll roll with the punches that you'll never feel  
And you'll have a heart that I'll never steal  
  
[Chorus]
