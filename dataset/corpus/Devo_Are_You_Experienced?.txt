If you could just get your mind together  
Then come along with me  
Hold hands and watch the sunrise  
From the bottom of the sea  
But first(but first), are you (are you), experienced?  
  
Well have you ever been experienced?  
Well. I have, I have  
  
I know I know  
You'll probably scream and cry  
Your little world won't let you go  
But who in your world  
Are you trying to prove  
That you're made out of gold  
And can't be sold  
But first but first), are you(are you), experienced?  
Well have you ever been experienced?  
Well. I have (I have). let me prove it to you.  
Let me prove it to you.  
  
Beautiful mutants I can hear in the distance  
I think they're callin' our name  
Maybe you can't hear them, but you will  
If you'll take hold of my hand  
But first (but first...), are you experienced?  
Well have you ever been experienced?  
Well. I have.(I have) let me prove it to you.  
Oh not necessarily beautiful  
But mutated
