At a point below zero  
There's no place left to go  
Six hundred unknown heroes  
Were killed like sleeping buffalo  
  
Through the devil's canyon  
Across the battlefield  
Death has no companion  
The spirit is forced to yield  
  
There goes the bandolero  
Through the hole in the wall  
He's a coward but doesn't care though  
In fact, he doesn't care at all  
  
The general that's commanding  
He's defending what he fears  
While the troops they are depending  
On reinforcements from the rear  
  
If God is in the heavens  
How can this happen here?  
In His name, they used the weapons  
For the massacre  
  
There is a point below zero  
Where the sun can see the land  
Six hundred unknown heroes  
Lay dead in the sand
