(Screamin' Jay Hawkins)  
[Inspired by Nina Simone's 1965 cover of Screamin' Jay Hawkins 1956 cult hit]  
I put a spell on you  
'cause you're mine  
You better stop the things you do  
I ain't lyin'  
No I ain't lyin'  
You know I can't stand it  
You're runnin' around  
You know better daddy  
I can't stand it cause you put me down  
I put a spell on you  
Because you're mine  
You're mine  
I love ya  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you anyhow  
And I don't care  
If you don't want me  
I'm yours right now  
You hear me  
I put a spell on you  
Because you're mine
