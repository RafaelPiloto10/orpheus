When you was seventeen and I was nineteen  
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens  
We didn't know a thing about love  
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug  
Held you tightly and promised you the world  
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl  
When I think about it now makes me smile  
Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while  
  
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades  
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (Of what?)  
Of the darkness and bitter memories  
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity  
I promised you I'd love you to the end  
Always and forever since way back when  
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend  
You taste better now than you did back then  
  
[Chorus]  
You will always be my candy  
One day we will start a family  
You will always be my candy girl  
(You'll be my candy girl forever)  
You will always be my candy  
Want your love girl, understand me  
You will always be my candy girl  
  
While you sucked caramel apple lollipops  
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock  
We used to walk down the block hold hands  
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man  
And any guys that want to socialize  
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that tries  
My peeps used to say I was whipped  
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped  
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt  
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt  
I would look up at ya I remember  
The afternoon you surrendered  
We made love the temperature was high as could be  
You said "Todd promise you ain't lyin' to me"  
And as we went our separate ways you turned back  
Smiled, I remember all that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Take it to the bridge)  
Candy girl  
You are my world  
Look so sweet  
You're a special treat  
Candy girl  
All I want to say  
I need your love  
Each and every day  
  
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall  
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call  
Of days when love was true I slept and held you  
Taste the brown sugar, let your climax melt you  
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts  
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught  
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me  
Sweet love strictly  
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side  
Take you for a mental and emotional ride  
Make love to your soul, your heart, and your mind  
In your hour of need girl, I'll be there every time  
And as long as you support my dreams  
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team  
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of  
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Candy girl  
You are my world  
Look so sweet  
You're a special treat  
(You'll be my candy girl forever)  
Candy girl  
All I want to say  
(Word is bond sweetheart)  
I need your love  
(I swear I'm down for whatever)  
Candy girl  
(sometimes you gotta go back home)  
Look so sweet  
(I love you)  
Candy girl
