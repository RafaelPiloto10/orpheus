I saw you  
And you saw me  
And I didn't even know your name  
Just one look  
That was all it took  
And I knew I'd never be the same  
If walkin' on air compares to what I feel  
Then how can I keep it sealed when  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to tell the world  
If the smile on my face  
Hasn't given me away already  
I want to tell the world  
There ain't no way to hide it  
Your love has got me flyin' high  
Since the day  
  
That you looked my way  
I knew we were meant to be together  
Now I thank the Lord  
For a love like yours  
Cause I know it's gonna last forever  
It's hard to believe my dreams have all come true  
And I'm so in love with you that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want the world to know  
Love has got me good to go  
[I want to tell the world, I want to tell the world]  
I have got to get it out  
She is all I think about  
[I want to tell the world, I want to tell the world]  
It's something' that I need to say  
Love has overtaken me  
  
[Chorus]
