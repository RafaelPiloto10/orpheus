I remember finding out about you  
Every day, my mind is all around you  
Looking out from my lonely room, day after day  
Bring it home, baby, make it soon  
I give my love to you  
  
I remember holding you while you sleep  
Every day, I feel the tears that you weep  
Looking out of my lonely gloom, day after day  
Bring it home, baby, make it soon  
I give my love to you  
  
Looking out of my lonely room, day after day  
Bring it home, baby, make it soon  
I give my love to you  
  
I remember finding out about you  
Every day, my mind is all around you  
Looking out of my lonely gloom, day after day  
Bring it home, baby, make it soon  
I give my love to you.
