Words and music by queen  
  
With the morning I face the sun  
I lift my head and smile for everyone  
Every afternoon youll find me working on  
I got my new shoes on  
Got to be moving on  
Thats what they say  
Every night Im tossed  
And I shake my fevered brow  
Thinking of my lost opportunity  
  
Yes every morning I face the sun  
I get so positive with everyone  
Every afternoon youll find the cracks showing through  
They know what Im going through  
Oh yes they do  
Every evening finds me  
The optimist behind me  
On with my lost opportunity
