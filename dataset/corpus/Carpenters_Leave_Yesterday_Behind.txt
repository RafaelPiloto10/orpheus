When the morning sunrise  
Becomes a magic show  
Before your very eyes  
And all the sounds of life  
Begin to harmonize  
You hear a song of hope  
Surround your senses  
And feel the promise of a brand new kind of world  
Lose your defenses  
Unlock your mind  
Unwind and follow me  
Come let me help you see  
How to find the way to leave yesterday behind  
  
We should be together  
When we're this close we're bound to work it out somehow  
We found a dream to share  
Don't lose it now  
Just let my song of love  
Surround your senses  
And feel the promise of a brand new kind of world  
Lose your defenses  
Unlock your mind  
You know I love you  
(Love you)  
Come let me show you  
(show you)  
How to find the way to leave yesterday behind
