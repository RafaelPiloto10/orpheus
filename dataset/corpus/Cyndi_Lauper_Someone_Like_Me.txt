Midnight falls on the snow-lit trees  
And as I stand inside I know that I  
Can't watch life through a window  
My indecision is blocking the door  
It's like a religion  
That I never ask for more  
I might stumble and fall  
  
What's someone like me,  
Doing in a life like this?  
I can't see  
What someone like me  
Is doing in a life like this  
Slipping back into the past  
  
Sun comes up and streams  
Through the blinds  
And as I throw my clothes on  
Do my hair wrong,  
Stare into my mirror  
Telling myself that everyone falls  
Take the first step  
That's the trick of it all  
Bounce back like a ball  
  
What's someone like me  
Doing in a life like this ?...  
  
My mind is filled with  
Runaway dreams  
I can't wake up  
I don't know what it means  
You see I fell asleep  
With the television on  
When I woke up it was gone  
I read my horoscope  
To see what's in store  
I get a little lazy but  
I want more, I want more  
  
What's someone like me  
Doing in a life like this ?  
I can't see  
What someone like me  
Is doing in a life like this...
