(I really can't stay) But baby it's cold outside  
(Got to go away) But baby it's cold outside  
(This evening has been) Been hoping you'd drop in  
(So very nice) I'll hold your hands they're just like ice  
(My mother will start to worry) Beautiful watch you're wearing  
(My father will be pacing the floor) Listen to the fireplace roar  
(So really I'd better scurry) Beautiful please don't hurry  
(Well maybe just half a drink) Put some records on while I pour  
(The neighbors might think) Baby it's bad out there  
(Say what's in this drink) No cabs to be had out there  
(I wish I knew how) Your eyes are like starlight now  
(To break this spell) I'll take your hat your hair looks swell  
(I ought to say no no) Mind if I move in closer  
(At least I'm going to say I tried) What's the sense of hurting my pride  
(I really can't stay) Baby don't hold out  
(Both) Baby it's cold outside  
  
(I simply must go) Baby it's cold outside  
(The answer is no) Baby it's cold outside  
(The welcome has been) How lucky that you dropped in  
(So nice and warm) Look out the window at the storm  
(My sister will be suspicious) Gosh your lips look delicious  
(My brother will be there at the door) Waves upon a tropical shore  
(My maiden aunt's mind is vicious) Gosh your lips are delicious  
(But maybe just a cigarette) Never such a blizzard before  
(I got to get home) But baby you'd freeze out there  
(Say lend me a comb) It's up to your knees out there  
(You've really been grand) I thrill when you touch my hand  
(But don't you see) How can you do this to me  
(There's bound to be talk tomorrow) Think of my life long sorrow  
(At least they'll be plenty implied) If you caught pneumonia and died  
(I really can't stay) Get over that old doubt  
(Both) Baby it's cold  
(Both) Baby it's cold outside
