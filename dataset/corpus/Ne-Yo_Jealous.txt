Said I'm jealous  
  
I said I wish my hands could do  
What that dress is doing  
Holding it tight  
As your body's moving.  
And the way that glass of wine,  
Can ease your mind and soothe ya.  
said ooh baby. I'm gonna do it to ya.  
  
From the wind that blows by  
Smell of a scent of your perfume.  
To the sun that touches your skin  
On a Sunday afternoon.  
I'm jealous!  
  
I said, you got me jealous of everything.  
Everything that gets to know to you. (Baby)  
Said you got me jealous of everything.  
Because nothing loves you like I do.  
I said nothing loves you like I do.  
  
Said I wish my thoughts could be,  
Could be inside your head.  
And make you think of me, and you,  
In your bed.  
Tattoo on your waistline.  
Ooh what I wouldn't do,  
Said what I wouldn't give to be a permanent part of you,  
Oh, oh.  
  
From the wind that blows by  
To the smell of a scent of your perfume.  
To the sun that touches your skin  
On a Sunday afternoon.
