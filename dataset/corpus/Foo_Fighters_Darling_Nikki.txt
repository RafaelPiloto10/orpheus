I knew a girl named Nikki  
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend  
I met her in a hotel lobby  
Masturbating with a magazine  
  
She said how'd you like to waste some time  
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind  
  
She took me to her castle  
And I just couldn't believe my eyes  
She had so many devices  
Everything that money could buy  
She said sign your name on the dotted line  
The lights went out  
And Nikki started to grind  
  
Ahh!  
Nikki!  
Oh  
  
The castle started spinning  
Or maybe it was my brain  
I can't tell you what she did to me  
But my body will never be the same  
Her lovin' will kick your behind  
Oh, she'll show you no mercy  
But she'll sho' 'nough sho' 'nough show you how to grind  
  
Woke up the next morning  
Nikki wasn't there  
I looked all over and all I found  
Was a phone number on the stairs  
It said thank you for a funky time  
Call me up whenever you want to grind  
  
Ah!  
Nikki!  
Oh  
Ah!  
Come back Nikki!  
Come back!
