Save me, free me from my heart this time  
Train's going down the track and I stay behind  
Nothing can free me from this ball and chain  
I made up my mind that I would live today  
And you're keeping me going, I know it's insane  
Cause I love you, and lose again  
When the heart calls, the mind obeys  
And it knows better than me  
Hold on one more day and maybe he'll be true  
Nothing can free me from this ball and chain  
I made up my mind that I would live today  
And you're keeping me going, I know it's insane  
Cause I love you, and I'll lose again  
Save me, free me from my heart this time  
Train's going down the track and I stay behind  
Nothing can free me from this ball and chain  
I made up my mind that I would live today  
And you're keeping me going, I know it's insane  
Cause I love you, and I'll lose again
