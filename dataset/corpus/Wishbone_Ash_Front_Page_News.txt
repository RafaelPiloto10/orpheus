You made me feel good  
After all this time,  
Welcomed me home  
With my name in lights,  
Took me by the hand,  
Shook away my fear,  
Brought back the memory  
Of those earlier years.  
Everybody's talkin', front page news.  
Gotta help you get up  
And get rid of your blues.  
Cheatin' the devil, or whatever you choose,  
Even if you've got nothin', boy,  
You've got somethin' to lose.  
You've got the...  
Eatin' out of your hand.  
Got the answer if you've got the time.  
Can't go on forever in lotus land,  
Don't end up doing one night stands.  
I've seen your face in every cloud,  
I've followed the sun  
Which brought me back to your side.  
I've lived some time  
By what the fortune-tellers say,  
But now I know in love with u.k.  
Everybody's talkin', front page news.
