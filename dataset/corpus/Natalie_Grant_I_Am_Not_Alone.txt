You're here  
In my heart  
You're the light  
That guides me through the dark  
  
You walk beside me  
The night seems cold  
Each time I fall  
Your arms are there to hold  
  
[Chorus]  
You walk beside me  
Giving strength I've never known  
I am not alone  
You walk beside me  
  
You're here  
In my mind  
I talk to you  
And all my fears unwind  
I know I'm loved for who I am  
You make me wanna be the best I can  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I rely on your patience  
When I face the unknown  
And because of you  
I am not alone  
  
In the sun, in the rain  
Through the good times and the pain  
I reach out for your hand  
I know that you understand  
  
[Chorus]
