Waits all day for the Sun to dim his brights  
Face shinin' amber in the radio lights  
It's all that he needs to see  
Fire ignites when he turns the key  
  
Wonder what it could be like  
Just look then he's gone  
Pay attention and you might  
See just how he makes sparks fly  
  
Hands on the wheel, he's a permanent fixture  
Reads hot rod mags like Holy Scripture  
He ignores the brake pedal like step-daddy's child  
Feel him pushing on the gas like a motherless wife  
  
Wonder what it could be like  
Just look then he's gone  
Pay attention and you might  
See just how he makes sparks fly  
  
While you're trying to think of  
Why you never could become  
Things you dreamed of  
Hot night sky he watch sparks fly  
  
Highway birds, sunrise, paradise  
Cinderella's morning appetite  
Squintin' his eyes and the driver kills his lights  
Ignites his stash, he's a Plymouth Satellite  
  
Wonder what it could be like  
Just look then he's gone  
Pay attention and you might  
See just how he makes sparks fly  
  
While you're trying to think of  
Why you never could become,  
Things you dreamed of  
Hot night sky he watch sparks fly  
  
Wonder what it could be like'  
Just look then he's gone'  
Pay attention and you might  
See just how he makes sparks fly  
  
While you're trying to think of  
Why you never could become  
Things you dreamed of  
Hot night sky he watch sparks  
Hot night sky he watch sparks fly
