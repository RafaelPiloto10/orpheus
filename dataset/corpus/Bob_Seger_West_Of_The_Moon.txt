Out on those trails  
Out 'neath that sky  
Rivers of old  
Still rushing by  
  
Eagles still soar  
White mountains loom  
Down in those valleys  
West of the Moon  
  
West of the stars  
Far from the chase  
Far from the crowds  
Far from the pace  
  
Horses run free  
Winter comes soon  
Out by those mountains  
West of the Moon  
  
And everywhere  
Everywhere  
Wild things are free  
Free in the wind and the sun  
  
Everywhere  
Everywhere  
As it should be  
Left on their own while they run  
  
Out by those mountains  
West of the Moon
