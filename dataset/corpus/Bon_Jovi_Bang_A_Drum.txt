I went to see the preacher  
To teach me how to pray  
He looked at me and smiled  
Then the preacher turned away  
He said if you want to tell him something  
You ain't gotta fold your hands  
Say it with your heart  
Your soul and believe it  
And I'd say amen  
  
Bang a drum for the sinners  
Bang a drum for the sins  
Bang a drum for the losers  
And those who win  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
Bang a drum for yourself son  
And a drum for me  
  
I called upon my brother just the  
Other day, he said: John I'm gonna  
Die if I don't start to live again  
I work each day and night like clockwork  
Just trying to make ends meet  
I could kick this bad world's ass  
If I could just get on my feet  
  
I'd bang a drum for the dying  
Bang a drum for the truth  
Bang a drum for the innocence  
Lost in our youth  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
Bang a drum for you brother  
And a drum for me  
  
I don't know where all the rivers run  
I don't know how far, I don't know how come  
But I'm gonna die believin'  
Each step that I take  
Ain't worth the ground that  
I walk on  
If we don't walk it our  
Own way  
  
No I don't claim to be a wise man  
A poet or a saint  
I'm just another man who's searching  
For a better way  
But my heart beats loud as thunder  
For the things that I believe  
Sometimes I wanna run for cover  
Sometimes I want to scream  
  
Bang a drum for tomorrow  
Bang a drum for the past  
Bang a drum for the heroes  
That won't come back  
Bang a drum for the promise  
Bang a drum for the lies  
Bang a drum for the lovers  
And the tears they've cried  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
But as long as my heart keeps on bangin'  
I got a reason to believe
