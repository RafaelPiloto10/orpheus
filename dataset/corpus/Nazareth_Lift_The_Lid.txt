Here I am, sitting on my porch  
Thinkin' my life has got to be beyond reproach  
Have I forgot some friends close to me  
Real ones that don't use me  
And does my woman love me now  
Like she loved me then  
Here I am,my defenses are down  
Will she remember me when I'm not around  
Will she still dream by me  
Or will she find a new life  
Will I ever get used, to being alone at night  
I'll never know, but would it do me any good if I did  
Life is a strange brew, maybe we should not lift the lid  
Lift the lid  
I'll never know, but would it do me any good if I did  
Life is a strange brew, maybe we should not lift the lid  
Lift the lid
