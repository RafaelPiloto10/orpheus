[Verse 1]  
I remember what you said to me, when you said it to me last night  
we was talkin', and you reassured me everythings fine  
When I woke up this morning to get some loving from you  
I turned to one side, to my suprise, I wasn't layin' next to you(mmmm)  
Why don't you get closed to me, I thought it was supposed to be  
Me and you, you and me, so complete(so complete)  
Why you handlin' me this way, what was it  
you was talkin yesterday, yesterday, I could say,  
I seemed to be so complete, so complete  
  
[Chorus]  
Went away, you said nothing  
you didn't, no kiss, no lovin'  
you didn't, it's a shame,  
but it brings about the weak in me,  
brings about the weak in me  
you didn't, spend a lifetime with me  
you didn't, share things I wan'na see  
you didn't, when ever your around me it's so complete  
  
[Verse 2]  
So I waited, and I waited, 'cause I knew you would come  
Hours 1, hour 2, hour, 3 hours, not at all  
If I'm dreaming, wake me up  
'Cause I just about had enough, I had enough  
I can not see, how would you ever let this happen to me  
I still belive, that it was supposed to be  
Me and you, you and me, so complete  
So complete, so complete  
If you saying that you need to leave, then be a man about it  
and step to me, step to me, tell me please  
that without me it's so complete, so complete  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
[Verse 3]  
Won't you tell me right now what you want from me(what you want from me)  
'Cause it's been too long that you've held it in baby(held it in, oh)  
Thought you where the one but, you just played me(you know you played me)  
Now I feel that I'm so incomplete, yeah  
  
Repeat Chorus (with different variations)  
  
[Verse 4]  
Please, give me the responce I need  
I want you to complete me, oh baby  
Please, give me all the lovin' I need  
Promise you'll neva leave me, oh baby  
Baby, what more can I say  
'Cause I want you to tell me  
What it is you wanna do  
'Cause I want'a be with you  
(be with you...)
