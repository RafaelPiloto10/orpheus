She's ahead of her time and she's never lazy  
But something changed your mind and she could drive you crazy  
Volunteers for winter coats and summer clothes that shine  
Volunteers for magazines I read them all the time  
But that's all right  
Do do do do do do do do do do - do do do do do do da da da  
Down the runway  
Do do do do do do do do do do - do do do do do do do  
She's so ugly  
  
Tidy work never suffers when you stage your abuse  
Cocktails in the evening when you're completely nude  
Models at the motor show and I dribble at the thought  
Models looking like lobsters, convertibles and sports
