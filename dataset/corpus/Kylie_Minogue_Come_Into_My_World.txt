Come, come, come into my world  
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love  
  
Take these arms that were made for lovin'  
And this heart that will beat for two  
Take these eyes that were meant for watching over you  
And I've been such a long yime waiting  
For someone I can call my own  
I've been chasing the life I'm dreaming  
Now I'm home  
  
I need your love  
Like night needs morning  
  
Come, come, come into my world  
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love  
  
Na na na na  
  
Take these lips that were made for kissing  
And this heart that will see you through  
And these hands that were made to touch and  
feel you  
  
So free your love  
Hear me I'm calling  
  
Oh won't you  
Come, come, come into my world  
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love  
  
I need your love  
Like night needs morning  
  
Oh won't you  
Come, come, come into my world  
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love
