Looking in the papers makes me sorry to be human  
A little ray of hope won't hurt at all  
A price on every head and it's cheaper when you're dead  
Quality of life may have to fall  
  
Muffled voices, world in action  
Stir the peaceful, need for longing  
  
I cannot describe the fear inside my heart  
I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace  
  
Guess it's human nature to be cruel and heartless  
But that's no reason to shoot him when he's down  
Crawl in on your knees and then bite the hand that feeds  
The cages throw their shadows across the ground  
  
Where's the sense in senseless violence  
Hear the silence too forgiving  
  
I cannot describe the fear inside my heart  
I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace (grace, grace)  
  
Press your hands in, into the pavement  
Bathed in glory, here's your moment  
  
I cannot describe the fear inside my heart  
(I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace)  
I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace  
(I cannot describe the fear inside my heart)  
  
I cannot describe the fear inside my heart  
(I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace)  
I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace  
(I cannot describe the fear inside my heart)
