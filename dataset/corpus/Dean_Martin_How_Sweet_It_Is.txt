How sweet it is hearing a nightingale  
Echo would call to his mate when the night shadows fall  
How sweet that rose ask the bee for it knows  
Where the honey drips from honey lips where red roses grow  
How sweet it is all of those lovely things  
But darling they can't compare with dreams I share with you  
I know the glow of love in our hearts like the stars forever will shine  
How sweet it is to know that you're mine  
How sweet it is hearing a nightingale  
Echo will call to his mate when the night shadows fall  
How sweet that rose ask the bee for it knows  
Where the honey drips from honey lips where red roses grow  
How sweet it is all of those lovely things  
But darling they can't compare with dreams I share with you  
I know the glow of love in our hearts like the stars forever will shine  
How sweet it is (How very sweet it it)  
How sweet it is to know that you're mine
