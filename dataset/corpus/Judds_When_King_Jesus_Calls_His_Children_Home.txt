When they plant me like a seed in the ground  
In silent sleep beneath some mossy mound  
I'll be like a rose just waitin' for the spring  
'Cause I'm a gonna rise up, rise up, shout and sing  
  
'Cause there ain't no grave gonna hold my body down  
When I hear, I hear that trumpet sound  
I know I've been a dyin' since the day that I was born  
But now I'm living for that resurrection morn'  
  
(Chorus)  
When King Jesus calls his children home  
When King Jesus calls his children home  
I'm a gonna wear my snow white gown  
I'm gonna put on a starry crown  
When King Jesus calls his children home  
  
Like a bird in a cage that's been set free  
My soul will sing throughout eternity  
I'll shed this mortal shell, oh, let ol' Satan stay in hell  
I'll see glory that no human tongue can tell  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Ye know not the hour  
Ye know not the day  
So, be humble, my children  
Hide and watch and pray  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
(Repeat Chorus)
