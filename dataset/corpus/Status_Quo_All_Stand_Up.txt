All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together  
  
Working all week till Friday  
Wish I could do it my way  
Until when I'm living it up  
I ain't giving it up  
Making the best of my lot  
One of these days when I stop  
And I'm gonna be living it up  
I won't be giving it up  
Telling you now it's my day  
Oh I'm gonna do it my way  
  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together  
  
The job it just drives me crazy  
Guess I'm a little lazy  
I don't care 'cause what do they know  
They'll be there when I go  
Every day feel like screaming  
Nothing gonna stop me dreaming  
And there's one thing sure that I know  
I can't wait for the whistle to blow  
Telling you now it's Friday  
I'm gonna do it my way  
  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together  
  
Living and loving and learning  
Gotta keep the whole world turning  
So come on let's give it a try  
No use in wondering why  
Running away and hiding  
Taking our time and finding  
If we stop then it's all gonna go  
Don't wait for the whistle to blow  
Everyday feel like screaming  
Nothing gonna stop me dreaming  
  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, are you ready for the weekend are you ever  
All stand up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say we're gonna get together  
  
All hands up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say never say never  
All hands up, let me hear you say never say never say never say
