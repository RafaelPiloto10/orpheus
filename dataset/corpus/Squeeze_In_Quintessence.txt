He smokes himself into double vision  
Leaves his mind on an indecision,  
Thinks he's invented imagination  
Says that god is some relation.  
He leaves his cigarette burning on the desk  
His clothes and magazines make up such a mess,  
Sitting up in bed transistor on his chest  
In quintessence.  
  
He and his friends sit around all evening  
Leaving their laughter upon the ceiling,  
Seems so funny yet it leaves me yawning  
Then I find it's the following morning.  
He says his girlfriend lives too far away  
Always at a friend's house or on holiday,  
His bible of romance hides itself away  
In quintessence.  
  
A 15 year old's browse through life,  
Is fine with his quintessence safe and sound in mind,  
Life's an adolescence from time to time  
With us all  
In quintessence.  
  
In the corner with his book and tissue  
All he can do is pretend to miss you,  
Closes his eyes as he sees her body  
Pulls funny faces and that's his hobby.  
On the other hand love ain't a happy word  
On the other hand love ain't a piece of skirt,  
Makes for something special in your football shirt  
In quintessence.
