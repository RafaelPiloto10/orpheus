Baby born in New York City  
Wrapped in a blanket all tattered and worn  
Mama's doin' the best she can  
It takes hope in a hopeless world  
  
Her eldest son, he stayed in school  
Listened to his mother, he never drank or used  
But every job he wants he gets refused  
It takes hope in a hopeless world  
  
Looking for hope in a hopeless world  
Trying to find love in these hateful times  
Try to stay strong but my mind is weak  
Looking for hope in a hopeless world  
  
Churches are full, but the prayers are not heard  
Saturday's child don't want to to go to Sunday school  
Whatever happened to the golden rule  
It takes hope in a hopeless world  
  
D'you got a quarter for the homeless man  
Spare some change for the soldiers who fought the war  
Put a little money in those hats and those tins  
Give them hope in a hopeless world  
  
Looking for hope in a hopeless world  
Searchin' for love in these hateful times  
Try to stay strong but my mind is weak  
Ease my mind, ease my mind  
  
And on the corner there stands a young girl  
The home she left was in the better part of town  
Daddy did things she never talked about  
It takes hope in a hopeless world  
  
Somebody out there gotta listen  
Somebody out there got to know what Pops been talkin' about  
Raise your hand, raise your hands if you're with me  
Give us hope in a hopeless world  
  
You've got to listen to the voice inside  
Peace and love don't compromise, realize  
Time is passing by  
Can't be standing still!
