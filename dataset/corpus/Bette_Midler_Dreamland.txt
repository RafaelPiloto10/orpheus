Now I lay me down to sleep  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
Angels on my left and right  
To keep me safe all through the night  
There's a place way up high  
Starry bright there, through the night there  
Close your eyes, let your wishes fly  
You'll be in Dreamland by and by  
Dimpled and drowsy, off you go  
Over the treetops, sliding down a rainbow  
Sleepyhead, curl up in your bed  
And 'til the sun says, "Rise and shine"  
Sleep warm in Dreamland, baby mine  
There's a place worlds away  
Time has wings there, green with springs there  
Smiles and songs bloom on every tree  
Only in Dreamland, just wait and see  
Deep down inside us, a child's still there  
Wishing for Dreamland, knowing that it's somewhere  
Though it may seem so far away  
If you believe that dreams come true  
You'll find a Dreamland waiting for you  
Mmm, go to sleep now, dear
