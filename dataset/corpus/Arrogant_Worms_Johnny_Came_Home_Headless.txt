Oh, Johnny was a tall man but his memory was short  
He'd forget to duck at doorways and often he'd get hurt  
I took good care of him for he had no family  
Actually he did, but he forgot who they be  
Johnny often liked to go out on the town  
He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around  
I knew when he was back for I would hear the smack  
Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack  
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace  
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face  
I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind  
But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine  
Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped  
As if trying to think of something but having no luck  
Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there  
'Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair  
I said, "Johnny where's your cranium?" but he didn't seem to know  
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose  
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry  
For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye  
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace  
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face  
I should have seen it coming, he should have stayed in bed  
For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead  
Refusing to believe that he had split for good  
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood  
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it  
He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded  
Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore  
Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door  
Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab  
Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad  
Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated  
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated  
I should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy  
But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body  
(I ain't got nobody)  
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace  
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face  
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face
