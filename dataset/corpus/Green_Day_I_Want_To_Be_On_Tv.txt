Want to be a pretty boy  
Want to go on Solid Gold  
Want to date a millionaire  
Want to make people stare  
  
I want to be on T.V.  
Want people to know me  
I want to be on T.V.  
Started out in sixty four  
Gonna be an omnivore  
Want to make people dance  
Gonna take off my pants  
  
On a magazine  
Gonna have some free cocaine  
Want to wear my Calvin Kleins  
Then the world will be all mine
