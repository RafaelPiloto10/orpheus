Well, the light's turnin' gray, nearly every day  
Come a walkin' into town and try to find the way  
Well, I've only got a nickel, got to score myself a dime  
And try to make it 'til tomorrow, buy a little more time  
  
Evil woman  
Evil woman  
Evil woman  
  
Well, my damsel she's a woman with coal black hair  
Don't you look her in her eye when she starts to stare  
'Cause her beauty drive you crazy  
And her potions steal your soul  
No matter how you beg her she don't ever let you go  
  
Well, you can cry, you can plead, it won't help you none  
She'll keep you in the shadows, never see the sun  
Try to run, try to hide find a place to stay  
No matter where you go you can't get away  
  
Evil woman  
Evil woman  
Evil woman, oh  
  
For evil woman set my life free  
I can't go on livin' this way, no  
Evil woman set my life free  
Pullin' me down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go against the floor again  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go against the floor again  
  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go again  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go again  
  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go again  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down, down  
  
Well, the light's turnin' gray nearly every day  
Come a walkin' into town try to find my way  
I said I only got a nickel got to score myself a dime  
Try to make it 'til tomorrow buy a little more time  
  
My damsel, she's a woman with coal black hair  
Don't you look her in her eye when she starts to stare  
'Cause her beauty drive you crazy  
And her potions steal your soul  
No matter how you beg her she don't ever let you go  
  
Evil woman  
Evil woman  
Evil woman
