Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterdays.  
It's been a very long long time. Since I last remember  
Seeing you. I hope you write and say you're fine. Did you  
Ever sit and dream. Of the time when we would meet  
Again? It's very hard now you're not mine.  
The 'phone's right next to you. And you know just what to  
Do. Just pick it up. And call my name.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.  
Tomorrow's just a step away. 'Til I come running back to  
You. I hope you stay right by my side. I thought I'd never  
See. My angel back here next to me. Promise me that you  
Won't hide.  
The 'phone's right next to you. And you know just what to  
Do. Just pick it up. And call my name.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.  
And you know there ain't much time. I'm so alone. Please  
Come home. I'm on my own.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.
