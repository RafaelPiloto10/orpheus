(Con Te Partiro)  
  
Stranded alone on a sea of emotion  
You found me  
Your love was a light  
In the darkness that shone  
So profoundly  
Say that you'll stay  
Do not be afraid, afraid  
You, you're my breath  
The air I breathe  
You are my imagination  
Su le finesse  
Song of my heart  
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper  
  
Con te partiro  
I'll go where you lead me  
Wherever you are  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
  
Stranded alone on a sea of emotion  
You found me  
It's you who first found me  
Come here, come here  
Put your arms around me,  
Come here  
It's you who surrounds me  
Come here, come here  
Come here  
Come here  
You, you're my breath  
The air I breathe  
You are my imagination  
Su le finesse  
Song of my heart  
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper  
  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
Con te partiro  
I'll go where you lead me  
Wherever you are  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
  
Con te partiro  
I'll go where you lead me,  
Wherever you are  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
In my...  
Heart!
