All I feel is pain it seems today  
A dark angel leads me to evil far beyond the grave  
Declares me a phantom demon I don't know  
It just cannot be defied  
At Hell this reflection stares at me  
And then I lose my mind  
It betrays me  
  
Oh, In hell I'll burn in flames  
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name  
Oh oh oh oh, In hell I'll burn in flames  
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel  
  
Angel of Death is bloodied now  
He's the one inside  
Tortured, scored that strike  
Against the fear, it feeds the fire  
Near me now, the demon's son  
Bruiser I'm the one  
Erase my soul for all your sins can never be undone  
I can't contain it  
  
Oh, In hell I'll burn in flames  
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name  
Oh oh oh oh, In hell I'll burn in flames  
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel the pain (whoa oh)  
Feel the pain  
The pain  
  
Oh, In hell I'll burn in flames  
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name (my name)  
Oh oh oh oh, In hell I'll burn in flames  
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel the pain  
Feel the pain  
Feel the pain (whoa oh)  
Feel the pain yeah  
Feel the pain
