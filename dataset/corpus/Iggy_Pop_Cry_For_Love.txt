Status seekers - I never cared  
Once I found out they never dared  
To seize the world and shake it upside down  
And every stinking bum should wear a crown  
  
Sayin' I cry for love  
Till all the plates are broken  
Cry for love  
Until my eyes are soakin'  
Yeah cry for love  
On every salmon mornig  
Cry for love  
'cause imitation's boring  
Cry for love  
  
bad tv that insults me freely  
Still I know what I'm dyin' to see  
In searching for a meaningful embrace  
Sometimes my self-respect took second place  
  
an' I cried for love  
I did what my heart told me  
Cried for love  
Can't stand it  
When they scold me  
Yeah I cried for love  
On every salmon morning  
Yeah I cry for love  
'cause imitation's boring  
Cry for love  
  
Surfers ride for love and wipe out when it hits 'em  
Soldiers kill for love and nobody admits it  
If you're cryin' for love well, that's ok don't sweat it  
If you're cryin' for love then there's still a chance you'll get it  
Cry for love
