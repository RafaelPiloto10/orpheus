[Chorus]  
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget  
  
[Verse 1]  
The bigger they are, the harder they fall  
This biggity boy's a diggity dog  
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off  
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber  
Face down, booty up, timber  
That's the way we like the what, timber  
I'm slicker than an oil spill  
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timber  
  
[Bridge]  
Swing your partner round and round  
End of the night, it's going down  
One more shot, another round  
End of the night, it's going down  
Swing your body round and round  
End of the night, it's going down  
One more shot, another round  
End of the night, it's going down  
  
[Chorus]  
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget  
  
[Chorus]  
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget  
  
[Verse 2]  
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane  
Nah, it's just me, ain't a dang thing changed  
Live in hotels, swing on plane  
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing  
Club jumping like Lebron, now, Voli  
Order me another round, homie  
We about to climb, wild, 'cause it's about to go down  
  
[Bridge]  
Swing your body round and round  
End of the night, it's going down  
One more shot, another round  
End of the night, it's going down  
Swing your body round and round  
End of the night, it's going down  
One more shot, another round  
End of the night, it's going down  
  
[Chorus]  
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget  
  
[Chorus]  
It's going down, I'm yelling timber  
You better move, you better dance  
Let's make a night, you won't remember  
I'll be the one, you won't forget  
  
[Outro]
