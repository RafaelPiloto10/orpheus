I've got a yearning to caress you  
One thought keeps burning in my soul  
A hungry yearning to posess you  
Is far beyond control  
I want your love for now, forever  
I want your heart and soul  
My life I give to you Anema E Core  
I only live for you Anema E Core  
  
I have but one desire  
And it's to love you  
With all my heart  
With all my soul  
My whole life through  
From stars I'll build your crown  
And kneel before you  
I pray you'll take my hand  
For I adore you  
Open up the door leading to Heaven  
A Heaven, mine and yours, Anema E Core
