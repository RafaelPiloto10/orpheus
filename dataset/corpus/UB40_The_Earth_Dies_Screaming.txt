A warm dry wind is all that breaks the silence,  
The highways quiet scars across the land.  
People lie, eyes closed, no longer dreaming,  
The earth dies screaming.  
Like scattered pebbles, cars lie silent waiting,  
Oil less engines seized by dirt and sand.  
Bodies hanging limp, no longer bleeding,  
The earth dies screaming.  
  
The earth dies screaming  
The earth dies screaming  
Your country needs you, lets strike up the band.  
  
The earth dies screaming  
The earth dies screaming  
Despite all odds we must defend our land.  
  
Half eaten meals lie rotting on the tables,  
Money clutched within a bony hand.  
Shutters down, the banks are not receiving,  
The earth dies screaming.
