So now love is gone  
And I can't go on  
Love is gone  
I want to say, now it's just too late  
Waited far too long  
  
Shoulda told you then I knew  
Shoulda told you right from the start, yeah  
But the words didn't come out right  
So I'll tell you straight from my heart  
  
You meant more to me  
Then I let you see  
You held on somehow  
All your tenderness and your sweet caress  
I miss you now  
  
But a head strong stubborn man  
Only works it out the best he can  
Valentines he never sent  
There's not enough time he's a working man  
  
[Chorus:]  
Can't stop falling  
Heartaches calling  
Finds you after the fall  
Saints or sinners  
Take no prisoners  
What's left, after you fall  
No not much no  
  
I said love is gone  
I can't go on  
Now love is gone  
I want to say but it's just too late  
Waited far too long  
  
Shoulda told you then I knew  
Shoulda told you right from the start, yeah  
But the words didn't come out right  
So I'll tell you straight from my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no not much  
After the fall  
After you fall  
After you fall
