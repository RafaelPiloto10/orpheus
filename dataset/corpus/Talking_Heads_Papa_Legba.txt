You'll be, hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm, magnet for money  
You'll be, mm-mm-mm-mm, magnet for love  
You'll feel, hmm, light in your body  
Now I'm gonna say, gonna say these words:  
  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
  
It might hmm-mmm-mm-mm...It might rain money  
It might hm-hi-hi-hi...It might rain fire  
Now I'm gonna call,  
Gonna call on Legba.  
Get yourself a sign  
Get your love and desire.  
  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempou  
Papa Legba,  
Come and open the gate.  
Papa Legba,  
To the city of camps.  
Now, we're your children  
Come and ride your horse  
In the night  
In the night  
Come and ride your horse  
  
There is a queen  
Of six sevens and nines  
Dust in your garden  
Poison in your mind  
There is a king  
That will steal your soul  
Din't let him catch you,  
Don't let him get control.  
  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
  
Papa Legba,  
Come and open the gate  
Papa Legba,  
To the city of camps  
Now, we're your children  
Come and ride your horse  
  
In the night  
In the night, come and ride your horse  
In the night  
In the night, come and ride your horse  
In the night  
In the night, come and ride your horse
