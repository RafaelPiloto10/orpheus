Yea woulda said you're so amazing  
So how could you be so heartless girl?  
"Live Your Life" take T.I.-M-E  
"Day and Night" just like Kid Cudi  
You'll think of me, you will oh  
Drake would say that you're "The Best He Ever Had"  
Rumors come and go but you keep your shadow  
Everywhere you go, it follows  
Can't understand I still love you  
(Watch the thugs talk about this one)  
  
Cause I thought I found the right woman  
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her  
Like, damn you let me down, down, down  
You're famous girl for breaking hearts  
  
You're famous girl, girl, girl  
You're famous girl, girl, girl  
You're famous girl, girl, girl  
Shoulda known you'd break my heart, heart, heart  
  
Keri would've said my love knocks her down  
Keisha would've told me I was sent from heaven  
Sorry B, I don't wear no "Halo"  
You were first to play the game, though  
Sorry I bust the windows out your car  
I might of cheated in the beginning  
I was wrong for writing "Disturbia"  
But I meant it in "Forever",  
We were supposed to be together  
And I can't let you go  
  
Said you thought you find the right man  
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me  
Like, damn I let you down, down, down  
Yes I'm famous girl for breaking hearts  
  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart  
(that I would break your heart)  
  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart  
(that I would break your heart)  
  
Many hearts we shoulda left unbroken  
Empty words are better left unspoken  
Too much pressure, I wished I was frozen  
See, we lost our way now  
I hope you're happy being famous, girl  
  
You're famous girl, girl, girl  
(Shoulda known that you would break my heart)  
You're famous girl, girl, girl  
(Shoulda known that you would leave me lonely)  
You're famous girl, girl, girl (yeah)  
Shoulda known you'd break my heart, heart, heart  
(That you would break my heart)  
  
(But then again)  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
(I've broken my share of hearts)  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm famous girl, girl, girl  
(Shoulda known from the start that we would break apart)  
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart  
(Yeah)
