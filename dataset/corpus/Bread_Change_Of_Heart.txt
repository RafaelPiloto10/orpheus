Everyone's thinkin' when he comes home  
He'll be takin' you back from me  
But nobody knows just how deep our love goes  
And he'll never take you from me  
  
Now I know that you never meant to cheat  
And I never meant to steal  
But you only forget when there's better yet  
And I know that's how we both feel  
  
It's a change of heart  
Look out for some rain  
When you change your heart  
One man's loss is another man's gain  
  
Everyone's sayin' when he comes home  
He'll loosen my hold on you  
But they just don't know that you're free to go  
And love's my only hold over you  
  
And I knew the night that your tears were fallin'  
What you were goin' through  
You knew it'd be hell but you had to tell him  
Now it would be me and you  
  
It's a change of heart  
Worked out for the best  
When you change your heart  
Save yourself and forget all the rest
