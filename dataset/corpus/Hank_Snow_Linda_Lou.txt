Linda Lou, honest true,  
I'm just wild about your lovely eyes of blue,  
For your smile, I'd walk miles,  
For my honey child I'm glad to be with you,  
  
As long as you are by my side I have no cause to pine,  
I point you out with so much pride,  
And tell the world you're mine,  
Linda Lou, honest true,  
I'm in love with you alone sweet Linda Lou.  
  
I've waited a long time for you darlin',  
But never knew exactly what you'd be,  
Now that you have come to me my darlin',  
You're a wee bit of heaven to me  
  
Linda Lou, honest true,  
You're the first in every thought I have today,  
You're so sweet, and so neat,  
That I thank the LORD for sending you my way,  
  
Some day you'll know the way I feel deep down within your heart,  
To be with you when shadows steal and know we'll never part,  
Linda Lou, honest true,  
I'm in love with you alone sweet Linda Lou.
