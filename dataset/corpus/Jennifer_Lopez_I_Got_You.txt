Right here  
Something in the dark shot glasses, you know  
Something that you can lean to  
Something that you can ride to  
Something that you can step to  
You know  
  
Sometimes real love can be  
Not seen 'cause you're thinkin'  
What's right in front of you  
Can't be the one for you  
  
Then one day you realize that  
There are feelings that you can't hold back  
And you're so caught up  
Now that's all you think of  
Crazy how  
  
All that talk of us not able to last  
Just because of mistakes we made in the past  
But they fail to understand  
  
[Chorus]  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you  
You got me  
  
I got you  
  
Things are often said to  
Doubt what I feel for you  
But words that people say  
Won't take my love away  
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright  
But why they say some things that ain't right  
I never know but please understand that baby, it ain't nothing  
  
All that talk of us not able to last  
Just because of mistakes we made in the past  
But they fail to understand  
  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, baby)  
I got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, baby)  
  
So that's all that people can do  
Never mind all the love, all that you  
gotta do is simply love, trust, and just stay focused on us  
Together we'll get through whatever if we  
Don't let speculations make situations up  
We'll be alright  
  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, babe)  
  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing (feels so good inside)  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you (I got you)  
You got me (yes, you got me, baby)  
I got you (nothing come between us)  
You got me (you got me)  
I got you (through whatever)  
You got me (you're all that I need)  
I got you (oh, baby)  
You got me (forever, baby)  
I got you (I got you)  
You got me (you got me)  
I got you  
You got me
