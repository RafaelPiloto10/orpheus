There's always someone haunting someone - haunting someone  
Like an echo in the wind leaves, unreconciled -  
Waiting to be picked up and bounced down again on  
Listeners ears  
  
There's always someone haunting someone - haunting someone  
And you know who I am  
Though I never leave my name or number  
I'm locked inside of you so it doesn't matter  
  
There's always someone haunting someone - haunting someone  
And you know who I am  
Though I never leave my name or number  
I'm locked inside of you so it doesn't matter  
  
There's always someone haunting someone - haunting someone  
And I can't sleep easy  
'Cause I'm afraid of dreaming  
And then the memory of the dream  
There's always someone haunting someone  
Haunting someone  
Haunting someone
