Don't do anything mellow at the Whiskey  
Jimmy says I'm so unfortunate  
But let the people at the Whiskey be a bundle of nerves  
And don't sing on fairness  
Cause if you do, your musical insurance better be paid up  
  
Don't sing anything pretty at the Whiskey  
Johnny says you'd best take my advice  
Cause the stony little crowd will get to talkin' even louder  
And they'll smother you in hissin'  
And if they do, your musical insurance better be paid up  
  
Oh, don't do anything mellow at the Whiskey  
Johnny says I'm so, so unfortunate  
But let the people at the Whiskey be a bundle of nerves  
And don't sing on what they're missin'  
  
Like Sunday mornings filled with flowers  
Just goin' fifteen miles up north  
Cause if you do, your musical insurance better be paid up  
Cause if you do, your musical insurance better be paid up
