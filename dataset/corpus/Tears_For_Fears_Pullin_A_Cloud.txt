Time seems a crazy thing  
Now that your heart can sing  
Like a child  
I know the stars tonight  
Carry a guiding light  
Still so proud  
Pushin' or pullin' a cloud  
  
Driving through driving rain  
Just me and johnny jane  
We're okay  
We're just pullin' a cloud  
  
There's a story in the lines of your face  
Never now but not afraid  
With the magic of your smile  
You make me humble  
  
Baby be wise  
Stay by my side  
Still so proud  
Pushin' or pullin' a cloud  
Pushin' or pullin' a cloud  
Pushin' or pullin' a cloud
