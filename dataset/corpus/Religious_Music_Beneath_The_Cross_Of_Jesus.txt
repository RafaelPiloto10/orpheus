Beneath the cross of Jesus  
I fain would take my stand  
The shadow of a mighty rock  
Within a weary land.  
A home within the wilderness,  
A rest upon the way,  
From the burning of the noontide heat,  
And the burden of the day.  
  
Upon that cross of Jesus  
Mine eye at times can see  
The very dying form of One  
Who suffered there for me.  
And from my stricken  
Heart with tears,  
Two wonders I confess,  
The wonders of redeeming love  
And my unworthiness.  
  
I take, O cross, thy shadow  
For my abiding place.  
I ask no other sunshine than  
The sunshine of His face.  
Content to let the world go by,  
To know no gain nor loss.  
My sinful self my only shame,  
My glory all the cross.
