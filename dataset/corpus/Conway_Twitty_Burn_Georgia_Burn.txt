From a kiss to a small spark, in a heartbeat a raging fire  
With hungry flames burning higher, Georgia gave to her desire  
She said no for so long, to temptation 'she finally turned  
But when she gave, she gave it all, burn, Georgia burn.  
  
Burn, Georgia burn  
There's a fire in your soul  
Am I to blame for the flame?  
That's out of control.  
  
Now twenty-five and the first time makes a woman kinda wild  
When wall flowers turn to roses, they take on a certain style  
Now I ain't sayin' she was wrong, as she took a wayward turn  
But I remember the fire I started, burn, Georgia burn.  
  
Burn, Georgia burn  
There's a fire in your soul  
Am I to blame for the flame?  
That's out of control.  
  
Burn, Georgia burn  
There's a fire in your soul  
Am I to blame for the flame?  
That's out of control
