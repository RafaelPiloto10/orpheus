God will make a way  
Where there seems to be no way  
He works in ways we cannot see  
He will make a way for me  
  
He will be my guide  
Hold me closely to His side  
With love and strength for each new day  
He will make a way, He will make a way  
  
Oh, God will make a way  
Where there seems to be no way  
He works in ways we cannot see  
He will make a way for me  
  
He will be my guide  
Hold me closely to His side  
With love and strength for each new day  
He will make a way, He will make a way  
  
By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me  
And rivers in the desert will I see  
Heaven and Earth will fade but His Word will still remain  
And He will do something new today  
  
Oh, God will make a way  
Where there seems to be no way  
He works in ways we cannot see  
He will make a way for me  
  
He will be my guide  
Hold me closely to His side  
With love and strength for each new day  
He will make a way, He will make a way  
  
By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me  
And rivers in the desert will I see  
Heaven and Earth will fade but His Word will still remain  
And He will do something new today  
  
Oh, God will make a way  
Where there seems to be no way  
He works in ways we cannot see  
He will make a way for me  
  
He will be my guide  
Hold me closely to His side  
With love and strength for each new day  
He will make a way, He will make a way  
  
With love and strength for each new day  
He will make a way, He will make a way
