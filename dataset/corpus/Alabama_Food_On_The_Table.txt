My dad was a big man with a will that was tough  
He was at his best when the going was rough  
He made a living for the family and never had to cheat  
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
We sat down at the table and thanked god in prayer  
Cause we had plenty to eat and plenty to wear  
We had patches on our britches but momma kept us neat  
We had food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
We picked the cotton and gathered the corn  
We were taught to work from the day we were born  
Mom and dad and all us children worked in the summer's heat  
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
When you sit down at the table thank god in prayer  
If you've got plenty to eat and plenty to wear  
If you've got patches on your britches just be sure to keep em neat  
If you've got food on the table and shoes on your feet
