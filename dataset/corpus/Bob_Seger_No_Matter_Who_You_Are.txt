No matter who you are no matter what you do  
There's gonna be someone wants something else from you  
Yeah  
This is an ancient test, it's a shiny lie  
Discover somethin' pure then sit and watch it die  
Yeah  
No matter who you are no matter where you've been  
No matter what you've done you'll have to start again  
No matter who you are  
Between the soaring dreams and the bottom line  
So much is given up so much is left behind  
Yeah  
This is the price you pay, this is the beast you feed  
When you abandon hope and you give in to greed  
No matter who you are no matter who you've been  
You'll have to sort it out and start again  
No matter who you are  
No matter who you are  
Don't take this wrong don't let it bring you down  
It's just the way things work in this great big town
