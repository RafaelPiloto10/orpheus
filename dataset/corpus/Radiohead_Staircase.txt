I walk down the staircase,  
Magnetic pull.  
Back to the other place  
That I cannot go.  
I'm sending a chopper,  
To steal you away.  
  
The pot is full,  
Let me take control,  
Let me take control.  
  
The pot is full  
Of secrets to be told,  
Secrets to be told.  
  
Out of orbit  
And I always will.  
  
The pot is full,  
Let me take control,  
Let me take control.  
  
The pot is full  
Of secrets to be told,  
Secrets to be told
