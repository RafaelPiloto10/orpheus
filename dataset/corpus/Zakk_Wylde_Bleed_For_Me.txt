This grave of life, I give to you  
Ignore what was, you know it's true  
Realms of fear, they speak the truth  
What has past, I hand to you  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through, I'll see you  
I'll dig a hole and bow my head  
To see you smile, I'd face my death  
Realms of fear, they speak the truth  
What has past, I hand to you  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through, I'll see you  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through, I'll see you
