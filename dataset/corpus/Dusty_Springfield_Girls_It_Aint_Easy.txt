Yeah, it ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy  
To keep the man you love satisfied  
It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy  
To keep the one you love by your side  
  
A woman's work is never done  
Never stops, it goes on and on  
You work your fingers to the bone  
You gotta be home every time he phones  
  
Sometimes the going gets a little tough  
Seems like my best ain't good enough  
Keeps you losing sleep  
Seven days a week, yeah  
  
It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy  
To keep the man you love satisfied  
It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy  
To keep the one you love by your side  
  
To keep him happy  
You must sacrifice  
Be ready and willing  
To spend lonely nights  
Do what you can  
Though he seems ungrateful  
Love him so true  
Even though he seems unfaithful  
  
But when his hope is gone  
And life gets him down  
That's when he'll say  
He needs you around  
  
Hard to live with him  
Hard to live without him  
It ain't easy, no  
  
Oh, yeah, it ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy  
It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy  
  
You got to favor him with understanding  
When understanding is what he needs  
We try hard to give them respect  
All that we get is their regret  
  
But when they're in trouble  
They need our love and care  
No matter when we gotta be right there  
In between the crying  
Gotta keep trying  
  
It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy, ooh, ooh, ooh  
It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy  
  
It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy, yeah, ooh  
It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy, no
