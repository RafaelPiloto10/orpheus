Follow Me Around  
I see you in the dark  
Corner of the street  
Coming after me... (Yah)  
  
Headlights on full-beam  
Coming down the fast lane  
Coming after me... (Yah)  
  
You follow me around...  
You follow me around...  
  
Nowadays I get panicked  
I cease to exist  
I cease to exist  
  
I feel absolutely nothing  
The words are out of ink  
The words you know are out of ink  
  
They follow me around...  
They follow me around...  
  
Did you lie to us Tony  
We thought you were different  
Now you know we're not so sure  
  
Drooling Looney tunes  
Moving in a swarm  
Moving in a swarm...  
  
They follow me around...  
They follow me around...  
They follow me around...  
They follow me around...
