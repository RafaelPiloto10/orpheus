You ask me how I'm feeling  
I only wish you knew  
How hard it is for me to share  
Share that kind of thing with you  
  
It's not that I don't love you  
It's just I can't connect  
'Cause I was taught from much too young  
To shine and not reflect  
  
And if you sense a smoke screen here  
A trick of the dry ice  
Just try to see there's more to me  
Than sour grapes and sugar mice  
  
Just try to understand  
I don't say all I can  
A stranger to myself, I am  
An accidental man  
  
You ask me if I'm happy  
I only wish I knew  
'Cause happiness is not a thing  
I ever learned to do  
  
It's not that I'm complaining  
It's all the same to me  
If everything that happens  
Happens accidentally  
  
Just try to understand  
I don't say all I can  
A stranger to myself, I am  
An accidental man  
A stranger to myself, I am  
An accidental man  
  
I was taught for every secret  
There's a price you have to pay  
Yes, I was taught for every secret  
There's a price you have to pay  
I was taught from much too young  
To never give myself away  
  
Just try to understand  
I don't say all I can  
A stranger to myself, I am  
An accidental man  
Just try to understand  
I don't do all I can  
A mystery to burned-out love  
An accidental man
