Someone told someone and someone told you  
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much  
Since everyone spread the story  
With his own little personal touch  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
True I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue  
When we're apart the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
True I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue  
When we're apart the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me  
And you never will
