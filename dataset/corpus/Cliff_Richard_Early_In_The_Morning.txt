Evening is the time of day  
I find nothing much to say  
Don't know what to do  
But I come to  
  
When it's early in the morning  
Over by the windows day is dawning  
When I feel the air  
I feel that life is very good to me, you know  
In the sun there's so much yellow  
Something in the early morning meadow  
Tells me that today you're on your way  
And you'll be coming home, home to me  
  
Night time isn't clear to me  
I find nothing near to me  
Don't know what to do  
But I come to  
  
When it's early in the morning  
Very, very early without warning  
I can feel a newly born vibration  
Sneaking up on me again  
There's a songbird on my pillow  
I can see the fun in weeping willow  
I can see the sun  
You're on your way  
You'll be coming home  
  
When it's early in the morning  
Over by the windows day is dawning  
When I feel the air  
I feel that life is very good to me, you know  
In the sun there's so much yellow  
Something in the early morning meadow  
Tells me that today you're on your way  
And you'll be coming home  
  
When it's early in the morning  
Very, very early without warning  
I can feel a newly born vibration  
Sneaking up on me again...
