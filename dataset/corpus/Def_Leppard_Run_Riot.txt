Living by the law is a bloody necessary bore  
Everybody are you gettin' what you're lookin' for  
Livin' by the rule is somethin' that you gotta do  
But does it matter if we break a rule or two  
  
Get up, break out, don't be the odd one out  
  
Livin' on the edge, I'm a tryin' to keep a level head  
Every morning it's a bummer gettin' out of bed  
Same old story does a nothin' ever ever change  
Yeah, they lock me up and then they let me out again  
  
Get up, break out, don't be the odd one out  
Come on, it's alright, we're hot tonight  
  
You better run, run riot  
You gotta run, run riot  
You know the time has come  
Run, run riot, I mean everyone  
Run, yeah, run riot  
Oh, gotta run riot babe  
  
Goin' through the motions desperation guaranteed  
Whoa, get f-f-frustrated easily  
Pedal to the metal senses working overtime  
Hey, gonna fight to the finish baby  
Draw the line  
  
Get up, break out, don't be the odd one out  
C'mon, it's alright we're hot tonight  
Run, run riot  
You gotta run, run riot  
You know the time has come  
Run, run riot, I mean everyone  
Run, yeah, run riot  
Speak to me  
  
They lock me up, they let me out but I'm up and runnin'  
I scream and shout  
  
Get up, break out, don't be the odd one out  
Come on, it's alright we're hot tonight  
You better run, run riot  
You gotta run, run riot  
You know the time has come  
Run, run riot, come on, run with me  
Run, run riot  
Run, run riot  
I'll take you from your misery  
Come on, stick with me
