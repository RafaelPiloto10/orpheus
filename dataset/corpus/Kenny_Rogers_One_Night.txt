Call me a fool, send me away  
I've got to say it's you I adore  
I'm longing in love, falling apart  
I follow my heart straight to your door.  
  
Face to face with all honesty  
I will be grateful if you'd give to me:  
Just one night to lay in your arms  
  
Give me just one night could it be that I was born  
To make every dream you ever had come true  
In just one night, oh one night with you.  
  
Standing this close the sound of your voice  
Leads me no choice I offer my love  
Am I so wrong to think you might fall  
'cause baby you're all I can think of.  
  
Face to face ....
