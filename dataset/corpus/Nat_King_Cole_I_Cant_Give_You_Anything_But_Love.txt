I can't give you anything but love  
Baby  
  
That's the only thing I've plenty of  
Baby  
Dream a while  
Scheme a while  
  
We're sure to find happiness  
And I guess  
All those things you've always pined for.  
Gee  
I'd like to see you looking swell  
Baby  
  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell  
Baby.  
Till that lucky day  
You know darned well  
Baby.  
I can't give you anything but love.
