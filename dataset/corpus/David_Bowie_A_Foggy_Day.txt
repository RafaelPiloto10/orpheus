I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town where the people I knew  
I had the feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've ever known  
A foggy day in a london town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The british museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles had'nt passed  
For suddenly I saw you there  
And through foggy london town the sun was shining everywhere
