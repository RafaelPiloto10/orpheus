  
Do I want you?  
Oh my do I  
Honey, indeed I do  
  
Do I need you?  
Oh my do I  
Honey, a-deed I do  
  
I'm glad that I'm the one who found you  
That's why I'm always hangin' around you  
  
Do I love you?  
Oh my do I  
Honey, deed I do  
  
I'm glad that I'm the one who found you  
That's why I'm always hangin' around you  
  
Do I love you?  
Oh my do I  
Honey, deed I do  
  
Honey, deed I do  
  
Honey, deed I do
