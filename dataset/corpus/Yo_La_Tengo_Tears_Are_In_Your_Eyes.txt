You tell me summer's here  
And the time is wrong  
You tell me winter's here and your days...  
Are getting long  
  
Tears are in your eyes... tonight  
You tell me that you haven't  
Slept in days  
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired...  
Anyway  
  
Tears are in your eyes... tonight  
Tears are in your eyes... every night  
  
Although you don't believe me you're strong  
Darkness always turns into the dawn  
And you won't even remember this for long...  
When it ends alright  
  
Please tell me how...you know tomorrow...staring at your shoes  
Tears are in your eyes...every night  
Tears are in your eyes...every night  
Tears are in your eyes...tonight
