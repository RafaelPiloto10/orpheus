This isn't really death, this isn't really life  
This isn't really anything I think I like  
  
And I will not sit up, don't be playing  
Not for you or anyone  
I will not change my fucking hair  
  
We have no reasons but we still have fun  
Then I blow up and you whispered my name  
  
Wait until I rip your back to shreds  
I wave my blue suede shoes  
That's all that remains of your spine  
  
I want excitement  
Your spinal remains  
I want to stand here  
In your spinal remains  
In chains  
  
This isn't really death, this isn't really life  
This isn't really anything I think I like  
  
And I will not grin or piss on the flag  
Not for you or anyone  
I will not plug a fucking ass  
  
I want to stand in  
Baby your spinal remains  
I won't save it  
Baby your spinal remains  
They're making me sick
