Where in the world did you go?  
Without a clue, without a word  
What on earth did I do wrong?  
You won't believe how much I hurt  
I can't believe the mess we're in  
My sense of humor wearing thin  
Gets away with murder every day  
Can't you hear me, won't you make it go away?  
  
Enough to taste of bitterness  
Hits me in the face, someone else's wish  
Here I lay awake, alone  
Just wishing you'd come home  
  
You leave me desolate and torn  
Go and fight in someone else's war  
And so you put us both to shame  
Don't come near me  
Don't you make it go away  
  
I can't believe the mess we're in  
My sense of humor wearing thin  
No ones getting younger anyway  
Can't you hear me, won't you make it go away?  
  
I can't believe the mess we're in  
My sense of humor wearing thin  
Gets away with murder every other day  
Can you hear me, won't you make it go away?  
  
Won't you make it go away?  
Won't you make it go away?
