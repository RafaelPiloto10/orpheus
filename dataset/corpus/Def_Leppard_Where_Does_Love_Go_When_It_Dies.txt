Could you ever steal a prayer to deny your God  
Could you ever buy your love and not count the cost  
Could you ever take a life when all was lost  
And would it ever be enough  
  
Could you bite the hand that feeds you and then ask for more  
Could you kiss the wound that bleeds spit it on the floor  
Could you open up your heart then close the door  
And would it ever be enough  
  
Every word you whisper  
All the tears you hide  
You die for love when it's alive  
But where does love go when it dies  
  
If you came across your dream would you walk on by  
Hold a candle to the wind and just let it die  
And is there room inside your mind for one more try  
And would it ever be enough  
  
I watch the time go rushing by it's like an ocean wave  
Showing you no mercy throwing dirt upon your grave  
You're drowning in the darkness and you're blinded by the light  
And there ain't no prayer that's gonna save you now  
  
If you woke up from your sleep blood on your hands  
Would you wash the pain away no one understands  
There must be someone out there who can help you breathe again  
And would it ever be enough
