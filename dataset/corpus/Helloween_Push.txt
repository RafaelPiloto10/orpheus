They're spending millions for your thrill  
Collective desperate overkill  
Wrapped up in harmless words that grin  
Forbidden games you'll never win  
The more you see the more you know  
Intended media mind control  
Shut down and see how beautiful life can be  
This is the prime of your lifetime  
You see through eyes of someone else  
More than the half of your lifetime  
Is just a tale in a storybook  
  
Push, enforce your independence  
Push your real intention  
Face your unconscious addiction  
Push your private fiction  
Push  
It's getting sicker frame by frame  
You're always staring at the same  
What is a lie, what is the truth?  
Incredible disgusting news  
The world is rough, the end is near  
Just calculation with your fear  
Without a shame nor least respect  
The operators stand erect  
  
This is the prime of your lifetime  
You see through eyes of someone else  
More than the half of your lifetime  
Is just a tale in a storybook  
  
Push, enforce your independence  
Push your real intention  
Face your unconscious addiction  
Push your private fiction  
Push
