There's no earthly way of knowing,  
What's in your heart when its' stopped going.  
The whole world shook,  
The storm was blowing through you.  
  
Waiting for god,  
To stop this.  
I'm too young and,  
And darkness.  
Everyone around you was corrupted,  
Say something.  
  
There's no dignity in death,  
To sell the world your last breath.  
Your still fighting over everything you left,  
Oh.  
  
I saw you standing at the gate,  
When Marlon Brando passed away.  
You had that look upon your face,  
Advertising Space.  
And no one learned from your mistakes,  
The little profits go to waste.  
All that's left in any case,  
Is advertising space.  
Oh  
  
Through your eyes the world was burning,  
Please be gentle I'm still learning.  
He seemed to say,  
As you kept turning up.  
  
They poisoned you with compromise,  
At what point did you realize.  
Everybody loves your life,  
But you.  
  
A special agent for the man,  
Water gates and Vietnam.  
No one really gave a damn,  
Do you think the CIA did?  
  
I saw you standing at the gate,  
When Marlon Brando passed away.  
You had that look upon your face,  
Advertising Space.  
And no one learned from your mistakes,  
The little profits go to waste.  
All that's left in any case,  
Is advertising space.  
Oh oh  
  
And no one learned from your mistakes,  
The little profits go to waste.  
All that's left in any case,  
Is advertising space.  
I've seen your daughter man she's cute,  
I was scared but I wanted to.  
Boy she looks a lot like you.
