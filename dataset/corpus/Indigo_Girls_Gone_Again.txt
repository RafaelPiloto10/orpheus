Think I'll bag that trip for two  
Pack it up to kakadu  
Honey, it's not for the weather  
Or the lack of loving you  
I got all this in between  
Something I did not forsee  
All the deals I made don't matter  
If I can't just let you be  
  
Gone again  
Gone again  
There ain't no way  
That I'm gonna let this heart mend  
Gone again  
  
I walked in king's cross for awhile  
Gave a junkie girl a smile  
We both traded in for danger  
Or the company of strangers  
She said all her family  
Was at the welfare agency  
Then she swindled my last twenty  
For a kiss and some poetry  
  
Gone again  
Gone again  
'cause there ain't no way  
That I'm gonna let this heart mend  
Gone again  
  
If I don't make kakadu  
I'll be at the rainbow room  
And I'll be courting some disaster  
With the melbourne wrecking crew  
Honey all this is to say  
That every dog don't got it's day  
If we take the love we're given  
(take the love)  
And we throw it all away  
  
It's gone again  
It's gone again  
'cause there ain't no way  
That I'm gonna let this heart mend  
It's gone again  
It's gone again  
'cause there ain't no way  
That I'm gonna let this heart mend  
Gone again
