There's a question  
Everybody's shouting out a question  
There's a question  
Everybody's shouting out a question  
  
Have you got an answer, politician?  
Have you got an answer, mathematician?  
  
There's a question  
Ringing out a clear loud question  
It's a question  
Giving you one in the head, it's a question  
  
Do you have an answer, theologian?  
A better answer than a politician  
  
There's a question  
  
There's a question  
Ringing out loud in space, there's a question  
And there's a question  
Ringing out over the stage, there's a question  
  
Do you have an answer, politician?  
Do you have an answer, mathematician?  
Do you have an answer, theologian?  
Do you have an answer, science man?  
  
Do you have an answer, Peter Pan?  
Father and son, a mother and daughter  
Son of man  
  
On and on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on and on
