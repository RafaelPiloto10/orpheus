I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Scared of the spotlight  
You don't come to visit  
I'm stuck in this bed  
  
Thin rubber gloves  
She laughs when she's crying  
She cries when she's laughing  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...  
(Away... away... away...)  
  
I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Christian suburbanite  
Washed down the toilet  
Money to burn  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...  
  
If you're frightened of dyin' and you're holding on...  
You'll see devils tearing your life away.  
But...if you've made your peace,  
Then the devila are really angels  
Freeing you from the earth... from the earth... from the earth  
  
Rotworms on the underground  
Caught between stations  
Butterfingers  
I'm losing my patience  
  
I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Christian suburbanite  
You got money to burn....  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...  
Away, away, away,  
Away, away, away.
