Who's the one you pray to?  
Who's your Jesus man?  
Where you go when it's over and done even if you can't?  
With bruises on your ego, personality in a sling,  
Clinging to self righteous pity never meant a thing.  
  
So who is your big brother?  
Who's your savior man?  
Just some ink on the dotted line, an X if ya can't.  
See misery loves company, you'll never feel a need,  
We're guaranteed a lifetime, at least until ya bleed.  
  
Suck the life out through the eyes.  
Windows to another world.  
Sifting through assorted lies,  
Welcome to another brand new world.  
  
A lot of people do it,  
It happens everyday.  
Doubt you'll ever know it's gone, don't use it anyway.  
So come on in you'll sit right down I gotta deal for you.  
A matter of integrity, here's all ya gotta do-o.  
  
I'm not dealing with you!  
Not the one to thank,  
Execution therapy,  
Put that in your bank.  
  
You're a liar!  
(Blood money!) Liar!!!  
(Due now!) Liar!!!  
(Blood money!) Liar!!!  
  
Payment due an' I'm collecting you.  
  
I am dealing with you!  
No one here to thank!  
Too much insecurity,  
Put that up your bank!  
  
I'm not dealing with you!  
No one here to thank!  
Fuck you insecurity,  
Put that up your bank
