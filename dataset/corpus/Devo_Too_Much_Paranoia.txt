Think I got your dial tone  
Think I got billy baxter's bone  
Think I got a bubble-sac  
Think I got a big mac attack  
Hold the pickles hold the lettuce  
Special orders don't upset us  
All we ask is that you let us  
Server it your way  
Too much paranoias  
My momma's afraid to tell me  
The things she's afraid of  
I been dipped in double meaning  
I been stuck with static cling  
Think I got a rupto-pac  
Think I got a big mac attack
