Everybody's restless  
And they got no place to go  
Someone's always trying to tell them  
Something they already know  
So their anger and resentment flow  
Don't it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long  
Mohammed's radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio  
Mohammed's radio  
You know the sheriff's got his problems too  
And he will surely take them out on me and you  
In walks the village idiot and her face is all aglow  
Because she's been up all night listening to  
Mohammed's radio  
Don't it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long  
Mohammed's radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio  
Mohammed's radio  
Everybody's desperate  
Trying to make ends meet  
Work all day still can't pay  
The price of gasoline and meat  
Alas their lives are incomplete  
Don't it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long  
Mohammed's radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio  
Mohammed's radio  
You've been up all night just listening for his drum  
Hoping that the righteous might just might just might just might just come  
I heard the general whispering to his aide de camp  
Be watchful for Mohammed's lamp  
Don't it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long  
Mohammed's radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio  
Mohammed's radio  
Mohammed's radio
