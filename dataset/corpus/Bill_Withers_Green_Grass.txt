Looking out at the people looking in  
Feeling good must be some kind of sin  
Looking in at the people looking out  
Feeling guilty, scared to move about  
  
Looking up at the people looking down  
Taking tranquilizers by the pound  
Looking down at the people looking up  
Getting mad 'cause they can't get enough  
  
Ah, but that green grass on the other side  
Is just an illusion  
We all have our own confusion  
  
Rich people watching the people poor  
Trying to figure out how to get some more  
Poor people watching people rich  
You know, they call them dirty you-know-which  
  
Ugly people watching the people pretty  
Say they can't get down to the nitty-gritty  
Pretty people watching people ugly  
Say I sure couldn't stand you to kiss and hug me  
  
Ah, but that green grass on the other side  
Is just an illusion  
We all have our own confusion
