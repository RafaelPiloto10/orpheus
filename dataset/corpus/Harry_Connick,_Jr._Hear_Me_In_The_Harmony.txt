The city don't even matter  
I could be anywhere  
I don't care  
There's a whole lotta hard workin people  
That could take my place  
And it's easy to leave  
When nobody knows your face  
Just close your eyes  
You can hear me in the harmony  
I came up in new orleans  
Fixin what I could find  
To peace my mind  
I gave what I had to the winners  
Just to get along  
But it's really hard to sing  
When nobody hears your song  
Just close your eyes  
You can hear me in the harmony  
I thought I learned from getting burned  
I bought a suit of armor and a silver cane  
I found a little man who'd be proud of me  
But he had to get up early  
And I had to get back to my pain  
I guess I'll keep on livin  
One day they'll ask for me  
I'll be free  
And if there's a heaven  
I'll be ready for my life to begin  
But I wonder if I call  
If they're gonna let me in  
Open your eyes  
You can hear me in the harmony
