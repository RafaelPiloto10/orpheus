Oh by gosh, by golly, it's time for mistletoe and holly,  
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents,  
Countrysides covered with snow.  
Oh by gosh, by jingle,  
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle.  
  
Overeating, merry greetings  
From relatives you don't know.  
Then comes that big night,  
Giving the tree a trim.  
You'll hear voices by starlight  
Singing yuletide hollers...  
  
Oh by gosh, by golly,  
It's time for mistletoe and holly,  
Fancy ties and Grandma's pies  
And folks stealing a kiss or two,  
As they whisper Merry Christmas to you.
