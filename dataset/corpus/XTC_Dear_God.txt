Dear God, hope you get the letter and  
I pray you can make it better down here  
I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer  
But all the people that you made in your image  
See them starving on their feet  
'Cause they don't get enough to eat from God  
I can't believe in you  
  
Dear God, sorry to disturb you but  
I feel that I should be heard loud and clear  
We all need a big reduction in amount of tears  
And all the people that you made in your image  
See them fighting in the street  
'Cause they can't make opinions meet about God  
I can't believe in you  
  
Did you make disease and the diamond blue?  
Did you make mankind after we made you?  
And the Devil too!  
  
Dear God don't know if you noticed but  
Your name is on a lot of quotes in this book  
And us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look  
And all the people that you made in your image  
Still believing that junk is true  
Well I know it ain't, and so do you  
Dear God  
I can't believe in  
I don't believe  
  
I won't believe in heaven or hell  
No saints, no sinners, no devil as well  
No pearly gates, no thorny crown  
You're always letting us humans down  
The wars you bring, the babes you drown  
Those lost at sea and never found  
And it's the same the whole world 'round  
The hurt I see helps to compound  
The Father, Son and Holy Ghost  
Is just somebody's unholy hoax  
And if you're up there you'll perceive  
That my heart's here upon my sleeve  
If there's one thing I don't believe in  
  
It's you  
Dear God
