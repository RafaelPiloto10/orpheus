I remember a girl on her cellphone  
Surrounded by her friends  
Eyes flickering, she's trying  
To smother a smile in her hands  
Is it someone for us  
Someone more worry-free  
Someone who can say'  
"Leave the worrying about him to me Josephine?"  
I remember you there in the last rays  
Of light at diplomacy's end  
Eyes flickering you're crying  
But, isn't this when the crimes begin?  
When the people you want to don't  
The people who do you  
Don't believe you Josephine?  
I remember you there at the table  
Surrounded by all the days plans  
Eyes flickering you're trying  
To let a coffee cup warm your hands  
Maybe we're born lost  
Born to persevere  
Honey I'd walk into your painting  
Until I'd reappeared  
A speck of comet-tail dust  
A blue-green northern light  
Flickering just in your eyes' deepest ravines  
Goodnight goodnight Josephine  
Goodnight, goodnight Josephine  
Goodnight, goodnight Josephine  
Goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Josephine, Josephine, Josephine, Josephine
