Oooh, oooh, oooh come on  
Still feels good-oh,oh,oh  
  
That old t-shirt you wear to bed  
Hangin' off your shoulders by a thread  
The one you ripped off me when we first met  
Still feels good  
  
That old familiar song blarin' from my car  
We know every note, every word by heart  
Puts a smile on your face 'cause you know it's ours  
And it still feels good  
  
[Chorus]  
Your fingers hooked around my belt loops  
Leanin' up against my ride  
Remember the first time I touched you  
It doesn't matter, I've held you a million times  
Oh, and it still feels good  
  
We made some plans, had some crazy dreams  
And now that we've reached a few you would think  
That it would get old to you and me  
But it still feels good, still feels good  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah and it still feels good, baby  
Yeah, it still feel good-yeah, yeah, yeah  
Still feels good  
Still feels good, baby
