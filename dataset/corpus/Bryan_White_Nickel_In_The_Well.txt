I've got a four leaf clover  
I hung a horseshoe on the wall  
I threw salt over my left shoulder  
I'll try anything at all  
To get lucky with you  
I want you so much  
Until you want me too  
I ain't gonna give up  
  
I'll throw another nickel in the well  
Tell myself this time maybe it'll help  
To make my dreams come true  
Just in case you're out in your backyard  
Lookin' up there too  
With a lot of love and a little luck  
You'll fall like I fell  
I'll just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well  
  
If I could get Houdini  
To teach me a trick or two  
Then maybe you would see me  
In the way I want you to  
Gonna knock on wood  
It ain't been easy  
I've done everything I could  
To make you need me  
  
I'll throw another nickel in the well  
Tell myself this time maybe it'll help  
To make my dreams come true  
Just in case you're out in your backyard  
Lookin' up there too  
With a lot of love and a little luck  
You'll fall like I fell  
I'll just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well  
  
With a lot of love and a little luck  
You'll fall like I fell  
I'll just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well  
  
Yeah, just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well
