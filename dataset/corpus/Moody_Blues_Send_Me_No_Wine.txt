Send me no wine  
To make an invitation.  
Leave me no time  
In your imagination.  
Only to find  
Words in your mind  
They're gonna make you, leave your,  
Leave your heart behind.  
  
Send me, send me no wine,  
To send my love away.  
Send me, send me no wine,  
To send my love away.  
  
Once in my life  
I need no conversation.  
All of my time  
I'll spend in fascination.  
Give me my love,  
With you in my life.  
If only everybody  
Found the answer in love.  
  
Send me, send me no wine,  
To send my love away.  
Send me, send me no wine,  
To send my love away.
