I just want to get a little more out of my payday  
Finally own a car that doesn't break down on the freeway  
A little vacation, ain't asking very much  
  
I keep coming home to this old broken down apartment  
I wish I had a dime for every hole that's in the carpet  
Well I don't want it all, but I ain't got enough  
  
[CHORUS]  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that ain't dry  
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life  
  
I don't mind the hours and the pain that comes from workin'  
But it's enough to kill me when I see my baby hurtin'  
Want to give her that diamond, I never got to buy  
She keeps tellin' me that everything is getting better  
But one step up the wrung and someone knocks me off the ladder  
Just want to break even someday before I die  
  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that ain't dry  
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life  
  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that ain't dry  
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life
