Living large, living free  
Living the life that dreams are made of  
Dying proud, dying free  
Dying the death of heroes  
But what you've done now  
Makes me wanna cry, keep on pushing  
Well, you've pushed too far  
You must die now  
You must die now  
Once we were free  
Living in perfect harmony  
It's much too late  
And now there's no turning back  
Attack  
Attack  
Attack  
Out of the blue, out of the sky  
The world comes crashing down  
Now it's out of true, we've been blown sky high  
And the king has lost his crown  
We must be fearless and be relentless  
Kill these insects, show no mercy  
You must die now  
You must die now  
Once we were free  
Living in perfect harmony  
It's much too late  
And now there's no turning back  
Attack  
Attack  
Attack  
Once we were free  
Living in perfect harmony  
It's much too late  
Now there's no turning back  
Attack  
Attack  
Attack
