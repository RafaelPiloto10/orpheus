We met when we were in school  
Never took no shit from no one, we weren't fools  
The teacher says we're dumb  
We're only having fun  
We piss on everyone  
In the classroom  
  
When we got thrown out I left without much fuss  
An' weekends we'd go dancing  
Down Streatham on the bus  
You always made me laugh  
  
Got me in bad fights  
Play me pool all night  
Smokin' menthol  
  
I practiced daily in my room  
You were down the crown planning your next move  
Go on a nicking spree  
Hit the wrong guy  
Each of you get three  
Years in Brixton  
  
I did my very best to write  
How was butlins?  
Were the screws too tight?  
When you lot get out  
Were gonna hit the town  
We'll burn it fuckin' down  
To a cinder  
  
'Cause years have passed and things have changed  
And I move anyway I want to go  
I'll never forget the feeling I got  
When I heard that you'd got home  
An' I'll never forget the smile on my face  
'Cause I knew where you would be  
An' if you're in the crown tonight  
Have a drink on me  
But go easy...step lightly...stay free
