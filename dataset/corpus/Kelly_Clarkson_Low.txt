Everybody's talking  
But they don't say a thing  
They look at me with sad eyes  
But I don't want their sympathy  
It's cool you didn't want me  
Sometimes you can't go back  
By why'd you have to go  
And make a mess like that  
Well I just have to say before I let go  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
'Cause what you did was low  
  
No I don't need your number  
There's nothing left to say  
'Cept I never thought it'd  
Hurt this much to be saved  
My friends are outside waiting  
I've gotta go  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
'Cause what you did was low  
What you did was low  
What you did was low  
What you did was low  
  
I walk out of this darkness  
With no sense of regret  
And I go with a clear conscience  
We both know that you can't say that  
This to show for all the time I loved you so  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
'Cause what you did was low  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
'Cause what you did was low  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
'Cause what you did was low
