Well I realizes I've been hypnotized  
I love you gypsy eyes  
I love you gypsy eyes  
  
All right  
Gypsy  
  
Way up in my tree I'm sitting by my fire  
Wonderin' where in this world might you be  
And known' all the time  
Your still rollin' along the country side  
Do you still think about me?  
  
Oh my  
Gypsy  
  
Well I walked right on up to your rubble road side  
The one that rambles on for a million miles  
Yes I walked down this road searching for your love  
And I found some too  
But I found her I ain't gonna let go  
  
I remember the first time I saw you  
The tears in your eyes oh that girl's tryin' to say  
Oh little girl you know I could love you  
But first I must make my getaway  
Two strange men fightin' to the death over me today  
I'll try and meet you by the old highway  
Hey!  
  
Well I realize that I've been hypnotized  
I love you gypsy eyes  
I love you gypsy eyes  
I love you gypsy eyes  
I love you gypsy eyes  
  
I've been searching so long  
I think they made me lose the battle  
Down against the road my worry knees  
Off to the side I fall but I hear her sweet call  
My gypsy eyes fine and I've been saved  
Oh I've been saved  
That's why I love you  
I said I love you  
Lord I love you
