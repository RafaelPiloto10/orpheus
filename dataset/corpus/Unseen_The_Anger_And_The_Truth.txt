Where's the anger?  
  
There comes a day when you finally realize  
That everything you've been taught was a fucking lie  
They always said that you should always tell the truth  
Do as I say, but don't do as I do  
  
Where's the anger?  
Where's the fucking truth?  
Did you lose it somewhere in your youth?  
  
Sometimes it's hard to see the enemy  
The left, the right, or the fence of apathy  
The sheep or the wolf, it's a thinly veiled disguise  
Movements are worthless if they're plagued with lies
