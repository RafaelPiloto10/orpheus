Once you were mine  
And you wanted the whole world know  
Now ev'ry time I'm around  
You've got somewhere to go  
I ask my heart ev'ry day  
Can there be some other way?  
Tell me, what can I do  
To change my blue destiny?  
  
First you decide  
That our love will always be true,  
Next thing I know  
You're running with somebody new  
Once you were mine alone  
Now you're just someone I've known  
Tell me, what can I do  
To change my blue destiny?  
  
And there were times  
When love was new  
And both our hearts were gay  
But now the signs says we're through  
And bound for separate ways  
  
And how can you love  
When your love doesn't want you at all?  
Girl, when you turn me away  
Got my back to the wall  
  
Still I'd forgive all your lies  
'Cause darlin', I realize that it's you  
Only you, can change my blue destiny  
Baby you, only you  
Can change my blue destiny
