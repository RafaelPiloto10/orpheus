Hey, hey, Mr. Government Man,  
I'm just a poor boy doin' the best that I can  
I've been stepped upon and pushed around, yes, I have  
You can tie me up, but never tie me down  
  
Well, I was drivin' around, tryin' to find a place  
To get a beer and some cigarettes  
Pullin' up behind me, not afraid to flirt  
There's a girl in a red Corvette  
  
I saw in her face that she wanted to race  
So I let my car out of jail  
Man, I blew it, before I knew it  
The Feds were on my tail  
  
I knew it were trouble, but didn't wanna stop  
I couldn't forget that girl  
My dashboard slick from alcohol  
And my head still in a whirl  
  
Just a country boy in the city lights  
Tryin' to have some fun  
But the Man behind me didn't wanna play  
He pulled out a gun  
  
Hey, hey, Mr. Government Man...  
  
Well, I had it comin', I hit the wall  
And my car went up in flames  
My head got hammered, thrown in the slammer  
No one but me to blame  
  
That's my story, ain't much glory  
But I know I paid my dues  
One thing I know in my heart and soul  
I ain't never gonna lose  
  
Hey, hey, Mr. Government Man...  
  
They say I might be goin' crazy  
Hey, what else can I do?  
Hey, my, my  
  
Hey, hey, Mr. Government Man...  
  
Hey, hey, Mr. Government Man  
Don't you push me around no more
