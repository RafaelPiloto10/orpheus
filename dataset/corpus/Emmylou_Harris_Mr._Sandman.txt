Mister Sandman, bring me a dream  
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen  
Give him two lips like roses and clover  
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over  
  
Sandman, I'm so alone  
Don't have nobody to call my own  
Please turn on your magic beam  
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream  
  
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream  
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen  
Give him the word that I'm not a rover  
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over  
  
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream  
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam  
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci  
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace  
  
Mister Sandman, someone to hold  
Would be so peachy before we're too old  
So please turn on your magic beam  
  
Mister Sandman, bring us  
Please, please, please  
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream
