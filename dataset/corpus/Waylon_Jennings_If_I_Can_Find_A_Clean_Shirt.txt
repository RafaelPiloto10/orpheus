Come on now Willie don't look at me that way  
I know you like a paperback book cause I've read every page  
I know what you're thinkin' and I don't think you're thinkin' at all  
This is old hoss that's you're talkin' to the one with the perfect recall  
  
No I ain't going down on the border with you tonight  
Drinking tequila taking chances on our lives  
All the women are crazy they like to party till daylight  
On second thought if I can find a clean shirt I might  
  
Wait a minute Waylon I ain't said a thing about that  
Sometimes I just like to wear my spurs and my old Mexican hat  
But we sure had fun the last time that we were down there  
And we woke up you had that weird tattoo and somebody had curled my hair  
  
No I ain't going down on the border...  
  
All the women are crazy they like to party till daylight  
On second thought if I can find a clean shirt I might
