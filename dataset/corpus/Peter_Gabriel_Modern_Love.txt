Hey, I'm feeling so dirty, you're looking so clean  
All you can give is a spin in your washing machine  
I fly off to Rome to my prima bella  
She leaves me in the rain with telescopic umbrella  
Ooh the pain -- Modern love can be a strain  
  
I trusted my Venus was untouched in her shell  
But the pearls in her oyster were as tacky as hell  
For Lady Godiva I came incognito  
But her driver had stolen her red hot magneto  
Ooh the pain, modern love can be a strain  
  
I don't know why they leave me in the lurch  
To carry on the search  
It's driving me up the wall  
Pity when I have so much passion  
Romance is out of fashion  
Can't handle modern love at all  
  
So I worship Diana by the light of the moon  
When I pull out my pipe she screams out of tune  
In Paris my heart sinks when I see the Mona Lisa  
She gives me the wink, then she shows me the freezer  
Ooh the pain  
Modern love can be a strain
