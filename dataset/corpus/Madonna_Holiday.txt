Holiday, celebrate  
Holiday, celebrate  
  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
It would be so nice  
Everybody spread the word  
We're gonna have a celebration  
All across the world  
In every nation  
It's time for the good times  
Forget about the bad times  
One day to come together  
To release the pressure  
We need a holiday  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
It would be so nice  
  
You can turn this world around  
And bring back all of those happy days  
Put your trouble down  
It's time to celebrate  
Let love shine  
And we will find  
A way to come together  
And make things better  
We need a holiday  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
It would be so nice  
  
Holiday, celebrate  
Holiday, celebrate  
  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
It would be so nice
