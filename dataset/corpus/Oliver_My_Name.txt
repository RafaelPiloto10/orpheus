Sikes  
  
Strong men tremble when they hear it!  
They've got cause enough to fear it!  
  
It's much blacker than they smear it!  
Nobody mentions...  
My name!  
  
Rich men hold their five-pound notes out --  
Saves me emptying their coats out.  
They know I could tear their throats out  
Just to live up to...  
My name!  
  
Wiv me  
Jemmy in me hand,  
Lemme see the man who dares  
Stop me.  
Taking what I may  
He can start to say his prayers!  
  
Biceps like an iron girder,  
Fit for doing of a murder,  
If I just so much as heard a  
Bloke even whisper...  
(spoken) My name! Bill Sikes...  
  
(sung) Some Toff, slumming wiv his valet,  
Bumped into me in the alley  
Now is eyes'll never tally  
He'd never heard of...  
My name!  
  
One bloke  
Used to boast the claim  
He could take my name in vain...  
Poor bloke...  
Shame 'e was so green  
Never was 'e seen again!  
  
Once bad -- What's the good of turning?  
In hell, I'll be there-a-burning  
Meanwhile, thing of what I'm earning  
All on account of...  
My name!  
  
What is it? What is it? What is it?  
  
Sikes  
(spoken) Bill Sikes.
