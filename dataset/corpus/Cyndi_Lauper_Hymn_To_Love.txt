If the sky should fall into the sea  
And the stars fade all around me  
All the times that we have known here  
I will sing a hymn to love  
  
We have lived and dreamed we two alone  
In a world that's been our very own  
With it's memories ever grateful  
Just for you I sing a hymn to love  
  
I remember each embrace  
The smile that lights your face  
And my heart begins to sing  
Your eyes have never lied  
And my heart begins to sing  
And my heart begins to sing  
  
If one day you should ever disappear  
Always remember these words  
If one day we had to say goodbye  
And our love should fade away and die  
In my heart you will remain here  
And I'II sing a hymn to love  
  
O for love, we live eternally  
In the blue we'll roll this harmony  
With every day we are in heaven  
As for you, I'll sing a hymn to love  
  
Don't you ever worry, dear  
And the stars shall fade from the sky  
All the times that we have known here  
I will sing a hymn to our love  
Oh darling,  
Just for you I sing  
A hymn to love
