I've been a gypsy  
For a thousand years  
A victim of circumstance  
I go wherever my destiny calls  
I'm caught in a game of chance  
  
I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
I want to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
Just trying to get inside  
  
No fame or fortune,  
No luck of the draw  
When I dance with Queen of Hearts  
A jack of all trades  
But, a loser in love  
It's tearing my soul apart  
  
Still I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
I want to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking in  
I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
Just trying to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking in  
  
The jack of diamonds  
An' the ace of spades  
Try to use me, and to abuse me  
It seems the dealer  
won't give me a chance  
I'm victim of circumstance  
  
So I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
I want to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking in  
So I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
Just trying to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking in
