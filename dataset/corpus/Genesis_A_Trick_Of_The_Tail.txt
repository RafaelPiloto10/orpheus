Bored of the life on the city of gold  
He'd left and let nobody know.  
Gone were the towers he had known from a child,  
Alone with the dream of a life  
He traveled the wide open road,  
The blinkered arcade,  
In search of another to share in his life.  
Nowhere.  
Everyone looked so strange to him.  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence.  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance, he cried  
  
And wept as they led him away to a cage  
Beast that can talk, read the sign.  
The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame  
And questioned his story again.  
But soon they grew bored of their prey  
Beast that can talk?  
More like a freak or publicity stunt.  
Oh  
No.  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence.  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance, he cried  
  
And broke down the door of the cage and marched on out.  
He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck, pointing out:  
There, beyond the bounds of you weak imagination  
Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold.  
Let me take you there, show you a living story  
Let me show you others such as me  
Why did I ever leave?  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance, he cried  
And wept.  
  
And so we set out with the best and his horns  
And his crazy description of home.  
After many days journey we came to a peak  
Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out.  
We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw  
A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all,  
But the beast was gone and a voice was heard:  
  
They've got no horns and they've got no tail  
They don't even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance  
  
Hello friend, welcome home.
