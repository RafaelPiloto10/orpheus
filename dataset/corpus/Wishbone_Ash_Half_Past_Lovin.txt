I'm half past lovin'  
And I got no more time for you,  
Half past lovin'  
And that's all that I can do.  
Your hands keep movin'  
But your face keeps standin' still.  
I got no time to lose  
And I ain't got time to kill.  
The wheels keep turnin'  
All through the night and day  
Wheels keep turnin'  
What else can I say?  
Time keeps changin'  
Like we knew it always will.  
I got no time to lose  
And I ain't got time to kill.  
You got good timin', honey,  
And your rhythm's fine as it can be.  
You got good timin', babe,  
And your motion's right for me.
