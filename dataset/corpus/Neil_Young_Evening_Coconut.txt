The Statue of Liberty  
Is breathing in the air  
Atlantis is waiting down below.  
Late at night, flashing lights  
Are sighted in the air.  
It's no secret,  
What everybody knows.  
It really don't matter much,  
Which way I go.  
But remember  
To pull over in the storm.  
  
Have you seen the evening coconut  
Bobbing on the bay?  
Standing on  
The water's edge of stone  
Someone there besides you  
To hear the words you say  
To show you things  
Your eyes have never known.  
  
Evening coconut, evening coconut  
Evening coconut, evening coconut  
Evening coconut, evening coconut  
Evening coconut, evening coconut  
Evening coconut, evening coconut  
  
The Statue of Liberty  
Is breathing in the air  
While Atlantis  
Is waiting down below.  
Late at night, flashing lights  
Are sighted in the air.  
It's no secret,  
What everybody knows.  
  
Evening coconut, evening coconut  
Evening coconut, evening coconut  
Evening coconut, evening coconut  
Evening coconut, evening coconut
