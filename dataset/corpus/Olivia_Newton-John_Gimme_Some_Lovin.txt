Well my temperature is rising and my feet left the floor  
Crazy people knockin' cause they're wantin' some more  
Let me in baby, I don't know what you've got  
But you'd better take it easy, this place is hot  
  
And I'm so glad we made it  
So glad we made it  
Oh won't you  
Gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'  
Every day  
  
Well my head is exploding and I'm floating to sound  
So much is happening cause you're around  
It's been a hard day and nothing went too good  
I'm gonna relax like everybody should  
  
And I'm so glad we made it  
So glad we made it  
Oh won't you  
Gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'  
Every day  
Oh now now, baby, oh give me your love  
  
Well I feel so good, everything is getting hot  
You'd better take it easy, cause this place is on fire  
It's been a hard day, and I ain't feeling too good  
I'd better relax like everybody should  
  
And I'm so glad we made it  
So glad we made it  
Oh won't you  
Gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'  
Every day  
Gimme, gimme some lovin'  
Oh baby, gimme some lovin'  
Oh gimme some lovin'  
I want you to gimme some lovin'  
Oh baby won't you gimme some lovin'
