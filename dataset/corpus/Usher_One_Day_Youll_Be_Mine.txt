Check it out  
Come on  
I'm sayin'  
You goin' be mine  
  
First time I saw you baby  
You did something to me  
That no one else has ever done  
Oh-its something in your eyes  
Caught me by surprise  
And told me that you were the one  
Oh-but what's bad is I know you got a man  
  
And he'll never understand  
The chemistry between me and you-Ah baby  
Something inside of me  
It's saying you and I were meant to be  
If you can think it you can have it  
That's why I believe  
  
One day you'll be mine[mine]  
No more creepin', sleepin' around  
No whisperin' when he's around  
One day you'll be mine  
  
Now eveytime I see you baby  
It's plain to see  
That I'm everything you've been missin' at home baby  
So much love to share  
  
It's something in the air  
Tellin' me I should never leave you alone  
But even though  
I know you gotta man  
  
He'll never understand  
The chemistry between me and you-Ah baby  
You can try to stop it but it won't quit  
You say you don't when I know that you want it  
I know,one day you'll be mine  
  
One day you'll be mine[mine]  
No more creepin', sleepin' around  
No whisperin' when he's around  
One day you'll be mine
