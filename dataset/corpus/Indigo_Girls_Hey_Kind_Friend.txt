Hey kind friend  
I don't know when I'll see you again  
On a ferry boat bound to Victoria  
Laying down to hide from the wind  
  
Big dipper hangin' over the city  
You know everything now is different for me  
And it ain't no use in  
Explainin' the scenery  
  
I said  
Kind friend  
Help me forget where I been  
Kind friend  
Remember who I am  
  
I was too late in Spokane  
So I caught a ride through the cascade range  
I saw the sun die in Olympia  
Running down on capital lake  
  
Now I ask you for some relief  
It's one true root that you bring to me  
It's 3 am  
And it's good company  
  
I said  
Hey kind friend  
Help me forget where I been  
Hey kind friend  
Help me remember who I am  
  
Hey kind friend  
Don't know if I'm gonna see you again  
It's okay friend  
It's okay friend  
  
(It's so hard when they all have)  
  
So I'll meet you in New Orleans or I'll see you around  
'Cause I don't know if it's worth coming down  
Hey I'm calling you  
From a gold rush town  
  
And I say  
Hey kind friend  
Help me forget where I've been  
Hey kind friend  
Help me remember who I am  
  
Hey kind friend  
I don't know if I'm gonna see you again  
It's ok friend  
I'm ok friend  
  
I said I'm ok friend  
I'm ok friend  
  
(See ya later)
