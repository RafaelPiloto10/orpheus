Are you sorry when the lights begin to fade  
Are you sorry for the promises you made  
For the burden of the ones who had to fall  
When you didn't see the writing on the wall  
It was forty years ago and I was young  
And the jungle not the desert heard the guns  
Someone said they had a secret plan  
And the rest of us were told to understand  
Well I don't want this, no I don't want this  
I have had enough no more  
Tomorrow is the price for yesterday  
A billion waves won't wash the truth away  
Someday you'll be ordered to explain  
No one gets to walk between the rain  
And I don't want this, no I don't want this  
I have had enough no more  
No I don't want this no I don't want this  
I have had enough no more  
No more
