Now that the past has ended  
My life's an open door  
I know that we could have been mended  
Oh but I can't take the hurt anymore  
Can't take the hurt anymore  
Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore  
The rainbow's over  
But I've seen it leave before  
A love that's been left in the corner  
Ooh 'cause I can't take the hurt anymore  
Can't take the hurt anymore  
Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore  
Lady of my lady's  
Can't we find the right  
And leave behind the sorrow  
Lady of my lady's  
Can't we find the light  
Bright enough to guide us  
Can't take the hurt anymore  
Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore  
This love grows older  
But I've felt it all before  
Yesterday's over my shoulder  
Ooh 'cause I can't take the hurt anymore  
Can't take the hurt anymore  
Ah ah can't take the hurt anymore  
My love I found has lost it's crown  
But I just can't leave it die  
I fool myself and no one else  
'cause I would if I could and I try  
Can't take the hurt anymore etc....
