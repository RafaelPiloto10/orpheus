The distant echo  
Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains  
To take them home to  
The ones that they love and who love them forever  
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts  
Cold and uninviting, partially naked  
Except for toffee wrappers and this morning's paper  
Mr. Jones got run down  
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow  
Madmen on the rampage  
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight  
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen  
Smiling, beguiling  
I put in the money and pull out a plum  
Behind me  
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices  
Hating, waiting  
"hey boy" they shout, "have you got any money?"  
And I said, "I've a little money and a take away curry,  
I'm on my way home to my wife.  
She'll be lining up the cutlery,  
You know she's expecting me  
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork"  
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight  
  
I first felt a fist, and then a kick  
I could now smell their breath  
They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs  
And too many right wing meetings  
My life swam around me  
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence  
The smell of brown leather  
It blended in with the weather  
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth  
It blocked all my senses  
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer  
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight  
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight  
  
The last thing that I saw  
As I lay there on the floor  
Was "Jesus saves" painted by an atheist nutter  
And a British rail poster read "have an away day, a cheap holiday  
Do it today!"  
I glanced back on my life  
And thought about my wife  
Cause they took the keys, and she'll think it's me  
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight  
The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold  
I'm down in the tube station at midnight  
Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnight
