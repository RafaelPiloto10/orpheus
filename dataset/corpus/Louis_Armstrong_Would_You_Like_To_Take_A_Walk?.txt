I saw you strolling by your solitary  
Am I nosy? Very, very  
I'd like to be a juicy huckleberry  
What you're after is a gal  
We're both in luck, for introductions  
Are not necessary  
  
Mmm, would you like to take walk?  
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?  
Mmm, how about a sarsaparilla?  
Gee, the moon is yeller  
Sump'n good'll come from that  
  
Mmm, have you heard the latest song?  
Mmm, it's a very pretty strain  
Mmm, don't you feel a little thrilly?  
Gee, it's getting chilly  
Sump'n good'll come from that  
  
When you're strolling though the wheresies  
You need a whosies to lean upon  
But when you have no whosies  
To hug and whatsies, gosh, darn  
  
Mmm, would you like to take walk?  
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?  
Mmm, ain't you tired of the talkies?  
I prefer the walkies  
Sump'n good'll come from that  
  
My little heart is full of palpitation  
What I need is consolation  
I'd like to stage a little celebration  
In the moonlight, right away  
I'll feel all pepped if you'll accept  
My friendly invitation  
  
Mmm, would you like to take walk?
