Yeah, when the spirit moves you  
You've got to feel it, baby  
Baby, when I think about you  
I think about love  
Darlin', I don't live without you  
And your love  
If I had those golden dreams of my yesterday  
I would wrap you in the heaven and feel it dying all the way  
I feel like makin'  
I feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love to you  
Baby, if I think about you  
I think about love  
Baby, baby, baby, if I to live without you  
I live without love  
And if I had the sun and moon  
And they were shinin'  
You know I would give you both night and day  
Love satisfying  
I feel like  
Feel like makin' love  
I feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love to you  
And if I had the sun and moon  
And they were shinin'  
You know I would give you both night and day  
Love satisfying  
I want to give you the sun  
I want to give you the moon and all the stars above  
'Cause I feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love  
I feel like makin' love  
I feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love to you  
Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love to you  
Yeah, I feel like
