They call me love  
They call me dear  
They kiss off and leave me  
For their own career  
I got a satellite dish, I'm all alone  
With my little goldfish  
And eminem, em on my headphones  
You heard that yet? You will!  
  
Selfish pigs put the blame on me  
So hacked off what I came to be  
I'm off the tracks  
Now I'm all at sea  
They like jogging more than they like me  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2  
  
Then need to have something,  
Becomes the seed to have anything  
The lonely tears have dried up  
And the brain cells start to fry  
My heart cries out for new things  
Turns to anything will do things  
My left sides like a train crash  
Form all the things I tried  
  
I was so scared  
I was lonely  
I got mixed up  
Now I'm only  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2  
  
Mummy and daddy's on prozac  
Said they're happy but  
They won't be back  
I hope they have a heart attack  
'cause of what they done to me  
  
They left me for a wine bar  
They left me for the wrong car  
I dunno how I got this far  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2  
  
Eminem ain't so far away from this  
  
Mummy got a boyfriend  
Daddy got a girlfriend  
Gotta go away at weekends  
I tell you what I'll do  
Take every pill that I see  
You can do what you want to me  
I'm only trying to break free  
From the evil that you do  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2
