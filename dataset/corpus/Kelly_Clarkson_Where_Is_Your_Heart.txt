I don't believe in the smile that you leave  
When you walk away and say goodbye  
Well, I don't expect the world to move underneath me  
But for God's sake, could you try  
I know that you're true to me  
You're always there, you say you care  
I know that you want to be mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you  
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you  
Is it so hard to give me what I need  
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, oh  
Where is your heart  
  
I don't understand, your love is so cold  
It's always me who's reaching out for your hand  
And I've always dreamed that love would be effortless  
Like a petal falling to the ground  
A dreamer following his dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It seems so much is left unsaid  
But you can say anything  
Oh, anytime you need  
Baby, it's just you and me, oh yeah  
  
I know that you're true to me  
You're always there, you say you care  
I know that you want to be mine  
  
Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you  
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you  
Is it so hard to give me what I need  
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, yeah  
  
Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you  
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you  
Is it so hard to give me what I need  
I want your heart to bleed, and that's all I'm asking for  
Where is your heart [Repeat: x4]
