It is the end of all hope  
To lose the child, the faith  
To end all the innocence  
To be someone like me  
This is the birth of all hope  
To have what I once had  
This life unforgiven  
It will end with a birth  
  
No will to wake for this morn  
To see another black rose born  
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow  
  
Angels, they fell first but I'm still here  
Alone as they are drawing near  
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung  
  
Wounded is the deer that leaps highest  
And my wound it cuts so deep  
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug  
  
Mandylion without a face  
Death wish without a prayer  
End of hope  
End of love  
End of time  
The rest is silence
