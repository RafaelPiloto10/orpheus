[Fabolous:]  
Uh yeah  
I'm back (thats right)  
Ghetto Fuckin' Fab niggas  
Street Family  
Desert Storm  
Get it on  
  
[Verse: Fabolous]  
I slide through in the name of the streets  
In the Range with the feets  
With TV screens in the frames of the seats  
I'm a pimp that slides into dames that I meet  
I rather just slide slugs in the chambers of heat  
I'm the reason other rookies in the game couldn't eat  
I'm the player Ly put in the game as a cheat  
Ya'll just tryin' to slide in the game in my cleats  
Ya'll could never be a ghetto superstar like me  
Whats the matter you confused?  
I ain't flattered or amused  
I don't know who put 'em in or what batteries they use  
But I got a clip for the slugs fatter than a fuse  
The rat tat tatta from the Uz  
That tell you  
Nobody do it sooner than son  
And he walk around with stones that look like the moon and the sun  
You know its real when another artist's street teams comin'  
Up to me askin' me when Street Dreams comin' nigga
