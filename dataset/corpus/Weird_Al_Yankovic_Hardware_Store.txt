Nothin' ever (ever) happens in this town  
Feelin' low down (down), not a lot to do around here  
I thought that I would go right out of my mind  
Until a friend told me the news  
  
He said, "Hey, you know that vacant lot  
Right beside the gas station? Well, somebody bought it  
And on that spot they're gonna build a shop  
Where we can go buy bolts and screws"  
  
Since then I've been walking on air (air)  
I can barely brush my teeth or comb my hair  
'Cause I'm so excited and I really don't care  
I've been waiting since last June  
  
For this day to finally arrive  
I'm so happy (happy) now just to be alive  
'Cause any minute now I'm gonna be inside  
Well, I hope they open soon  
  
I can't wait, (no I) I can't wait (oh when)  
When are they gonna open up the door?  
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the  
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the  
Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes, I'm goin' to the  
Hardware store  
  
In my sleeping bag I camped out overnight  
Right in front of the store, then as soon as it was light out  
I pressed my nose right up against the glass  
You know, I had to be first in line  
  
Gonna get me a flashlight and a broom  
Want a pair of pliers for every single room of my house  
See those hacksaws? Very, very soon  
One of them will be all mine  
  
Guys with nametags walking down the aisles  
Rows of garden hoses that go on for miles and miles  
Brand new socket wrenches in a plethora of styles  
All arranged alphabetically  
  
And they're doing a promotional stunt  
There's a great big purple sign out front  
That says every 27th customer  
Will get a ball-peen hammer free  
  
I can't wait, (no I) I can't wait (oh when)  
When are they gonna open up the door?  
I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the  
Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the
