Fill her up! [Repeats]  
  
Her engine's running and the fuel is clean  
She only uses it 'cause she's a machine  
She don't use much though, just to get around  
  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
  
The awesome power of electricity  
Stored for you in a giant battery  
She don't use much though, that's smart for a car

The world is ready for a whole new game  
Some old-timers wanna stay the same  
They like to advertise how clean and green they are  
  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
  
But she don't listen to what they say  
She burned the mess they clean(?) instead  
She don't use much though, that's smart for a car  
  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)  
(Keep filling that fuel line) (Keep filling that old fuel line)

She's not the car that she used to be  
Keep ready for you, and she's ready for me  
Into the future that's her destiny
