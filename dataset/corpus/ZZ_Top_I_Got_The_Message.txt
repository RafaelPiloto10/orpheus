I'm picking up on a signal  
That's in the air tonight.  
It's sparkin' my receiver,  
It feels like dynamite.  
I got the message  
But I want to get it straight from you.  
  
My mind is electric,  
I'm about to blow a fuse.  
The cockpit is empty  
So shoot it down the tube.  
I got the message  
But I want to get it straight from you.  
  
I've got to make a connection.  
I'm on needles and pins.  
Workin' up a printout  
And I'm gonna zero in.  
I got the message  
But I want to get it straight from you.
