It's hard to leave your bed  
The cool and hard summer sheets  
Hangover hanging on by the fangs  
Walk to work on wild feet  
Get to the back door  
Look around then turn the key  
Turn all the lights on  
Take down the chairs and make things neat  
  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Beautiful and disaffected  
It was all perfect till  
He came along and wrecked it  
  
Your favorite mixed tape  
You popped it into the deck  
Don't care if it's out of date  
Ol' cat power and classic Beck  
Beware purveyors of cool  
With their compacts of one  
Talking cannons to fool  
When all you need's a BB gun  
  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Beautiful and disaffected  
It was all perfect till  
He came along and wrecked it  
  
One night he'll make you choose  
I'm sorry but he will  
The hardscape or your shoes  
When the moon's behind the hill  
  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Beautiful and disaffected  
It was all perfect till  
He came along and wrecked it  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Hey Coffee Girl  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Hey there Coffee Girl
