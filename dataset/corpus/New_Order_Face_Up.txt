Ever since I've seen your face  
This life of mine has gone to waste  
I was young and you were old  
And I always knew you were cold  
At the start you had a heart  
But in the end you lost your friend  
Can you see your own dark face?  
It's dying in a lonely place  
  
Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you  
I said, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you  
  
As we get old, we lose our place  
Reflecting back the world's disgrace  
I feel so low, I feel so humble  
Sometimes in life we take a tumble  
Don't let anybody tell you that you're no good  
Cause you know they would  
Don't let anybody tell you what you should do  
Cause it's not that way and...  
  
Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you  
I said, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you  
We were young and we were pure  
And life was just an open door  
I said oh, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you  
  
You were me and I was you  
This world of ours it felt brand new  
You took me a little further...  
I heard it all before, I've heard it all before  
I can't hear it anymore  
Your hair was long, your eyes was blue  
Guess what I'm gonna do to you  
  
Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you  
I said, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you  
We were young and we were pure  
And life was just an open door  
I said oh, oh, how I cannot bear the thought...  
Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you  
I said oh, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you  
We were young and we were pure...
