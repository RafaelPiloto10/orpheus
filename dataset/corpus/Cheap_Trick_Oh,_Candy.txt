Oh Candy why did you do it  
You should've called me on the telephone  
I didn't expect for you call me  
'Cause I didn't think that you were alone  
So alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, Candy worked so hard  
At doin' what he thought was right  
It really, really doesn't mean a thing  
Oh, Candy worked so hard  
At doin' what he thought was right  
It really, really doesn't mean a thing  
  
Oh Candy why did you do it  
You didn't stick a needle in your vein  
You just got so damned depressed  
We all liked you except yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You, you won't be comin' around no more  
You, you won't be comin' around no more  
Oh Candy why did you do it  
I didn't think you heard a word that I said.
