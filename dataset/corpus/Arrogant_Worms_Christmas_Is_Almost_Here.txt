Chorus  
Christmas is almost here (x3)  
Aaahhhggggrrr!  
It's just five days till Christmas, I haven't done a thing  
Don't even have a Christmas tree, I am panicking  
Most lots are all sold out, I search until the night  
I end up with a grubby shrub with a case of blight  
CHORUS  
It's four days till Christmas, still have to decorate  
Spend hours in the basement until I find the crate  
Of lights and bulbs and popcorn strings, tangled in a knot  
Then I spend the day separating what I've got  
CHORUS  
It's three days till Christmas, I spent all day writing cards  
I started writing letters now I just say "best regards"  
I shove 'em in a mailbox and to the mall I go  
To get gifts for Jim and Jane and Tim and Uncle Joe (and aunt Mavis and
Grandma and  
....)  
CHORUS  
Two days till Christmas, a million things to do  
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due  
Where are my in-laws, they should have shown up  
I bet they're at the airport I forgot to pick them up  
CHORUS (x4)  
Christmas is here  
It's finally Christmas, the kids wake me up at five  
I fall downstairs a messy haired zombie, half-alive  
Spend all day serving company, then fall down inert  
If these are my holidays I'd rather stay at work
