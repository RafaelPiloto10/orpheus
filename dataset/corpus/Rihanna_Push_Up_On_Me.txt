We break, break, we break, break, we break, break, we breaking down  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break, we breaking down  
  
It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious  
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious  
'Cause the beat gonna chase my body  
Shakin' aside my bones  
And you pushin' all my buttons, takin' me outta my zone  
Yeah  
  
[Bridge:]  
The way that you stare, starts a fire in me  
Come up to my room you sexy little thing  
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease  
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would light me up and say you want me  
Push up on me  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would light me up and say you want me  
Push up on me  
  
I know many guys just like ya, extremely confident  
Got so much flavor with you like you're the perfect man  
You wanna make me chase ya like its a compliment  
But let's get right down to it  
I can be the girl that can break you down  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we breaking down  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we breaking down  
  
I wanna see how you move it  
Show me, show me how you do it  
You really got me on it, I must confess (I must confess)  
Baby there ain't nothing to it  
Baby who you think you're fooling  
You wanna come get me outta my dress  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break, we breaking down  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break, we breaking down
