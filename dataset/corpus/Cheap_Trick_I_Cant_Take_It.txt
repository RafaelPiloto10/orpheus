Well I saw you today and realized  
How I missed my peace of mind  
I feel your breath in my ear  
But late at night it's you I always think about  
That little girl inside of you I once knew  
I should have known better  
Still the smell of you was on my face  
But you were too busy  
To notice me last night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I can't take it alone  
I can't make it alone  
I can't take it  
I can't make it alone  
Oh no, ooh, oh no  
  
Then I tell myself I'll put you down  
Don't want to see your face around  
Don't call me up anymore  
When I hear your voice it's in my ear  
You're kissing on the phone  
It makes it all come clear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I try to tell myself  
Don't need you anymore  
Don't want you hanging around my door, oh no  
  
Now I can't take it alone  
I can't make it alone  
I can't take it alone  
I can't make it alone  
I can't take it alone  
I can't make it alone  
If it's wrong or right  
I can't take it, I can't make it alone  
  
You know how I tried  
I can't take it, I can't make it alone  
I try tell myself don't need you anymore  
I can't take it alone, I can't make it alone  
Oh baby, my pretty baby  
I can't take it alone, I can't make it alone
