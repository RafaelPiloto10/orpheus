Now young Mr. Moon flew away in the night  
With his best friend Magnus right by his side  
They soared through the Milky Way counting the stars  
Once around Venus, twice around Mars  
  
Then they spied an island rise out of the sea  
They fell back to Earth just as free as you please  
The children all gathered the church bells did ring  
Suddenly everyone started to sing  
  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
  
Queen of the island she welcomed them in  
Asking them questions of where they have been  
She offered them chocolate she offered them tea  
They all took their seats in the top of a tree  
  
And raccoon brought wine and the mice they brought cheese  
Beautiful birds floated by on the breeze  
From out in the oceans the dolphins began  
Humming a tune that soon covered the land  
  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
  
So young Princess Leah brought coral and pearls  
Gifts to the travelers from some other world  
The Bush doctor mixed up a magical spell  
Swore them to secrecy, never to tell  
  
So young Mr. Moon flew away in the night  
With his best friend Magnus still right by his side  
The sun was just rising, they'd be home by noon  
Humming the words to this magical tune  
  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
  
Song for the little children  
Song for the world
