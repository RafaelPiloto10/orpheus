Are you ready, Steve?  
Uh-huh.  
Andy?  
Yeah.  
Mick?  
Ok.  
Alright, fellas,  
Let's go!  
  
Oh it's been getting so hard  
Livin' with the things you do to me,  
Uh-huh.  
Oh my dreams are getting so strange  
I'd like to tell you everything I see,  
Ummh  
  
Oh, I see a man at the back  
As a matter of fact  
His eyes are red as the sun  
And a girl in the corner  
Let no one ignore her  
'Cause she thinks she's  
The passionate at one  
  
Oh, yeah, it was like lightning,  
Everybody was frightening  
And the music was soothing,  
And they all started grooving  
  
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)  
And the man at the back said  
Everyone attack and  
It turned into a ballroom blitz  
And the girl in the corner said  
Boy, I wanna warn ya,  
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz  
Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, Ballroom blitz.  
  
I'm reaching out for something  
Touching nothing's all I ever do  
Oh,  
I softly call you over  
When you appear there's nothing left of you, Aha  
  
Now the man in the back  
Is ready to crack as he  
Raises his hands to the sky  
And the girl in the corner is ev'ryone's mourner 'cause  
She could kill you with a wink of her eye  
  
Oh yeah,  
It was electric,  
So frightfully hectic  
And the band started leaving,  
'Cause they all stopped breathing  
  
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)  
And the man at the back said  
Everyone attack and  
It turned into a ballroom blitz  
And the girl in the corner said  
Boy, I wanna warn ya,  
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz  
Ballroom blitz (eco 3 times)  
  
Oh yeah, it was like lightning, everybody was frightening  
And the music was soothing, and they all started grooving  
  
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)  
And the man at the back said  
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz  
And the girl in the corner said  
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz  
Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, Ballroom blitz  
  
It's it's a ballroom blitz, it's it's a ballroom blitz  
It's it's a ballroom blitz,  
Yeah!, it's a ballroom blitz!
