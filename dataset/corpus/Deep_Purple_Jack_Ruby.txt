There's no method in my madness, no craft, no guile  
No expertise, no self assuring smile  
No wizardry or witchcraft, no crass deceit  
No dark conspiracies, I stand on my own two feet  
I'm coming through just like jack ruby  
  
I ragged around the edges but I got control  
There's no way around it and I got control  
I reach out for my program, still got control  
Straight down to business, who needs control  
I've got panache just like jack ruby  
  
I don't beg forgiveness, I don't beg at all  
But I beg to differ 'cause I got the ball  
There was no invitation, you're not my type  
And what's gone, it ain't worth having, kiss it all goodbye  
Right on the money just like jack ruby
