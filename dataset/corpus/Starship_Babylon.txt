Forever, you'll be remembered as the one who played it cool  
Whenever they speak your name they'll say it's you who broke the golden rule  
But here's what I really want to know  
Did you see the writing on the wall  
  
Babylon  
How long can this foolish magic carry on  
Babylon  
Who will love you when the fantasy of youth is gone  
  
Babylon is it true that your streets were paved with gold  
And did you play beneath the stars  
Babylon did you know it would all come down to  
How you played the dealer's cards  
  
Remember how you loved the laughter  
A kingdom on the rise  
Crys in the night would turn you to song  
And when they call ooh you sang along  
  
Here's what I really want to know  
Did you see the writing on the wall  
  
Babylon  
How long will this foolish magic carry on  
Babylon  
Who will love you when the fantasy of youth is gone  
  
Babylon is it true that your streets were paved with gold  
And did you play beneath the stars  
Babylon did you know it would all come down to  
How you played the dealer's cards  
  
It's over you rate two pages in some book  
Your legacy  
Lost in the night and still you sing your song  
For those who will take heed  
  
Here's what I really want to know  
Did you see the writing on the wall  
  
Babylon  
How long will this foolish magic carry on  
Babylon  
Who will love you when the fantasy of youth is gone  
  
Babylon is it true that your streets were paved with gold  
And did you play beneath the stars  
Babylon did you know it would all come down to  
How you played the dealer's cards
