If you're ready to fall in love  
Here's the thing you've been dreaming of  
Scientific fact that you should know  
  
If you're ready to give your heart  
And you don't know which way to start  
And you're afraid you'll go against the flow  
  
Ask anyone who's ever been given the blow  
If you'll know when all systems are go  
  
[Chorus]  
All systems go, ohoohooh  
All systems go, oohoohooh  
All systems go, all systems go  
All systems go oo oh oo oh  
All systems go, all systems go  
All systems go oo oh oo oh  
  
Is your mind in computer mode?  
And all your senses in overload  
And all controls for take off in your hands  
  
200,000 watts of my love are starting  
To glow  
Let you know that all systems are go  
  
You're on a one way trip to the sun  
Your heart's on fire and you're ready to run  
Faster now faster, we're headin' out for  
Planet Mars  
Love sudden impact, everything's under  
Control  
And all systems are go  
  
[Chorus]
