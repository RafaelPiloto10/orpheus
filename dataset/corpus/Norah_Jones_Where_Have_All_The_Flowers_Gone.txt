WITH DOLLY PARTON AND LEE ANN WOMACK  
WRITER PETE SEEGER  
Where have all the flowers gone? Long time passing Where have all the flowers
gone? Long time ago Where have all the flowers gone? Girls have picked them
every one When will they ever learn? When will they ever learn? Where have all
the young girls gone? Long time passing Where have all the young girls gone?
Long time ago Where have all the young girls gone? Taken husbands every one
When will they ever learn? When will they ever learn? Where have all the young
men gone? Long time passing Where have all the young men gone? Long time ago
Where have all the young men gone? Gone for soldiers every one When will they
ever learn? When will they ever learn? Where have all the soldiers gone? Long
time passing Where have all the soldiers gone? Long time ago Where have all
the soldiers gone? Gone to graveyards every one When will they ever learn?
When will they ever learn? Where have all the graveyards gone? Long time
passing Where have all the graveyards gone? Long time ago Where have all the
graveyards gone? Covered with flowers every one When will we ever learn? When
will we ever learn?
