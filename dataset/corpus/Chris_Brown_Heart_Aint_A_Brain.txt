It's a 360 turn  
Sittin' where we begin  
Like beginnin'  
And here's the end  
Like kissin'  
And missin' class  
But what  
We needed to learn  
Was different  
Than just some math  
It's the big picture  
We missed it  
The big figures  
Just didn't add up  
  
We said  
Let's noy leave on bad terms  
In between  
Them bad words  
This could be love right?  
Uh, huh  
But are we gon' leave  
When it's this good?  
Damnit we just cause  
Seems this lovin's  
All for nothing  
Baby, you know  
  
[Chorus]  
A heart ain't a brain  
But I think  
That I still love you  
A happy endin'  
Makes it right  
Cause it ends  
When you don't want to  
And it makes perfect sense  
To end it like the start  
How do I explain  
This nonsense to my heart?  
A heart ain't a brain  
But I'm thinkin'  
That I still love you  
  
It's a fly twist  
Just when you said  
I got this  
Right when the fight  
Has stopped it  
Seem my body felt wrong  
Held on them nights  
We held on  
We can't let it go  
But if we don't then  
We will never know  
  
We we said let's not leave on bad terms  
In between those bad words  
This could be love right?  
Uh, huh  
But are we gon' leave  
When it's this good?  
Damnit we just cause  
Seems this lovin's  
All for nothing  
Baby, you know  
  
[Chorus]
