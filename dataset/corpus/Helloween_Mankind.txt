Here is all mankind so proud of their achievements  
There is a stone that is warmer than you  
  
Look how we stand in the stream of illusions  
No one says a word  
  
Here you laugh and there you cry  
All that makes you move  
  
There's no fear for anything  
Anything but you  
  
Animals dying for our vanity  
Our world is a beautiful place to be free  
  
Drinking the blood of the weak, it's so easy  
No one hears them cry  
  
Here you cheat and there you lie  
All that makes you gain  
  
One day we will face His throne  
There's nothin' we can say  
  
Prosperity, luxury, fast food is rising  
It's the rainforest that dies  
  
Here you laugh and there you cry  
All that makes you move  
  
Here you cheat and there you lie  
All that makes you gain
