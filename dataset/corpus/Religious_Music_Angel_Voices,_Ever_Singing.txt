Angel voices, ever singing, round Thy throne of light  
Angel harps, forever ringing, rest not day or night  
Thousands only live to bless Thee, and confess Thee Lord of might.  
  
Thou Who art beyond the farthest mortal eye can scan  
Can it be that Thou regardest songs of sinful man  
Can we feel that Thou art near us and wilt hear us? Yea, we can.  
  
Lord, we know Thy love rejoices o'er each work of Thine  
Thou didst ears and hands and voices for Thy praise combine  
Craftsman's art and music's measure for Thy pleasure didst design.  
  
Here, great God, today we offer of Thine own to Thee  
And for Thine acceptance proffer, all unworthily  
Hearts and minds, and hands and voices, in our choicest melody.  
  
Honor, glory, might and merit, Thine shall ever be  
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, blessed Trinity  
Of the best that Thou hast given Earth and heaven render Thee...
