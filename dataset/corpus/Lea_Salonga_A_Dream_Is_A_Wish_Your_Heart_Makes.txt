(d. Hoffman-livingston)  
  
A dream is wish your heart makes  
When you're past asleep  
In dreams, you will lose your heartache  
Whatever you wished for, you keep  
  
Have faith in your dream and someday  
Your rainbow will come smiling too  
No matter how your heart is grieving  
If you keep on believing  
The dream that you wish will come true  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la rin  
Ohh oh la ra la ra la rin  
Ohh oh la ra la ra la rin  
  
No matter how your heart is grieving  
If you keep on believing  
The dream tha you wish will come true  
  
No matter how your heart is grieving  
If you keep on believing  
The dream tha you wish will come true
