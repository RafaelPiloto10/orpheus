I know that it's time for a change  
Mmm but when that change comes  
Will you still feel the same?  
  
How many times have I tried to turn this love around?  
I don't want to give up  
But baby it's time I had two feet on the ground  
Can you release me  
Can you release me  
Now that you're gone I can't help myself from wondering  
Oh, if you'd have come down from your high  
Would we've been all right?  
Release me  
Can you release me  
  
Come on baby, come on baby  
You knew it was time to just let go  
'Cause we want to be free  
But somehow it's just not that easy  
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'  
'Cause you're a waste of time for me  
I'm trying to make you see  
That baby you've just got to release me  
Release me  
Release me  
I'm not going back to you anymore  
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow  
So stop coming around my door  
'Cause you're not gonna find  
What you're looking for  
  
Come on baby, come on baby  
You knew it was time to just let go  
'Cause we want to be free  
But somehow it's just not that easy  
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'  
'Cause you're a waste of time for me  
I'm trying to make you see  
That baby you've just got to release me  
Release me  
Release me  
I'm not going back to you anymore  
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow  
So stop coming around my door  
'Cause you're not gonna find  
What you're looking for  
  
What is this power you've got on me  
What is this power, Oh  
What is it, What is it  
  
Come on baby, come on baby  
You knew it was time to just let go  
'Cause we want to be free  
But somehow it's just not that easy  
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'  
'Cause you're a waste of time for me  
I'm trying to make you see  
That baby you've just got to release me  
Release me  
Release me  
I'm not going back to you anymore  
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow  
So stop coming around my door  
'Cause you're not gonna find  
What you're looking for  
  
Release me  
Will you release me  
Ah... Release me  
Will you release me
