I'm at the point of no return  
I'm watching the candle burn  
Both ends  
There's a lesson we  
Both can learn, this time  
So if you wanna make my day  
There's something  
You've gotta say  
Now please don't laugh  
And turn away, this time  
I don't wanna make a fuss  
But this is the time for us  
And I ain't gonna miss the buss  
This time  
  
No return  
So there'll be no turning back  
Once I know that  
You'll be by my side  
No return  
Maybe you'll give me all the love  
That you always felt  
You had to hide  
No return  
I've come a thousand miles  
Across the ocean  
But that ain't half  
As far as my emotion  
Now I've reached  
The point of no return  
  
While on my way down the avenue  
I had to stop for a drink or two  
Or three  
Now not that I was stalling you  
For time  
It's just I wanted to feel my best  
And I almost passed the test  
I need your lovin' to do the rest  
This time  
  
No return, so please don't ever do  
What you've done  
So many times before  
No return  
Because I've made up my mind  
That this time I'll make it  
Through' your door  
No return, I rode above the clouds  
So far below me  
But didn't get as high as  
When you hold me  
Now I've reached  
The point of no return  
  
I'm at the point of no return  
I'm watching the candle burn  
Both ends  
There's a lesson we  
Both can learn, this time  
I don't wanna make a fuss  
But this is the time for us  
And I ain't gonna miss the buss  
This time  
  
No return  
So there'll be no turning back  
Once I know that  
You'll be by my side  
No return  
Maybe you'll give me all the love  
You always felt you had to hide  
No return, I rode above the clouds  
So far below me  
But didn't get as high as  
When you hold me  
Now I've reached  
The point of no return  
  
No return, so please don't ever do  
What you've done  
So many times before  
No return  
Because I've made up my mind
