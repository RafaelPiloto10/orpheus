Blackness awakens, visions come alive.  
Seeing through darkness with borrowed eyes.  
  
Death survivor, take me higher,  
Reunite my soul.  
Whisperer of truth, I trust in you  
To make me whole.  
  
Sun, come shine my way,  
Make healing waters bury all my pain.  
Wind, carry me home,  
The fabric of reality is tearing apart.  
The piece of me that died  
Will return to live again.  
  
Feeling myself slip away,  
Silently dreaming awake,  
Hidden memories flooding back.  
I will not grow in the light  
Until I pass through the darkest caverns  
Of my heart.  
  
Dance with fire, spirit guide  
Erase the world outside.  
Messenger of truth, I trust in you,  
Transform me now.  
  
Sun, come shine my way,  
Make healing waters bury all my pain.  
Wind, carry me home,  
The fabric of reality is tearing apart.  
The piece of me that died  
Will return to live again.  
And at last the time has come  
To unite again as one,  
To the power of the earth I'm calling.  
Crossing bridges in the sky  
On a journey to renew my life.  
Shaman, take my hand!
