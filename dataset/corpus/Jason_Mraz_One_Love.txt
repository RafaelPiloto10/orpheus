One love, one heart  
Oh let's get together now and we can feel alright  
Let them all pass their dirty remarks  
There is one question I'd really love to ask  
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner,  
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?  
  
One love, one heart  
Let's get together now and we can feel alright  
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon  
So when the man comes  
There won't be no no doom  
Have pity on those who chances grow thinner  
Cause there ain't no hiding place from the Father of creation  
  
Oh one love what about the love, one heart  
Oh lets get together now and we can feel alright  
One love, one heart  
Let's get together now and we can feel alright  
I said lets let's get it together now  
And we can feel alright  
  
One love, one heart  
O lets get together now and we can feel alright  
One love what about the love, one heart  
Let's get together now and we can feel alright  
I said lets get together we're gonna fell alright  
I said lets lets get it together now and we can feel alright
