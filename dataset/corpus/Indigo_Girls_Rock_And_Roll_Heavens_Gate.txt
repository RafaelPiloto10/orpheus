It didn't happen for you,  
No one wants to hear the truth,  
Coming from three political queers.  
Plucking the punk rock bloom.  
So you break up the band  
And leave us all in tow.  
Now we gotta figure out  
Where to go.  
I caught it at a rave  
Did it give you vaccination?  
I saw it on my T.V.  
Did it lighten up your load?  
And every fuckin D.J.  
Did you feel affilliated,  
Is telling me I'm free.  
Like you really had a home?  
Free to be a loser  
Were the ticket prices too high?  
Free to be a trend  
Were the lights too bright?  
Free to be a backlash over and over again.  
Was it all a bunch of hype?  
You say, "I'm losing inspiration,  
One band at a time.  
I gotta know there's someone, somewhere, out there singing for our side."  
Where I come up, we share the mortar and the glue.  
And what we build together, we share that too.  
And the wind may come, and the rain may fall,  
But we stand together or we don't stand at all.  
Where are you going to now,  
Now that the goings gone?  
So here's to your survival  
And swimming up the stream,  
Crossing over one dam after another  
Until we get to Rock and Roll Heaven's gate.  
I caught it at a rave  
Did it give you vaccination?  
I saw it on the T.V.  
Did it lighten up your load?  
And every fucking D.J.  
Did you feel affiliated,  
Is telling me I'm free.  
Like you really had a home?  
Free to be a loser  
Were the ticket prices too high?  
Free to be a trend  
Were the lights too bright?  
Free to be a backlash over and over  
Until I get to Rock and Roll Heaven's gate.
