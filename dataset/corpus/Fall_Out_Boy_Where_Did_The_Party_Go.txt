Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na, na  
  
I'm here to collect your hearts,  
It's the only reason that I sing  
I don't believe a word you say,  
But I can't stop listening  
  
This is the story of how they met,  
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes,  
And when she touched him he turned ruby red  
A story that they'll never forget  
Never forget  
  
And all the boys are smoking Menthol's,  
Girls are getting back rubs,  
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough  
  
My old aches become new again  
My old friends become ex's again  
  
Oh where did the party go?  
We were ending it on the phone  
I'm not gonna go home alone  
Where, where did the party go?  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na, yeah  
  
I know I expect too much  
And not enough all at once  
You know I only wanted fun  
And you got me all fucked up  
Oh no  
  
I looked for your name on the Ouija board  
And you're making magic oh dear lord  
You and me are the difference between real love  
And the love on TV, love on TV  
  
And all the boys are smoking Menthol's,  
Girls are getting back rubs,  
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough  
  
My old aches become new again  
My old friends become ex's again, yeah  
  
Oh where did the party go?  
We were ending it on the phone  
I'm not gonna go home alone  
Where, where did the party go?  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na  
  
All the kids who screamed (we weren't the same)  
In sweaty rooms  
Now we're doomed to organizing walk-in closets like tombs  
  
Silent film stars stuck in talking cinema light  
So let's fade away together one dream at a time  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Oh where did the party go?  
We were ending it on the phone  
I'm not gonna go home alone  
Where, where did the party go?  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na
