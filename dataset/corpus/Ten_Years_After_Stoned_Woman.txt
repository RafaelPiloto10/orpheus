She gonna love him, stoned out of mind all the time  
She gonna keep him, stoned out of his mind all the time  
She don't see nothing  
She just has loving and she keeps on puffing all the time  
I keep on praying  
She'll just have a flash  
She'll hear what I'm saying all the time  
Well, she's a stoned woman, baby, it's true  
Well, she's a stoned woman  
Baby, baby, baby, I don't know, really, what to do  
  
She gonna love him, stoned out of mind all the time  
She gonna keep him, stoned out of his mind all the time  
She don't see nothing  
She just has loving and she keeps on puffing all the time  
All the time  
I keep on praying  
She'll just have a flash  
She'll hear what I'm saying all the time  
All the time  
All the time  
All the time
