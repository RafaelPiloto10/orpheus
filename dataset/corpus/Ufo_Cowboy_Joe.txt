(instrumental)  
I'm not looking to change your mind,  
There's a place, call it home  
It's no secret, the world unwinds  
Maybe now you're not alone  
It's just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
Straitlaced to the bone  
(this story will not play? )  
You take the wheel and play the chance  
Suddenly the room's divided  
As in the way of true romance  
It's always undecided  
It's just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
Shipwrecked to the bay  
(this story will not play? )  
Every time he climbs back up  
Smacked down with a dime  
It's evens or odds now  
Just ran out of time  
(instrumental)  
Love's a struggle, there's a fight  
No bone of contention  
So unhappy, well here's the bite  
That's the mother of invention  
It's just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
Strange place to play  
It's just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
(fade out)
