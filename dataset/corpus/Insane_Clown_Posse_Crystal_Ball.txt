Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Dark Lotus Family, It's Our World  
Lookin my crystal ball it's alright  
Welcome, my curious sisters and brothers  
First, put a twenty in the jar with the others  
(That's right take a seat)  
Ain't no smokin in here, I need to keep my ball clear  
There spirits in there  
(Whats your future, someone gonna shoot ya)  
Will you get your girlfriend back, as if I know that  
I can only tell you where your soul is headed  
And will remain eternaly embeded, the rest forget it  
Life is nothin but a test to clear  
Did you have a heart while you where here  
And was it sincere?  
Your still unraveling your future right now  
What kinda person are ya bro, oh, where there you go  
You control your own muthafuckin' destiny  
I ain't lettin' the devil get the best of me  
(I'm gonna make it into Shangri-la) golden walls  
What's up with you check your own crystal balls  
Lookin my crystal ball its allright  
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright  
  
Lookin in my crystal ball I'm seein' thugs  
Both catchin' and firin' slugs (paper for drugs)  
I see a line waiting on block cheese a mile long  
All tryin to be strong (It's the same old song)  
But when I look into everybodys faces (smile)  
Their soul are headed other places  
And they ain't worried about payin them dues down here  
(Because they mother fuckin future is crystal clear)  
The focus switches to you and it ain't good  
All mad cause someone rolls up out the neighborhood  
Check your self and the judgment was passed  
Yo, you be in hell (right up the asshole)  
It will get ya if ya let it pack your speedo's  
I hear it's hot where you headed  
I'm trying to tell ya now (when the grim reaper calls)  
You don't want to be ass out grippin' your crystal balls  
  
Lookin my crystal ball its alright  
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright  
Lookin my crystal ball its alright  
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright  
  
Look into my crystal ball its all black  
And everybodys frozen in time front to back  
Their controlled by the matrix of mind, body and soul  
And I'm branded by the system of carnival freekshow  
I see the fame analyize cause nothin is the skyz  
It's the same as seein the death in the demons eyes  
I'm high in my sights, from the truth of my crystal ball  
Believe me when I say we comin for all of y'all  
Look deep into my crystal ball  
See the dead smokin on trees and drinking alcohol  
Underneath the street beneath the concrete  
If you listen to the night you can hear my heart beat  
All painted up buried in a axe and shit  
Juggalo love got each others backs and shit  
Encased in glass for the whole world to see  
Am I inside, or is the crystal ball inside of me  
  
Lookin my crystal ball its alright  
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright  
  
Rain comes down (Lookin my crystal ball it's alright)
