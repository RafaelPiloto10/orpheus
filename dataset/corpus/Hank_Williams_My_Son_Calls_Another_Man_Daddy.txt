Tonight my head is bowed in sorrow  
I can't keep the tears from my eyes  
My son calls another man daddy  
The right to his love I've been denied.  
  
My son calls another man daddy  
He'll ne'er know my name nor my face  
God only knows how it hurts me  
For another to be in my place.  
  
Each night I laid there in prison  
I pictured a future so bright  
For he was the one ray of sunshine  
That shone through the darkest of nights.  
  
My son calls another man daddy  
He'll ne'er know my name nor my face  
God only knows how it hurts me  
For another to be in my place.  
  
Today his mother shares a new love  
She just couldn't stand my disgrace  
My son calls another man daddy  
And longs for the love he can't replace.  
  
My son calls another man daddy  
He'll ne'er know my name nor my face  
God only knows how it hurts me  
For another to be in my place.  
  
My son calls another man daddy  
He'll ne'er know my name nor my face  
God only knows how it hurts me  
For another to be in my place.
