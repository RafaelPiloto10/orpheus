Saw a girl walkin' down the street  
Upsettin' everybody she meet  
Well, she walks up to the corner  
She stops, everybody they want her  
  
She's fine  
Yes, yes, yes, she's fine  
She's a fine, pretty thing  
I wanna love her all the time  
  
Well, I said tell me baby  
Honey, where you goin'  
She said darlin'  
Well, I wouldn't be knowin'  
She had on a long evening frock  
She stopped in the street and did the ? rock  
  
She's fine  
Yeah, she's fine  
She's a fine, pretty thing  
I wanna love that woman all the time  
  
Well, I said tell me baby  
What you thinkin' of  
She said there isn't anything greater than love  
She looked at me  
And she gave me a smile  
Shook her head and winked her eye  
  
But she's fine  
Yes, yes, she's fine  
She's a fine, pretty thing  
I need to love that woman all the time
