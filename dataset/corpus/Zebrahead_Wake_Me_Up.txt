I want a wrecking ball  
I want to break it all  
I want to jump the track  
Fade the day to black  
It's in the elements  
In the elements  
Is what they meant  
And the world is bent  
  
Give me something to believe in  
A drop of hope to raise our fists up high  
Blood fills our lungs from screaming  
We won't live a lie  
won't live a lie  
This life is but a dream!  
  
[Chorus]  
So wake me up  
Cause I must be dreaming  
I can't believe what my eyes are seeing  
Yeah wake me up  
I can't find a meaning  
Nothing really matters when  
the world is sinking  
Down, down. down  
When it all falls  
Down, down, down  
Who will you blame?  
  
I want to be what I'm not  
I want to care a lot  
I want to stop your fall  
I want to take it all  
It's never Heaven sent  
Never heaven sent  
And what they meant  
never made a dent  
Give me something to believe in  
A drop of hope to raise our fists up high  
Blood fills our lungs from screaming  
We won't live a lie  
won't live a lie  
This life is but a dream.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trust is breached  
We're misunderstood  
We try to find our way  
But we're falling down  
Nothing to hold on to  
No one there to catch you  
And I could never lie to you  
  
I said we're fucking falling down  
Nothing to hold to  
No one there to catch you  
And I know you'd never lie  
Give us something to believe in  
This life is not a dream!  
  
[Chorus]
