An asteroid crashed and nothing burned  
It made me wonder  
Do tigers sleep in lily patches?  
Do rhinos run from thunder.  
I got an ache in my left ear  
I felt the truth but I still could hear.  
Made me think, I would not be burned,  
But rather give myself to science,  
I felt that I could help  
To science, I felt that I can help  
  
Paranoid the doctor ran,  
Shouting his graphic translation  
All out of order  
Gang wars and ails of riches,  
Spewing forth their color  
He purposely waited till I was done  
To knock on the lavatory door  
Accusing me of ruining the fun,  
He knocked on it some more  
The fun, He knocked on it some more.  
  
And alloy suitors were all inside  
An apple or a grape  
To put forth a cloud of Mercury  
In front of a mighty car  
On a freeway in Los Angeles  
Once the spraying has been done  
'Cause there's more pain from necessity  
You're a portrait of your past,  
There's a mummy in the cabinet.  
Are there no more arrows left?  
  
What's that rubber bottle doing here?  
How's that napkin for a proof  
Ten cents to a dollar now  
For a shelf of pregnant hens  
  
Robert Palmer is employed  
Again, again, again  
So stupendous, living in this tube.
