It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen  
I bought a Coke and some gasoline  
And I drove out to the County Fair  
And when I saw her for the first time  
She was standing there in the ticket line  
And it all started right then and there  
Oh a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset  
And that's a day I'll never forget  
  
I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt  
She was killing me in that mini-skirt  
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks  
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick  
I worked so hard for that first kiss  
A heart don't forget something like that  
  
It was five years later on a south-bound plane  
I was headed down to New Orleans  
To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras  
When I heard a voice from the past  
Coming from a few rows back  
When I looked I couldn't believe just what I saw  
  
She said I bet you don't remember me  
And I said only every other memory  
  
I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt  
You were killing me in that mini-skirt  
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks  
  
You had a sun tan line and red lipstick  
I worked so hard for that first kiss  
A heart don't forget something like that  
  
Like an old photograph  
Time can make a feeling fade  
But the memory of the first love  
Never fades away  
  
I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt  
She was killing me in that mini-skirt  
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks  
  
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick  
I worked so hard for that first kiss  
A heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget  
I said a heart don't forget something like that  
Oh, not something like that
