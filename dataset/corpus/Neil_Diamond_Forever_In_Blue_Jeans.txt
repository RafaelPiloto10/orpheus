Money talks  
But it don't sing and dance  
And it don't walk  
And long as I can have you here with me  
I'd much rather be  
Forever in blue jeans  
Honey's sweet  
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat  
And if you pardon me  
I'd like to say  
We'll do okay  
Forever in blue jeans  
  
Maybe tonight  
Maybe tonight, you and I  
All alone by the fire  
Nothing around  
But the sound of my heart  
And your sighs  
  
Money talks  
But it don't sing and dance  
And it don't walk  
And long as I can have you here with me  
I'd much rather be  
Forever in blue jeans, babe
