No one to talk with  
I'm by my self,  
No one to walk with,  
But I'm happy on the shelf  
Aint misbehavin'  
I'm savin' my love for you....  
I know for certain the one that I love,  
Im through with flirtin'  
Its just you Im thinkin of  
Aint misbehavin Im saving my love for you  
Im like Jack Horner  
Sittin in a corner  
Dont go nowhere  
What do i care  
Your kisses are worth waitin for  
baby believe me  
I dont stay out late I dont care to go,  
Im home about 8 just me and my radio  
Aint misbehavin  
Im savin' my love for you  
Im like jack horner sittin in a corner  
I dont go nowhere what do i care  
Your kisses are worth waiting for  
Baby believe me  
I dont stay out late I dont care to go Im home about 8  
Just me and my radio  
Aint misbehavin Im saving my love for you
