There's a time and place everywhere I go  
Where the river meets the sea  
Somewhere between the gates of dreams  
And the turning of the key  
There's a cutting edge there's a real fine line  
And it's caught in come and go  
And you're leaving what you thought you knew  
To what you've come to know  
When the twilight turns at the end of day  
And the angels kiss the moon  
There's a diamond sun everywhere she goes  
And there ain't no other way  
I'm gonna dream tonight  
By that pale moonlight  
Till the morning comes my way  
  
I'm walking tall  
And I'm walking fine  
And I'm up there  
With that girl of mine  
  
And I'm standing in the twilight now  
Yeah I'm standing by her side  
Oh I'm gazing in that gate of dreams  
Underneath that midnight sky  
Cause there's a diamond sun everywhere she goes  
And there ain't no other way  
I'm gonna dream tonight  
By that pale moonlight  
Till the morning comes my way  
  
I'm walking tall  
And I'm walking fine  
And I'm up there  
With that girl of mine
