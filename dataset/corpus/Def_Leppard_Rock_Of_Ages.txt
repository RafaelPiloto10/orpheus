All right  
I got somethin' to say  
Yeah, it's better to burn out  
Yeah, than fade away  
All right  
Ow gonna start a fire  
C'mon!  
  
Rise up! Gather round  
Rock this place to the ground  
Burn it up, let's go for broke  
Watch the night go up in smoke  
Rock on! Rock on!  
Drive me crazier, no serenade  
No fire brigade, just Pyromania (c'mon)  
  
What do you want? What do you want?  
I want rock 'n' roll, yes I do  
Long live rock 'n' roll  
Oh let's go, let's strike a light  
We're gonna blow like dynamite  
I don't care if it takes all night  
Gonna set this town alight  
  
What do you want? What do you want?  
I want rock 'n' roll, alright!  
Long live rock 'n' roll  
  
[Chorus]  
Rock of ages, rock of ages  
Still rollin', keep a-rollin'  
Rock of ages, rock of ages  
Still rollin', rock'n'rollin'  
We got the power, got the glory  
Just say you need it and if you need it  
Say yeah!  
Heh heh heh heh  
Now listen to me  
  
I'm burnin', burnin', I got the fever  
I know for sure, there ain't no cure  
So feel it, don't fight it, go with the flow  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme one more for the road  
  
What do you want? What do you want?  
I want rock 'n' roll, You betcha  
Long live rock 'n' roll  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're gonna burn this damn place down  
Down to the ground  
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh
