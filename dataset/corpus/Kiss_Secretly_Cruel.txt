I saw my pictures hangin' on her wall  
She cut it out of that magazine  
It was a hot day, she wore lingerie  
And nothin' else in between, ooh  
She had long hair and thigh high snake skin boots  
And she was all over me like a cheap suit  
Then she bared herself, aha  
And stripped my soul  
Began to shake, rattle, and roll  
Then I took control, yeah  
  
But I know she's secretly cruel  
I ain't nobody's fool  
Yeah, I know she's secretly cruel  
Just when I though it was safe  
She puts her lips to my face  
She's secretly, secretly cruel  
  
Well she grabbed my hair  
And I began to rise  
I could tell what she wanted  
By that look in her eyes, oh, ow  
By that look in her eyes, yeah  
I said "Come here babe and make it quick"  
She said "Not so fast"  
And had a drink  
  
Well it ain't just luck  
But I better knock on wood  
She's gonna give me everything  
Somehow I knew she would  
  
Oh, but I know she's secretly cruel  
I ain't nobody's fool  
Well, I know she's secretly cruel  
I said baby you're the fire, but I am the fuel  
She's secretly, secretly cruel  
Yeah, so cruel  
  
Well it ain't just luck (ain't just luck)  
But I better knock on wood, yeah  
She's gonna give me everything  
Somehow I knew she would  
  
Oh, but I know she's secretly cruel  
I ain't nobody's fool, nobody's fool  
Secretly, she's so cruel (cruel)  
I'm in love, but I don't play the fool  
Secretly, she's so cruel, secretly, so cruel  
Cruel, yeah, cruel, yeah, cruel, yeah  
I know she's secretly, she's so cruel, secretly, so cruel  
Cruel, yeah, cruel, yeah, cruel, yeah  
I know she's secretly, she's so cruel, secretly, she's so cruel  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, secretly, secretly cruel, cruel
