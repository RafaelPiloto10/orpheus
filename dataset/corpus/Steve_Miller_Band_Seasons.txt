Summer, fall, winter, spring  
Of the seasons I will sing  
To help you through your birth  
As you spend your time on earth  
In the wind  
The summer song won't last long  
When this warm old man has come  
I'll sing your of your birth  
As you spend your time on earth  
In the wind  
And so it goes  
As the wind blows  
The seasons will flow  
To help you through your birth  
As you spend your time on earth  
In the wind  
A mother's child  
A father's son  
In this crowd, I'm only one  
To tell you of your worth  
As you spend your time on earth  
In the wind  
And so it goes  
As the wind blows  
And so it goes  
As the wind blows
