You want to look like me.  
You want to act like me.  
You've got no sense of your own identity.  
You can't begin to see  
  
That you and me makes we.  
That's not what I want to be  
So fuck you.  
Imitation's not a flattery.  
  
You can't begin to feel, you can't begin to feel,  
You can't begin to feel.  
I said fuck you  
I don't want to know you.  
  
I don't want to know.  
It's about time, I've made up my mind.  
Get out of my life you motherfucker.  
It's about time, made up my mind.  
  
I'm taking what's mine  
You motherfucker  
You are made  
From things you steal from me.  
  
You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel,  
Can't begin to feel  
So fuck you  
You suck my energy, my personality.  
  
You steal steal steal from me.  
You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel,  
Can't begin to feel  
So fuck you.  
  
Imitation's not a flattery.  
So you're a pitiful thief, you're a pitiful thief,  
You're a pitiful thief.  
Fuck you.

You are made from things you steal from me.  
You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel.
