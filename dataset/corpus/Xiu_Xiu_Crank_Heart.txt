Telling your son a joke  
He doesn't think is funny  
We'll catch him unawares but  
What if he doesn't wear underwear.  
Lighting it up  
You were so cool  
Her school colors  
Black and light black  
Giving it up  
She has started  
Your life's colors  
Black and light black  
Getting your hair from under your bed  
Breaking your fingers  
Getting killed by a car  
Before you can make him pay.
