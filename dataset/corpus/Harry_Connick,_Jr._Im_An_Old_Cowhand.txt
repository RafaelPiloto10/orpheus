Oh, step aside, y'all ornery tenderfeet  
Cause I'm about to sing my song  
I'm an old cowhand from the rio grande  
But my legs ain't bowed, and my cheeks ain't tan  
Well I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow  
Never roped a steer 'cause I don't know how  
And I sure ain't fixin' to startin now  
Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay  
  
I'm an old cowhand from the rio grande  
And I learned to ride before I learned to stand  
Well I'm a ridin fool who is up to date  
I know every trail in the lone star state  
'cause I ride the range in a ford v-8  
Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay  
  
Look out, I'm gonna show y'all how to ride now  
Here we go  
  
I'm an old cowhand from the rio grande  
And I come to town just to hear the band  
I know all the songs that the cowboys know  
'bout the big corral where the dogies go  
'cause I learned them all on the radio  
Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay  
  
Now my story's almost done, so listen up!  
You ain't got much longer now  
  
I'm an old cowhand from the rio grande  
Where the west is wild round the borderland  
Where the buffalo roam around the zoo  
And the indian make you a rug or two  
And the old bar-x is the bar-be-cue  
Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay  
  
I'm just an old cowhand...
