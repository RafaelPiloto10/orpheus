Stay around don't play around  
This old town and all  
Seems like I got to travel on  
  
A lot of people won't get no supper tonight  
Justice tonight  
  
Runnin' and a hiding tonight  
Justice tonight  
  
Remember to kick it over  
No one will guide you through Armageddon time  
It's Armageddon  
It's not Christmas time  
  
A lot of people  
A lot of people use a calculator  
A lot of people won't get no supper tonight  
A lot of people sittin' down by the light  
  
The battle is gettin' hotter  
Armageddon time  
Armageddon  
  
Remember to kick it over  
Armageddon time  
  
A lot of people ain't got no supper tonight  
A lot of people got to stand out back
