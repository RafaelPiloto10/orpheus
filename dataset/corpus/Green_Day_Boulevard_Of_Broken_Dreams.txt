[Verse 1]  
I walk a lonely road  
The only one that I have ever known  
Don't know where it goes  
But it's home to me and I walk alone  
  
[Verse 2]  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of broken dreams  
Where the city sleeps  
And I'm the only one and I walk alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I walk alone  
I walk alone  
  
I walk alone  
I walk a...  
  
[Chorus]  
My shadow's only one that walks beside me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Till then I walk alone  
  
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah  
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'm walking down the line  
That divides me somewhere in my mind  
On the border line of the edge  
And where I walk alone  
  
Read between the lines  
What's fucked up and everything's all right  
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive  
And I walk alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I walk alone  
I walk alone  
  
I walk alone  
I walk a...  
  
[Chorus]  
My shadow's only one that walks beside me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Till then I walk alone  
  
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah  
Ah-ah, ah-ah  
  
I walk alone  
I walk a  
  
[Verse 4]  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of broken dreams  
Where the city sleeps  
And I'm the only one and I walk a  
  
[Chorus]  
My shadow's only one that walks beside me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Till then I walk alone
