On big alley stands a lady waiting  
For awhile  
Acting out an untold story like a  
Wounded child  
But the mystery of the circumstance  
Won't hide  
She believes true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Waiting for her long lost lover  
Returning from the war  
Though I know she knew the truth  
She also knew much more  
And the answer that she gave to all of us  
Whispered low saying  
True love survives  
True love survives  
  
Is she dreaming does she know  
A secret I can't see  
Maybe there's a trace of truth  
In all that she believes  
  
For one day I took a look deep down inside  
A voice cried saying true love's alive  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
  
True is love is never-ending  
It's giving all and not pretending  
It's holding on although your heart  
Feels dead  
  
A quarter of a century of years  
Have gone by  
Still the dream of this peculiar  
Lady's kept alive  
So I'm holding tight to one who I desired  
A burning fire saying true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever  
Only love will last forever
