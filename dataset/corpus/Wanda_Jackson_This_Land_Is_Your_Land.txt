This land is your land this land is mine land from California to the New York
Island  
From redwood forrest to the gulf stream water this land was made for you and
me  
As I went walking that ribbon of highway I saw above me an endless skyway  
I saw below me a golden valley and this land was made for you and me  
This land is your land this land is mine land...  
This land is your land this land is mine land...  
I've roamed and I've rambled I've followed my footsteps  
To the sparkling sands of a diamond desert  
And all around me a voice was sounding this land was made for you and me  
This land is your land this land is mine land...  
This land is your land this land is mine land...
