In his boat and through the dark he rowed  
Chained to oar and the night and the wind that blowed  
Horribly 'round his ears  
Under the bridge and into your dreams he soars  
While you lie alone in that idea-free sleep of yours  
That you've been sleeping now for years  
  
And he wants you  
He wants you  
He is straight and he is true  
Ooh hoo hoo  
  
Beneath the hanging cliffs and under the many stars where  
He will move, all amongst your tangled hair  
And deep into the sea  
And you will wake and walk and draw the blind  
And feel some presence there behind  
And turn to see what that may be  
Oh, babe, it's me  
  
And he wants you  
He wants you  
He is straight and he is true  
Ooh hoo hoo
