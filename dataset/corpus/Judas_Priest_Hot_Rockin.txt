I've done my share of workin' out  
I wanna go some place where I can scream and shout  
Show me the lights, where I can find  
The only thing I need to give me peace of mind  
  
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go hot rockin'  
  
Where is the spark that kicks the air  
Where is the energy that charges everywhere  
I see the crowd, I hear the roar  
I feel my body to leave the ground and soar  
  
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go hot rockin'  
  
I'm goin' out in search of the bright lights  
Somehow I feel that tonight is the right night  
I'm almost there I've got the vibration  
It's coming strong from this generation  
My blood is hot, from now on I'm set free  
My pulse is hot, so don't try to stop me  
'Cause this is it and I'm hot rockin'  
  
Don't let it stop, don't let it end  
Please let it carry on and on and on again  
I get so high. Knocked off my feet yeah  
This is the only way I want, I want, I want  
  
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go hot rockin'  
  
It's all I want, it's all I crave  
I just want to go hot rockin'
