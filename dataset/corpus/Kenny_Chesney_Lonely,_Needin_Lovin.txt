She comes in every morning at nine and sits down at her desk  
Smiles and says hello to everybody and tries to do her best  
To act like nothing's wrong and nothing's missin' in her life  
But her eyes tell a story  
That her smile can't disguise  
  
She's got that needin' somebody, wantin' somebody who  
Will treat her like somebody for once in her life  
She's lonely for love  
Is that asking too much  
For someone to treat her right  
She's got that lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes  
  
Sometimes I want to walk on over and tell her I can help  
'Cause I know losing a love is tough  
I've been there myself  
You still feel the pain long after all the tears have dried  
And it's so hard to cover up  
The hurt you feel inside  
  
She's got that needin' somebody, wantin' somebody who  
Will treat her like somebody for once in her life  
She's lonely for love  
Is that asking too much  
For someone to treat her right  
She's got that lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes  
  
Well I wish I could hold her right now  
And take her in my arms and show her  
That love can still be found  
  
She's got that needin' somebody, wantin' somebody who  
Will treat her like somebody for once in her life  
She's lonely for love  
Is that asking too much  
For someone to treat her right  
She's got that lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes  
  
She's got that lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes  
  
Somebody look in her eyes  
Lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes
