Remember me  
Don't you forget me, child  
We are all only here  
Just for a little while  
  
Do you remember the girl?  
The girl that you were dating  
Keep all your ?  
And then you walked away  
  
Oh yes, he did now  
Oh yes, he did  
  
You remember when you were sick  
You were cripple and you were lame  
I stood by your bed time till you  
Were on your feet again  
  
Oh yes, I did now  
Oh yes, I did  
  
Oh, somewhere oh down the line  
You are gonna see this little heart of mine  
Is so large, so wonderful, so true  
  
Oh now, somewhere  
Brighter days you're gonna see  
What a big mistake that you made  
  
I said I'm a begging you  
I said I'm a begging you  
I said I'm pleading, pleading, pleading  
  
Remember me  
Don't you forget me, child  
We are all only here  
Just for a little while  
  
Oh yes, we're here now, oh yes, we're here  
I need a little of your love everyday  
I need you to sit and to talk to me right now  
  
Every second, every minute, every hour of the day  
I need you to hold my little trembling hand  
I need you to just stand right by  
Oh, my, my, my
