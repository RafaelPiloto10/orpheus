Hey everybody take a look at me,  
I've got street credibility,  
I may not have a job,  
But I have a good time,  
With the boys that I meet "down on the line"  
  
I don't need you  
So you don't approve,  
Well, who asked you to?  
Hey, jerk you work  
This guy's got better things to do  
Hell  
I ain't never gonna work, get down in the dirt  
I choose, to cruise  
Gonna live my life, sharp as a knife  
I've found my groove and I just can't lose  
I'm style from head to toe  
Cool cat flash gonna let you know  
I'm a soul boy, I'm a dole boy,  
Take pleasure in leisure, I believe in joy!  
  
[Chorus]  
Wham!  
Bam!  
I am!  
A man!  
Job or no job  
You can't tell me that I'm not  
Do!  
You!  
Enjoy what you do?  
If not  
Just stop!  
Don't stay there and rot!  
  
Party nights, and neon lights  
We hit the floors, we hit the heights  
Dancing shoes, and pretty girls  
Boys in leather kiss girls in pearls!  
Hot, damn! everybody, let's play!  
So they promised you a good job, no way!  
One, two, three, rap!  
See'mon everybody, don't need this crap!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you're a pub man  
Or a club man  
Maybe a jet black guy with a hip hi-fi  
A white cool cat with a trilby hat  
Maybe leather and studs is where you're at  
Make the most of every day  
Don't let hard times stand in your way  
Give a wham give a bam but don't give a damn  
'cause the benefit gang are gonna pay!  
  
Now reach up high and touch your soul  
The boys from wham! will help you reach that goal  
It's gonna break your mama's heart (so sad)  
It's gonna break your daddy's heart (too bad)  
Just throw the dice and take
