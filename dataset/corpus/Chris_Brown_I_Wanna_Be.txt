Look, I know we been friends for a while now  
But, I just feel I can confess to you  
It's gon' be hard but, alright here it goes  
  
Imagine that the pillow that you cried on was my chest  
And the tissue that you wiped your face with was my hand  
Girl, imagine if you needed advice about some other guy,  
I'm the one that comes to mind  
Not try'na hear you tell nobody that I'm just a friend  
Just try'na make sure I'm that body that you call your man  
And anytime you need a shoulder, it's yours night or day  
Well, what I'm try'na say is  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna be, the last number you call late at night  
Said I wanna be, the first one that you dial when you open your eyes  
Wanna be the one you run to, wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you  
I wanna be, yeah  
Wanna be, yeah  
  
Be the man makin' your girls jealous (Girl, I wanna be)  
Be the guy shuttin' down all the fellas (ooh)  
Whatever you need, girl it's all on me  
Your soldier, your friend or your lover (ooh)  
Girl, I wanna be yours  
  
Would it be cool, would you mind if I called you my boo, (my boo)  
What if the next whip you was pushin' was the one I bought for you  
Can I be the one that meets your Pops and take your mama shoppin'  
Be the only one that I (wait!), have you thought about it (wait), Really
thought about it  
Maybe you should take some time, call your girls and talk about it (yeah)  
Cause I done already made up my mind (my mind)  
Don't need no more time to know if I wanna be with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Be the man makin' your girls jealous (I wanna)  
Be the guy shuttin' down all the fellas (fellas, yeah)  
Whatever you need, girl it's all on me  
Your soldier, your friend or your lover (ooh)  
Girl, I wanna be yours  
  
Put me on your screen saver, all over your Myspace and  
Make me one of your five favorites, that's where I wanna be  
The one you cryin' for, stayin' up all night fightin' for  
Wanna be your good, bad, love, hate, Girl!  
  
Cross my heart, hope to die, on everything that's good  
I'ma do you right, show you right, Get this understood  
Cross my heart, hope to die, on everything that's good  
I'ma do you right, show you right, Get this understood  
  
I wanna be, the last number that you call late at night (oh)  
first one that you dial when you open your eyes (when you open your eyes)  
Wanna be the one you run to  
Wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you (oh)  
I wanna be, yeah (I wanna yours)  
Wanna be, yeah  
  
Be the man makin' your girls jealous (jealous, yeah)  
Be the guy shuttin' down all the fellas (fellas)  
Whatever you need, (uh)  
Girl, it's all on me  
Your soldier, your friend or your lover  
Girl, I wanna be yours  
  
Girl, I wanna be, yours  
I wanna be, yours  
be yours  
I wanna be  
be yours  
I wanna be  
Be yours
