Goodnight sweetheart, all my prayers are for you  
Goodnight sweetheart, I'll be watching o'er you  
Tears and parting may make us forlorn  
But with the dawn a new day is born  
So I'll say goodnight sweetheart, sleep will banish sorrow  
Goodnight Sweetheart, when we meet tomorrow  
Dreams enfold you, in them, dear, I'll hold you  
Goodnight sweetheart goodnight.
