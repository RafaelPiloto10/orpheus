By your heart strings I'm hanging from a dream,  
Gently swinging in the warm autumn breeze.  
  
Come look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up, no more.  
  
Tip toeing along a strand of your hair suspended between,  
These thoughts and actions miles above reality.  
  
Come look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
  
Come look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
  
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
  
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.  
  
Opening up, opening up, opening up, opening up.  
Look at the scars, you open me up, open me up.  
Smother a heart, opening up, opening up.  
Look at the scars, you open me up, opening up, open me up
