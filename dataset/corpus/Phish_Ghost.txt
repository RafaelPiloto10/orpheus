I feel I never told you  
The story of the ghost  
That I once knew and talked to  
Of whom I'd never boast  
  
For this was my big secret  
How I'd get ahead  
And never have to worry  
I'd call him instead  
  
His answer came in actions  
He never spoke a word  
Or maybe I laid down the phone  
Before he could be heard  
  
I somehow feel forsaken  
Like he had closed the door  
I guess I just stopped needing him  
As much as once before  
  
But maybe he's still with me  
The latch was left unhooked  
He's waiting in the wind and rain  
I simply haven't looked
