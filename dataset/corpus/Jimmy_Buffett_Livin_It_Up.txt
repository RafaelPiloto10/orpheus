He took one last look  
Tossed that address book  
His odyssey had begun  
No time to see sights  
Ran all the red lights  
Burned all his bridges  
Now it's love on the run  
  
[Chorus:]  
Livin' it up  
Is takin' all of his time  
But he ain't givin' it up  
It suits his temperament fine  
  
Up on the bandstand, plays for a few fans  
Workin' for minimum wage  
He sees her lookin', his brain is cookin'  
She takes her seat of the foot of the stage  
  
[Chorus:]  
Livin' it up  
It's takin' all of his time  
But he ain't givin' it up  
It suits his temperament fine  
  
Yeah he loves livin' it up  
And takin' all of he's time  
But he ain't givin' it up  
It never crosses his mind  
  
Didn't say much, had a soft touch  
Knew what felt good in her man  
He was the same way, they split the next day  
Sang all the way through the Yucatan  
  
[Chorus:]  
Livin' it up  
It's takin' all of our taime  
But we ain't givin' it up  
It never crosses our mind  
No no no he's just livin' it up  
And takin' all of his time  
But he ain't givin' her up  
She suits his temperament fine  
Yeah she's just livin' it up  
And takin' all of his time.
