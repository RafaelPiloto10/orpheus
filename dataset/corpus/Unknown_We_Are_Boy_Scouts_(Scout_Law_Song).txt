We are boy scouts,  
Trusting in our honour.  
Loyal, Helpful,  
Friend to One and All.  
  
Ever Courteous,  
Every kind to animals,  
We obey our orders even though they're small.  
  
Always cheerful,  
Whistle through the rain drops.  
Careful and thrifty,  
Clean in thought and deed.  
  
So come on boys now,  
Don't forget we're boy scouts.  
Be prepared, be prepared,  
Keep in mind the law.
