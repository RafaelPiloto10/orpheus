When I done it you know I did it to death (death)  
So sit back and hold ya breath (just hold ya breath)  
I don't know about them  
I really ran these streets  
So listen up as shit get deep (Let's Go!)  
  
You know I'm smoking the best  
I ain't got to brag  
The young fly nigga with the Georgia swag  
(Yeah!) The seat's suede  
So is the ?  
The clientele in Minnesota  
And so it the Vikings (Damn!)  
Inside so soft  
I can't believe it's not butter  
Snowman bitch  
Did I st-st-stutter? (Ha-Ha!)  
Came straight from the hood  
Right to the big screen  
The way the boy ball  
You'll swear he had hoop dreams (Yeah!)  
No grants, no scholarships (nah)  
Had to make my own way  
I still stack them chips (Hey!)  
The homey from the block  
Coming down with the knowledge (knowledge)  
Straight to the pros  
Yeah I soared past college (Yeah!)  
  
What you talkin' bout?  
Nigga my life (Hey!)  
And I'ma get it all  
No matter the price (Ha-Ha!)  
When I did it  
You know I done it the best  
Sit back and just hold ya breath,  
And just hold ya breath (Yeah!)  
  
What you talkin' bout?  
Changing the game  
And showing ya  
Half these rappin' ass niggas is lames (Hey!)  
When I did it  
You know I done it the best  
Sit back and just hold ya breath, and just hold ya breath (Yeah!)  
  
They say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice  
I say the blacker the rims the sweeter the coupe (Whoo!)  
That money goes out, that sack comes in  
I can't even lie, I'd do it all again (Yeah!)  
I flip the rap game  
Just like the work (Hey!)  
And it was snow white  
Just like my shirt  
Got in so much paper  
Seen so many haters (nah)  
Seen bricks stacked tall as skyscrapers (Damn!)  
Got damn that's high (Yeah!)  
Done everything I said  
So I am that fly (That's Right!)  
Everyone was the truth  
Tell me who came realer (Huh?!)  
The word on the street is that I'm still that nigga  
  
What you talkin' bout?  
Nigga my life (Hey!)  
And I'ma get it all  
No matter the price (Ha-Ha!)  
When I did it  
You know I done it the best  
Sit back and just hold ya breath, and just hold ya breath (Yeah!)  
  
What you talkin' bout?

Half these rappin' ass niggas is lames (Hey!)  
When I did it  
You know I done it the best  
Sit back and just hold ya breath, and just hold ya breath (Yeah!)  
  
Between love and hate  
There's a thin ass line  
I think we all can agree  
Last summer was mine (Ha-Ha!)  
And if you don't say my name  
Then you wasting your time  
And if I don't wear my watch  
Then I'm wasting my shine (Yeah!)  
Spend a hundred on it homey  
Then set the time  
A few mil before the deal  
And I'm still on the grind  
The critics criticize me  
Cause a nigga talking yams  
I ain't sugar coating shit  
This is who I am (nah)  
Nigga you been to the A  
You seen me making it rain  
Seen it wit ya own eyes  
You know this shit ain't a game (Yeah!)  
So you niggas listen closely  
To what I'm saying (sayin')  
If ya game ain't money  
Then I ain't playin' (Let's Get It!)  
  
What you talkin' bout?  
Nigga my life (Hey!)  
And I'ma get it all  
No matter the price (Ha-Ha!)  
When I did it  
You know I done it the best  
Sit back and just hold ya breath, and just hold ya breath (Yeah!)
