"Mad Love"  
  
Your insensitivity is your personality  
Trait least favourite  
Ha, ha! Funny  
You think you're so funny  
  
But you hurt my feelings  
We've had some good dealings  
What have I done recently  
To make you so mean to me?  
  
I'm oversensitive you say  
But I think you were nasty today  
You make me feel nasty  
Like a control freak  
  
I just want to feel helpful  
Like I'm needed, a sense of reason  
You tell your friends I'm a fucking kook  
Look how long it took  
  
I've been like this all the time  
You don't know what it's like to be me  
You're not paranoid, neurotic  
You're free  
  
I don't like me much anymore  
You make me feel a burden  
You make me feel like a bore
