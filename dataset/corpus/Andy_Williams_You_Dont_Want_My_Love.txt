In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
"Some other time", that's whatcha say when I want you  
Then you laugh at me and make me cry  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
You don't seem to care a thing about me  
You'd rather live without me  
Than to have my arms around you  
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone (all alone)  
  
[Chorus]  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
Once upon a time you used to smile and wave to me  
And walk with me but now you don't  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
Some other guy is takin' up all your time  
Now ya don't have any time for me  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
You don't seem to care a thing about me  
You'd rather live without me  
Than to have my arms around you  
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone (all alone)  
  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
(In summertime, in summertime when all the leaves are green)  
In the summertime, I'll be blue all the time  
Cause you don't want my love
