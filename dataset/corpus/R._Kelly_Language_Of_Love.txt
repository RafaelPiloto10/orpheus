Ft. Taj Jackson  
  
Baby don't speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
It's the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause it's the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
  
Your expressions are saying what I wanna hear  
Like baby will you spend the night  
Let's go to the special place you always take me to  
The signal I'm whispering inside your ear  
Got you feeling butterflies  
Cause you're anticipating the things I'ma do to you  
  
She's swinging her hair  
That's sign number one  
Doing the dance for me  
Like I'm that song in the club  
And she's putting her hair  
Where she wants me to start from  
Only what I wanna hear you say  
  
Baby don't speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
It's the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause it's the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
The language of love  
Softly, you're killing me the pillow  
She's finding me funny  
But shaking like it's 30 degrees below  
So I gotta keep her warm  
Like some hot tea  
Keep you up all night  
Like some coffee  
Take you on a ride  
We'll be sitting in the backseat  
On my Bentley  
Take you anywhere you wanna go  
  
She's breathing hard  
That's sign number two  
Doesn't matter where we are  
Long as I'm with you  
But the way you communicate  
When I do what you like  
Only what I wanna hear you say  
  
Baby don't speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
It's the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause it's the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
The language of love
