Something about the way he touched me.  
Was so slow, the way he put his arms around me.  
Even though I'm feeling lonely,  
I'm, I'm feeling lonely.  
  
Don't understand the words he said,  
Made me do wrong.  
But now there's nothing that's in my head  
And though it's strong, I wish he'd leave me alone,  
I wish he'd leave me  
  
'Cause I know, trouble will follow  
But I have to go  
I have to go  
  
'Cause I know, trouble will follow  
But I have to go  
But I have to go  
  
He makes me think that I don't know me  
So I'll show him what I remember all the things he showed me  
And I want more,  
I'm feeling lonely  
Oh, I'm feeling lonely
