I take a step outside  
And I breath the air  
And I slam the door  
And I'm on my way  
I won't lay no blame  
I won't call you names  
'Cause I've made my break  
And I won't look back  
I've turned my back  
On those endless games  
  
I'm all through with ties  
I'm all tired of tears  
I'm a happy man  
Don't it look that way  
Shakin' dust from my shoes  
There's a road ahead  
And there's no way back home (no way back home)  
Oh but I have to say  
  
Leavin' home ain't easy  
Oh I never thought it would be easy  
Leavin' on your own  
Oh is the main thing calling me back  
Leavin' home ain't easy  
On the one you're leavin' home  
  
Stay my love my love please stay  
Don't stray my love  
What's wrong my love?  
What's right my love?  
Oh leavin' home ain't easy  
I thought how could I think of leavin'  
Leavin' on your own  
Still tryin' to persuade me that  
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way  
Leavin' home ain't easy  
But may be the only way
