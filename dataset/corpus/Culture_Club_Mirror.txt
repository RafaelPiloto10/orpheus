(trying to get the message through)  
You took the sun from the sky, give it back  
You know I wouldn't take a bullet for you  
You bring me down 'cause of all that you lack  
You're underhanded and you're sly with it too  
  
In a moment of desperation  
We forgive and we compromise  
Reaching out for that one sensation, life  
  
No time for wasting my time  
I'm just trying to get the message through  
You hold up a mirror to me  
You know that all you'll ever see is you  
All you'll ever see is you  
  
You know you won't change the world from your back  
But still you lie there like a vacant fool  
What happens when all your credit runs out  
And I have to be kind to be cruel  
  
In a moment of desperation  
We forgive and we close our eyes  
Reaching out for that perfect love to survive hey, yeah, yeah  
  
No time for wasting my time  
I'm just trying to get the message through (trying to get the message through)  
You hold up a mirror to me  
You know that all you'll ever see is you  
All you'll ever see is you  
  
You just don't get it  
Do ya?

In a moment of desperation  
We forgive and we close our eyes  
Reaching out for that one sensation to survive, hey yeah  
  
No time for wasting my time  
I'm just trying to get the message through (trying to get the message through)  
You hold up a mirror to me  
You know that all you'll ever see is you (ooh-ooh)  
All you'll ever see is you
