Be-side to "December Will Be Magic Again" single  
Written by Kate Bush  
Warm and soothing,  
That's how I remember home.  
Walking into arms  
Through the back door.  
Hearing voices I know well,  
And long for.  
Cold and boozy,  
Our holiday in the Alps.  
Sitting in the lobby,  
Mostly smoking.  
Choking on the woozy afternoon.  
I'm reeling in the music  
And I've only had a few.  
And I'm afraid  
By the way we grow old,  
My darling.  
Abrupt, too moody,  
You making our party list.  
I remember sulking  
On the sofa.  
For most of the winter  
We were strangers.  
Just one more  
To ease the ache,  
Before the night takes me.  
When you stay asleep  
On your side of the bed,  
Don't look at me,  
Don't look at you...  
I'm reeling in the music  
And I've only had a few.  
And I'm afraid  
By the way we grow old,
