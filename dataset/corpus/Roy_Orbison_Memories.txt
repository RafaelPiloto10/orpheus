In a cold December, memories can melt your heart away  
In a warm September, you can still remember yesterday  
  
Even in the darkest night when dreams fade away  
When your love is gone, you'll never be alone in memories  
  
Memories, while walking through a winter snow, memories, when summer breezes
start to blow  
When true love is far away it may be yours in memories  
  
Memories, while falling leaves just fill the air, memories, when springtime
comes and love's not there  
Even when you cry, try not to say goodbye to memories  
  
Golden memories can turn the night into day, teach your heart to smile  
And live each day a while in memories
