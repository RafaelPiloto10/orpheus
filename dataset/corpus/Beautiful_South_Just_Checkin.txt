I came in here, just to see his guilty face  
I'm just checkin'  
He's been dead twenty years but I sort of miss the chase  
I'm just checkin'  
  
I've seen folk just like her, pop their noses round the door  
They're just checkin'  
If this is where their husband was between 1 and 4  
They're just checkin'  
  
Nothing hits so definite, hits so hard  
When he's moved from Old White Hart  
and he's doing the Old Graveyard  
We're running a check. On the love we had taken away  
We're running a check. That death wasn't fortnight astray  
Nothing hits so definite (repeat)  
  
The mask of sobriety for afternoons he'd save  
I'm just checkin'  
If he could fool me regularly he'd certainly fool his grave  
I'm just checkin'  
  
I've seen those widows pray for the hunt that was taken away  
They're just checkin'  
They pretend they've just popped by like they popped by yesterday  
They're just checkin'  
  
I came round here in case he left a slate  
No one settles up around here, like the widowed or the late  
We've seen folk like you settle bills or family feuds  
But no one's bought a drink for those that death excludes  
We're just checkin'  
We're just thinkin'  
We're just sinkin'
