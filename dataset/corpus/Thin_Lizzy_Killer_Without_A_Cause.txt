He made a big impression  
When he walked across the room  
And I must make my confession  
I might have spoke too soon  
  
He's a killer  
Without a cause  
The time is right  
To settle scores  
  
On the streets he lives again  
Down the alley and round the bend  
On the beat beneath the light  
An angel comes to claim the light  
  
From the streets  
This rebel shall rise  
His soul shall soar  
Through the skies  
  
The same old confrontation  
At the bar in the saloon  
But it's just another tricky situation  
The underworld operation lies in ruins  
  
He's a killer  
Without a cause  
The time is right  
To settle scores
