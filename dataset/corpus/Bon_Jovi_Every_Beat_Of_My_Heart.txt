As a hard rain beats down in the night  
It sounds like applause  
Still I can't hear a sound  
With the beat of my heart  
  
I can't pick up that phone anymore  
And I need to confess  
If I don't say, "I love you"  
Everything else is a waste of my breathe  
  
Every beat of my heart I would give  
Every beat of my heart just to live  
To live for your love, if all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
As I whisper your name  
I wish you were here by my side  
And the only way that I find you  
Is when I close my eyes  
  
With my ring on your finger  
I hope and I pray  
That you know deep in your soul  
With every step that you take  
  
Every beat of my heart I would give  
Every beat of my heart just to live  
I live for your love, if all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
It's the little things that you do  
That make me want you more  
It's the way your hands are trembling  
But what they trembling for?  
  
It's the way the smile fits on your lips  
The way you hold me tight  
God knows I'd give everything  
To be in your arms tonight  
  
I live for your love, it's all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give every beat of my heart just to live  
Every beat of my heart, just to live  
I live for your love, it's all that I want  
To die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
Give you every beat of my heart  
Give you every beat of my heart  
Give you every beat of my heart
