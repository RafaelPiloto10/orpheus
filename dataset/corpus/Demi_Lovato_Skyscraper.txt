Skies are crying  
I am watching  
Catching tear drops in my hands  
Only silence  
Has an ending  
Like we never had a chance  
  
Do you have to  
Make me feel like  
There is nothing left of me  
  
[Chorus]  
You can take everything I have  
You can break everything I am  
Like I'm made of glass  
Like I'm made of paper  
Go on and try to tear me down  
I will be rising from the ground  
Like a skyscraper  
Like a skyscraper  
  
As the smoke clears  
I awaken  
And untangle you from me  
Would it make you  
Feel better  
To watch me while I bleed  
  
All my windows  
Still are broken  
But I'm standing on my feet  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Go run run run  
I'm gonna stay right here  
Watch you disappear ya yaa  
Go run run run  
Ya it's a long way down  
But I am closer to the clouds up here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Like a skyscraper)  
Like a skyscraper  
Like a skyscraper
