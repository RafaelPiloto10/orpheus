Broken windows  
In empty hallways  
A pale dead moon  
In a sky streaked with gray  
  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to chase love away  
  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's gonna to rain today  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
  
Kick it down the street  
And that's the way to treat a friend  
Right before me  
The signs implore me  
  
Help the needy  
And show them the way  
Human kindness, is overflowing  
And I think it's gonna to rain today
