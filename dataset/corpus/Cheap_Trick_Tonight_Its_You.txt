Time's not sleeping and time won't lose  
You can't win 'cause time can't lose  
So stop (so stop) what you're doin'  
Start on something new  
Don't (no don't) don't be hypnotized  
Don't start thinkin' with your eyes  
  
(I don't know) Why you mean that much to me  
(You don't know) What it feels like lovin' you  
(We all know) A change is good for you  
(That's all right) Gotta do what you gotta do  
Anyway  
  
All I want is a place in your heart to fall into  
All I need is someone to love  
And tonight it's you, tonight it's you

Come away with me  
Smile with your eyes  
So I can see
