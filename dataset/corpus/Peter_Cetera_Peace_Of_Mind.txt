Every time I have it made  
I let it rain on my parade  
I need a star that doesn't fade  
When I open my eyes  
Everything is clear to see  
You've given me a destiny  
I know there's something left for me  
And I found it this time  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't want it all, I just want a little bit  
And I'll never stop 'til I get to it  
  
Being with a woman like you  
Is all I ever wanted to do  
Give me something I can hold on to  
Then I'll have it all  
  
Find a little place in the sun  
Won't you tell me I'm the chosen one  
Say you need me when the day is done  
Then I'll have enough  
To get me through my life  
  
Chorus  
  
I never will reget it  
'Cause I'm having the time of my life  
I can fly on the wings of our love here in the night  
Oh, it hurts if I let it  
But it's something I'd rather forget  
Now the past isn't holding me down  
Oh, don't you know  
I've learned to let it go
