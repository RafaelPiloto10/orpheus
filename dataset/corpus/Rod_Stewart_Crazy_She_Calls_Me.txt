I say I'll move the mountains  
And I'll move the mountains  
If she wants them out of the way  
Crazy she calls me  
Sure, I'm crazy  
Crazy in love, I say  
  
I say I'll go through fire  
And I'll go through fire  
As she wants it, so it will be  
Crazy she calls me  
Sure, I'm crazy  
Crazy in love, you see  
  
Like the wind that shakes the bough  
She moves me with a smile  
The difficult I'll do right now  
The impossible will take a little while  
I say I'll care forever  
And I mean forever  
If I have to hold up the sky  
Crazy she calls me  
Sure, I'm crazy  
Crazy in love am I  
  
Like the wind that shakes the bough  
She moves me with a smile  
The difficult I'll do right now  
The impossible will take a little while  
  
I say I'll care forever  
And I mean forever  
If I have to hold up the sky  
Crazy she calls me  
  
Sure, I'm crazy  
Crazy in love am I  
Crazy in love
