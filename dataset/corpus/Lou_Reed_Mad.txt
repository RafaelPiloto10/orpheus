Mad, you just make me mad  
I hate your silent breathing in the night  
Sad, you make me sad  
When I juxtapose your features, I get sad  
I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed  
But I was so tired, I was so tired  
Who would think you'd find a bobby pin?  
It just makes me mad, makes me mad  
It just makes me, makes me  
Mad  
Glad, when I'm gone you're glad  
That overwhelming tension dissipates  
Oh, Tad, you think I'm a baby  
Nobody likes to hear  
Why don't you grow up at dawn  
I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed  
But I was so tired, so tired  
Who would think you'd find a bobby pin?  
It makes me mad, makes me mad  
Don't you know it just makes me  
Mad  
It just makes me mad  
Dumb, you're dumb as my thumb  
In the wistful morning, you throw a coffee cup at my head  
Scum, you said I'm scum  
What a very lovely, feminine thing to do  
Bark, why don't you just bark?  
Sit, come, stay are the perfect words meant for you  
Ah, ass, you says I'm an ass  
You better call 911 'cause I'm gonna hold you tight  
I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed  
But I was so tired, so tired  
You said you're out of town for the night  
And I believed in you, I believed you  
And I was so tired  
It makes me so mad  
It makes me so  
Mad  
It makes me so mad  
It just makes me mad  
It makes me mad  
It makes me mad  
It makes me mad  
It makes me mad  
It makes me mad, ah  
Dumb
