(Jimmy Buffett)  
  
Here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are  
  
Who would have thought this game, this flame would still be burning  
Who would have guessed that all these blenders would still be churning  
Not even we on our bended knees could have ever blessed it  
Not even I with my head in the sky could have ever guessed it  
  
But here we are, for a family reunion, costume barbeque  
All the black sheep, family outcasts, and a freak or two  
  
No the hat tricks and the gold bricks still don't have us down  
Still a party, we are the hearty when we come to town  
You're still grinning and we're still winning, nothing left to say  
I'm still gliding as I go flying down this endless wave  
  
And here we are, we're the offbeat Uncle Freds who spill their wine on you  
And the in-your-face Aunt Rachels with an attitude  
All the ones that use your bathroom then eat all your food  
We're the dreamy Deadheads who just like us and Dave Matthews  
  
Here we are, maybe it's because in spite of all the work we do  
It's the child in us we really value  
Here we are, with our fins up and our feathers flashing  
Here we are, with our coconut shell brassieres chanting  
  
Here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are
