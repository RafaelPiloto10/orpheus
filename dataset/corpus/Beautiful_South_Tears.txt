Tears have rolled down many good cheek  
So when it comes down to your turn  
Don't be afraid of admitting you're weak  
Cause these are tears that you earn  
  
Strangers, new neighbours, they'll both understand  
Who hasn't been there? Hold up your hand  
Strangers, neighbours, none of them planned  
Tears are the wage of this land  
  
When raindrop first fell to the ground  
It seemed like the brightest idea  
Even though teardrops were already around  
No one yet linked them with tear  
  
Raindrop you notice when stood under trees  
Pin-drop you can hear if down on your knees  
But if teardrop anyone sees  
It's time, gentlemen please  
  
Scars you know take longer to heal  
Whilst tears you'll not see again  
So which do we try so hard to conceal  
The ones that make fools of us men  
Bricklayer, teacher, firefighter or vet  
One thing in common, the hankies they've wet  
But hidden away in the bedroom I bet  
Tears in public, not yet  
Drums have rolled for hundreds of years  
Since we've blown one another to bits  
Generals and soldiers still holding their ears  
Cause drumbeat and teardrop don't mix  
  
When teardrops fall everyone in the band  
Makes out their music's slipped from the stand  
Leaving the singer, his head in his hands  
Public emotion, be damned
