There's a light, a different kind of light  
When we close, we close our eyes  
There's a place, a distant kind of place  
We can't let go, just can't let go  
  
There's a faith, a stronger kind of faith  
It makes you try, just a little harder  
There's a time, a lonely kind of time  
When you know, you simply know  
  
That you just can't fake it  
  
A mother's son knows he never walks alone  
No matter what he's become  
Hard as he tries, he can never give it back  
Life's too short, for a mother's son  
  
There's a rage, a silent kind of rage  
It makes you live out on the edge  
There's a pain, a different kind of pain  
Knowing time will change everything  
  
You just can't fake it  
  
A mother's son knows he never walks alone  
No matter what he's become  
Hard as he tries, he can never give it back  
Life's too short for a mother's son  
  
You just can't fake it  
  
A mother's son knows he never walks alone  
No matter what he's become  
Hard as he tries, he can never give it back  
Life's too short for a mother's son  
  
There's a light, a different kind of light
