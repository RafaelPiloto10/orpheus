Riding up the alley in the rain  
No lights to show the way  
How could this ever be their home  
Through the darkness You could only see  
A giant shadow which was to be  
A house where evil ruled at night  
And the shadows at the gate, they seemed to be alive  
Yeah the shadows at the gate, Alive  
Everything inside was left untouched  
Except for what the rats had got  
And the dust of time that showed its mark  
Armed with candlelight and open eyes  
Through the dark they fought their way  
'Til every room was lit again...Again  
And the house began to breathe, it seemed to be alive  
Yeah the house began to breathe, Alive  
  
As the candlelight began to fade  
And Jonathan said "Let's go to bed"  
The fireplace had ceased to burn...Burn  
Both were fast asleep before the dawn, Dreaming, dreaming  
And they did not know about the shadow  
Yeah the shadow on the wall, it really came alive  
Yeah the shadow on the wall, Sunrise!
