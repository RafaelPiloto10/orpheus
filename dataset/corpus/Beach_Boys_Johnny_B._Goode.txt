He came from Louisiana, close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods up near the evergreens  
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood  
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode  
He never ever learned to read or write so well  
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell  
Go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Johnny B. Goode  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunney sack  
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad tracks  
Engineers would see him sittin' in the shade  
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made  
And people passing by would stop and say  
My my but that little country boy can play  
Go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Johnny B. Goode
