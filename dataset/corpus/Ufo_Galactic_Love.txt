Take away your daughters, don't stand in front of me  
Take away your young boys, I know where I'm supposed to be  
Don't ask me to tell you about galactic love  
I'm only your cosmic father, banished from above  
I was having pipe dreams about congregation scenes  
When I'm asked the minister beamed in on me  
Don't ask me to tell you about galactic love  
I'm only your cosmic father, banished from above  
Take away your daughters, don't stand in front of me  
Take away your young boys, I don't know how I'm supposed to be  
Don't ask me to tell you about galactic love  
I'm only a cosmic father, banished from above
