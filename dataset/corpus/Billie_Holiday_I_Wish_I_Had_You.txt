Joys that come to others  
Seldom come to me  
But if I only were Aladdin  
How different things would be  
Every time I wish  
I wish I had you  
Every time I dream  
The dream is for two  
You're the part within my heart  
That beats all day  
Seems to say, "I love you"  
  
Everywhere I go  
You're all that I see  
Wonder if you know  
What you mean to me  
Wishes would be grand  
If only they came true  
For every time I wish  
I wish I had you
