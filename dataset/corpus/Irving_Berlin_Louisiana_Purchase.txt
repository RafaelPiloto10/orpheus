Louisiana purchase, I'll tell you what it means  
It means I'd like to sell you New Orleans  
Come on, come on  
And you all can go to town way down in New Orleans  
Louisiana salesman with nothing in his jeans  
That's why I'd like to sell you New Orleans  
Come on, come on  
And do all the things there are to do in New Orleans  
Where does that heat come from?  
That rhythmic beat come from?  
And that red meat come from?  
New Orleans  
Louisiana purchase, I told you what it means  
So won't you let me sell you New Orleans?  
Come on, come on  
And you all can go to town way down in New Orleans
