She stands before you naked  
You can see it, you can taste it,  
And she comes to you light as the breeze.  
Now you can drink it or you can nurse it,  
It don't matter how you worship  
As long as you're  
Down on your knees.  
So I knelt there at the delta,  
At the alpha and the omega,  
At the cradle of the river and the seas.  
And like a blessing come from heaven  
For something like a second  
I was healed and my heart  
Was at ease.  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen,  
Oh something like this.  
  
And you're weak and you're harmless  
And you're sleeping in your harness  
And the wind going wild  
In the trees,  
And it ain't exactly prison  
But you'll never be forgiven  
For whatever you've done  
With the keys.  
  
O baby I waited  
  
It's dark now and it's snowing  
O my love I must be going,  
The river has started to freeze.  
And I'm sick of pretending  
I'm broken from bending  
I've lived too long on my knees.  
  
Then she dances so graceful  
And your heart's hard and hateful  
And she's naked  
But that's just a tease.  
And you turn in disgust  
From your hatred and from your love  
And comes to you  
Light as the breeze.  
  
O baby I waited  
  
There's blood on every bracelet  
You can see it, you can taste it,  
And it's please baby  
Please baby please.  
And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim  
But don't forget there's still a woman  
Beneath this  
Resplendent chemise.  
  
So I knelt there at the delta,  
At the alpha and the omega,  
I knelt there like one who believes.  
And the blessings come from heaven  
And for something like a second  
I'm cured and my heart  
Is at ease
