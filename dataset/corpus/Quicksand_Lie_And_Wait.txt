Inequity solace, in your driven sate  
Seize your right to earn the same  
She wants it  
How long must we wait  
  
Before they take our side?  
Sordid practice, engine overheated  
There's no way to cool  
Turned up on your side  
  
The one that you choose  
Why should they mind  
Scared of what your thinking?  
A strong resistant  
  
Sunday feeling, under weight  
Of what's to come  
Tired of living under thumb  
She wonders, why did you say what you said.  
  
Silently living is death.  
Shout him down, it's worth it,  
No compromises on this.  
Turned up on your side,  
  
The one that you choose.  
Why should they mind,  
Scared of what your thinking.  
Scared of what your thinking.  
  
She wonders,  
How long, have we been senseless.  
So tired and pensive.  
Instead of stand up,  
  
Stand to the side.  
Feel a strong resistant.
