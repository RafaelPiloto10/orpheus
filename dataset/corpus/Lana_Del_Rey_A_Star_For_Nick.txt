You know it  
And I know it  
Gonna be a star  
You won't, you won't  
Get me very far.  
Don't say hello, it's already time to go.  
  
Oh, the wind is carrying me home, me home, me home again.  
  
You know it  
And I know it  
Gonna be a star  
You won't, you won't  
Get me very far.  
You saw life  
Back in the countryside, a-a-a-a-ah.  
  
Oh, my soul, rise up and go  
Beyond, beyond  
To what you know
