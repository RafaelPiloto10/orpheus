How we do  
Yo  
All of my rhymes fall all of my days I trade  
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade  
Killing late nights cruisin'  
All you see is the break lights  
And hair blowing you know where we going  
Or at the club in the rear frontin'  
Poppin droppin'  
The amounts of cats but we aint trying to hear nothing  
Probably was wilder than wobbly are you the wiggy to give me  
Hold me down and make me slow down to be twissy  
Keep the ice out the club life - change face  
Get on love wife while he on the license plates  
Wait - make me think about you even when your not around  
Use the bathroom put the toilet seat back down  
Got me some sprinkles the hair with the wrinkles  
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles  
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways  
Jigga keep me jiggy all of my days  
  
(Changing faces)  
In the middle of the night  
Got me thinkin' bout cha babe  
Got me dreamin' about cha baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
All that I have  
All that I have  
Baby it's yours  
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby  
All I want is to be with you all of my days  
All I want all I need  
All I want is to be with you all of my days  
All I want baby  
  
(Changing faces)  
Anything that turn you on  
I'll be givin' it to you babe  
You don't have to worry baby  
  
(Chorus 1x)  
  
(Jay Z)  
Yeah ha ha - check it

All I want - all I need  
Is you in my life - loving me  
All I want - all I need  
Is you in my life  
  
(Jay Z)  
Uh huh

Loving me  
  
(Jay Z)  
Now we going house shoppin'  
Everybody want to know the prices of spouse droppin'  
Keep it on the low are Kelly style it's quite shockin'  
A year ago all I did was spend nights hoppin'  
In the club in search of pretty faces and night stalkers  
Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle  
Rice droppin' got you a nice rock and...  
Now it's on and poppin' droppin' holiday platinum bracelets  
Jigga - are Kelly - Changing Faces  
Uh  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
  
(Fade away
