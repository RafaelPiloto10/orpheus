I ain't got a nickel to call mine  
The government has made me pay my tax on time  
They've taken all my bread and left me here for dead  
I ain't even got a lousy dime  
  
Who the hell wants money  
When there ain't none to be had  
It don't make the good times better  
It don't make the bad times bad  
  
Well, you find out who your friends are  
When you ain't got a dime  
Just trying to make the best of these hard times  
  
I've got fifteen cars and I can't afford the gas  
We've got a horse but how long can she last  
My managers enraged, my banker stands there days  
Funny how the money goes so fast  
  
Who the hell wants money  
When there ain't none to be had  
It don't make the good times better  
It don't make the bad times bad  
  
Well, you find out who your friends are  
When you ain't got a dime  
Just trying to make the best of these hard times  
  
We are broke but we've been broke before  
But being broke don't scare us anymore  
My daddy's broke and grandpa too  
But I'm still here to sing for you  
We are going to make it through for sure  
  
Well, you find out who your friends are  
When you ain't got a dime  
Just trying to make the best of these hard times
