Hope climbs atop of the piano  
Reaching out towards the warmth of the sun  
Some man tries to ask her down  
But now maybe that's where she belongs  
My God she said,  
I'm the sunflower who wants  
My god he said,  
This woman is gone  
Into the dark  
Is there anybody there  
My god she said  
He climbed up top to find that she was slipping  
Let her go, let her go, let me go  
How long must we leave before we're winning  
They don't know, they don't know they just don't know  
If she can't be there I know it's best that  
Nothing is denied  
If she can't be there it's best that  
Everyone change sides
