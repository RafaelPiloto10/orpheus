I think I know the way, the story's gonna end  
It's getting to the part I hate, when heartache close in.  
The stage is set, it's time for me to leave  
Cause I don't want to see the final scene.  
  
Fade to blue  
We didn't make it through  
Let the curtain fall  
And fade to blue  
  
We played the part of lovers  
Knew every line by heart  
But sometimes love just can't erase  
What's written in the stars  
So before the bitter words come crashing down  
Let's leave what's left, and the lights go out  
  
And fade to blue  
We didn't make it through  
There won't be a curtain call  
Just fade to blue  
  
Almost happy endings have no way of coming true  
Once the feelings starts to fade to blue  
We didn't make it through  
So let the curtain fall  
Just fade to blue  
And fade to blue
