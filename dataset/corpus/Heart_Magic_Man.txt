Cold, late night so long ago  
When I was not so strong you know  
A pretty man came to me  
I never seen eyes so blue  
You know, I could not run away it seemed  
We'd seen each other in a dream  
Seemed like he knew me, he looked right through me, yeah  
  
"Come on home, girl" he said with a smile  
"you don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile  
But try to understand, try to understand  
Try, try, try to understand, I'm a magic man"  
  
Winter nights we sang in tune  
Played inside the months of moon  
"Never think of never..let this spell last forever"  
Well, summer lover passed to fall  
Tried to realize it all  
Mama says she's worried, growing up in a hurry  
  
"Come on home, girl" Mama cried on the phone  
"Too soon to lose my baby yet, my girl should be at home"  
But try to understand, try to understand  
Try, try, try to understand, he's a magic man, Mama, ah  
He's a magic man  
  
"Come on home, girl" he said with a smile  
"I cast my spell of love on you, a woman from a child"  
But try to understand, try to understand  
Oh, oh, try, try, try to understand,  
He's a magic man, oh, he's got the magic hands  
  
Oh's over top  
  
"Come on home, girl" he said with a smile  
"You don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile"  
But try to understand, try to understand  
Try, try, try to understand, he's a magic man, yeah, oh
