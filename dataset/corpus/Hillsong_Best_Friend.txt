Have you heard of the one called Savior?  
Have you of His perfect love,  
Have you heard of the one in heaven,  
Have you heard how He gave His son'  
Cause I found this love,  
I believe in the Son. Show me Your way.  
  
I believe in the One called Savior,  
I believe He's the risen One,  
I believe I'll live forever,  
I believe that my king will come,  
Cause I found this love,  
I believe in the Son. Show me Your way.  
  
Chorus:  
Jesus, you are my best friend,  
And you will always be,  
And nothing will ever change that,  
Jesus, you are my best friend,  
And you will always be,  
And nothing will ever change that.  
  
Bridge:  
Nothing will ever change that,  
Nothing will ever change that,  
Nothing will ever change that,  
Nothing will ever change that.
