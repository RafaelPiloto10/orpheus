Every day I see him coming  
Every day he walks on by  
Life used to be so plain and simple  
Before he came into my life  
  
Every night I keep on dreaming  
Every night I take him home  
We always go to bed together  
I always wake up all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh it's strange, so strange  
What he's doing to me  
Oh it's strange so strange  
Did this ever happen to you  
The way it has happened to me  
The way it just happened to me  
  
Every day outside my window  
Always minutes close to eight  
I wish he stayed a little longer  
But his bus is never late  
  
Every night we're dancing slowly  
I play the music he adores  
Like Sinatra then we're talking  
All important things for sure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh it's strange so strange  
What he's doing to me  
Oh so strange real strange  
Did this ever happen to you  
The way it has happened to me  
The way it just happened to me
