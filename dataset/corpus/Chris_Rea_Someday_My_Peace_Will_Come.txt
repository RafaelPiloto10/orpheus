Someday  
My peace will come  
Oh I know  
My peace will come  
  
I will sleep like a child without pain  
Without fear  
Like a smile in the afternoon sun  
Oh someday  
  
My peace will come  
Lord can you hear me  
Oh I know you know my name  
It's written in the tears  
That flow from my pain  
  
Broken hearted broken soul  
All my life on the run  
But someday  
Yeah someday  
  
My peace will come  
Someday  
My peace will come
