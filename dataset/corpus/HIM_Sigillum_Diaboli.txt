Sigillum Diaboli  
I can't see as I'm facing your pitiful lies  
Don't have the strength to carry your heavy load of life  
I'm your Christ and I want you  
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do  
  
Oh  
I can't see through your eyes, bring your tears on me  
I will lift the burden from your shoulders just to have killing  
I'm your Christ and I want you  
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do  
  
Oh as well as I do  
Oh as well as I do  
Just as well as I do  
Oh as well as I do  
Oh as well as I do  
  
So I'm your Christ to and I want you  
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do  
So I'm your Christ and I want you  
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do  
  
Oh, so you've come from above  
And you say you want it all  
And I cut myself for your love  
I'm killing myself for you, yes you  
  
I can't see as I'm facing your pityful lies  
Don't have the strength to carry your heavy load of life  
I'm your Christ and I want you  
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do  
I'm your Christ and I want you  
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do  
  
Yes you do  
Yes you do, my Darling  
Yes you do, oh  
Yes you do, oh my Love  
So
