Me, myself and I  
Are all in love with you  
We all think you're wonderful  
We do  
  
Me, myself and I  
Have just one point of view  
We're convinced  
There's no one else like you  
It can't be denied dear  
You brought the sun to us  
We'd be satisfied dear  
If you, you'd belong to one of us  
  
So if you pass me by  
Three hearts will break in two  
Cause me, myself and I  
Are all in love with you  
  
Me, myself and I  
Are all in love with you  
We all think you're wonderful  
We do  
  
Me, myself and I  
Have just one point of view  
We're convinced  
There's no one else like you  
  
It can't be denied dear  
You brought the sun to us  
We'd be satisfied dear  
If you'd belong to one of us  
  
So if you pass me by  
Three hearts will break in two  
Cause me, myself and I  
Are all in love with you
