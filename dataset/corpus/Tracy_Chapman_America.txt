You were lost and got lucky  
Came upon the shore  
Found you were conquering America  
You spoke of peace  
But waged a war  
While you were conquering America  
  
There was land to take  
And people to kill  
While you were conquering America  
You served yourself  
Did God's will  
While you were conquering America  
  
The ghost of Columbus haunts this world  
'Cause you're still conquering America  
The meek won't survive  
Or inherit the earth  
Cause you're still conquering America  
  
America [Repeat: x3]  
  
You found bodies to serve  
Submit and degrade  
While you were conquering America  
Made us soldiers and junkies  
Prisoners and slaves  
While you were conquering America  
  
America [Repeat: x3]  
  
You hands are at my throat  
My back's against the wall  
Because you're still conquering America  
We're sick and tired hungry and poor  
Cause you're still conquering America  
  
You bomb the very ground  
That feeds your own babies  
You're still conquering America  
Your sons and your daughters  
May never sing your praises  
While you're conquering America  
  
America [Repeat: x3]  
  
I see you eyes seek a distant shore  
While you're conquering America  
Taking rockets to the moon  
Trying to find a new world  
And you're still conquering America  
  
America [Repeat: x3]  
  
The ghost of Columbus haunts this world  
Cause you're still conquering America  
You're still conquering America  
You're still conquering America
