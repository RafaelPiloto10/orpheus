There was a young girl  
Ridin' on the wind  
She had all of the answers  
Didn't need to pretend  
I remember she was the only friend I ever needed  
  
Now I wonder  
How to work it all out  
My hands are tremblin'  
I've got this feelin' now  
  
There's a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
That's been there from the start  
Don't tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
'Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus]  
Could this be love  
That I hear calling  
Could this be love  
That I hear calling  
  
Got a fast education  
Holding you in tears  
Someone finally hurt you  
After all these years  
Got to get my message to you somehow  
  
Now you're lookin' in my eyes for courage  
Too late to think this through  
Baby  
There must be somethinbg we can do  
  
There's a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
That's been there from the start  
Don't tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
'Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
That's been there from the start  
Don't tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
'Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus]
