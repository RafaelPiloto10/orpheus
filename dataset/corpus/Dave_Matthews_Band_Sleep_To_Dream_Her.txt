I know I'll miss her later  
Wish I could bend my love to hate her  
Wish I could be her creator  
To twist her arms now  
  
She stares up at the stars when  
The stars fell from her hair then  
I bent down to collect them  
And then she was gone  
  
Oh, I sleep just to dream her  
I beg the night just to see her  
That my only love should be her  
Just to lie in her arms  
  
Oh, I came there to find out  
Find out she'd made up her mind, oh  
My arms are all tied up  
To me she was blind  
  
This space between us  
Where wingless dreams fall earless  
Will you not bear me witness  
With your back to me now  
  
It seemed so unnerving  
Still somehow deserving  
That she could hold my heart so tightly  
And still not see me here, oh  
  
Oh, I sleep just to dream her  
Beg the night just to see her  
That my only love should be her  
Just to lie in her arms  
  
I know I'll miss her later  
Wish I could bend my love to hate her  
Wish I could be her creator  
To be the light in her eyes
