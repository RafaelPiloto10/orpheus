When I wake up in the mornin' light  
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on  
  
It's the weekend, and I know that you're free  
So pull on your jeans and come on out with me  
Oh 'cause I need to have you near me,  
I need to feel you close to me  
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me  
  
You and me, we'll go motorbike ridin' in the sun  
And the wind and the rain  
I got money in my pocket, I got a tiger in my tank  
And I'm king of the road again  
  
I'll meet ya in the usual place  
You don't need a thing except your pretty face, alright  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on  
Aw, here we go mama  
  
You and me, we'll go motorbike ridin' in the sun  
And the wind and the rain  
I got money in my pocket, I got a tiger in my tank  
And I'm king of the road again  
  
When I wake up in the mornin' light  
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right  
Hey I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on  
  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on [Repeat: x3]
