Only came outside to watch the nightfall with the rain  
I heard you making patterns rhyme like  
Some new romantic looking for the TV sound  
You'll see I'm right some other time look now  
  
Look all around, there's not sign of life  
Voices, another sound  
Can you hear me now?  
  
This is Planet Earth, you're looking at Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This is Planet Earth  
My head is stuck on something precious let me know  
If you're coming down to land is there  
Anybody out there trying to get through?  
My eyes are so cloudy I can't see you  
  
Look now, look all around, there's no sign of  
Life voices, another sound  
Can you hear me now?  
  
This is Planet Earth  
You're looking at Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This is Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This calling Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This looking at Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This is Planet Earth
