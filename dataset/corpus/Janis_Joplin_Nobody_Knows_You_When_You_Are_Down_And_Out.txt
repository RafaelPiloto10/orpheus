Well, once I lived the life of a millionaire, spending my money, no, I didn't
care  
Takin' my friend John out for a mighty good time  
Buyin' high-priced liquor, champagne and wine  
  
Then I began to fall so low, didn't have a friend, nor no place to go  
If I get my hands on a dollar again  
I'm goin' to hold on to it until the eagle grins  
  
Soon as I get back up on my feet again, everybody wants to be my long-lost
friend  
It's might strange, without a doubt  
Nobody wants you when you're down and out  
  
Lord, soon as I get up on my feet again, everybody wants to be my long-lost
friend  
It's mighty strange, without a doubt  
Nobody wants you when you're down and out  
That's what I mean, when you're down and out
