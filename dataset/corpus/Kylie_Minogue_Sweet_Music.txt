New sensation  
New sensation  
Check out this groove and you're  
Walkin' on air  
Going into a new  
Dimension, yeah  
So put your vibes on my beat  
And we'll lay it down like that  
Slap the hi-hat in  
Put the fair light on the track  
  
And we can go  
Crazy like that  
Feelin' like that  
Movin' like that  
Drop it like that  
Rockin' the track  
I'm lookin for that new sensation  
  
I think we're on to somethin'  
You're taste it mirrors mine  
So high I'm in the moment  
Let's make this demo right  
I might just lose it  
  
When we make sweet music  
No feather beds, no exotic affair, yea  
Got samples and scratches  
Let's do it, right here  
Boys and girls  
A different kind of sound  
  
'Cause every heartbeat babe  
Is the soundtrack to your life, oh  
And every man out there must be sent  
  
To get me high  
And we can go  
Crazy like that  
Feelin' like that  
Movin' like that  
Drop it like that  
Rockin' the track  
I'm lookin' for that new sensation  
  
I think we're on to somethin'  
You're taste it mirrors mine  
So high I'm in the moment
