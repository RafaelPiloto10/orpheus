I know how it feels to be on your own  
In this cruel world where hearts are bound to turn to stone  
Where you are alone and tired of breathing  
It's all going wrong and you just can't stand the pain anymore  
You're too numb to believe in anything  
  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Darling don't let me down  
  
I know how easy it is to let go  
Surrender to despair lurking at your door  
To lose your soul and all your feelings  
Strength all gone  
And so many things left unsaid and deeds undone  
You've stopped caring  
Cause it's all in vain  
  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Darling don't let me down  
  
You're so alone and tired of breathing  
It's all gone wrong and you just can't stand the pain  
  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Darling don't let me down  
Don't let me down  
Don't let me down  
Just don't let me down
