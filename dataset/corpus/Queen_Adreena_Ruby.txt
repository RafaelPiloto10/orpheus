Kill or be killed  
I applaud it  
Get away from me if you don't want it  
  
Who could blame me?  
Well you could maybe  
  
I'm still in love with you and I'm black and blue  
  
Naked Ruby cried  
He fell onto the knife  
Naked Ruby cried  
He fell onto the knife  
  
The hangman's daughter  
Stockholm syndrome  
Cut right through him  
Let the light in  
  
Kill or be killed  
I applaud it  
So get away from me if you don't want it  
  
Naked Ruby cried  
He fell onto the knife  
Naked Ruby cried  
He fell onto the knife  
  
Your schizophrenia  
A broken light bulb  
Must let the light in  
Get the truth told  
  
Who could blame me?  
You could maybe  
  
I'm still in love with you and I'm black and blue  
  
Naked Ruby cried  
He fell onto the knife  
Naked Ruby cried  
He fell onto the knife
