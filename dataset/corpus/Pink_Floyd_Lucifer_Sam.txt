Lucifer Sam, Siam cat.  
Always sitting by your side  
Always by your side.  
That cat's something I can't explain.  
  
Ginger the gentle you're the witch.  
You're the left side  
He's the right side.  
Oh, no!  
That cat's something I can't explain.  
  
Lucifer go to sea.  
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat.  
Somewhere, anywhere.  
That cat's something I can't explain.  
  
At night prowling sifting sand.  
Hiding around on the ground.  
He'll be found when you're around.  
That cat's something I can't explain.
