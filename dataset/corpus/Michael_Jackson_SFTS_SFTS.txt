Never had a gift for beein' so sure  
Oh no no  
Never thought I've see you walkin' that door  
Oh na-yeah  
I can make you feel you're the queen  
No remedy, no compromise  
Oh  
Would you rather be right here with me  
I want you right here next to me  
  
Do you relly wanna stay?  
I can take ya slow  
Do you wanna walk away?  
Let it go  
Girl, I'm believing you're the ready just to say goodbye  
I'll be standing in the rain case you change your mind  
  
Do you relly wanna stay?  
I can take ya slow  
Do you really wanna go?
