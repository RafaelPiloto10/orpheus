Talk it over  
Talk it over  
You seem to think  
That everything is more important than me, baby  
As if to think  
My world would be lonely without you on the scene  
Oh, it's about time  
I moved up the ladder  
Got to be number one  
Or nothin' at all  
Let's sit down, talk it over  
Take that finger from your face  
Look at me for goodness sake  
Talk it over, hey  
Talk about it  
I do everything I can  
To make life easy for you, baby  
But you take me for granted  
What is our love, our love comin' to? Oh  
It's about time for us to have a talk  
And maybe I'm not satisfyin' you, boy  
You gotta tell me 'cause this ain't right  
Why ain't you, oh, be holding me tight?  
Let's sit down, talk it over  
Take that finger from your face  
Look at me for goodness sake  
Talk it over  
Talk about it, baby  
(Talk it over)  
I said let's talk about it, baby  
(Talk it over)  
Ooh, talk about it, baby  
(Talk it over)  
Let's talk it over, yeah  
(Talk, talk, talk)  
Hey, talk it over  
(Let's talk it over)  
Hey, baby come on over here  
(Talk, talk, talk)  
Talk it over with me, baby, yeah  
(Let's talk it over)  
Hey, talk it over, baby  
(Talk, talk, talk)  
Talk, talk, talk, talk it over  
(Let's talk it over)  
Talk, talk, talk it over with me  
(Talk, talk, talk)  
Hey, talk it over  
(Let's talk it over)
