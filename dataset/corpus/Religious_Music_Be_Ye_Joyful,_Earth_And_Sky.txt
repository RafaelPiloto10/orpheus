Be ye joyful, earth and sky,  
Hallelujah!  
Unto us God's Son came nigh,  
Hallelujah!  
  
Refrain:  
He for our salvation  
Left God's habitation,  
Yes, He left God's habitation.  
  
Here the fairest Rose we see,  
Hallelujah!  
Blooming forth from Jesse's tree,  
Hallelujah!  
  
Refrain:  
He for our salvation  
Left God's habitation,  
Yes, He left God's habitation.  
  
He, the great incarnate Word,  
Hallelujah!  
Jesus Christ doth help afford,  
Hallelujah!  
  
Refrain:  
He for our salvation  
Left God's habitation,  
Yes, He left God's habitation...
