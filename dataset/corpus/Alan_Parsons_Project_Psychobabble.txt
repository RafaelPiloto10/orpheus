Tell you 'bout a dream that I have every night  
Tell you 'bout a Dream that I have every night  
It ain't kodachrome and it isn't black and white  
Take me for a fool if you feel that's right  
Well I'm Never on my own but there's nobody in sight  
  
I don't know if I'm scared of the Lightning  
Trying to reach me  
I can't turn to the left or the right  
I'm too scared to run and I'm too weak to fight  
But I don't Care it's all psychobabble rap to me  
  
Tell you 'bout a dream that I have every night  
It's in dolby stereo but I never hear it right  
Take me for a fool well that's alright  
Well I see the way to go But there isn't any light  
  
I don't know why I'm scared of the lightning  
Trying to reach me  
Help me to find what I don't want to know  
You're taking me There but I don't want to go  
I don't care it's all Psychobabble rap to me  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
I don't care it's all psychobabble rap to me  
  
You're readin' my mind you won't look in my eyes  
You say I do things that I don't Realise  
But I don't care it's all psychobabble rap to me  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
You're lighting a scene that's faded to black  
I threw it away cause I don't want it back  
But I don't care it's all psychbabble rap
