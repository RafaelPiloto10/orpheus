Sweet Disposition,  
Never Too Soon,  
Oh, Reckless, Abandon.  
  
Like No One's Watching You  
No One.  
  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud,  
A kiss, a cry  
Our rights, our wrongs,  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
  
So stay there,  
Because I'll be coming over.  
And while our blood's still young  
It's so young  
It runs  
And we won't stop until it's over.  
Won't stop to surrender.  
  
Songs of desperation  
I played them for you  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud,  
A kiss, a cry  
Our rights, our wrongs,  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
  
So stay there,  
Because I'll be coming over.  
And while our blood's still young  
It's so young  
It runs  
And we won't stop until it's over.  
Won't stop to surrender.
