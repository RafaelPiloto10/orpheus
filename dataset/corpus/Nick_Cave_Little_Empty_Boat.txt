You found me at some party,  
You thought I'd understand,  
You barreled over to me,  
With a drink in each hand.  
I respect your beliefs girl  
And I consider you a friend,  
But I've already been born once,  
I don't want to be born again.  
Your knowledge is impressive  
And your argument is good,  
But I am the resurrection babe  
And your standin' on my foot  
  
[Chorus]  
But my little boat is empty,  
It don't go  
And my oar is broken,  
It don't row row row,  
My little boat is empty,  
It don't go,  
And my oar is broken,  
It don't row row row  
  
Your tiny little face  
Keeps yappin' in the gloom  
Seven steps behind me  
With your dust-pan and broom.  
I can't help but imagine you  
All postured and prone,  
But there's a little guy on my shoulder  
Says I should go home alone  
But you keep leaning in on me  
And you're lookin' pretty pissed  
That grave you've dug between  
Your legs is hard to resist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give to God what belongs to God  
And give the rest to me,  
Tell our gracious host to fuck himself,  
It's time for us to leave  
  
[Chorus]
