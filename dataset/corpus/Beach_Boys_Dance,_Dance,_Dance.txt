After six hours of school I've had enough for the day  
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way  
  
I gotta dance (dance dance dance now the beat's really hot) right on the spot  
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot)  
The beat's really hot  
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)  
Dance (dance) dance (dance) dance (dance) yeah!  
  
When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick  
With my chick by my side the radio does the trick  
  
I gotta dance (dance dance dance now the beat's really hot) right on the spot  
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot)  
The beat's really hot  
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)  
Dance (dance) dance (dance) dance (dance) yeah!  
Oh man!  
  
At a weekend dance we like to show up last  
I play it cool when it's slow and jump in when it's fast  
  
I gotta dance (dance dance dance now the beat's really hot) right on the spot  
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot)  
The beat's really hot  
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)  
Dance (dance) dance (dance) dance (dance) yeah!  
  
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)  
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot)  
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)  
Dance (dance) dance (dance) dance (dance) yeah!  
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)  
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot)  
(Dance dance dance...)
