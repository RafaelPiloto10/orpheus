Some people tell you  
They're trapped in the distance  
And can't get what  
They want most.  
They throw a wall  
And then call for assistance  
And make no attempt to get close.  
Oh, I think you should know  
You've got to go slow  
Below the surface  
And easy through the waves.  
Slow below the surface  
And easy through the waves.  
You're running so fast  
That you can't find the past  
And your future is wearing thin  
Come from behind  
It's a matter of time  
'Til you see where you've always been  
Oh, I think you should know  
You've got to go slow  
Below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
Slow below the surface  
And easy through the waves.  
Some people tell you they're in trapped in the distance  
And can't get what they want most  
They throw up a wall and then  
Call for assistance  
And make no attempt to get close.  
Oh, I think you should know  
You've got to go slow  
Below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
Slow below the surface  
And easy through the waves.  
You know that your  
Life must have a purpose  
You better make a stand  
While you still can.
