I was there on the day the monkey came into this world  
His face was round and reddish and his hair was slightly curled  
He didn't look too different from the others I had seen  
Who'd-a-thought he was the answer to the nation's dream?  
At first he didn't seem to be intelligent at all  
Each time he'd start to walk about he'd stumble and he'd fall  
My first impression was to be a most mistaken thought  
Lord a'mighty, what's this little hairy monkey wrought?  
Because I witnessed his departure from his mother's womb  
I felt inclined to check his progress every afternoon  
One day the keeper of the zoo called in the live TV  
Frankly said, "I think you'll be amazed at what you see"  
The monkey walked and talked and waved his arms about his head  
In the corner was the stack of books that he had read  
"An Educated Monkey!", said the papers 'cross the land  
It was more than weary sociologists could stand  
Oh, his fame was universal, he was on the Carson show  
People talked about him kindly everywhere he'd go  
His insight was amazing, his philosophy was fair  
He became a politician welcome everywhere  
His wit was not to be compared with any mind intact  
He'd lace a phrase with irony and blend it all with fact  
Conservatives applauded and the liberals were entranced  
The bigots and the integrationists were in his camp  
Nobody dared to meet him in an open press debate  
He was nominated by the folks from every state  
Yes, a monkey was the President, though maybe not the first  
And there was peace and harmony throughout the universe  
The dream I had last night has been related as it came  
As for interpretation, well, it's really very plain  
Would you rather have a monkey up in Washington, D.C.  
Or have those people making monkeys out of you and me?
