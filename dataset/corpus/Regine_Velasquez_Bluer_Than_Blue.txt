After you go, I can catch on my reading  
After you go, I have lot more time sleeping  
And when you go, it looks like thing's gonna be lot easier  
Life would be at ease you know  
I really should be glad.  
Chorus:  
But I'm bluer than blue  
Sadder than sad  
You're the only life this empty room has ever had  
Life without you is gonna be  
Bluer than blue..  
After you go, I have a lot more room in my closet  
After you go, I can stay out long if I feel like  
And when you go, I can run through half screaming  
And no one can ever hear me  
I really should be glad  
(Repeat Chorus)  
I don't have to miss no tv show  
I can start my whole life over  
Change the numbers on my telephone  
But the night will sure be colder.  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Bluer than blue  
Bluer than blue  
Bluer than blue..
