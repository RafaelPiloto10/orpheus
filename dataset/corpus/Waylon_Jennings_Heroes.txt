Son you make me feel so proud I pop the buttons off my shirt  
I know I said I'd take you to the lake today  
But I'm going to have to break those plans, and it really hurts  
Every time I go fishin' it'd always start me wishin'  
That I could be a child again  
Take my 50 cents and go down to the local picture show  
To watch my heroes rope and ride  
Most times they'd win but when they'd lose it always made me cry  
Ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die  
One by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all  
  
Well I guess the fish just ain't bitin' just as well I don't feel like
fightin'  
All in all it just ain't that great a fishin' day that old newspaper headline  
Kind of wrapped around this old heart of mine another big one got away  
And I can't count the times he's made me laugh  
But this time he's made me cry  
There ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die  
One by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all
