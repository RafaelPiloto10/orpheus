Back the fuck away from it and leave it where it lies  
How many stabbings can it take before it dies  
I got the message like a bullet to the head  
No wishful thinking now to help bring back the dead  
  
I never noticed as you turned into a ghost  
You couldn't help me when I needed you the most  
You made your choice, you would not change your course  
I got a lesson how to flog a dying horse  
  
On Easter I got a chocolate rabbit  
Biggest one I ever had  
You never know 'till you've bitten off their head  
If they're hollow and the chocolate's bad
