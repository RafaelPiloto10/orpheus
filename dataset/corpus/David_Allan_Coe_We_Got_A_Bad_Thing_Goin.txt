You got a one horse ranch in Texas you got a mansion in Spain  
You blew in on a Greyhound bus honey you flew in your own plane  
You got drunk on whiskey seen you get tipsy on wine  
We got a bad thing goin' it's just a bad thing goin'  
We got a bad thing goin' but don't it feel fine  
You sure are a high class lady you got a blue blood in your veins  
You're a rose in the bright sunshine I'm a cowboy in the rain  
We ain't got nothin' in common cept for a little time  
We got a bad thing goin'...  
You're a rodeo rattler and a midnight gambler you ain't never had a job  
And I just found out your daddy owns a bank I was fixin' to rob  
[ guitar ]  
You got a one horse ranch in Texas...  
Yeah we ain't got nothin' in common you know that girl you must have missed it  
Be like ridin' in them barrel races and like sailin' them boats
