Anything you can do  
I can do it better  
I'm the toughest  
(I'm the toughest)  
I can do what you can't do  
You'll never try to do what I do  
I'm the toughest  
(I'm the toughest)  
  
Stop from doing wrongs  
Change your foolish plans  
Stop from doing wrongs  
Live up like a man  
  
I'm the toughest  
(I'm the toughest)  
  
Now my little brothers  
You got to be good  
Do what's right  
Don't be bad-minded  
Take what's yours, and  
There'll be no fuss nor fight  
  
Anything you can do  
I can do better  
I'm the toughest  
(I'm the toughest)  
I can do what you can't do  
You'll never try to do what I do  
I'm the toughest  
(I'm the toughest)  
  
Stop from doing wrongs  
Change your foolish plans  
Stop from doing wrongs  
Just live up like a man  
I'm the toughest  
(I'm the toughest)  
  
Now my brothers  
You got to be good  
Just do what you know is right  
Don't be bad-minded  
Just take what's yours  
And there be no fuss nor fight  
  
Anything you can do  
I can do it better  
I'm the toughest  
(I'm the toughest)  
I can do what you can't do  
You'll never try to do what I do  
I'm the toughest  
(I'm the toughest)  
I'm the toughest  
I'm the toughest  
Anything you can do  
I can do better  
I'm the toughest  
I'm the toughest  
I'm the toughest  
I said I love my brother  
I said I love my sister
