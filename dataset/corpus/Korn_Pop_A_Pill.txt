Well look at this  
I see clearly now  
Look at this  
I can feel it now  
Happiness  
Is seldom found  
Pop the pill  
I'm so damn happy now  
  
Feeling things crawl on me  
I need my fix today  
This is way beyond me  
I can't live without you today  
  
Well look at this  
I see colors now  
Look at this  
I'm butt ugly now  
Happiness  
Is seldom found  
Pop the pill  
I'm so damn happy now  
  
Feeling things crawl on me  
I need my fix today  
This is way beyond me  
I can't live without you today  
You today, you today  
  
I don't give out anything around me  
Even all the love that surrounds me  
Make me, even me  
I don't give out anything  
I do this to shut off the voice  
Worthy, worthy, worthy  
I don't give out anything  
  
Feeling things crawl on me  
I need my fix today  
This is way beyond me  
I can't live without you today  
You today, you today, you today  
  
Feeling things crawl on me  
I need my fix today  
This is way beyond me  
I can't live without you today
