As you awoke this morning  
And opened up your eyes  
Did you notice the tear-stains  
Lining your face were mine  
  
Don't you wonder, can't you see  
What's happening to our lives  
I can't keep living this masquerade  
When my lonely eyes see only your face at night  
  
I only see in infrared  
I can't dream anymore  
can't you see I need, too  
I can't stand the pain  
  
Youve gathered all my secrets  
And I don't know who I am  
I even feel alone when you're near  
Cause you'll never understand  
  
When we first met I must have seemed  
A million miles away  
Its strange how our lives have touched  
But the time is right  
Ill leave tonight  
Don't look in my eyes  
Cause youve never seen them so black  
  
I only see in infrared  
I can't dream anymore  
can't you see I need to  
I can't stand the pain
