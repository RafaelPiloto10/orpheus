Man y'all play too much  
Now now Percival, don't fret  
We're here to help you  
I told you to bring good songs, what are you gonna do now?  
Look at the keys, well, you gotta do something  
Keep your eyes on the keys, here's looking at you kid  
Okay okay, well, make up something, yeah right  
You won't make sense, I don't know lets try it  
Here we go  
  
[Chorus]  
Makes no sense at all [Repeat: x4]  
  
ABC, 123, Do-re-mi, out of key  
(you got that right)  
Out of touch, out of tune, butter knife, tea spoon  
(now what was that)  
Razz-a-matazz, Thing-a-majig, whatchamacallit, bullshit  
So and so, such and such (bullshit!) pretty much  
(I think I'm gonna throw up)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
1 and 1 makes 2, 2 and 2 makes 4, 4 and 4 makes 8 and 8 makes 16  
16 and, 16 makes (32 Percival)  
Makes no sense at all  
Who needs lyrics anyway (You!)  
  
[Bridge]  
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations? [Repeat: x8]  
  
Hey! Hey little buddy where you going?  
Come back man! We was just playing! Come on man!  
See I pissed him off
