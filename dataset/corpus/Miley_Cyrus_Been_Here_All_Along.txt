Mmm. Yeaah  
Sunrise and I lifted my head  
Then I smiled at your picture sittin' next to my bed  
Sunset and you're feelin' okay  
Cause you smile at the letter that I sent you today  
  
And I can't wait till I see you again  
And we'll both say remember when  
The band played on the 4th of July  
And you held me on your shoulders way up high  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
You're with me  
You've been here all along  
You've been here all along  
  
Back then you walked me to school  
Tell me to be careful and to follow the rules  
Fast forward, you taught me to drive  
You gave me the keys and we went for a ride  
  
And I can't wait till I see you again  
And we both say, remember when  
I'm holding on to moments like that  
And I know that they're coming back  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
You're with me  
You've been here all along.  
  
Yeahh  
  
All along, the way  
I keep you in my heart  
And in my breath  
You'll always be the one  
That cares the most  
Counting all the days  
I see you runnin' up to say  
I miss you  
I miss you  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
  
You're still there for me  
Where ever there might be  
And if an ocean lies between us  
I'll send the message across the sea  
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright  
I believe that you were listening to my song  
You're with me  
Cuz you're with me  
You've been here all along  
You've been here all along
