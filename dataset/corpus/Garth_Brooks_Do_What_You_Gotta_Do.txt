Sometimes you've got to take the heat  
If you're gonna walk down the mean street  
Take the heat and you see it through  
"Cause sometimes it comes down to  
Do what you gotta do  
Sometimes it goes right down to the wire  
And you might have to walk through the fire  
Walk on boy all the way through  
Sometimes it just comes down to  
Do what you gotta do  
Well there's people that'll tell you  
It's just no use  
And there's people that'll tell you  
That you're gonna lose  
People that'll tell you  
Anything you're gonna listen to  
Do what you gotta do  
Someday they're going to call your name  
They'll come looking for some one to blame  
What's your name, boy  
Hey, you just tell them true  
"Cause they can't take the truth from you  
So do what you gotta do  
Well, they'll call you a hero or a traitor  
But you'll find out that, sooner or later,  
Nobody in this world is gonna do it for you  
Do what you gotta do  
There ain't nobody in this world  
That's gonna do it for you  
Do what you gotta do
