It's out of control, And there's nothing I can do now  
Out of control, spinning softly through the blue now  
And look beyond these walls as the meaning starts to dawn  
It's getting to the point, getting to the point  
  
It's out of control, nothing I can do  
Like a fire that keeps on burning  
And nobody knows what I'm going through  
And the thoughts just keep returning  
And all you had to say, was that you were gonna stay  
It's getting to the point, getting to the point  
  
It's getting to the point where nobody can stop it now  
It's getting to the point of no return  
And all that I can do is stand and watch it now  
watch it burn, burn, burn  
It's getting to the point where reasons are forgotten  
It's getting to the point where no one knows  
And all that I can do is say I'm sorry, but that's the way it goes  
It's getting to the point  
  
Forever is a long way, forever takes your breath away  
I'd like to talk about it, try to understand  
It's getting to the point, getting to the point  
It's out of control, nothing I can do  
Like a fire that keeps on burning  
And nobody knows what I'm going through  
And the thoughts just keep returning  
And all you had to say, was that you were gonna stay  
It's getting to the point, getting to the point
