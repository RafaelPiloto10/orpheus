Up all night I could not sleep  
The whiskey that I drank was cheap  
With shakin' hands I went and I lit up my last cigarette  
Well the sun came, night had fled  
And sleepy eyed I reached my bed  
I saw you sleepy dreamin' there all covered and warm  
  
South city midnight lady  
I'm much obliged indeed  
You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need  
I thought there was no reason  
For all these things I do  
But the smile that I sent out returned with you  
  
When day has left the night behind  
And shadows roll across my mind  
I sometimes find myself alone out walkin' the street  
Yes, and when I'm feelin' down and blue  
Then all I do is think of you  
And all my foolish problems seem to fade away  
  
South city midnight lady  
I'm much obliged indeed  
You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need  
I thought there was no reason  
For all these things I do  
But the smile that I sent out returned with you
