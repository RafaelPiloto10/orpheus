Imagination is funny  
It makes a cloudy day sunny  
It makes a bee think of honey  
Just like I think of you  
  
Imagination is crazy  
Your whole perspective gets hazy  
It starts you asking a daisy what to do  
What to do  
  
Have you ever felt a gentle touch  
And then a kiss, then and then  
You find it's only your imagination again  
Oh well  
  
Imagination is silly  
You go around willy-nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
Yet I can't imagine that you want me too
