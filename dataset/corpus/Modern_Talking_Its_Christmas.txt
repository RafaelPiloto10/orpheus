What do the lonely do on Christmas ?  
Woman is a man's best friend  
There are people in loneliness, girl  
Waiting for a helping hand  
There's no mountain that's high enough  
Heaven will send me  
You're drowning in a sea of love, girl  
Never set you free  
I have a heart of sun  
And you will never be alone  
We'll have some days of fun  
My love  
  
Oh babe, it's Christmas  
And I give you my heart  
Oh it's Christmas  
From the very first start  
Oh babe, it's Christmas  
Wish you a happy New Year  
Oh, it's Christmas  
Pray for me to be here  
  
What do the lonely do on New Year?  
What do the lonely do?  
I've been looking through your tears, babe  
Feel memories with you  
Dreams are nothing more than emotions  
But they'll come true  
Give me all your sweet devotions  
Babe, I'm missing you  
I have a heart of sun  
And you will never be alone  
We'll have some days of fun  
My love
