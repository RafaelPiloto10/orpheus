[X-Raided talking]  
Nigga who was the first one screamin' the block  
on these records nigga?  
Who was the first nigga that brought the town  
really nationwide nigga?  
Who but me nigga?  
[Verse 1]  
Draggin' it tellin' it nigga ways, and peepin' the game  
Packin' it sellin' it nigga pay, keepin' the change Raided,  
Deep in the game crack, sellin' it nigga track  
Hit the bell and it hold back on the scene  
wid felons greens inhalin' the smoke  
Sub-machines full ah violence on foes  
in the club shoot beams and walk,  
Lookin' for fiends sellin' souls to the cops red,  
Died in his shirt hurt, silence is proved dead  
I'm a soul to the block nigga that think violence is cute  
Chase niggas in hot pursuit, nine's is mute  
Silencers screwed on the nose of the barrels  
That cry murders youth,  
throw holes in devils like po' do  
Cause riots and urge my loc if to ghost you  
Madman motherfucka we lootin' this mansion  
Cause you lyin', rhymin' wid passion but no truth  
Bad hands is dealt, like gamblers in Vegas  
milk wives and niggas amplifiers invade the,  
Scrambler motherfuck it he called yo convo  
Red or blue if you cut the wrong one the bomb blow  
We roll super thick like fire ants  
Troop wid heat like we bought gun stores wid my advance  
Who but me?  
[Chorus 2X: X-Raided] and (Dott Dogg)  
Who be flashin' (nigga!)  
Who be mashin' (nigga!)  
Who be smashin' (nigga!)  
Who but me? (Madman!)  
If you cashin' (nigga!)  
If you blastin' (nigga!)  
If you thrashin', troop wid me (Madman!)  
[Verse 2]  
I'm can cannin' it nigga  
Been bringin' it nigga  
Fuck a lil glocks and bails been bringin' it nigga  
Scope loc Dogg crippin' it, slip the clip in it  
Catch 'em slippin' on dubs jack, then I'm strippin' it  
Hennessey sippin' it, dope sack flippin' it  
Call the case I still got, court Dott skippin' it  
I ain't new to this nigga, been true to this nigga  
Off branch talkin' bout what they gon' do to this nigga  
But I ain't feelin' them niggas  
So I'm killin' them niggas  
Don't you try to tell him now these  
pair ah villains fillin' up niggas  
y'all know how I do, and know what I does  
Set trip ain't no love, let 'em know what's up 'cause  
Madman till my casket drop it don't stop  
Fuck the haters and the cops  
Tell them niggas give you props  
And I only got my love for my thugs and bitches  
And all I got for enemies is some slugs and stitches  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
You'll get lost in the mix nigga, swallowed in the game  
You get the flossin' it slippin' it up wildin' wid the pain  
Like Baby Layne, catch you in the mall and stomp ya brain  
Cause I want yo chain I'm sick and don't want to change  
My niggas is followin' the same groove we,  
Stick to the scripts stick to the Crips  
All them other fools get dicks to the lips  
So I share no blunt, my bitch bought Nikes and boxers  
Don't wear no pumps, buy me a glock and report it stolen  
Holdin' my chips to the roll of the die  
wid the loot like Scrooge Mcduck tuck yo jewels  
Or my crew push up the conversatin' choose to buck  
Momma waitin' for me to rise,  
Motivation to my girl be demise  
You hear me nigga be advised I do whatever it takes  
Get together wid snakes, go to hell and sit forever and bake  
Look in my eyes you can see it if you willin' to try  
True indeed no disguise for what I'm feelin' inside  
Who but me?  
[Chorus]
