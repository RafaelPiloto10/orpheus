This Old Man  
He worked for thirty years with  
Two strong hands, in the factory light his  
Lunch box held all his needs with  
Coffee sandwiches and dreams  
For Me  
  
This Old Man  
He taught me many times  
To undertand, that showing love is simply  
Nothing you should have o hide  
Don't keep your feelings locked inside  
He said  
  
When I was young  
I dreamed a young man's dreams  
I saw in you reyes  
The things I'd never seen  
But now I grow old  
But I don't really mind  
Cause can't you see with my family  
We'll share these timeless memories
