Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid fool about my money don't try to
save  
My heart says go go have a time cause it's Saturday night baby I'm feelin'

Gonna shake it up gonna ball it up we're gonna rock it up and ball tonight  
Got me a date and I won't be late pick me up in the tonight  
Shag on down to the union hall when the gang starts jumpin' I'll have a ball
