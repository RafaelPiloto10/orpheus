Well she's a girl in a million  
And I'm a millionaire  
She wants to mother my children  
I think I wanna marry her  
Well I haven't got a lot of money  
Got a full head of hair?  
But she's a girl in a million  
And I'm a millionaire  
Her dad's a bigshot politician  
Her mother she's a judge  
And I'm a no good for nothing  
And I'm the one that she loves  
Well we haven't got a lot of money  
Since daddy took the trust fund away  
But she's a girl in a million  
And I'm a millionaire  
She's a goalgetter and I have to go and get her  
She ought to know better could do better  
But I'm the one that she loves  
(go figure)  
Hey hey hey  
My fortune cookie says ah  
She's a girl in a million  
And I'm a millionaire  
Yeah  
She's a girl in a million yes  
She's a girl in a million (I'm a millionaire)  
She's a girl in a million, million, million, million, million, million  
She's a girl in a million, yes she's a girl in a million, million  
And I'm a millionaire
