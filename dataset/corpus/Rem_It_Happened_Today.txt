This is not a parable  
This is a terrible  
This is a terrible thing  
  
Yes I will rhyme that, after, after all I've done today  
I have earned my wings  
  
It happened today. Hooray! Hooray!  
It happened. Hip, hip, hooray!  
  
We'll leave the allegory to another Bible story  
Out of deference, defiance and choice  
And close in on a promise, after, after all I've done today  
I have earned my voice.  
  
It happened today. Hooray! Hooray!  
It happened. Hip, hip hooray!
