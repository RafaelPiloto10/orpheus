Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, fingle all the way  
Oh, what fun on Jah's cool run in a one-horse open sleigh  
  
We're dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh  
And o'er the fields we go a-laughin' all the way  
The bells on bob-tail ring, they're making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, fingle all the way  
Oh, what fun on Jah's cool run in a one-horse open sleigh  
  
A day or two ago I thought I'd take a run to Port Antonio  
I be cruisin' in the sun  
The radio was loud, the chicken jerked and fried  
And all I had to do that day was drive on the left side  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to run in a one-horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, fingle all the way  
Oh, what fun on Jah's cool run in a one-horse open sleigh
