I was thinking about her, visiting the past  
Reconstructing details with old photographs  
I was studying the faces with an objective point of view  
Suddenly remembering doesn't haunt me  
I'll follow the sun  
And now the time has come, and so, my love, I must go  
And though I lose a friend, in the end you will know oh  
One day you'll find that I have gone  
But tomorrow might rain so I'll follow the sun  
All the time you couldn't tell me that one day I'd be glad  
That something that I thought was love was misinterpreted  
  
But they were doing me a favor, a blessing in disguise  
If she would've been faithful, if she could have been true  
Then I would've been cheated, I would never know real love  
I would've missed out on you  
I watch you sleeping, your body touching me  
There's no doubt about it, this is where I want to be  
You know it's so ironic, I had to lose to win  
I want to thank her, if she would've been faithful  
If she could have been true  
Then I would've been cheated, I would never know real love  
I would've missed out on you  
It's a paradox full of contradiction, how I got from there to here  
It defies a logical explanation  
If she would've been faithful, if she could have been true  
Then I would've been cheated, I would never know real love  
I would've missed out on you  
If she would've been faithful, if she could have been true  
Then I would've been cheated, I would never know real love  
I would've missed out on you
