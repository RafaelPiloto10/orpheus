Air cushioned soles  
I bought them on the Portbello Road on a Saturday  
I stop and stare awhile  
A common pastime when conversation goes astray  
  
And don't think I'm walking out of this  
She don't mind  
Whatever I say, whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
  
Blue, blue jeans I wear them every day  
There's no particular reason to change  
My thoughts are getting banal, I can't help it  
But I won't pull out hair another day  
  
And don't think I'm walking out of this  
She don't mind  
Whatever I say, Whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
If you don't mind  
Whatever I say, Whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
  
You know it's to be with you  
Don't give up on me yet  
Don't think I'm walking out of this  
She don't mind  
Whatever I say, Whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
If you don't mind  
Whatever I say, Whatever I say  
I don't really want to change a thing  
I want to stay this way forever  
  
You know it's to be with you
