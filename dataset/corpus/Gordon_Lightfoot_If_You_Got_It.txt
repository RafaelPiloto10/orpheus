If you got it  
Don't lose it girl it's got to be  
The one creative thing that's left for you and me  
If you find it  
Don't lose it all the very next day  
Lock it in your soul and throw the key away  
  
So, don't you let it go  
Let it stay let it grow  
Like the snow  
Don't let it melt away  
If you find it  
Then give it girl with all your might  
Forget about yourself you're not the losin' kind  
  
If you get it  
Then keep it cool don't let it die  
You may only see it once don't let it pass you by  
So don't you let it go  
Let it stay let it grow  
Like the snow  
Don't let it melt away  
  
If you find it  
Then give it girl with all your might  
Forget about yourself you're not the losin' kind  
  
If you get it  
Then keep it cool don't let it die  
You may only see it once don't let it pass you by  
Pass you by, don't let it die  
Don't let it go
