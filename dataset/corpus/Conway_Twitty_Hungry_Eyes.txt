A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp  
Stands out in this memory I revive  
'Cause my daddy raised a family there with two hard working hands  
To try to feed my mama's hungry eyes  
  
He dreamed of something better and my mama's faith was strong  
And us kids were just too young to realize  
That another class of people put us somewhere just below  
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes  
  
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted  
But it wasn't ?cause my daddy didn't try  
She only wanted things she really needed  
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes  
  
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life  
But I don't recall a change of any size  
Just a little loss of courage as their age began to show  
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes  
Mama never had the luxuries  
Oh, I still recall my mama's hungry eyes
