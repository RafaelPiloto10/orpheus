[Intro]  
(Numa numa)  
(Numa numa)  
(Numa numa)  
(Numa numa)  
  
[Verse 1]  
You call me up  
(Numa numa)  
It's like a broken record  
(Numa numa)  
Saying that your heart hurts  
(Numa numa)  
That you never get over him getting over you  
(Numa numa)  
And you end up crying  
(Numa numa)  
And I end up lying  
(Numa numa)  
Cos I'm just a sucker for anything that you do  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And when the phone call finally ends  
You say, "thanks for being a friend"  
(Numa numa)  
And we're going in circles again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt, heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight, straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
I'm right here when you gonna realize  
That I'm your cure, heartbreak girl?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I bite my tongue  
(Numa numa)  
But I want to scream out  
(Numa numa)  
You could be with me now  
(Numa numa)  
But I end up telling you what you want to hear  
(Numa numa)  
But you're not ready  
(Numa numa)  
And it's so frustrating  
(Numa numa)  
He treats you so bad and I'm so good to you, it's not fair  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And when the phone call finally ends  
You say, "I'll call you tomorrow at 10,"  
(Numa numa)  
And I'm stuck in the friendzone again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt, heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight, straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
I'm right here when you gonna realize  
That I'm your cure, heartbreak girl?  
  
[Bridge]  
I know someday it's gonna happen  
And you'll finally forget the day you met him  
Sometimes you're so close to your confession  
I've gotta get it through your head  
That you belong with me instead anyone can  
  
[Chorus]  
I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt, heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight, straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
I'm right here when you gonna realize  
That I'm your cure, heartbreak girl?  
  
[Outro]  
(Numa numa)
