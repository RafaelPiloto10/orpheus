[J. Cole]  
They say anythings possible,  
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles  
Chasing obscene profits so we ain't stopping for the red lights  
Look in my rear view all I see is n-ggas headlights  
Catch me if you can hoe  
They try and sack me and I scramble  
Look up in the sky you'll see exactly where I am bo  
Hey, don't you see me man?  
Making my wishes come true with no genie man  
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man  
I'm on these rich n-ggas ass no bikini man  
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man  
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man  
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope  
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost  
Silly head to approach, what's up young blood  
Aint it strange, a year ago today I was counting change  
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city  
Though I gotta thank God cause if you weren't with me  
Than I surely woulda died  
You can throw the fork in me  
This my New Years resolution, dawg  
No more Pork in me  
Uh, I aint no Muslim though  
Kuran butler I'm a wizard if he doesn't know  
It's young Simba, I'm ballin' til the buzzard blow  
You try and kick the shit I kick you gon stub your toe  
Boy that's just how tough I go  
See this is my life work  
This shit you callin classic, I be like that mic work  
Want you to feel something new, that's how a dike work  
And ask me bout pressure, they wanna see my pipe burst  
  
Not tonight n-gga  
Not tonight n-gga  
Yeah, hey  
Hey, man, hey  
  
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely  
Never met a baby momma, momma who don't like me  
Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me  
I hit her til she snooze, like the news n-gga nightly  
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me  
No she bitter with this n-gga  
Cause he aint quite me  
One things for certain baby, you are a wifey  
Two things for f-cking sure  
I am not the husband thoguh  
So run back to him while you still can  
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah that's a real man  
I was ashamed all along and I still am  
We let the lust interupt something real, damn  
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position  
I wouldn't say that you a hoe, just made a hoe decision  
Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibitions  
We both know that's what you wanted girl  
I know you listening  
  
Hey  
Girl I know you listening  
Uh I know you listening  
Hey, yeah  
  
Shout out to the bootleggers who supply my shit  
The fans online trying to find my shit  
And to then-ggas listening but wont buy my sh-t  
And catch me in the street wanna ride my d-ck  
Y'all n-ggas is the worst, see me like  
"J. Cole homie, can you sign my burnt CD"  
N-gga please, an album ten dollars  
You act like it's ten g's  
This food for thought cost the same as 2 numbers three's  
So at ease with that broke shit  
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no sh-t  
You know I feel ya pain, that's why I slang this hope sh-t  
And give you lines that you rewind and think oh sh-t  
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes sh-t  
I give you that and a whole lot more sh-t  
Than got richer and still rapping like I'm poor sh-t  
You n-ggas thinnk you know sh-t, n-gga you don't know sh-t  
Hoe bitch!  
Yeah, Cole bitch!  
J Cole n-gga
