Have you ever met a lady, screaming angst potential?  
Have you ever dreamed of romance, no matter how experimental?  
Have you ever felt an alien drifting back into your hometown?  
Did you think you were buying safety  
When you bought that piece of ground?  
  
She said all the best freaks are here  
She said all the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
So I said all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
  
Have you ever woke up, sweating in the middle of the night?  
You search the darkness and you're scrambling for the light  
Have you ever walked down the street, heard bootsteps following you?  
Don't worry my son, you've got the spook squad looking after you  
  
He said all the best freaks are here  
He said all the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
So I said all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me, stop staring at me  
  
Airport terminal, patiently waiting on the last call  
You feel the eyes burn the back of your head  
Sign the autograph, get out of the picture, gonna have the last laugh  
Feel the whispers as you head for the plane  
Stop staring at me  
  
Love and linen sheets seem so very far away  
You save your pennies and you buy another day  
But after all it's only hide and seek, just another game  
There's so much fun to be had when you're living with a name  
  
All the best freaks are here, all the best freaks are here,  
Please stop staring at me, all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
Oh, stop staring at me, oh, stop staring at me  
  
They said all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
All the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me
