God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you  
Put it in the soul of everyone  
Do you know what you want? You don't know for sure  
You don't feel right, you can't find a cure  
And you're gettin' less than what you're lookin' for  
You don't have money or a fancy car  
And you're tired of wishin' on a falling star  
You gotta put your faith in a loud guitar  
Chorus:  
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you  
Gave rock and roll to everyone (oh yeah)  
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you  
Put it in the soul of everyone  
"Now listen"  
If you wanna be a singer, or play guitar  
Man, you gotta sweat or you won't get far  
Cause it's never too late to work nine-to-five  
You can take a stand, or you can compromise  
You can work real hard or just fantasize  
But you don't start livin' till you realize - "I gotta tell ya!"  
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you  
Gave rock and roll to everyone  
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you  
Put it in the soul  
(Instrumental break)  
God gave rock and roll to you (to everyone he gave the song to be sung)  
Gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to everyone  
God gave rock and roll to you (to everyone he gave the song to be sung)  
Gave rock and roll to you, saved rock and roll for everyone  
Saved rock and roll  
chorus repeats out...  
"I know life sometimes can get tough! And I know life sometimes can be a  
drag!  
But people, we have been given a gift, we have been given a road  
And that road's name is... Rock and Roll
