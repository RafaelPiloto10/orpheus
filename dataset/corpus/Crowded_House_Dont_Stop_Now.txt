Another pleasant day in the countryside  
Has ended up in tears on a stormy night  
'Cause you can't follow my directions home  
But don't stop now  
  
God knows where the satellite's taking us  
I can't tell what's right in front of us  
But I hang on every word  
And don't stop now  
No, don't stop now  
You give me something I can write about  
  
You get fooled by the lightning every time  
See the after-image of my outline  
And you turn the wrong way 'round  
Well, don't stop now  
No, don't stop now  
You give me something I can write about  
You give me something I can cry about  
  
In a church house ten miles out of town  
Is the devil gonna track me down?  
And travel through a tunnel in the trees  
Just remember that's how you get to me  
  
There's no number on the house  
The birds are heading south  
Sometimes you have to turn  
The wrong way 'round  
Sometimes you get too close to nowhere now  
  
This is helpful in the silence  
I wait with a blank piece of paper on the top of my head  
And all I want is something I can write about  
All I want is something I can cry about  
Ooo
