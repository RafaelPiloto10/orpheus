I was holding on, now I'm letting go  
This is nothing more than a picture show  
Everything I knew now I hardly know  
Busy keeping less, never getting more  
  
One more nickel, dime, I'm out the door  
This kind of life I can't afford  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to believe  
There's something to believe  
I would live only  
Just to believe  
Oh, I'd love to believe  
It's not only me that's longing  
Only just to believe  
So believe  
'Cause I want to believe  
I want to believe  
  
Can't put my mind at ease with the words I say  
Trying to get myself to get out of my way  
Birds in the trees just make me depressed  
Seeing sunny skies, feeling emptiness  
  
Layers of lies just seem to fold  
This kind of life is all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Murder wears a friendly smile  
Like the perfect end in a plastic vial  
No pain  
Sorry, I can't seem to stay  
But this bird was meant to fly away  
Fly away, fly away  
  
Layers of lies just seem to fold  
This kind of life is all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will believe  
I'd love to believe  
I can believe in something  
I will believe  
I'd love to believe  
I can't believe in nothing
