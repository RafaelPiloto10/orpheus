Hold on tightly to your innocence  
And don't you let go  
Until you know it's gonna be your way  
  
Through the tangle and the bramble  
There's a thread that runs through  
And it's true  
There's no need to be afraid  
  
Smiling ear to ear  
It's something in the atmosphere  
Every star above reflecting in your sea of love  
Is it just a dream  
Or are things as they really seem  
Somebody help me make the call  
  
You could be the light  
That shines so bright  
You show the way to go  
And if it's so  
Don't be too surprised  
  
Just give yourself a chance  
And take a glance  
Around to see the glow  
Burning in my eyes  
  
Smiling ear to ear  
It's something in the atmosphere  
Every star above reflecting in your sea of love  
This is not a dream  
It's just the way it's always been  
You've got to rise above it all  
  
Somewhere down the road that we follow  
We'll be one with everything  
I know as soon as tomorrow  
We could be arriving  
  
Somewhere down the road that we follow  
We'll be one with everything  
I know as soon as tomorrow  
We could be arriving  
And in my dreams I'm there by your side  
Learning to fly again  
  
The world we see (World we see and hear)  
Is a mystery (Mystery but we)  
But we hold the key (Hold the key to the door)  
If we have the faith to live (Have the faith anymore)  
And believe  
  
Somewhere down the road that we follow  
We'll be one with everything  
I know as soon as tomorrow  
We could be arriving  
And in my dreams I'm there by your side  
Learning to fly again
