Well you can take all of the money that you made and put it in the jar  
Drag out a map that will show you, is Heaven very far?  
You take all of the medicine you need 'til ya find out who you are  
Maybe you can figure why that woman wanna be so cruel  
But ya, ya just can't forget her, can you fool?  
  
Well those winter nights and the city lights and the crying of the train  
Everyday is a shade of gray, every memory's a fade  
And then ya finally use the sense God gave ya to come out of the rain  
Still you can't figure why that man is got to be so cruel  
But ya just can't forget him, can you fool?  
  
Oh, love is long and love is hard  
Love brings lots of pain  
She was here, now she's gone  
Lord, bring her back again  
  
Well you can take all of the money that you made and put it in the jar  
Drag out a map that will show you, is Heaven very far?  
And you can take all of the medicine you need 'til ya find out who you are  
Still you can't figure why that man he got to be so cruel  
But ya just can't forget him, can you fool?  
No, you just can't forget her, can you fool?  
Aww, can you fool?
