All my friends alone on a hill  
They're just looking down with violent  
Minds out on loan  
They're just not equipped  
Insistence  
We hope for the best  
We're not making sense  
In silence wait for the day  
When you're better than  
  
In this silence  
I'm not buying  
But you're not faking  
I'm not  
I guess we better hold on again  
Cause this time  
We won't understand again  
I'm not waiting for some sense  
Still they sit alone on a hill  
Their mechanical thoughts  
Have left them out on their own  
They're not buying this
