If this is heaven, then I'm in hell  
If trust is misfortune, then wish me well  
  
While I think of sadness, baby  
Your light shines through  
Your light shines through  
Your light shines through  
  
[Chorus]  
Because it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
  
I've lost control of my darker side  
A world, all for free on a nastier ride  
  
And I have crossed myself in anger  
All your mercy can't save me  
All your mercy can't save me  
All your mercy can't save me  
  
Because it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
  
It's beggar's day  
You know it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
  
See this love I've stored for you  
Wheel it and deal it, but our feelings are true  
  
And I have crossed myself in anger  
All your mercy can't save me  
All your mercy can't save me  
All your mercy can't save me  
  
[Chorus x 2]
