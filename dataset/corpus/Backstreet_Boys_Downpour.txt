Ooh, yeah, yeah  
I've been walking around inside a haze  
Between the lines of reason  
Hiding from the ghost of yesterday  
Feels like I'm barely breathing  
I, I wanna feel the rain again  
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain, feel the rain  
I've been losing days  
The shades pulled down  
I still can't face the sun  
But I, I'm going crazy  
I can't stay here  
I've gone completely numb  
I just wanna need someone  
I, I wanna feel the rain again  
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain, feel the rain  
Oh no, I thought you were the only one  
But now I think I was wrong  
?Cause life goes on  
I've been walking around inside a haze  
I, I wanna feel the rain again  
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain  
I, I wanna feel the rain again  
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the downpour, I wanna feel the rain  
In a downpour, feel the rain  
Feel the rain, oh, oh  
I wanna feel the rain
