In Your name  
There is hope when all seems lost  
There is freedom in the power of the cross  
Let the world see  
  
In Your name  
There is truth where logic fails  
Understanding that makes sense of our days  
You are worthy  
  
Hear the sound of all creation roar  
We're crying out as one  
To You our God  
Now show us the way of Your love  
And we will come running  
  
[Chorus]  
All for Jesus name  
Your love displayed  
We are alive in the mystery  
All for sinners' gain  
Your life You gave  
We'll sing Your praise for eternity  
  
In Your name  
There is mercy without end  
Overtaking us now time and again  
Let the world see  
In Your name  
There is love that never fails  
And the promist that Your love will prevail  
You are worthy  
  
Hear the sound of all creation roar  
We're crying out as one  
To You our God  
Now show us the way of Your love  
And we will come running  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Great is Your name  
Great is Your name [Repeat: x 2]  
  
Hear the sound of all creation roar  
We're crying out as one  
To You our God  
Now show us the way of Your love  
And we will come running  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Great is Your name  
Great is Your name [Repeat: x 4]
