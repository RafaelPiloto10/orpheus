Drop your guns  
and hear the news  
The war is won  
and we've called a truce  
The key is found  
and the circle complete  
And the higher ground  
is beneath our feet  
  
Like the turn of a page  
or a change of gear  
A brand new age  
is already here  
And even while  
men pursue their doom  
A magical child  
is kicking in the womb  
  
I'm preparing for birth  
I'm not the only one  
I'm a part of the Earth  
I'm a drop of the Sun  
I'm in step with the stars  
I'm in a league with the land  
I'm a functioning part of the Master's Plan!
