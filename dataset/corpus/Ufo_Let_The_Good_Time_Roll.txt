Now here's an invitation  
It's on page 33  
Attractive and exciting female  
Must be looking for someone like me  
Looking through your magazine  
Now here's a cryptic clue  
Yes the river is swollen  
This one could be, could be for you  
Come on lover pickup the phone  
02900 in the Twilight Zone  
Oh she let's the good times roll  
Come on baby now free my soul  
Oh she lets the good times roll  
Heat it up and just let me go  
A knight in shining armor  
Honest and sincere  
That's the way I'll word it now  
Oh! plus a good career  
Sticky situations  
They will fade away  
Place an ad in this column  
And find a love you pray  
Come on baby pick up the phone  
Dial my number in the twilight zone  
Oh she lets the good time roll  
Take it real fast or you can take it slow  
Oh she let's the good time roll  
Just pump it up now let me go

Oh she lets the good times roll  
She takes it fast or you can take it slow
