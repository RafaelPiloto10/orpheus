Sky so vast is the sky  
With far away clouds just wandering by  
Where do they go? Oh, I don't know, don't know  
  
Wind that speaks to the leaves  
Telling Stories that no one believes  
Stories of love belong to you and me  
  
Oh Dindi, if I only had words  
I would say all the beautiful things that I see  
When you're with me, oh, my Dindi  
  
Oh Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees  
That's how my heart is singing Dindi  
Happy Dindi when you're with me  
  
I love you more each day, yes, I do, yes, I do  
I'd let you go away if you take me with you  
  
Don't you know, my Dindi?  
I'd be running and searching for you  
Like a river that can't find the sea  
That would be me without you, my Dindi  
  
I love you more each day, yes, I do, yes, I do  
I'd let you go away if you take me with you  
  
Don't you know, Dindi?  
I'd be running and searching for you  
Like a river that can't find the sea  
That would be me without you, without you, yeah  
My Dindi, my Dindi, my Dindi
