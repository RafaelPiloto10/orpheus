Do you believe in Heaven?  
That man's soul is eternal?  
Our prayers are always answered?  
And miracles can happen?  
  
Save me.  
  
But don't you wonder?  
The Holy Ghost and Jesus?  
In paradise and angels?  
That God is all forgiving?  
  
Save me.  
  
Reward the faithful?  
He lies to you and deceives.  
A dark salvation comes.  
Innocence bleeding.  
  
Too dark to see the pictures of Heaven  
Too dark to find the Garden of Eden.  
Blinded by faith and stories of wonder,  
Devine mercy? Mercy lies bleeding.  
  
Save me.
