Want love? Get closer  
You want love? Get closer  
Hold her hand, be forward  
Come on, be a man, get closer  
Instead of worrying about those things you said  
Follow your heart and forget your head  
Maybe some things will jump out your mouth  
Make her notice that you're crazy about her  
You want love? Get closer  
You want love? Get closer  
You make a fuss when her eyes ain't on you  
Well, give her something to look forward to  
Remember all those other girls who ran  
Away from something they didn't understand  
You want love? Get closer  
You want love? Get closer  
Why you worrying about those things you said  
Follow your heart and forget your head  
Oh, slide over on the seat  
She'll give you something that's, oh so sweet
