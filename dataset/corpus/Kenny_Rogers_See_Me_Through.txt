Take my hand, pull me up  
Find my own way soon enough  
You'll see me through, see me through  
What you give will see me through  
When my mind cannot reach  
You can show me harmony  
That sees me through, sees me through  
What you teach will see me through  
You told me, you showed me  
And when you're working day was done  
I watched you go, I should have known  
That even when I feel alone  
You'll see me through, see me through  
When I need you, you'll see me through
