Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends.  
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends,  
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  
  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?  
Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me.  
I wait for delivery each day until three,  
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?  
  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?  
I'm counting on you, Lord, please don't let me down.  
Prove that you love me and buy the next round,  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?  
  
Everybody!  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends,  
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends,  
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  
  
That's it!
