How y'all feelin' tonight?  
I don't give a damn  
  
Mama I'm leavin' way from home to join the circus  
And papa I go into that place where them clowns get down (get down)  
Sister I know that there are lions tigers and bears  
I'll be safe and sure to call y'all when I get there  
  
[Chorus]  
Nothing but the greatest show on earth  
(shut up while I'm singing) step right up step right up come one come all  
What u want what you need  
Wanna drank wanna chief  
I got it yeah I got it  
  
Mama I'm moving up and I'll be selling cotton candy  
And papa next week they'll let me sit on the trapeze  
Uncle you should see all these dancing girls  
And every night I get to sleep under the big top  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Macy Gray]  
Ain't nothing like, great  
It's the greatest show on earth  
What u want what u need  
Wanna drank wanna chief  
I, I got it hey I got it  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh oh oh oh oh whoa  
Yeah yeah oh yeah  
Oh oh yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
OK OK OK OK OK  
I got good love  
I got true love  
I got green love  
I got blue love  
I got dark love  
I got light love  
I got white love

I got plaid love  
I got stripeded love  
  
What you clapping for I ain't done yet
