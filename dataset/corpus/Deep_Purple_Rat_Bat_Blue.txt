Hey baby, what you gonna do  
When the lights go up on you?  
What's your name, can I drive you home?  
Sweet woman, are you all alone?  
You're the one for me  
I'm gonna keep you busy as a bee, could bee, could be  
Rat bat blue  
  
Now, get up woman, don't be slow  
It's getting late and I wanna go  
No cause for acting big  
Got to love, got to live  
Stick around with me  
I'm gonna show you things you never thought you'd see,  
You see  
Rat bat blue  
You're so fine  
  
Get out!  
You didn't understand  
I'm a hard loving man  
No way you can satisfy  
The way you look, the way you lie  
And when you shut the door  
Make sure I don't see you 'round here no more  
Rat bat blue  
Alright
