Undying love you've given to me  
Seen in me things I would never have seen  
I don't understand why you care so much  
It's all a mystery  
Time and time again I ask myself  
What I have done to deserve such wealth  
The price you paid  
I could never repay  
Your generosity  
Chorus:  
In wanting to save me  
In order to save the day  
Because of love you placed yourself  
In harm's way  
It's truly beyond me  
Left without a word to say  
What kind of love would place itself  
In harm's way?  
What kind of love would place itself  
In harm's way?  
  
When I was down you came and lifted me  
When I was bound, yes, you set me free  
Things that you do makes it clear to see  
It's all a master plan  
Oh, no greater love that I've come to know  
And when I refuse, you still love me so  
With open arms you came and rescued me  
And erased all the pain  
Yes all the pain  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
What kind of love would place itself  
And risk your life for love's sake?  
What kind of love just takes on all the blame?  
It seems to be so easy  
It hurts sometimes but you never let go  
You will to love in spite of all you know  
You know, you know  
  
[Chorus:]
