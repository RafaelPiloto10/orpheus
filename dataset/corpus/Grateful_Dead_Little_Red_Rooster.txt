I'm a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days  
Just a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days  
Keep everything in the barnyard people, upset in every way  
  
Dogs begin to bark now and the hounds begin to howl  
Dogs begin to bark now and the hounds begin to howl  
Watch out stray cat people the little red rooster is on the prowl  
  
If you see the little red rooster, won't you please drive him home  
If you see my little red rooster, won't you please drive him home  
Been no peace in the barnyard people, since the little red rooster's been gone  
  
Yeah and the little red rooster, well you ain't shit to me  
Think you're a stud boy, well I doubt you'll ever be  
While your away I'm gonna fuck with your hens, boy  
I'm just bein' neighborly
