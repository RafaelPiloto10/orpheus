We agreed that it was over  
Now the lines have all been drawn  
The vows we made began to fade  
But now they're gone  
Put your pictures in a shoebox  
And my gold ring in a drawer  
I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Now Sherri says she jealous  
Of this freedom that I've found  
If she were me she would be  
Out on the town  
And she says she can't imagine  
What on earth I'm waiting for  
I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Oh I shouldn't care or wonder where and how you are  
But I can't hide this hurt inside my broken heart  
I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before  
Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Now I'm writing you this letter  
And it's killing me tonight  
That I agreed when you believed  
It wasn't right  
And I couldn't sleep up on the bed  
So I'm down here on the floor  
Where I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Oh I shouldn't care or wonder where and how you are  
But I can't hide this hurt inside my broken heart  
I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before  
Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before  
Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore
