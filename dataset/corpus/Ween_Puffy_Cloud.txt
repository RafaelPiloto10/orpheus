Drift away on a puffy cloud  
Go away on a puffy cloud  
My brain is dead from too much pot  
'Cause Gene, Dean and I smoke too much pot  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Float away on a cotton ball  
We write songs about the clouds  
My brain is dead from too much pot  
'Cause Gene, Dean and I smoke too much pot  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Drift away on a puffy cloud  
Go away on a puffy cloud  
My brain is dead from too much pot  
'Cause Gene, Dean and I smoke too much pot  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud
