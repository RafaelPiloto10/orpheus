I spend my time  
Thinkin' 'bout you constantly  
It's true that I want you  
You're the meaning of success to me  
Cause anything you want  
You can get from me  
Don't try to work it out  
Just let it be  
Emotion has no price  
And love is free  
I've been going round in circles  
You're always on my mind  
I need you so bad  
It's driving me out of my mind  
Reflected in your eyes  
Can't you see  
You and I against the world  
Young lions roam free  
You're always taking me somewhere  
That I've never seen  
No matter where you go  
I'm with you  
Every step of the way  
No matter what you need  
I've got more every single day  
My heart is full for you  
And I'm longing to find you  
Every step of the way  
I'm with you  
Every step of the way  
I'm right beside you  
Cause anything you want  
You can get from me  
Don't try to work it out  
Just let it be  
Emotion has no price  
And love is free  
It's free and no matter where you go  
I'm with you  
Every step of the way  
No matter what you need  
I've got more every single day  
My heart is full for you  
In your shadow you'll find me  
Every step of the way  
I'm with you  
Every step of the way  
I'm right beside you  
No matter what you do  
No matter what you say  
I'm right beside you  
Every single day  
No matter what you do  
Or who you do it to  
No matter where you've been  
No matter what you say  
Or who you say it to  
No matter what you do  
I will stay close to you  
Every step of the way  
Every single day  
Every step of the way
