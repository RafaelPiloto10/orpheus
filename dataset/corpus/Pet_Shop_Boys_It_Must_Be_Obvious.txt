Are you feeling alright?  
It's easy, we've been there before  
But it feels like the flight  
Of the von Trapps, does that mean it's war?  
Oh no,  
From my head to my toes  
I'm in love with you  
Do you think it shows?  
  
We're meant to be friends  
That's what it says in the script  
Is it really the end  
If, sometimes, I stray just a bit?  
Oh no,  
It should be poetry, not prose  
I'm in love with you  
Do you think it shows?  
  
And everyone knows when they look at us  
'Course they do, it must be obvious  
I never told you, now I suppose  
That you're the only one who doesn't know  
  
You were different when  
We met in an ordinary way  
I didn't intend  
To interrupt your own shadowplay  
Oh no,  
I won't upset the status quo  
I'm in love with you  
Do you think it shows?  
  
And everyone knows when they look at us  
'Course they do, it must be obvious  
You've never asked me, and I'm surprised  
That you're the only one who hasn't tried  
  
Everyone knows when they look at us  
'Course they do, it must be obvious  
I never asked you, now I suppose  
That you're the only one who doesn't know  
  
Aah  
When they look at us  
It must be obvious  
Oooh
