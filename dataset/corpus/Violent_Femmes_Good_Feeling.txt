Good feeling  
Won't you stay with me just a little longer  
It always seems like your leaving  
When I need you here just a little longer  
Dear lady there's so many things  
That I have come to fear  
Little voice says I'm going crazy  
To see all my worlds disappear  
Vague sketch of a fantasy  
Laughing at the sunrise  
Like he's been up all night  
Ooh slippin' and slidin'  
What a good time but now  
Have have to find a bed  
That can take this wait  
Good feeling  
Won't you say stay with me just a little longer  
It always seems like your leaving  
When I know the other one  
Just a little too well  
Oh dear lady  
Won't you stay with me just a little longer  
Why does it always seems like your leaving  
When I need you here just a little longer
