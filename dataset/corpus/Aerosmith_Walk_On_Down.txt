Yeah yeah  
  
You wonder why you got holes in your shoes  
You wonder why they got more money than you  
You wonder why you got nothin' to lose  
It makes no sense, don't try to figure it out  
You gotta walk on down  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
When you're shit outta luck  
There's just one thing to do and that's  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
When you're shit outta luck  
There's just one thing to do and that's  
Yeah  
  
Well, she says that she loves ya  
In your mind there's no doubt, but  
You feel like a stranger  
When the lights go out  
As you lie there awake  
You think this ain't no gift  
Don't try to figure that weight's too heavy to lift  
You gotta walk on down  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
When you're shit outta luck  
There's just one thing to do and that's  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
'Cause I got no time to lose  
It's my life if I choose  
Put on my walkin' shoes  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
When you're shit outta luck  
There's just one thing to do and that's  
  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
Walk on down  
When you're shit outta luck  
There's just one thing to do and that's  
Walk on down  
Walk on down (down down down down)  
Walk on down  
When you're shit outta luck  
There's just one thing to do and that's  
Walk on down
