If I could  
I'd protect you from the sadness in your eyes  
Give you courage in a world of compromise  
Yes, I would  
If I could  
I would teach you all the things I never learned  
And I'd help you cross the bridges that I burned  
Yes, I would  
  
If I could  
I would try to shield your innocence from time  
But the part of life I gave you isn't mine  
I watched you grow  
So I could let you go  
  
If I could  
I would help you make it through the hungry years  
But I know that I can never cry your tears  
But I would  
If I could  
  
If I live  
In a time and place  
Where you don't want to be  
You don't have to walk along this road with me  
My yesterday  
Won't have to be your way  
  
If I knew  
I'd have tried to change the world I brought you to  
Through there wasn't very much that I could do  
But I still would  
If I could  
  
If, if I could  
I would try to shield your innocence from time  
But the part of life I gave you isn't mine.  
I watched you grow  
So I could let you go  
  
If I could  
I would help you make it through the hungry years  
But I know that I can never cry your tears  
But I would  
If I could  
  
Yes, I would  
Yes, I would  
If I could
