Pray the real live forever man  
Pray the fakes get exposed  
I want that ferrari then I swerve  
I want that bugatti just to hurt  
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose  
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it  
I don't like how serious they take themselves  
I've always been me I guess I know myself  
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that  
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that  
This been where you find me at

I know a nigga named Johnny Bling  
He put me on to the finer things  
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans

Like twenty four seven, that's where my life took me  
That's just how shit happened to go
