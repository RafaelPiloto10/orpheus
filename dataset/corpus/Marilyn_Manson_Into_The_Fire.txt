This is the film, close to the third act and the misery  
It's not rain, you rapist werewolves  
It's God pissing down on you  
We'll die alone  
Cause I'll break off my own arms  
Sharpen my bones  
Stab you once for each time I thought of you  
Trying to take something  
You'll never be good enough to even look upon  
  
It's better to push something away that's slipping  
Than to risk being dragged down  
  
If you want to hit bottom  
Don't bother to try taking me with you  
I won't answer if you call  
Two heartbeats ended in hell  
Trying to break your fall  
  
This isn't a mob, won't need to change the names  
Everyone around you  
Has murdered someone, something sacred  
Isn't one nail without dirt under it  
Isn't any white cotton panties that aren't soaked and stained red  
  
It's better to push something away that's slipping  
Than to risk being dragged down  
  
If you want to hit bottom  
Don't bother to try taking me with you  
I won't answer if you call  
Two heartbeats ended in hell  
Trying to break your fall  
  
Into the fire  
Into the fire  
Into the fire  
Into the fire  
Fire, oh  
Into the fire  
Fire, oh  
Into the fire  
Fire, oh  
Into the fire  
Fire, oh
