Compliment what she does  
Send her roses just because  
If it's violins she loves let them play  
Dedicate her fav'right song and hold  
Her closer all night long  
Love her today  
Find one hundred ways  
  
Don't forget there could be  
An old lover in her memory  
If you need her so much more  
Why don't you say  
Maybe she has it in her mind  
That she's just wasting her time  
Ask her to stay  
Find one hundred ways  
  
Bein' cool won't help you keep a love warm  
You'll just blow your only chance  
Take the time to open up your heart  
That's the secret of romance  
  
Sacrifice if you care  
Buy her some moonlight to wear  
If there's one more star she wants  
Go all the way  
  
In your arms tonight  
She'll reflect that she owes you  
The sweetest of debts if she wants to pay  
Find one hundred ways  
  
In your arms tonight  
She'll reflect that she owes you  
The sweetest of debts if she wants to pay  
Find one hundred ways  
  
Ya gotta believe it whoa  
Love her today  
Find one hundred ways
