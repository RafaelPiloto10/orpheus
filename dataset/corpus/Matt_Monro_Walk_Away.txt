Walk away, please go  
Before you throw your life away  
A life that I could share for just a day  
We should have met some years ago  
For your sake I say  
Walk away, just go.  
  
Walk away, and live  
A life that's full  
With no regret  
Don't look back at me  
Just try to forget  
Why build a dream that cannot come true  
So be strong, reach the stars now  
Walk away, walk on.  
  
If I heard your voice  
I'd beg you to stay  
So don't say a word  
Just run, run away.  
  
Goodbye my love  
My tears will fall  
Now that you've gone  
I can't help but cry  
But I must go on  
I'm sad that I after searching so long  
Knew, I loved you, but I told you  
Walk away, walk on, walk on
