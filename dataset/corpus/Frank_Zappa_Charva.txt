Charva, I loved you  
I loved you through and through  
I loved you since in grammar school  
When we were sniffing glue  
I loved you purty baby doll  
And I don't know what in the world  
To do about it  
Boppa-bah-boppa-choo-wah  
Charva, my darling  
The only love I had  
I hope you will forgive me dear  
For punching out your dad  
I loved you, I loved you  
And I don't know what in the world  
I'm gonna do about it  
Ooohh-oh-oooh  
Lahm-buh-buhm-buhm  
I remember, remember the junior prom  
And I remember the time I broke your father's arm  
And I remember, remember all the love we shared  
Every place and everywhere  
Oh charva, charva  
I love you more and more  
I swear it ain't because your father owns a liquor store  
Charva, my baby  
I love you and I don't know what to do about it  
Oh-oh charva  
Ooooohh  
Oh-oh charva  
Ooooohh  
Come back my little darling charva  
I love you so much honey  
Come back to me charva  
Please charva, please come back to me  
I miss you so much
