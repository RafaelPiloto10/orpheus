Everybody

Rock your body right  
Backstreet's Back alright  
  
Hey, hey yeah, well,  
Oh my god we're back again  
Brothers, sisters, everybody sing  
Gonna bring the flavor,

Gotta question for ya  
Better answer now yeah  
  
Am I original?

Now throw your hands up in the air  
Wave them around like you just don't care  
If you want to party let me hear you yell

Make you understand
