There was a time I knew  
All that there was to know  
No one could tell me then  
I was wrong  
  
I wasn't strong enough  
To see where my weakness lay  
The world that you hold so tight  
Could slip away  
  
And from moment to moment  
Your life can change  
There's a storm over the horizon  
A sea no one can see  
  
Somewhere around the bend  
Right when you least expect  
Someone can walk away  
With no regret  
  
Leaving an empty space  
Breaking a sacred trust  
All of your shiny dreams  
Begin to rust  
  
Yes, from moment to moment your life can change  
There's a storm over the horizon  
The sea you cannot see  
  
Yes, from moment to moment  
Promise me you'll never change  
Promise me you'll stay the same  
Promise me you'll never change  
  
Yes, from moment to moment your life can change  
There's a storm over the horizon  
A sea you'll never see  
  
Yes, from moment to moment your life can change  
There's a light when the sun is rising  
A day after today  
  
Promise me you'll never change (promise me you'll never change)  
Promise me you'll stay the same (the same)  
Promise me you'll never change  
  
Every moment is a shining light  
Every moment is the darkest night  
Every moment gotta get it right  
Every single moment  
  
Every moment is a shining light  
Every moment is the darkest night  
Every moment gotta get it right  
  
Every moment is a shining light  
Every moment is the darkest night  
Every moment gotta get it right  
Every single moment  
  
Every moment is a shining light  
Every moment is the darkest night  
Every moment gotta get it right  
Every single moment
