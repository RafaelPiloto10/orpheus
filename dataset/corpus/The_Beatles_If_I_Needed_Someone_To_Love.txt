If I needed someone to love  
Youre the woman I'd be thinking of  
If I needed someone  
  
If I had some more time to spend  
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend  
If I needed someone  
  
Had you come some other day  
Then it might not have been like this  
But you see now I'm too much in love  
  
Carve your number on my wall  
And maybe you will get a call from me
