Kickin' as I'm Trying to sleep Got the mud beneath my shoes  
Rubber band, rubberband Gun in hand, gun in hand I wanna use  
Roamin', roamin', roam Get away, gotta get away  
And I think I think too much I don't care yeah but I don't care  
Roamin', roamin', roam Get away, gotta get away  
And I think I think too much  
  
Trippin' as I'm thinkin' about a boy, his name was sue  
He's a man, he's a man crackerman, crackerman, he's a woman too  
Roamin', roamin' roam Get away, gotta get away  
And I think I think too much I don't care yeah but I don't care  
Roamin', roamin' roam Get away, gotta get away  
And I think I think too much  
  
And I'm thinkin' While I'm thinking  
And I'm thinkin' While I'm thinking  
  
Roamin', roamin' roam Get away, gotta get away  
And I think I think too much I don't care yeah but I don't care  
Roamin', roamin' roam Get away, gotta get away  
And I think I think too much  
  
And I'm thinkin' While I'm thinking  
And I'm thinkin' While I'm thinking
