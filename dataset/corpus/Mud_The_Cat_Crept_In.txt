I said a hey you guys look who's awaitin' outside. Well she got style you can
see it in her feline eyes. When she starts movin' you sure can tell When she
starts shakin' she's raisin' hell. I said a hey you guys look who's awaitin'
outside. Do you remember how she left that floor last Saturday night. When the
cat broke loose well she darn near started the figh Well she may be flashin'
like a neon sign But you can't touch her 'cause she's mine all mine. I said a
hey you guys look who's awaitin' outside. And then the cat crept in and crept
out again The cat crept in and crept out again So I open the door for that
high-heeled paw I said the cat crept in ooh and crept out again. I said the
cat crept in and we crept out again. I said a hey you guys look who's awaitin'
outside . . . Hey you guys you can hear that alley cat cry Well she ain't
superstitious but she's hangin' on life No. 9 Well you may not know it but she
hides in the light And she may not know it but this cat can bite I said a hey
you guys look who's awaitin' outside. And then the cat crept in and crept out
again . . . I said a hey you guys look who's awaitin' outside . . . Hey you
guys look who's waiting outside She got style you can see it in her feline
eyes Well she may be flashin' like a neon sign But you can't touch her 'cause
she's mine all mine. I said a hey you guys look who's awaitin' outside. And
then the cat crept in and crept out again
