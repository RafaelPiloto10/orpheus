I've got to take a little time  
A little time to think things over  
I'd better read between the lines  
In case I need it when I'm older  
  
This big mountain, I must climb  
Feels like the world upon my shoulders  
Through the crowds, I see love shine  
It keeps me warm as life grows colder  
  
In my life, there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
I can't stop now  
I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to know what love is  
Reggae can show me  
I want to feel what love is  
Reggae can show me  
  
I'm going to take a little time  
A little time to look around me  
I've got nowhere left to hide  
It looks like reggae has finally found me  
  
In my life, there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
I can't stop now  
I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
[Chorus]
