All veils and misty  
Streets of blue  
Almond looks  
That chill divine  
Some silken moment  
Goes on forever  
And we're leaving broken hearts behind  
  
[Chorus:]  
Mystify  
Mystify me  
Mystify  
Mystify me  
  
I need perfection  
Some twisted selection  
That tangles me  
To keep me alive  
  
In all that exists  
None have your beauty  
I see your face  
I will survive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Eternally wild with the power  
To make every moment come alive  
All those stars that shine upon you  
Will kiss you every night  
  
All veils and misty  
Streets of blue  
Almond looks  
That chill divine  
Some silken moment  
Goes on forever  
And we're leaving  
Yeah we're leaving broken hearts behind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're eternally wild with the power  
To make every moment come alive  
All those stars that shine upon you  
And they'll kiss you every night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mystify  
Mystify me  
Mystify
