In the world's mighty gallery of pictures  
Hang the scenes that're painted from life  
There's pictures of love and of passion  
And there's pictures of keys and of strife  
  
There hung pictures of youth and of beauty  
Of old age and a blushing young bride  
They all hung on the wall but the saddest of all  
Are the pictures from life's other side  
  
Just a picture from life's other side  
Someone has fell by the way  
A life has gone out with the tide  
That might have been happy some day  
  
There's a poor old mother at home  
She's watching and waiting alone  
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear  
Just a picture from life's other side  
  
The first scene is that of a gambler  
Who had lost all of his money at play  
And he drowses dead mother's ring from his finger  
Which she wore long ago on her wedding day  
  
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it  
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide  
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead  
That's just a picture from life's other side  
  
Now the last scene is that by the river  
Of a heartbroken mother and baby  
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver  
On an outcast, soon no one will save  
  
And yet she was once a true woman  
She was somebody's darling and pride  
God help her she leaps, oh there's no one to weep  
It's just a picture from life's other side
