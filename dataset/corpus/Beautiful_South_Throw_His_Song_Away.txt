Verse one, he was pissed, an excuse that you probably missed  
'Cause his smile and his grace made your skirt ride high  
  
Verse two, still drunk and his breath most definitely stunk  
Of the lies and the shite he was spitting out  
  
Chorus:  
So won't you throw his song away  
Won't you throw his song away  
Won't you throw his song away  
  
Verse three, is the verse that'll make you smile  
And if you're able to hold back the bile and just kiss his hairy ear  
  
Verse four is as sad as a man ever gets  
Is a verse built to open your legs  
If you don't, if you don't, he'll retire  
  
Chorus  
  
You, you deserve higher than I can sing  
Deserve lower than the trumpet can swing  
You, you deserve all  
Me, I'm beyond all that ism and blues  
I'm beyond all that, I always lose  
Yes I fuck, but I win  
  
Chorus
