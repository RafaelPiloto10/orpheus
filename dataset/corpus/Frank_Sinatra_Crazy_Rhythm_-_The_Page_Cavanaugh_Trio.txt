Crazy rhythm, here's the doorway  
I'll go my way, you'll go your way  
Crazy rhythm, from now on, we're through  
  
Here is where we have a showdown  
I'm too high and you're too low down  
Crazy rhythm, here's goodbye to you  
  
They say that when a high brow meets a low brow  
Walking along Broadway  
Soon the high brow, he has no brow  
Ain't it a shame and you're to blame  
  
What's the use of our mission  
You produce the same condition  
Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too  
  
They say that when a high brow meets a low brow  
Walking along Broadway  
Soon the high brow, he has no brow  
Ain't it a shame and you're to blame  
  
What's the use of prohibition  
You produce the same condition  
Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too  
Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too  
Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too
