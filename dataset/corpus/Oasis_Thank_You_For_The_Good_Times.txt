Who will rise ?  
It would be so nice to hear you say  
"Thank you for the good times"  
Before the good times fly away  
Your eyes  
Are telling lies  
Some of the stories on the way  
But it's so nice  
But don't let the good times fly away  
  
I drink to every sucker standing here  
Among the few who try and cheat the years  
There's always one of us who's blown away  
Or strapped and stopped for breath along the way  
  
Who will rise?  
It would be so nice to hear you say  
"Thank you for the good times"  
Before the good times fly away  
  
I drink to every sucker standing here  
Among the few who try and cheat the years  
There's always one of us who's blown away  
Or stopped and strapped for cash along the way  
  
Who will rise?  
It would be so nice to hear you say  
"Thank you for the good times"  
Before the good times fly away  
  
Thank you for the good times  
Before the good times fly away  
  
Thank you for the good times  
Before the good times fly away
