Its Christmas and we walk alone,  
To strangers with noone to miss us,  
On our own,  
Out in the cold,  
  
Trudging onward,  
Braving a harsh winter storm,  
You and I met passing by,  
And now our spirits feel warm,  
I don't have anyone at home,  
To talk to,  
And you don't have anything to do,  
So I'll spend my Christmas with you,  
  
I'll spend my Christmas,  
  
It's Christmas,  
And we are in love,  
With the way that the soft snowflakes kiss us,  
From far above,  
The blustery breeze,  
  
Trudging onward,  
Braving a harsh winter storm,  
You and I met passing by and now our spirits feel warm,  
  
I believe,  
That Jesus is truly the only way,  
And I celebrate,  
Christmas because it's his birthday,  
  
I don't have anyone at home to talk to,  
And you don't have anything to do,  
So I'll spend my Christmas with you,  
  
I'll spend my Christmas with you,  
I'll spend my Christmas with you,  
I'll spend my Christmas with you.
