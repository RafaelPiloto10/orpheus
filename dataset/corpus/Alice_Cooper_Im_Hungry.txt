I got a head full of faces, a heart full of pain  
I got some bad ideas feeding my brain  
I got a night full of promise, a city full of prey  
Looks like everything is going my way  
I got an eye for the beauties and a mouth full of charm  
I got a tongue dripping poison tattooed on my arm  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something to eat  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something so sweet  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something to chew  
Something soft and tender, how 'bout you?  
I'm hungry  
I'm hungry  
Yeah, I'm hungry  
Oh, I'm hungry  
I got a smile for the lady that goes on my face  
I got a kiss on my lips that leads to my place  
I got a bed in my basement fit for two  
I got some chloroform and handcuffs just for you  
I'm hungry  
I'm hungry  
Yeah, I'm hungry  
Oh, I'm hungry  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something to eat  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something so sweet  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something to chew  
Something soft and tender, how 'bout you?  
I'm hungry  
I'm hungry  
Yeah, I'm hungry  
Oh, I'm hungry
