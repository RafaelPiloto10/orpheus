I ain't lookin' to compete with you,  
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,  
Simplify you, classify you,  
Deny, defy or crucify you.  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you.  
  
No, and I ain't lookin' to fight with you,  
Frighten you or uptighten you,  
Drag you down or drain you down,  
Chain you down or bring you down.  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you.  
  
I ain't lookin' to block you up  
Shock or knock or lock you up,  
Analyze you, categorize you,  
Finalize you or advertise you.  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you.  
  
I don't want to straight-face you,  
Race or chase you, track or trace you,  
Or disgrace you or displace you,  
Or define you or confine you.  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you.  
  
I don't want to meet your kin,  
Make you spin or do you in,  
Or select you or dissect you,  
Or inspect you or reject you.  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you.  
  
I don't want to fake you out,  
Take or shake or forsake you out,  
I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me,  
See like me or be like me.  
All I really want to do  
Is, baby, be friends with you.
