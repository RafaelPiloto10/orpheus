Way down in the state of Georgia  
Through the swamps and everglades  
There's a hole in Tiger Mountain  
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave.  
  
I had a girl (had a girl)  
In Waycross, Georgia (Waycross, Georgia) but she had unfaithful ways  
Made me feel (made me feel) I was unwanted (so unwanted)  
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave.  
  
I couldn't stand the way she did me  
Couldn't take her low down ways  
Before I'd stay with a cheatin' woman  
I'll go live the bears in Miller's Cave.  
  
I caught her out (caught her out) one Sunday morning (Sunday morning)  
With a man they call Big Dave  
Meanest man (meanest man) in Waycross, Georgia (Waycross, Georgia)  
I'd rather fight a Mountain Lion in Miller's Cave.  
  
I said you'll pay, both you and Davey  
I must see you in your grave  
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em  
I took their cheatin', schemin' bones to Miller's Cave.  
  
That woman made (woman made) me feel unwanted (so unwanted)  
But I showed 'em I was brave  
Most wanted man in the state of Georgia  
But they'll never find me 'cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave.  
  
Dark cold, cave, Miller's Cave.
