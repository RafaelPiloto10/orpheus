"You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light.  
Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime.  
As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into consciousness
remembering all you have learned.  
When I tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present,  
feeling peaceful and refreshed.  
Open your eyes, Nicholas."  
  
Friday evening  
The blood still on my hands  
To think that she would leave me now  
For that ungrateful man  
  
Sole survivor  
No witness to the crime  
I must act fast to cover up  
I think that there's still time  
  
He'd seem hopeless and lost with this note  
They'll buy into the words that I wrote  
  
"This feeling inside me  
Finally found my love, I've finally broke free  
No longer torn in two  
I'd take my own life before losing you"  
  
Feeling good this Friday afternoon  
I ran into Julian  
Said we'd get together soon  
  
He's always had my heart  
He needs to know  
I'll break free of the Miracle  
It's time for him to go  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my love, I've finally broke free  
No longer torn in two  
He'd kill his brother if he only knew  
  
Their love renewed  
They'd rendezvous  
In a pathway out of view  
They thought no one knew  
Then came a shot out of the night  
  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
Until we fade away  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
We fade away  
  
As their bodies lie still  
And the ending draws near  
Spirits rise through the air  
All their fears disappear, it all becomes clear  
A blinding light comes into view  
An old soul exchanged for a new  
A familiar voice comes shining through  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my life, I'm finally free  
No longer torn in two  
I learned about my life by living through you  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my life, I'm finally free  
No longer torn in two  
Living my own life by learning from you  
  
We'll meet again my friend someday soon  
  
"News in London, France, Russia and Italy have deleted their  
lead story, all anticipating the outcome of the man considered to  
be a member of American nobility. And as you can imagine, as  
the skies have grown darker here over Washington, the mood  
has grown darker as well and people here are beginning to  
resign themselves to the possibility that they are witnessing yet  
another tragedy in a long string of misfortunes. Reaction from

"Open your eyes, Nicholas."  
  
"AAAH!"
