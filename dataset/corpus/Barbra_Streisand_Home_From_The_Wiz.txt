When I think of home, I think of a place  
Where there's love overflowing  
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there  
With the things I've been knowin'  
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning  
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning  
Sprinkling the sea  
Makes it all clean  
  
Maybe there's a way for me to go back  
Now that I have some direction  
It would sure be nice to back home  
Where there's love and affection  
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up  
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up  
Time be my friend  
Let me start again  
  
Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face  
But I still know where I'm goin'  
I have had my mind spun around in space  
And yet I've watched it growin'  
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know  
If we should believe the things that we see  
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?  
Or is better just to let things be?  
  
Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy  
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me  
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find  
A world full of love like yours and mine  
Like home
