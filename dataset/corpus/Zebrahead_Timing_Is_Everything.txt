If I didn't know better, I would swear you don't care  
Throw yourself around, hold me down  
I can see through you  
You're so fucking bull-headed, tormented, I don't get it  
Thrown your weight around, hold me down  
I can see right through you  
Timing here is everything and everything means everything  
I can see right through you  
Timing here is everything and everything means everything  
I can see right through you  
Timing here is everything and everything means everything  
I can see right  
Think I'm gonna be sick  
You take anything to get through  
You always got something to prove  
And you want it all  
What you got ain't enough  
What you got ain't enough  
What you got ain't enough  
Come on come on, alright alright  
If I didn't know better, I would swear you don't care  
Throw yourself around, hold me down  
I can see through you  
You're so fucking bull-headed, tormented, I don't get it
