YOU BROKE YOUR OWN HEART  
WRITERS HANK WILLIAMS, HANK WILLIAMS JR.  
You're letter says you're unhappy we're many miles apart  
It's a little late to ask for pity,  
Remember you broke your own heart  
You walked out on the heart that loved you, has no pity from the start  
You cheated and lied and now you're gonna cry,  
Remember you broke your own heart  
A heart can stand so much sorrow and then it bends and breaks  
And a love that is honest and true can turn to bitter hate  
Now that you're gone and lonely, and your dreams have fallen apart  
Think of the one that once loved you,  
Remember you broke your own heart
