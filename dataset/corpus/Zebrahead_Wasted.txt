Gotta get up  
Gotta open my eyes  
I'm swimming through this haze  
That's been around me for days  
Don't want to come down  
But you were always around  
And everyone's so strange  
There's nothing that they can change  
  
Take my hand  
Show me how this all fits in your plan  
Understand  
That I don't need you  
I just need to  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feel how does it feel  
To crush the world in two  
One last time  
And I  
Am wasted  
Feel how does it feel  
To scream with out a sound  
One more time  
And I'm  
Still wasted  
  
Get me away  
I'm thinking maybe someday  
You'll find out who I am  
But you don't give a damn  
Closing my eyes  
It's all the same to me  
What I don't want to know  
Is what I'm not going to see  
  
Take my hand  
Show me how this all fits in your plan  
Understand  
That I don't need you  
I just need to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Watch the world stop  
I drop put my finger on it  
Thinking back to the day you said  
I could get up on it  
Say that you have changed  
I'm the same just a little louded  
Comin' in out of phase lost my place  
Now I know I've blown it  
Fall into a sea of your distress  
And I confess that  
I take less than your best  
But you don't want  
To give it away today  
Blue sky gray  
Nothing that you say  
Take another trip  
Take another fall  
Take it all away  
  
[Chorus: x2]
