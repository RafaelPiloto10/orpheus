Hey, some kinds of love  
Margarita told Tom  
Between thought and expression  
lies a lifetime  
Situations arise  
because of the weather  
And no kinds of love  
are better than others  
la-dee-ta-ta-ta  
  
Hey, some kinds of love  
now Margarita told Tom  
Well of course, baby, you're a bore  
but at that you're not charmless  
Because a bore is a straight line  
finds a wealth in division  
And no kinds of love  
mistaken for vision  
la-dee-ta  
  
Some kinds of love  
now Margarita told Tom  
They turn to division  
woh baby, you're not charming  
Oh baby, ....  
  
And no kinds of love  
mistaken for vision  
Put jelly on your shoulder  
oh baby, lies down upon the carpet  
Put jelly on your shoulder  
let's do what you fear most  
That from which you recoil  
but still makes your eyes moist  
Put jelly, baby, on your shoulder  
lies down, now baby, on the carpet, ooohhh  
Ooohhh-ooohhh, ooohhh  
ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh, ooohhh-ooohhh  
  
Well some kinds of love  
they're mistaken for vision  
  
Well I don't know, baby, what it's all about  
Oh little baby, why don't you come back  
hey, la-dee-ta-ta-ta  
Oh no Lord, ta-li-ta-li-sha  
oh now baby, la-dee-ta-ta  
Oh baby, la-dee-ta, ta-ti-ta-ti-ta  
da-ti-da-ti-ta, la-ta-ta
