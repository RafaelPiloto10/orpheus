Who'll take the only hearts they got  
And throw them into the fire?  
Who'll risk their own self respect  
In the name of desire?  
Who'll regret everything they've done  
And who will get the bill?  
  
Lovers will  
Who'll hurt each other all the time  
And never give it a thought?  
Who'll lie about where they've been  
And hope they never get caught?  
Who'll say each other's kisses  
No longer thrill?  
Lovers will  
Lovers will do almost anything  
  
For the thrill that only love can bring  
If love is a healer, who'll be the first ones ill?  
Lovers will  
  
Who'll never know what they've got  
Until it's just about gone?  
And whose arms will gather up what's left  
To carry on?  
  
And who'll stalk that little bit of love  
That hasn't been killed?  
Lovers will
