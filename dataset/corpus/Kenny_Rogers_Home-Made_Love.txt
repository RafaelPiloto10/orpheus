Homemade love just like mama used to make  
Homemade love that's what she used to say  
You can satisfy frustration and the same old one night stand  
But there ain't nothing quite as good as homemade love  
Homemade love all the cold and lonely nights  
Feel so good when your woman makes it right  
And she knows just how to please in each and every way  
There ain't nothing quite as good as homemade love  
Homemade love love home ain't nothing without love her sweet love  
And you know it won't be over she'll be there every day  
Homemade love take it with you when you go  
Homemade love let everybody know  
That your woman ain't to please as she's headed straight for you  
There ain't nothing quite as good as homemade love  
Homemade love love home ain't nothing...
