Take me backwards  
Turn me around  
Cannot find my balance  
On the ground  
This world is too heavy  
For a feather falling quickly  
  
And I wrote your story  
But I'm afraid of how it ends  
And though my friends are doing well  
And I'm still on the mend  
  
I'm going to lay back down  
Hope the wind takes me around  
I gotta find some courage in this town  
'Cause nobody's going to save  
Somebody who won't change  
I tried to be brave  
  
Nothing's coming easy  
And all at once  
I feel a little queasy  
Oh but if you lost my remedy  
Won't you please come and be with me  
It's not like there's much better  
But his grasp is as green as mine  
I can't say that I'm satisfied  
Three thousand miles from your kiss goodbye  
  
I'm going to lay back down  
Hope the wind takes me around  
I gotta find some courage in this town  
And everybody's afraid  
'Cause chances come from change  
And everybody's afraid  
Cause chances come from breaking  
That chances are you're breaking open  
  
I'm going to lay back down  
Hope the wind takes me around  
I gotta find some courage in this town  
'Cause nobody's going to save  
Somebody who won't change  
It's time to be brave
