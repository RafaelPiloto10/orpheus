If you got to make a fool of somebody  
If you got to make a fool of someone  
Do you really gotta hurt me  
I'm the one that'll worry  
  
If you got to make a fool of somebody  
If you got to make a fool of someone  
Do you really gotta hurt me  
I'm the one that'll worry  
  
Daytime night time  
Anytime at all  
I'll be there waiting  
Anytime you call  
Just to be near you  
You know  
That anywhere I'll go  
How could you hurt me so
