Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day  
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf  
But let me tell you I got news for you  
And you'll soon find out it's true  
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself  
'Cause I'm already gone  
And I'm feelin' strong  
I will sing this vict'ry song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo,hoo,hoo  
  
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why  
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right  
But remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky  
You can see the stars and still not see the light (that's right)  
  
And I'm already gone (I'm already gone)  
And I'm feelin' strong (now I'm feelin' strong)  
I will sing this vict'ry song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo, hoo,hoo  
  
Well I know it wasn't you who held me down  
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free (oh baby)  
So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains  
And we never even know we have the key  
Oh no  
  
But me, I'm already gone (I'm already gone)  
And I'm feelin' strong (now I'm feelin' strong)  
I will sing this vict'ry song  
'Cause I'm already gone  
'Cause I'm already gone  
And I'm feelin' strong  
I will sing this vict'ry song  
'Cause I'm already gone  
'Cause I'm already gone  
'Cause I'm already gone
