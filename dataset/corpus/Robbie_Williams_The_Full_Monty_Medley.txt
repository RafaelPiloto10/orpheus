You've done it all, you've broken every code  
And pulled the Rebel to the floor  
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say  
For only metal - what a bore!  
Blue eyes, blue eyes, how come you tell so many lies?  
  
Come up and see me, make me smile  
Or do what you want, run on wild  
Come up and see me, make me smile  
Or do what you want, run on wild  
  
MR TOM JONES!  
Baby take off your coat (Tell 'em Tom!)  
Real slow  
Baby take off your shoes  
I'll help you take off your shoes  
  
You give me reason to live  
You give me reason to live  
You give me reason to live  
You give me reason to live

You gotta know how to pony  
Like Mony Baronie.  
Mashed potato,  
Do the alligator.  
Put your hand on your hip,  
Let your backbone slip.  
Do the Watusi  
Like your Aunt Lucy.  
  
Na na na na na...

Put your hand on your hip,  
Let your backbone slip.
