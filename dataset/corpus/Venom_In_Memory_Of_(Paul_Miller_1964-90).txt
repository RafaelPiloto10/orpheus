He was in life as he was in death  
A well remebered man  
His life was taken like a sudden breath  
That simply wasn't planned  
And all that's left to say  
Written on his grave it says:  
In Memory Of  
In all the essence of a friendship he,  
Was never so cold or sad  
He tried so hard as he struggled in  
What little time he had  
No more return to home  
Written on his stone it says  
In Memory Of  
And now he's gone all that's left behind  
Is a legacy  
In the pages of a magazine  
Eft in time to read  
The only thing that's said  
A memory of his life  
Written at it's head it says  
All this left behind
