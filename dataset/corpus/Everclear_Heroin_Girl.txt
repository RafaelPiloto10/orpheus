I used to know a girl  
She had two pierced nipples and a black tattoo  
We'd drink that Mexican beer  
We'd live on Mexican food  
Yeah, I wish I could go back  
Yes, back in time  
  
Esther used to be the kind of girl that you would  
Never leave  
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my  
Disease  
She'd do anything  
  
I can hear them talking in the real world  
But they don't understand that I'm happy in hell  
With my heroin girl  
Yeah, with a heroin girl  
  
Esther used to be the kind of lover you would  
Never leave  
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my  
Disease  
She'd do anything  
  
I can hear them talking in the real world  
But they don't understand that I'm losing myself  
In a white-trash hell  
Lost inside a heroin girl  
Yeah, with a heroin girl, yeah yeah  
  
They found her out in the fields  
About a mile from home  
Her face was warm from the sun  
But her body was cold  
I heard a policeman say  
Just another overdose  
Just another overdose!  
  
Esther used to be the kind of lover you would  
Never leave  
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my  
Disease  
She would do anything
