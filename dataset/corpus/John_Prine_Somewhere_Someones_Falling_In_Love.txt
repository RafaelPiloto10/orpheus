Well, I got time on my hands and I got you on my mind  
And the moon and the stars up above  
There's a warm summer breeze  
Blowing down through the trees  
And somewhere someone's falling in love  
Well, if this world where we live is the only one we have  
Then there's only one thing I'm thinking of  
Let's go for that ride - keep our eyes open wide  
Cause somewhere someone's falling in love  
  
Chorus:  
You may be looking for someone  
Someone may be looking for you  
Someday you'll awaken and open your eyes  
And love will be looking at you  
  
So don't get down on yourself.  
No and don't lose your faith  
Believe these words that I'm singing of  
For as sure as the day that you were born  
Somewhere someone's falling in love  
  
[Repeat Chorus:]  
So don't get down on yourself.  
No, and don't lose your faith  
Believe these words that I'm singing of  
For as sure as the day that you were born  
Somewhere someone's falling in love  
Yeah, for as sure as the day that you were born  
Somewhere someone's falling  
Somewhere someone's falling  
Somewhere someone's falling in love
