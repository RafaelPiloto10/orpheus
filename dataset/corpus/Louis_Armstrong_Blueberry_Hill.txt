I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill  
On Blueberry Hill when I found you  
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill  
And lingered until my dreams came true  
  
The wind in the willow played  
Love's sweet melody  
But all of those vows we made  
Were never to be  
  
Though we're apart, you're part of me still  
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill  
  
(I found my thrill) Come climb the hill with me, baby  
(On Blueberry Hill) We'll see what we shall see  
(On Blueberry Hill) I'll bring my horn with me  
(When I found you) I'll be wit' you where berries are blue  
(The moon stood still) Each afternoon we'll go  
(On Blueberry Hill) Higher than the moon we'll go  
(And lingered until) Then, to a weddin' in June we'll go  
(My dreams came true) Ba-ba-da-de-buzz-buzz va-de-n-da-day  
  
The wind in the willow played (do you really love me)  
Love's sweet melody (as I love you?)  
But all of those vows we made (will you still remember)  
Were never to be (when the night is through?)  
  
Though we're apart, you're part of me still  
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
