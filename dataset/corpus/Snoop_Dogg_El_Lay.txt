LA, Sunset Boulevard, Pacific Highway  
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali  
Don't go 'less you go hard  
Go 'less you go hard  
  
Hollywood, downtime and back  
Life is always good  
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood  
You knew that it never would  
Knew that it never would  
  
Lakers, Dodgers, Ducks, Kings, Angels, Clippers  
Real set trippers, clarify ride, we bonafide dippers  
ESPN, you know Sports Centre  
Spooned and groomed, dipped and wet,  
Home of the NBA championship  
Purple and gold, homie let the story be told  
It's the city where you shoot your favorite television episode  
And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard  
But you gotta have a low-rider car  
With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin'  
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon  
That's how we represent it though  
Birthplace of Chevrolet '64, yeah I love showing it out  
First things first my nig', you better know where you at  
You in  
  
LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway  
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali  
Don't go 'less you go hard  
Go 'less you go hard  
  
Hollywood, downtime and back  
Life is always good  
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood  
You knew that it never would  
You knew that it never would  
  
Riding on the 405  
On my way to pick up baby  
85 in the winter time  
Man, this place is crazy  
I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it  
Summer time in Cali  
  
Rollin' down Fairfax  
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico  
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes  
I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues  
About 9 o'clock stop by the record shop  
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball  
Life is a mystery, my life is like history  
Stop by my dispensary, give me some kush and pusha  
Put it in the trunk, smelling like a skunk  
But it's all legal in LA, everybody taking a hit  
From the politicians, athletes and even the teachers  
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher  
He say "Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya"  
Yeah, I love showing you that  
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at  
You in  
  
LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway  
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali  
Don't go 'less you go hard  
Go 'less you go hard  
  
Hollywood, downtime and back  
Life is always good  
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood  
You knew that it never would  
Knew that it never would  
LA
