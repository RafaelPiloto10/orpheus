I haven't seen you in forever  
You haven't changed a bit  
You didn't think that I'd remember  
But how could I forget  
  
We sang 'Bobby McGee' on the hood of my car  
Made a wish on every star  
In that clear September sky  
One bottle of wine, two Dixie cups  
At three a.m. I fell in love  
For the first time in my life  
And that's somethin'  
That just don't happen twice  
  
To this day I still taste that first kiss  
How I prayed it wouldn't end  
In a way seeing you like this  
I guess it never really did  
  
We sang 'Bobby McGee' on the hood of my car  
Made a wish on every star  
In that clear September sky  
One bottle of wine, two Dixie cups  
At three a.m. I fell in love  
For the first time in my life  
And that's somethin'  
That just don't happen twice  
  
One bottle of wine, two Dixie cups  
At three a.m. I fell in love  
For the first time in my life  
And that's somethin'  
That just don't happen twice  
  
That's somethin', baby that's somethin'  
Oh that's somethin'  
That just don't happen twice
