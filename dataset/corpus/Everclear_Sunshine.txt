Roll and tumble with your big heart falling  
You're rolling tumbling alone  
Beats forever what your dirty hand's holding  
You reach for something you will never know  
Heard you singing in a taco bell bathroom  
Heard you singing a cheap trick song  
Yeah, we sang surrender all the way the county line  
When I listen to that music  
It makes me think of summertime  
Yeah, that acid summer  
We were wasted and happy  
We were laughing in the sunshine  
(sunshine)  
  
Twist and turn with your bright eye shining  
Twist and turn in the california sun  
Wait forever for the life you dream of  
You wait for something that will never come  
You twist and turn in the slow motion daydream  
You twist and turn in your own sweet hell  
I don't get too close to the fire anymore  
But when I think of you now, it makes me think of summertime  
Yeah, that acid summer  
We were wasted and happy  
We laughing in the sunshine  
Laughing in the sunshine  
Laughing in the sunshine  
Laughing in the sunshine  
In the sunshine  
  
Twist and turn with your bright eyes shining  
Twist and turn in the california sun  
Wait forever for the life you dream of  
You wait for something that will never come  
You twist and turn in the slow motion freefall  
You twist and turn in your own good time  
I can't watch you twisting and turning anymore  
No I never thought a good time would turn into a lifestyle  
No I just can't watch you wait anymore  
But when I think of that summertime  
It always seem to make me smile  
(smile)  
Yeah, that acid summer  
We were wasted and happy  
We were laughing in the sunshine  
(go!)  
We were laughing in the sunshine  
(go!)  
Laughing in the sunshine  
(go!)  
Laughing in the sunshine  
(go!)
