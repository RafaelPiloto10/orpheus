[Verse 1]  
Stuck in the jet wash,  
Bad trip I couldn't get off.  
And maybe I bit off more than I could chew,  
And overhead of the aqua blue.  
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture,  
Blessed be the boys time can't capture.  
On film or between the sheets,  
I always fall from your window,  
To the pitch black streets.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And with the black banners raised,  
As the crooked smiles fade.  
Former heroes who quit too late,  
Just wanna fill up the trophy case again.  
  
[Chorus]  
And in the end, I'd do it all again!  
I think you're my best friend,  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
I'll be yours, when it rains it pours, stay thirsty like before,  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm not passive but aggressive,  
Take note, it's not impressive.  
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse on my bedroom floor,  
We put your curse in reverse.  
And it's our time now if you want to to be,  
Maul the world like the carnival bears set free.  
And your love is anemic and I can't believe,  
That you couldn't see it coming from me.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I still feel that rush in my veins,  
It twists my head just a bit too thin.  
All those people I see in those old photographs I've seen are dead.  
  
[Chorus]  
And in the end, I'd do it all again!  
I think you're my best friend.  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
I'll be yours, when it rains it pours, stay thirsty like before,  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
  
[Bridge]  
And sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah  
And let your dirty sadness fill me up, just like a balloon  
  
[Outro]  
And in the end, I'd do it all again,  
I think you're my best friend.  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
I'll be yours, when it rains it pours, stay thirsty like before,  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?
