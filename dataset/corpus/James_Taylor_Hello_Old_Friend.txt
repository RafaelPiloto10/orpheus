Paris' rooftops were lovely to see  
Switzerland's vertical landscape  
Crossed my mind's eye just now  
Canada's shoreline has been calling out to me  
But it's been too long a time  
Since last I crossed  
That vast nantucket sound  
Refrain  
Hello old friend  
Welcome me home again  
Well, I've been away  
But that's all over now  
Say I can stay for October, now  
Stay a while and play  
Little dog david  
I must look like a fool  
I should've remembered  
You'd be forgetting my smell, well  
Give me a week or two to recapture my cool  
I've got stories to tell  
About how I snatched the devil's catch  
And out ran the hounds of hell  
Refrain
