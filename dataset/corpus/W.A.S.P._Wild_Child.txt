I ride, I ride the winds that bring the rain  
A creature of love and can't be tamed  
I want you, cause I'm gonna take your love from him  
And I'll touch your face and hot burning skin  
No, he'll never ever touch you like I do  
So look in my eyes and burn alive the truth  
  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I want you  
  
Tell me, tell me the lies you're telling him when you  
Run away 'cause I want to know  
Cause I, I'm sure it's killing him to find  
That you run to me when he let's you go  
Cause I'm burning, burning, burning up with fire  
So come turn me on and turn the flames up higher  
  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I want you  
  
A naked hit machine, I want your love  
When the moons arise we'll feel just what it does  
  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I'm a wild child, come and love me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
I want you  
My heart's in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I want you
