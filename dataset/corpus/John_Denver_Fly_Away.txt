All of her days have gone soft and cloudy  
All of her dreams have gone dry  
All of her nights have gone sad and shady  
She's getting ready to fly  
  
Fly away fly away fly away.  
  
Life in the city can make you crazy  
For sounds of the sand and the sea  
Life in a high-rise can make you hungry  
For things that you can't even see  
  
Fly away, fly away, fly away.  
  
In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she  
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere  
That she'd rather be.  
  
She's looking for lovers and children playing  
She's looking for signs of the spring  
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing  
She listens for any old things  
  
Fly away, fly away, fly away.
