Every night I say my prayers  
Like throwing confetti in the air  
I don't need perfect, but I'll take fair  
I've learned to drive while I cry  
Figured out the answer's always why  
I've been brave and I've been scared  
  
I'm just a girl like you  
I'm just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But that's a chance I gotta take  
Just like you did  
  
Do what I can to survive  
Back and forth from a woman to a child  
I'm coming up for air  
We're not all that far apart  
Both fragile works of art  
See the colors that we share  
  
But, I'm just a girl like you  
I'm just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But that's a chance I gotta take  
Just like you did  
  
Oh I've always believed in him and me  
I get you, I wish that you'd get me  
  
Yeah well, I'm just a girl like you  
I'm just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But that's a chance I gotta take  
Just like you did  
  
Oh, I'm just a girl like you  
I'm just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But that's a chance I gotta take  
Just like you
