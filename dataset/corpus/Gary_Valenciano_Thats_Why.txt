Why, why?  
'Cause I'm the type of guy  
Who believes in a Spirit I can't see with my eyes  
You can't deny, even if you try  
The one who created you, the earth and the sky  
I'm a baptized disciple, so I shall not tell a lie  
I've got the Holy Spirit, now I'm flyin' high  
Now while I'm rippin' a record take a second  
Do me a favor (make the Lord Jesus Christ your saviour)  
Yes, I must confess, I had a lot of stress  
On my chest - I was a mess  
But now I'm blessed  
By the Lord Jesus Christ being in my life  
Now I'm a whole new guy  
Go tell 'em that's why  
Refrain:  
Maybe you've seen the change - that's why  
Things are not the same - that's why  
Things just happen when you call upon His name - that's why  
Maybe you want the change - that's why  
Maybe you want the same - that's why  
Maybe you'd better call upon His name  
Yeah  
Bridge:  
So light (so light), so free  
That's what I feel now, that I've got the Lord in me  
So right (so right), so real  
Nothing in the world can make me feel  
What I'm feeling now  
Now it's time, time to open up  
Your heart and your mind  
That's why I'm here bustin' this rhyme  
So can you hear me?  
(Just tryin' to save your soul)  
Well can you feel me?  
(Let the Lord take control)  
Then the life you think will be eternal  
Instead it's gonna be inside hell's inferno  
Now get it straight, don't wait  
Hesitate or procrastinate  
The Lord's comin' back, don't wait  
So light (so light), so free  
That's what I feel now, that I've got the Lord in me  
Maybe you've seen the change - that's why  
Things are not the same - t
