I was deprived of a young girl's dream  
By the cruel force of nature from the blue  
Instead of a night full of romance supreme  
All I got was a runny nose and Asiatic flu  
  
It's raining on prom night  
My hair is a mess  
It's running all over  
My taffeta dress  
  
It's wiltin' the quiltin'  
In my maiden-form  
And mascara flows  
Right down my nose  
Because of the storm  
  
I don't even have  
My corsage, oh gee  
It fell down the sewer  
With my sister's I.D  
  
Yes, it's raining on prom night  
Oh my darling, what can I do?  
I miss you  
It's raining rain from the skies  
And it's raining real tears from my eyes over you  
  
Oh, dear God, make him feel  
The same way I do right now  
Make him want to see me again  
  
Oh, what can I do?  
It's raining rain from the skies  
It's raining tears from my eyes over you  
Raining, oh, tears from my eyes over you  
  
Raining, oh, raining on prom night  
Oh, raining, oh, tears from my eyes over you  
Raining
