Well I can't forget this evening  
Though your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes the sorrow show  
Yes it shows  
And I can't forget tomorrow  
When I think of all your sorrow  
When I had you there  
and then let you go  
And now it's only fair that I should let you know  
Yeah -- gotta know  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't give I can't give anymore  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't give I can't give anymore  
Well I can't forget this evening  
though your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows  
yes it shows  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't give I can't give anymore no no more  
(repeat chorus)
