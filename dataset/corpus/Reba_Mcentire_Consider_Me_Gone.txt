Every time I turn the conversation to something deeper  
Than the weather I can feel you all but shuttin' down.  
And when I need an explanation for the silence you  
Just tell me you don't wanna talk about it now.  
  
What you're not saying is coming in loud  
And clear we're at a crossroads here  
  
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose  
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you  
If you don't get drunk on my kiss  
If you think you can do better than this then I guess we're done  
Let's not drag this on  
Consider me gone  
  
With you I've always been wide open like a window or an ocean.  
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide.  
So when you leave me not knowin' where you're goin'  
I start thinkin' that we're lookin' we're lookin' at goodbye.  
  
How about a strong shot of honesty  
Don't you owe that to me  
  
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose  
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you  
If you don't get drunk on my kiss  
If you think you can do better than this then I guess we're done  
Let's not drag this on  
Consider me gone.  
  
Consider me a memory.  
Consider me the past.  
Consider me a smile in an old photograph  
Someone who used to make you laugh.  
  
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose  
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you  
Then I guess we're done let's not drag this on.  
Consider me gone.  
Consider me gone.  
Consider me gone.  
Just consider me gone.
