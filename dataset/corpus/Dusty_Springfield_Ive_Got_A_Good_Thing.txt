(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing going  
Take the sun and take the moon  
And stars that shine so bright  
All I need is my guy  
And everything's all right  
Everything about him thrills me  
The way he looks at me just kills me  
He's got a way of getting to me  
Every kiss just goes right through me  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing  
(I got a good thing)  
You know I got a good thing, baby  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing going  
Take the rainbow from the sky  
Oh, I don't really care  
I will have a pot of gold  
As long as he is there  
I never knew such sweet affection  
And it's all in my direction  
If he left there's no mistaking  
My poor heart would start to break and  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing  
(I got a good thing)  
You know I got a good thing going, yeah  
You know I got a good thing, yeah  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing, yeah  
(I got a good thing)  
You know I got a good thing going  
(I got a good thing)  
You know I got a sweet thing baby  
(I got a good thing)  
Everything is everything, baby  
(I got a good thing)  
Everything is uptight, all right, out of sight  
(I got a good thing)  
Know I got a ooh, oh, sweet, sweet thing  
(I got a good thing)  
Sweet mmm  
(I got a good thing)
