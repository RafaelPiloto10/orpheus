"I think I'll sing you a little ballad  
It's a new one. I just learnt it. oh, I hope you like it."  
Got my mother's eyes and my father's hair  
Does anybody really care?  
It's gettin' cold out here  
  
Well, I keep walkin' with my head held high  
With my head to the sky  
With my mother's eyes  
  
And my mother's eyes are with me  
In the darkness that's been paid for  
I'm just a nameless stranger, don't know why  
  
Have I seen all that I could?  
Have I seen more than I should  
With my mother's eyes?  
  
And my mother's eyes are with me  
In the chilly winds of autumn  
If I ain't here by winter, she'll know why  
  
I've seen all that I dare  
I've seen more than my share  
Forgive me if I stare with my mother's eyes
