It's Christmas time  
I see the lines of people everywhere tryin' to pick out the gifts  
That show how much they care  
It makes me wish that I could see my friends on Christmas Day  
And fill my list with lots of gifts but I can only say  
  
Here comes a merry Christmas strait to you  
I hope it cheers you up when you are down and feelin' blue  
Right or wrong I'll sing my song and you will know just who sings  
A merry Christmas strait to you  
  
There's lot of ways to share the days of Christmas with your friends  
A Christmas card, a tree that stars and gifts that make you grin  
I'd like to share this song with everyone who came our way  
Without a doubt the fires not out it burns for you today  
  
So here's a merry Christmas strait to you  
I hope it cheers you up when you are down and feeling blue  
You've been so kind you crossed my mind and nothing less will do  
Here's a merry Christmas strait to you  
  
Here comes a merry Christmas  
And to all who might have missed us  
A very, merry Christmas strait to you
