I'm blind with eyes wide open  
My body's tired and broken  
I want a taste of something, that doesn't leave me dry  
This hope for answered questions  
As rare as true conviction  
I stare into the distance, there is no truth in sight  
Who can tell me why  
Everybody's looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see  
A blue sky waiting for me  
I've seen the main attraction  
I've felt the moment's passion  
I won't be no soap box teacher, just taking your time  
Just taking your time  
Who can tell me why  
Everybody's looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see  
A blue sky  
Everywhere I go, it feels like I'm always searching for something  
'Til I know for sure, I'll be right here waiting for something  
More, more, for something more, for something more  
Everybody's looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see  
Somewhere there's a blue sky waiting  
Everybody's looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that there's got to be a blue sky waiting for me  
A blue sky
