Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man  
Putting end to evil doers games  
Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man  
Maybe you are in his book of names  
Maybe you are in his book of names  
So be kind and helpful to your mother  
Just think twice before you try and steal  
When he cuts with sticky silver snippers  
You may find the wounds will never heal  
All self made bad boys  
If you refuse to believe he exist  
You won't be frightened when you find out  
You're on his list  
You're on his list  
You're on his list  
So be good and never poison people  
Just think twice before the deed is done  
When you wake up guilty in the morning  
You may find important pieces gone
