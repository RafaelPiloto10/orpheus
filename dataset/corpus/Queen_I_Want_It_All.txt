Adventure seeker on an empty street  
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet  
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt  
With the pain and anger can't see a way out  
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say  
Gotta find me a future move out of my way  
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now  
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now  
  
Listen all you people, come gather round  
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground  
But just give me, huh, what I know is mine  
People do you hear me, just gimme the sign  
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth  
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth  
  
I want it all (give it all - I want it all)  
I want it all (yeah)  
I want it all and I want it now  
  
I want it all (yes I want it all)  
I want it all hey  
I want it all and I want it now  
  
I'm a man with a one track mind  
So much to do in one lifetime (people do you hear me)  
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies  
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all  
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all  
Oooh oh yeah yeah - ha ha ha ha ha  
Yeah yeah yeah yeaaah  
I want it all  
  
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth  
Here's to the future  
Hear the cry of youth (hear the cry of youth) (hear the cry of youth)  
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all and I want it now  
  
I want it all yeah yeah yeaaaah  
I want it all, I want it all and I want it now  
Oh oh oh oh oooh  
  
And I want it - now  
I want it, I want it  
Ooooh ha
