Woke up sweating in the sun  
Sprawled across my big brother's grave  
Shaking and drunk with sleep  
I crawled to my feet and walked up into the shade  
Of a young elm tree that must have been planted since the last we came  
Vicki, my mom, and me, cleaned the dirt  
From the plaque that says his name  
Walking to my girlfriend's car  
Came back down on me  
Yeah, I guess I fell to my knees  
To keep from falling face-first into the dream  
The vision that had had me twisting out under the afternoon sky  
I didn't know it then  
But it was thirteen years to the day he died  
  
He held his hand in me  
Like brothers we walked  
Through the colorless world of an alcohol dream  
I talked for hours  
Trying the break through the silence  
That he held over me  
Then he started away, turned his head  
Keep it up so you can die like me  
  
Ever since my brother odied  
I've drifted all over from town to town to town  
Every place I go it's always the same  
I keep doing junk, I keep going down  
My mama got religion and my sisters gave up  
Man I just gave up too  
I just died inside  
Don't wanna die like george  
Everybody says there's things to see  
Everybody's pointing their fingers at me  
  
I woke up driving  
After another blackout from another bad drug  
I can't shake this hell that I made for myself  
For every other life I took  
See my sister's son walk the line I walked  
He's only sixteen  
If he don't learn from my mistakes  
He's gonna waste away  
He's gonna die like me
