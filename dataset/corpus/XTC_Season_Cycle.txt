Season cycle moving round and round  
Pushing life up from a cold dead ground  
It's growing green  
It's growing green, well  
Darling don't you ever stop to wonder  
About the clouds about the hail and thunder  
'Bout the baby and its umbilical  
Who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle?  
  
Summer chased by Autumn  
Autumn chased by Winter  
Season cycle go from death to life  
Winter chased by Springtime  
Bring a harvest or a man his wife  
Springtime's turning  
It's growing green  
It's growing green, well  
Darling, don't you ever sit and ponder  
Darling did you ever think  
About the building of the hills a yonder  
All this life stuff's closely linked  
Where we're going in this verdant spiral  
Who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle?  
Round and round and round and round  
  
I really get confused on who would make all this  
Is there a God in Heaven  
Everybody says join our religion get to Heaven  
I say no thanks why bless my soul  
I'm already there!  
  
Autumn is royal  
As Spring is clown  
But to repaint Summer  
They're closing Winter down  
  
Darling don't you ever stop to wonder  
Darling did you ever think  
About the clouds about the hail and thunder  
All this life stuff's closely linked  
About the baby and its umbilical  
Who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle?  
Season cycle  
Darling, don't you ever sit and ponder  
Darling did you ever think  
About the building of the hills a yonder  
All this life stuff's closely linked  
Where we're going in the verdant spiral  
Who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle?
