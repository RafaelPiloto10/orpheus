I see my future shuffling  
A shaky step at a time  
I got no choice but careful  
Thank God I've done my crime  
The tools I see on TV  
Can't stand it when they fake  
A prick's a prick at any age  
Why give one a break?  
  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live live live live live  
  
The soul is in the eyeball  
For anyone to see  
I'm better than a Pepsi  
I'm cooler than MTV  
I'm hotter than California  
I'm cheaper than a gram  
I'm deeper thar the shit I'm in  
An' I don't really give a damn  
  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live a little bit longer now  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live live live live live  
  
Step up it's fight time  
Kick scratch and bite time  
Ain't talking about no more fun  
But that don't bother my bad ass none  
  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live a little bit longer now  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live live live live live  
Just a little bit longer  
I want to live live live live live
