I took the cannonball down to the ocean  
Across the desert from sea to shining sea  
I rode a ladder that climbs across the nation  
Fifty million feet of earth between the buried and me  
  
"How do you do?"  
She said, "Hey, how do you do?"  
  
She buys a ticket 'cause it's cold where she comes from  
She climbs aboard because she's scared of getting older in the snow  
Love is a ghost train rumbling through the darkness  
Hold on to me darling I've got nowhere else to go  
  
"How do you do?"  
She said, "How do you do?"  
  
I took the cannonball down to the ocean  
Watched the diesel disappear beneath the tumbling waves  
Love is a ghost train howling on the radio  
"Remember everything." she said, "when only memory remains."  
  
"How do you do?"  
She said, "Hey, how do you do?"
