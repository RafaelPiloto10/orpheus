I can see clearly now the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
  
Oh yes, I can make it now the pain is gone  
All of the bad feelings have disappeared  
Here is the rainbow I've been praying for  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day (ooh...)  
  
Look all around,  
There's nothing but blue skies  
Look straight ahead,  
There's nothing but blue skies  
  
I can see clearly now the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Here's the rainbow I've been praying for  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
Real, real, real, real bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
Yeah, hey, it's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day
