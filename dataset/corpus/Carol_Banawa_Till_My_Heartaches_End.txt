I recall when you said that you would never leave me  
You told me more, so much more like when the time you whispered in my ear  
There was heaven in my heart  
I remember when you said that you'd be here forever  
  
Then you left without even saying that you're leaving  
I was hurt and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday  
And I pray that you would stay  
But then you're gone and, oh, so far away  
  
CHORUS  
I was afraid this time would come  
I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within  
I have learned to live my life beside you  
  
Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight  
And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again  
I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end  
  
And then you left without even saying that you're leaving  
I was hurt and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday  
And I pray that you would stay  
But then you're gone and, oh, so far away  
  
CHORUS  
I was afraid this time would come  
I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within  
I have learned to live my life beside you  
  
Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight  
And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again  
I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end  
  
Woh oh yeah  
  
CHORUS  
I was afraid this time would come  
I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within  
I have learned to live my life beside you  
  
Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight  
And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again  
I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end  
  
CODA  
Keep on dreaming till my heartaches end...
