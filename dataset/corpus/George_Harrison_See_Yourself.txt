It's easier to tell a lie than it is to tell the truth  
It's easier to kill a fly than it is to turn it loose  
It's easier to criticize somebody else  
Than to see yourself  
  
It's easier to give a sigh and be like all the rest  
Who stand around and crucify you while you do your best  
It's easier to see the books upon the shelf  
Than to see yourself  
  
It's easier to hurt someone and make them cry  
Than it is to dry their eyes  
I got tired of fooling around with other people's lies  
Rather I'd find someone that's true  
  
It's easier to say you won't than it is to feel you can  
It's easier to drag your feet than it is to be a man  
It's easier to look at someone eles's wealth  
Than to see yourself
