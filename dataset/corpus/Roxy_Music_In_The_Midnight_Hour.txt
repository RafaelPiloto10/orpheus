I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour  
That's when my love comes tumbling down  
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour  
When there's no one else around  
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you  
And do all the things I told you  
In the midnight hour  
  
I'm gonna wait till the stars come out  
And see that twinkle in your eye  
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour  
That's when my love begins to shine  
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you  
And do all things I told you  
In the midnight hour
