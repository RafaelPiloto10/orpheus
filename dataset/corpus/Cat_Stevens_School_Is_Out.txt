School is out now we're gonna have some fun.  
We're gonna make like we are the only ones.  
  
I'm gonna buy a piece of the sky  
And sell passin' clouds.  
I'm gonna be a mayor of some small town  
And tax the crowds.  
I'm gonna be a local surveyor  
And study the foreman's girl.  
I'm gonna line up some of the finest  
Girls that are in the world.  
  
We're comin' out of school today  
And we're so happy, yes, to be alive.  
It's gonna be the best day,  
The best day of our lives.  
  
I'm gonna be a history maker  
And call myself Richard the Third.  
I'm gonna buy an amplifier  
And shout out "Have you heard?"  
  
We're comin' out of school today  
And we're so happy, yes, to be alive.  
It's gonna be the best day,  
The best day of our lives.  
  
We're comin' out of school today, baby,  
We're comin' out of school today.  
Hey, comin' out of school today.  
Oh, out, out, School is out, a school is out, out.
