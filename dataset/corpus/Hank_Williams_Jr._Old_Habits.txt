Well I kicked the habit, of smoking back sometime ago.  
And I tried the hard stuff, but I had to let all that go.  
But the toughest thing I ever gave up was today.  
Cause Old Habits Like You are hard to break.  
  
I chew lifesavers to help me get off ciggarates.  
But you know for your love I aint found no lifesavers yet.  
And I've grown cold Turkey cause theres not even on kiss ad day.  
And Old habits like you are hard to break.  
  
Old habits like you are hard to break.  
Love with someone new is so hard to make.  
I had grown so use to your love and all of your ways.  
  
And Old Habits Like You are hard to breakbla
