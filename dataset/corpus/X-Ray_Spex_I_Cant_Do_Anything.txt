I can't write  
And I can't sing  
I can't do anything  
I can't read  
And I can't spell  
I can't even get to hell  
I can't love  
And I can't hate  
I can't even hesitate  
I can't dance  
And I can't walk  
I can't even try to talk  
  
Freedom tried to strangle me  
With my plastic popper beads  
But I hit him back  
With my pet rat  
Yeah I hit him back  
With my pet rat  
  
I can't spit  
And I can't kick  
I can't even be thick  
I can't read  
And I can't spell  
I can't even get to hell  
I can't love  
And I can't hate  
I can't even hesitate  
I can't dance  
And I can't walk  
I can't even try to talk
