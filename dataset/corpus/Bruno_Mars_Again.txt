Hands over my head thinking 'what else could go wrong? '  
Would've stayed in bed, how can a day be so long?  
Never believed that things happen for a reason  
But how this turned out removed all my doubts, so believe  
That for you I'll do it all over again  
Do it all over again  
All I went through, led me to you  
So I'd do it all over again  
For you  
  
I missed the first train, stood out in the rain, all day  
Little did I know  
When I caught the next train, there you were to sweep me away  
Guess that's what I've waited for  
Never believed that things happened for a reason  
But how this turned out, you moved all my doubts, So believe  
That for you I'd do it all over again  
Do it all over again  
All I went through, led me to you  
So I'd do it all over again  
  
(Ohhohoh) Who ever thought a day gone so wrong, would turn out so lovely?  
I'm so glad I found you  
Even though the day went so wrong, I wouldn't change a thing (yeah, yeah, oh
I'll do it)  
I'd do it all over again  
Do it all over again  
All I went through, led me to you  
So I'd do it all over again (yeah, yeah ohhh)  
I'd do it all over again (I'd do it all over, I'd do it all over)  
Do it all over again (I'd do it all over for you, for you)  
All I went through, led me to you (all I went through, it led me to you)  
So I'd do it all over again (over again)  
  
Who ever thought a day gone so wrong, could turn out so lovely?  
Who ever thought a day gone so wrong, could turn out so lovely?
