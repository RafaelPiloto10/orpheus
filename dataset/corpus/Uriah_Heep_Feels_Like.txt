I can feel your sadness  
From what I said to you  
I'm drinking my forgiveness  
So restless and confused  
I don't know what I see  
But it looks a lot like love  
Showing me something  
Deeper then deep in my soul  
And it makes me feel like  
I'm at the point of no return - feels like  
I'm at the point  
It makes me feel like  
I'm at the point of no return - feels like  
I'm at the point  
I was drifting through the days  
With nowhere else to turn  
I finally discovered  
How much I have to learn  
I shouldn't be afraid  
For you to bring my love  
Taking me somewhere  
Deeper than deep in my soul  
This time my heart will lead the way  
To win the game you'got to play  
You love me like a lover  
I see it in your face  
No need to think it over  
No need to run the race  
I don't know if you planned it  
But you're driving me insane  
Telling me something  
Over and over again
