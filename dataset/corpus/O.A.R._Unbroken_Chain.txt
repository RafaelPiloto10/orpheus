Blue light rain, whoa unbroken chain,  
Looking for familiar faces in an empty window pane.  
  
Listening for the secret, searching for the sound  
But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds.  
  
Willow sky, whoa, I walk and wonder why,  
They say love your brother, but you will catch it when you try.  
  
Roll you down the line boy, drop you for a loss,  
Ride you out on a cold railroad and nail you to a cross.  
  
November and more, as I wait for the score,  
They're telling me forgiveness is the key to every door.  
A slow winder day a night like forever,  
Sink like a stone, float like a feather.  
  
(instrumental)  
Lilac rain, unbroken chain, Song of the sawhet owl.  
Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane, Listening to the winds howl  
  
Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls, Unbroken chain of shy and sea.  
Unbroken chain of the western wind, Unbroken chain of you and me.
