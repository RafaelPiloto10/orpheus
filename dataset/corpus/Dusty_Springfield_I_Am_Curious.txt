I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting  
  
The noise that announces a seduction  
I'm a volcano  
In a state of eruption  
I live life with a wild intensity  
Need to be aroused  
To the point of intimacy  
  
What are your motives?  
I got to know  
I'm doing research  
I got to know  
What are your motives?  
I got to know  
Tell me your motives, oh, oh  
  
'Cause I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting  
  
The fusing, the melting of two bodies  
I'm addicted to lethal sexuality  
I live life on the edge of ecstasy  
Need to be desired  
Nothing else fulfills me  
  
What are your motives?  
I got to know  
I'm doing research  
I got to know  
What are your motives?  
I got to know  
Tell me your motives, ooh, ooh  
  
I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting  
  
I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting  
  
Yes, I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I am curious with myself  
Too delirious from singing  
'Cause I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting
