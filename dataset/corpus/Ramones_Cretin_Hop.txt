There's no stoppin' the cretins from hoppin'  
You gotta keep it beatin'  
For all the hoppin' cretins  
  
Cretin! Cretin!  
I'm gonna go for a whirl with my cretin girl  
My feet won't stop  
Doin' the Cretin Hop  
Cretin! Cretin!  
  
One-two-three  
Cretins want to hop some more  
Four-five-six-seven  
All good cretins go to heaven  
Rockaway Beach  
Chewing out a rhythm on my bubble gum  
The sun is out and I want some  
It's not hard, not far to reach  
We can hitch a ride
