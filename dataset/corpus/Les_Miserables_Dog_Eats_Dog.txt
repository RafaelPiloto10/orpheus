"Thenardier:  
Here's a hint of gold  
Stuck into a tooth  
Pardon me mieseur  
You won't be needing it no more  
  
Shouldn't be too hard to sell  
Add it to the pile  
Add it to the stack  
Here among the sewer rats  
A breath away from hell  
You get accustomed to the smell  
  
Well someone's got to clean them up my friends  
Bodies on the highway  
Law and order upside down  
Someone's got to collect their odds and ends  
As a service to the town  
  
Here's a tasty ring  
Pretty little thing  
Wouldn't want to waste it  
That would really be a crime  
Thank you sir I'm in your debt  
  
Here's a little toy  
Take it off the boy  
His heart's no longer going  
And he's lived his little time  
But his watch is ticking yet  
  
Well someone's got to clean them up my friends  
Before the little harvest disappears into the mud  
Someone's got to collect their odds and ends  
When the gutters run with blood  
  
It's a world where the dog eats dog  
And they kill for the bones in the street  
And God in his heaven  
He don't interfere  
Cause he's dead as the stiffs at my feet  
  
I raise my eyes to see the heavens  
And only the moon looks down  
The harvest moon shines down
