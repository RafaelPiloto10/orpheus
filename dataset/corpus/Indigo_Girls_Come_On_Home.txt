Dark clouds are comin' like an army  
Soon the sky will open up and disarm me  
You will go just like you've gone before  
One sad soldier off to war, enemies that only you can see.  
  
Dishes stacked, the table cleared  
It's always like the scene of the last supper here  
You speak so cryptically that's not news to me  
The flood is here it will carry you  
And I've got work to do.  
  
Come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Come back here and shut the door  
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.  
  
There is fire there is lust  
Some will trade it all for someone they could trust  
There's a bag of silver for a box of nails  
It's so simple the betrayal  
Though it's known to change the world and what's to come.  
  
Just come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Don't you recognize them anymore  
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.  
  
There's the given and the expected  
I count my blessings while I eye what I've neglected  
Is this for better is this for worse  
You're all jammed up and the dam's about to burst.  
  
I hear the owl in the night  
I realize that some things never are made right  
By some will we string together here  
Days to months and months to years  
What if everything we have adds up to nothing.  
  
Come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Come back here and shut the door  
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.
