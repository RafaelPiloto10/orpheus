Gimme fuel,  
Gimme fire,  
Gimme that which I desire,  
Ooh!  
  
Turn on...I see red  
Adrenaline crash and crash my head  
Nitro junkie, paint me dead  
And I see red  
  
One hundred plus through black and white  
War horse, warhead  
Fuck 'em man, white knuckles tight  
Through black and white  
  
Ohhh, on I burn,  
Fuel is pumping engines,  
Burning hard, loose and clean  
  
And I burn,  
Churning my direction,  
Quench my thirst with gasoline  
  
So gimme fuel,  
Gimme fire,  
Gimme that which I desire,  
  
Hey  
  
Turn on beyond the bone  
Swallow future, spit out home  
Burn your face upon the chrome  
Yeah!  
  
Take the corner, join the crash,  
Headlights, headlines  
Another junkie lives too fast  
Yeah lives way too fast, fast, fast, oohh-aye  
  
Ohhh, on I burn  
Fuel is pumping engines  
Burning hard, loose and clean  
  
And on I burn  
Churning my direction,  
Quench my thirst with gasoline  
  
So gimme fuel  
Gimme fire  
Gimme that which I desire  
  
Yeah-heah  
  
White knuckle tight!  
(solo)  
  
Gimme fuel...on I burn, on and on  
Gimme fire...on I burn, on and on  
My desire...  
  
Ohhh, on I burn  
Fuel is pumping engines  
Burning hard, loose and clean  
  
And I burn  
Churning my direction  
Quench my thirst with gasoline  
  
Gimme fuel  
Gimme fire  
Gimme that which I desire  
Ooh  
  
On I burn!
