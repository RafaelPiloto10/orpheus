Last night I dug your picture out from our old dresser drawer.  
I set it on the table and I talked to it till four.  
I read some old love letters right up to the break of dawn.  
Yeah, I've been sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.  
  
Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings.  
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling  
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home.  
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.  
  
I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,  
Exhuming things that's better left alone.  
And I'm resurrecting mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone.  
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.  
  
And I went through the closet and I found some things in there,  
Like that pretty lingerie that I bought you to wear.  
And I recalled how good you looked each time you had it on.  
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.  
  
I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,  
Exhuming things that's better left alone.  
And I'm resurrecting mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone.  
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.
