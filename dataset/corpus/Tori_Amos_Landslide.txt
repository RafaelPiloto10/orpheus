I took my love, I took it down  
Climbed a mountain and I turned around  
I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills  
'Til the landslide brought me down  
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?  
Can the child within my heart rise above?  
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?  
Can I handle the seasons of my life?  
Well, I've been afraid of changing  
'Cause I've built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder, even children get older  
And I'm getting older too  
Oh, take my love, take it down  
Climb a mountain and turn around  
If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Will the landslide bring it down?  
If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well, the landslide will bring it down
