Come over here  
  
All you got is this moment  
The twenty-first century's yesterday  
You can care all you want  
Everybody does yeah that's okay  
  
So slide over here  
And give me a moment  
Your moves are so raw  
I've got to let you know  
I've got to let you know  
You're one of my kind  
  
I need you tonight  
'cause I'm not sleeping  
There's something about you girl  
That makes me sweat  
  
How do you feel  
I'm lonely  
What do you think  
Can't take it all  
Whatcha gonna do  
Gonna live my life
