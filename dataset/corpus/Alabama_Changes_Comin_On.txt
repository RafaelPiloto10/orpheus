Long hair was not in style the first time I heard Haggard on the radio, but I
could feel the changes comin' on.  
The Beatles crossed the ocean, an overnight explosion on the T.V.  
My brother had to go to Vietnam.  
  
Ford unveiled the Mustang.  
Things were good in Detroit for the people there.  
And I could feel changes comin' on.  
From Atlanta Doctor King told the world he had a dream.  
People followed him.  
And Daddy said my hair was getting long.  
  
I could feel changes comin' on.  
People started singin' different songs, searchin' for the place where they
belong.  
I could feel changes comin' on.  
  
Well, I'm still hooked on Haggard.  
But the Beatles can't come back like we hoped they would.  
In Memphis, Tennessee, The King is gone.  
As I put my kids to bed, I wonder what lies ahead for them to see, 'cause I
can feel the changes comin' on.  
  
I could feel changes comin' on.  
People stilll are singin' different songs.  
They're searchin' for the place where they belong.  
I can feel changes comin' on.  
  
I can feel changes comin' on. I can feel changes comin' on.
