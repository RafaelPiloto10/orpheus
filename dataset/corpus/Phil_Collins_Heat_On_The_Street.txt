You've gotta shout if you've got something to say  
I know it's getting bad, you read it every day  
And you, you can try your best to fight it  
But you can't make it on your own  
  
Someone better tell the people up there  
I think they ought to know, the bubble's just about to bust  
Tell them they'd better beware  
The word is on the street, get up on your feet, and shout out  
  
The kids out there don't know how to react  
The streets are getting tough and that's a matter of fact  
And I, I can't take it any longer  
But we can't make it on our own  
  
The people there find it hard to relate  
They don't know how it feels to be standing there on your own  
Believe me, it's never too late  
It's time to make a move, get up on your feet and shout  
  
Stop, look down, everybody, do you see what's going on  
Around you, stop  
  
Shout out, shout it out, shout loud  
Shout out, shout it out, shout loud  
  
There are people who give and there are people who take  
But I believe it's gonna get better  
Realize what a difference you make  
And don't turn away, hey! I'm talking to you!  
  
So there's only the one solution  
Stop and think what's going on  
You can draw your own conclusions  
But we won't make it on our own  
  
Someone better tell the people up there  
I think they ought to know  
The bubble's just about to burst  
Tell them they'd better beware  
The word is on the street  
Get up on your feet and shout  
  
Stop, look down, everybody  
Do you see what's going on  
Around you, stop
