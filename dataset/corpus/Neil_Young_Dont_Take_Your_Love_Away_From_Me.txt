There's just one thing  
I'm askin' of you  
There's just one thing,  
Baby, I'm askin' of you  
Don't ever leave me, baby  
No matter what you do  
There's just one thing  
I'm askin' of you.  
  
Don't take your love away from me  
Don't take your love away from me  
'Cause if you ever leave me, baby  
How wrong you would be  
Don't take your love away from me.  
  
When I make a promise,  
You can bet that it's true  
When I make a promise,  
Baby, you can bet that it's true  
So put your chips down, baby  
Empty your pockets, too  
'Cause when I make a promise,  
You can bet that it's true.  
  
Don't take your love away from me  
Don't take your love away from me  
'Cause if you ever leave me, baby  
How wrong you would be  
Don't take your love away from me.
