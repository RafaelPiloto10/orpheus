Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking  
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah  
When she walks, she's like a samba that swings so cool and sways so gentle  
When she passes, each one she passes goes - ooh  
  
Ooh, but I watch her so sadly, how can I tell her I love her  
Yes I would give my heart gladly,  
But each day, when she walks to the sea  
She looks straight ahead, not at me
