A thousand arms to hold you tight  
Five hundreds hours to love you right.  
  
Darling, each and every day I've known you  
I fall in love with you a little more  
More than just my arms and hours can show you  
Maybe that's why I keep wishin' for.  
  
A thousand arms to hold you tight  
Five hundreds hours to love you right  
A thousand arms to never let you go  
Five hundred hours to always love you so.  
  
It seems I just can't do enough things for you  
To ever pay you back for lovin' me  
I idolize and worship and adore you  
Still if I had one wish that wish would be.  
  
A thousand arms to hold you tight  
Five hundreds hours to love you right  
A thousand arms to never let you go  
Five hundred hours to always love you so.  
  
A thousand arms to hold you tight  
Five hundreds hours to love you right  
A thousand arms to never let you go  
Five hundred hours to always love you so...
