Mark: We ... we have a new album out, it was released the fifteenth. It's
called Closer To Home. We'd like to do one ... we'd like to do one from the
album. Ah ..., but before we do, I feel that ah ..., I have to tell you
something because I know that if you were in my place that you would do it for
me.  
Mark: Ah ... brothers and sisters, there are people out there that look just
like you or maybe ah ..., your brother ah ..., but they're not. And, when they
hand you something, don't take it -- don't take it, okay?  
Mark: This is Mean Mistreater ...
