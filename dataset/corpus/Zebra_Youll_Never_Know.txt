Why am I here all alone  
I'm gettin' growing pains  
And I'm feeling so old  
I'm gettin' tired,  
Walkin' in the rain, sleepin' in the sand  
Now life has taken its toll  
And now my sanity's gettin' harder to hold  
I'm kinda tired  
Walkin' in the rain, sleepin' in the sand  
Now don't take advice from a stranger  
You can't live your life by what others do  
We're all here alive for a reason  
You'll never know  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
How can I make it alone?  
It's such a crazy world,  
And I'm feelin' so stoned  
I'm kinda tired  
Walkin' in the rain, sleepin' in the sand  
Just sleepin' in the sand  
You can't see the light from an angel  
You can't add the price of what others do  
We're all here alive for a reason  
You'll never know  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was
