Mama raised me to be a man  
Told me son you have to understand  
Learn to get while the gettin's good  
And bring it back to the neighborhood  
  
[Chorus]  
And I swear, I was there  
Tell me why should I lie  
I just want to say  
A little lovin' goes a long, long way  
  
Uncle Henry and Cousin Grace  
Used to weekend at our place  
Grace and I would go behind the barn  
We almost burned the damned thing down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need your lovin'  
Just a little lovin'  
I need your lovin'  
Just a little lovin'  
A little lovin' each and every day  
A little lovin' goes a long, long way, long way  
  
I knew a woman from New Orleans  
Her old man used to treat her mean  
And she would come to me for sympathy  
Southern Comfort and ecstasy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I need your lovin'  
Just a little lovin'  
I need your lovin'  
Just a little lovin'  
A little lovin' each and every day  
A little lovin' goes a long, long way
