My heart is beating from me  
I am standing all alone  
Please call me only if you are coming home  
Waste another year flies by  
Waste a night or two  
You taught me how to live  
In the streets of shame  
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain  
There's no sign of hope  
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope  
There's a glow of light  
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night  
Bearing gifts and trust  
The fixture in the city of lust  
What the hells your name  
What's your pleasure and what's your pain?  
Do you dream too much?  
Do you think what you need is a crutch  
In the crowd of pain. St. Jimmy comes without any shame  
He says, "We're fucked up"  
And we're not the same  
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame  
  
Jimmy died today  
He blew out his brains into the bay  
In this state of mind, it's my own private suicide  
  
And nobody cares  
And nobody cares  
Does anyone care if nobody cares?  
Jesus is filling out paperwork now  
At the facility on east 12th st.  
He's not listening to a word now  
He's in his own world  
And he's daydreaming  
He'd rather be doing something else now,  
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly,  
His life is on the line of anxiety now  
And he had enough  
And she had plenty  
Somebody get me out of here  
Anybody get me out of here  
Somebody get me out of here  
Get me the fuck right out of here  
So far away  
I don't want to stay  
Get me out of here right now  
I just want to be free  
Is there a possibility  
Get me out of here right now  
This life like dream ain't for me  
  
I fell asleep watching spike TV  
After ten cups of coffee  
And you're still not there  
Dreaming of a song  
When something went wrong  
And I can't tell anyone  
Cause no one's there  
Left me here alone  
When I should have stayed home  
After ten cups of coffee  
I'm thinking where'd you go  
Nobody likes you  
Everyone left you  
They're all out without you havin' fun  
Where'd you go  
I'm thinking weird you go  
Nobody likes you  
Everyone left you  
They're all out without you havin' fun  
Where'd you go  
  
Geez, ha  
  
I got a rock and roll band  
I got a rock and roll life  
I got a rock and roll girlfriend  
And another ex-wife  
I got a rock and roll house  
I got a rock and roll car  
I plat the shit out the drums  
And I can play the guitar  
I got a kid in New York  
I got a kid in the bay  
I haven't drank or smoked a thing  
In over twenty two days  
So get off my case, get off my case, off my case!  
  
Here they come marching down the street  
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat  
Coming back from the edge of town  
Underneath their feet  
The time has come and its going nowhere  
Nobody ever said that life was fair now  
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear  
In the summer heat  
The world is spinning  
Around and around  
Out of control again  
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down  
So send my love a letter bomb  
And visit me in hell  
We're the ones going  
  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
  
I started fuckin' running  
Just as soon as my feet touched the ground  
We're back in the Barrio  
But to you and me, that's jingle town  
  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
  
Nobody likes you  
Everyone left you  
They're all out without you havin' fun
