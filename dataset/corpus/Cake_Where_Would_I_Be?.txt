I've been waiting  
For so long  
I've been hoping  
Your love's not gone  
Houses are sliding in the mud  
Rivers are raging in your blood  
Where would I be  
Without your love?  
Where would I be  
Without your arms around me?  
You were to be  
  
The only one  
If I knew you  
I would not run  
You have been  
Cloudy distant and dark  
I'm thinking of  
Noah and the ark  
Where would I be  
Without your love?  
Where would I be  
Without your arms around me?
