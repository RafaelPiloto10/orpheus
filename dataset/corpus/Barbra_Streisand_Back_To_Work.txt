Chorus:  
Hey here comes Joe now running down the street, hey Joe!  
He must have news the way he moves his feet, hey Joe!  
He's coming from the meeting with the boss, hey Joe!  
I hope they didn't throw him for a loss, hey Joe!  
He must have news about the strike, I wonder what it's like.  
Hey Joe! Hey Joe! Hey Joe, don't be so slow!  
Tell us, Joe! Spill it, Joe! Joe, what do you know?  
  
Joe:  
What do I know?  
I ain't heard as good news since Lord knows when,  
For the strike is over, boys,  
Back to work again!  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah!  
  
Joe:  
The fighting's through now,  
There's no more fuss  
For the strike is over, boys,  
Back to work for us!  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah!  
  
Joe:  
We gave a little, and we took a little.  
It was quite a fight but things came out all right!  
Shout to the rafters, let yourselves go.  
For the striking all is done, let's have fun,  
The day is won, back to work we go!  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah!  
Back to work again!  
Back to work for us! Joe:  
We gave a little, and we took a little. We gave and we took--  
It was quite a fight It was quite a fight  
  
Joe:  
But things came out all right!  
Shout to the rafters, let yourselves go.  
For the striking all is done,  
  
Joe and chorus:  
Let's have fun,  
The day is won, back to work we go!  
Back to work, Joe!  
Back to work, Joe!  
Back to work we go!
