Caroline, I see you  
Standing on the stairway,  
Waiting for your bear there.  
Handy on the landing,  
Penny in my pocket,  
High enough to hold you.  
  
When I come back home  
To you tomorrow,  
You may well be angry,  
I'll for sure be hungry.  
Meet me in the middle,  
Make it melt like chocolate,  
Be my little baby.  
  
I take you down by the water  
Some December morning.  
Take you from your family,  
Leave them with their longing.  
Take you by your hand,  
Somewhere on the sand.  
  
Caroline, I love you,  
Though I'm late to say so,  
Hesitate to tell you.  
What will be your answer  
Some December morning?  
Standing on the stairway,  
Caroline, I see you.
