That's how heartaches are made.  
That's how heartaches are made.  
  
They told me I was such a fool to love you.  
They said that you're the kind who'd never be true.  
Pretty soon the day would come when I'd be the sorry one.  
But I said that I'm not afraid.  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, that's how heartaches are made.  
That's how heartaches are made.  
  
I went ahead and my heart opened the door.  
I gave you so much love. No one could love more.  
You pretended to be mine. How could you be so unkind,  
With all the other girls you play?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I know you're not sincere and you'll never be.  
But still I want those kisses so desperately.  
I could never let you go, baby even though I know  
Every rule in love you disobeyed.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's how heartaches are made. [Repeat: x3]
