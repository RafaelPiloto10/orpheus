(verse)  
Look into yourself and see  
Do you know who you are? (who you are)  
When you're feeling sad and blue  
You should know that you are  
The sun and the moon to me  
I care for you can't you see  
You don't need to go so far  
And you know who you are (who you are)  
Hey people don't look so down  
Let me play in your game (in your game)  
If you wanna scream and shout  
You should not be ashamed  
Do what you want to do  
Don't let the world get on you  
Listen what I have to say  
Then you will be okay  
Come together!  
Now!  
Come together...  
(verse)  
Never too late to try  
Don't give up on yourself  
What you are searching for  
Will be find, you will see  
Just take it easily  
Let yourself be free  
Listen what I have to say  
Then you will be okay  
(chorus)  
Come together!  
Everyone are feeling fine  
People smiling  
Sun is shining on you  
Feel the light  
Come together!  
Feel the rhythm, dance with me  
Take my hand, integrity  
After rain comes the sun  
(break)  
(verse)  
Ah, it's such a lovely day  
So glad we're all here today  
Every single one of us  
Will be fine, you will see  
(chorus)  
(breakdown)  
If we...  
If we...  
If we...  
If we all come together  
Life is gonna be much better  
If we all come together  
This is gonna last forever  
If we all come together  
Life is gonna be much better  
If we all come together  
Life is gonna last forever
