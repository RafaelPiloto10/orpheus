Big Will and Tra-Knox  
Yo yo yo yo jump  
When I tell you make your way up to the front  
Addicted to the way I kick it I know what you want  
The don jiggy catering to what your feeling  
Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling  
Shake  
What ya momma gave you baby don't let nothing break  
Yo watch cause we don't care how much time it's gonna take  
Dance floor packed and it's looking like a lake  
It's abduction here's your instructions  
Slide  
Get up off that wall girl stop trying to hide  
Tracking aphrodisiac won't be denied  
Chill with that cigarette take it outside  
Messing with my vibe  
I don't like that  
Bounce  
I'm a press your player when it counts  
Party like a lamb and a wolf about to pounce  
The don jiggy catering to what you're feeling  
Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling  
  
[Chorus]  
Bring it on the nothing  
Ain't no time for fun things (come on)  
Just let it flow (jump on)  
Act like you know  
The only floor is jumping  
Ooh these girls are something (come on)  
Just let it flow (jump on)  
Act like you know  
  
I-I-I-I called Jazzy Jeff on the phone  
I said, "I'm downstairs waiting Jeff come on"  
I told him there's this hot spot we gotta burn  
He said, "Man after last weekend haven't you learned?"  
Yo look here last week was a mistake  
That mommy trying to dish out what she couldn't take  
Come back me dancing like wow like this thing is a game  
One little move on her and she bust into flames (whoosh)  
The whole club running trying to ruin my night  
I told her roll around little she'll be alright  
Then everybody mad at me all up in my face  
Somebody should've told that girl to stay in her place  
You feel a little heat baby girl I'm behind ya  
And hopefully your burnt Gucci dress will remind ya  
Of how serious I am maybe it's crazy why yall  
But if you want to play hunny go get a baby doll  
Holla at me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh uh huh  
Check and make sure I'm looking cute for huh  
Check and make sure I'm packing lute for huh  
Cause I'm about to shut down the bar for huh  
And later open up my car door for huh  
7 PM I leave the set and then  
No more acting back to rapping again  
Red carpet hectic getting me in  
What happened last week sure it could happen again  
Mos def full funk when ya looking at the front looking like a jet magazine
beauty of the month  
Shades low laying liggy low on the cut  
Told myself you're the one to shake it up with  
Bounce  
Over to your table can get me on announce  
Observe the curves body fat about an ounce  
Hormones pumping out dangerous amounts  
Grabbed ya arm turn around girl  
Jump  
Move when I tell ya make your move up to the front  
Addicted to the way I kick it I know what ya want  
The don jiggy catering to what you're feeling  
Pack it from the floor up to the ceiling  
Come on  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Come on  
Jump on  
The only floor is jumping  
Come on  
Just let it flow (jump on)  
Act like you know  
Big Will uh  
Tra-Knox uh  
Foundation laid to the rock why yall  
One time we out what
