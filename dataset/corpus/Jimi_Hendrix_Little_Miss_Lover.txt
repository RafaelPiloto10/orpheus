Little miss lover,  
Where have you been in this world for so long  
Well, I love a lover that feels like you  
Would you like to tag along?  
  
Well I really don't need any help little girl  
But I believe you could help me out anyway  
Ah sack it to me  
Would you believe baby I've been looking for a soul  
That feels like you  
For some time  
  
Excuse me while I see  
If the gypsy in me is right  
If you don't mind  
Well he signals me OK  
So I think it's safe to say  
I'm gonna make a play  
Ah yeah  
See me walk towards you baby  
Ah give me some  
Oh get into it  
  
Hey hey little miss lover  
Well now, there's so much you and me can discover  
And I think we should start, we should start right now, baby  
Hey hey little miss lover  
Ah little miss lover  
Yeah little miss lover  
Ah baby  
Ah look at me baby  
Little miss lover  
Hey baby  
Hey!
