Cool tears flow upon my pillow.  
And i'm freezing blue with misery.  
You know that i never meant to hurt you  
But something always gets right in the way.  
  
So i'll fill this bedrom full of mystery.  
Hang our last conclusions on the wall.  
And if this empty building starts to get to me  
Please remember that it just might be your fault.  
  
Better to have lost in love  
Than never to have loved at all...  
  
So the fated lovers turn to enemies -  
And all their hidden feelings start to show.  
And i never though that boy  
Could mean so much to me.  
And now it seems i'll have to let you go...
