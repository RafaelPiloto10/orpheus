Don't you go away  
C'mon get close to me  
The hassles of the day  
Have made a real mess of me  
  
The moon is in the sky  
And the stars are out tonight  
They shimmer in the pools of your eyes  
In the moonlight  
  
You're so nice to touch  
Lovely to look at  
Touch, touch  
In the tradition of love  
  
Hear the summer breeze  
All the nighttime's listening  
Your eyes are sparkling now  
And their oceans glistening  
  
Sail upon a sea  
Of love filling the room  
Lilacs seem to be  
Everywhere with their perfume  
  
Love, love  
Love, love  
Love, love  
  
You can in a breath  
Blow the storm clouds out the sky  
A hurricane retreats  
In the blinking of your eye  
A flame within my heart  
Is ignited by your voice  
C'mon baby now  
Let's make love our final choice  
  
Ooh you're nice to touch  
Lovely to look at  
Touch, touch  
In the tradition of love  
  
Love, love  
Love, love  
Love, love
