You know our love was meant to be  
The kind of love that lasts forever  
And I need you here with me  
From tonight until the end of time  
  
You should know, everywhere I go  
You're always on my mind, in my heart  
In my soul  
  
You're the meaning in my life  
You're the inspiration  
You bring feeling to my life  
You're the inspiration  
want to have you near me  
I want to have you hear me sayin'  
No one needs you more than I need you  
  
And I know, yes I know that it's plain to see  
We're so in love when we're together  
And I know that I need you here with me  
From tonight until the end of time  
  
You should know, everywhere I go  
Always on my mind, in my heart  
In my soul  
  
You're the meaning in my life  
You're the inspiration  
You bring feeling to my life  
You're the inspiration  
want to have you near me  
I want to have you hear me sayin'  
No one needs you more than I need you  
  
You're the meaning in my life  
You're the inspiration  
You bring feeling to my life  
You're the inspiration  
want to have you near me  
I want to have you hear me sayin'  
No one needs you more than I need you
