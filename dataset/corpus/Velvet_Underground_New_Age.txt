Can I have your autograph  
He said to the fat blonde actress  
You know I've seen every movie you've been in  
From Paths of Pain to Jewels of Glory  
And when you kissed Robert Mitchum  
Gee but I thought you'd never catch him  
  
Over the hill right now  
And you're looking for love  
You're over the hill right now  
And you're looking for love  
I'll come running to you  
honey when you want me  
I'll come running to yoy  
honey when you want me  
  
Can I have your autograph  
He said to the fat blonde actress  
You know I know everything you've done  
Anyway I hate divorces  
To the left is a marble shower  
It was fun even for an hour  
  
Your're over the hill right now  
And you're looking for love  
You're over the hill right now  
And you're looking for love  
I'll come running to you  
honey when you want me  
I'll come running to you  
honey when you want me  
  
Something's got a hold on me  
And I don't know what  
  
Something's got a hold on me  
And I don't know what  
  
It's the beginning of a new age  
It's the beginning of a new age  
  
It's a new age
