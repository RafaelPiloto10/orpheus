When we are dancing  
And you're dangerously near me  
I get ideas, I get ideas  
I want to hold you  
So much closer than I dare do  
I want to scold you  
'Cause I care more than I care to  
  
And when you touch me  
And there's fire in every finger  
I get ideas, yes, I get ideas  
And after we have kissed goodnight  
And still you linger  
I kinda think you get ideas too  
  
Your eyes are always saying  
The things you're never saying  
I only hope they're saying  
That you could love me too  
For that's the whole idea, it's true  
The lovely idea  
That I'm falling in love with you
