When I push the sheets away from your face  
And watch you sleep all day here  
And when I push you away  
And say you simply cannot stay here  
  
And it's all love, all love  
It's all love, my stupid love  
  
When I say you take away  
The most important parts of me with you  
When I've had the greyest day  
You add more grey, it's just your way  
It's true  
  
But it's all love, all love, ohh  
It's all love, all love, ohh  
It's all love, all love, ohh  
It's all love, my stupid love  
  
You can't be the one to kill the pain anymore  
You let me in but then you slam my fingers in the door  
I've had enough but I keep asking you to give me more  
  
When I say  
That there's no way  
  
It's all love, all love, ohh  
It's all love, all love, ohh  
It's all love, all love, ohh  
It's all love, my stupid love  
  
It's all love, all love  
(It's all love, it's all love)  
It's all love, all love  
(It's all love, it's all love)  
It's all love, all love  
(It's all love, it's all love)  
It's all love my stupid love
