It's not easy it's never been easy  
To let anyone see the sentimental side of me  
Hard as I try, I can't help but show  
It's my heart you're takin' as you go  
Don't like goodbyes, tears or sighs  
I'm not too good at leavin' time  
I got no taste for grievin' time  
No, no, no, not me  
You've been my near one ever my dear one  
I never thought that you would find another love  
A different kind but it came to be  
Now that your future is looking up  
Forget the past and go fill your loving cup  
But remember, remember leavin' is fine  
And the world overhead has a clear new shine  
I won't be grievin' now that you're leavin'  
It's travelin' time and you must move on  
Found someone that you can lean upon  
And if I could arrange it oh, would I care to change it  
Not me, not me
