[Chorus]  
Hey Jesus can you give me a ride back home  
  
I've been out here in this world too long on my own  
I won't bother you no more  
If you can just get me in the door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I started out I was so young and so strong  
I just let it roll off my back when things went wrong  
Now it's starting to get to me  
All of this inhumanity  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You wouldn't know it by looking at me now  
But I was showing some promise once upon a time  
But it's gone now  
And it ain't coming back  
My time's come and gone  
It's as simple as that  
  
Hey Jesus this world is just too troublesome for me  
I try to fight off all these devils but I'm just too weak  
When I'm out here walking all alone  
I feel like taking my life but I won't  
Too big a coward, can you give me a ride back home  
  
[Chorus: x2]
