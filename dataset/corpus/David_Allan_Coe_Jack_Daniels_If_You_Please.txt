Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
Your the only friend there's has ever been that didn't do me wrong  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane since my babies gone  
  
Cigarettes and whiskey calm my shaking hands  
I just lost a lover to a one night stand  
Something temporary to late I had to learn  
Someone from her past sure it couldn't last a bridge she couldn't burn  
  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
Your the only friend there's has ever been that didn't do me wrong  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane since my babies gone  
  
Promises were broken dreams were left to die  
Empty words were spoken tears were in our eyes  
Something temporary those fears will fade away  
Please do the best you can to help me understand  
These games that people play  
  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
Your the only friend there's has ever been that didn't do me wrong  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane since my babies gone  
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane since my babies gone
