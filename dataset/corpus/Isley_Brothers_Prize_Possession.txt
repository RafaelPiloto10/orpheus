Sanctuary  
Is what you  
Are to me  
Yeah  
No dictionary  
Can find  
The words to say  
How much  
I love you  
Hallelujah  
It's bout time I found someone Whose gonna love me  
For me  
Hey Miss Beloved  
Since you come into my life  
And unlocked the door  
To my heart  
I've been free  
  
Many have called  
But the chosen are few  
Yeah  
Said there's so few  
That's why I'm so happy  
Woman  
To be lying next to you  
Yeah  
  
Prize possession  
You're my  
Movie star  
My near or far  
My everything  
  
You are my  
Prize possession  
You are my cozy nights  
My fireplace  
My sweet melodies  
  
You put the light at the end of my  
Tunnel  
Yes you did  
And you did not let me die  
When it looks like life was gettin' away  
From me  
Ohhh  
You loved  
And clothed  
And you fed me woman  
I remember  
Momma  
You're my best friend  
I love you  
And woman you've got to know your  
  
My prize possession  
Said you are my  
Movie star  
My near or far  
My Christmas carol  
  
Prize possession  
You are my  
Cozy nights  
My fireplace  
My sweet melodies  
  
Lady April  
Let your rain fall down  
It's much cozier when it's wet  
We can cuddle up together  
Oh  
Aw  
c'mon suga  
We can weather any storm  
A family that prays together  
Will stay together  
  
Prize Possession
