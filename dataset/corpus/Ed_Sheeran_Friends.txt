We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been  
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives  
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?  
I never know, no one wants it to  
  
So I could take the back road  
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home  
And if you know me like I know you  
You should love me, you should know  
  
Friends just sleep in another bed  
And friends don't treat me like you do  
Well I know that there's a limit to everything  
But my friends won't love me like you  
No, my friends won't love me like you  
  
We're not friends, we could be anything  
If we tried to keep those secrets safe  
No one will find out if it all went wrong  
They'll never know what we've been through  
  
So I could take the back road  
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home  
And if you know me like I know you  
You should love me, you should know  
  
Friends just sleep in another bed  
And friends don't treat me like you do  
Well I know that there's a limit to everything  
But my friends won't love me like you  
No, my friends won't love me like you  
  
But then again, if we're not friends  
Someone else might love you too  
And then again, if we're not friends  
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why  
  
Friends should sleep in other beds  
And friends should kiss me like you do  
And I know that there's a limit to everything  
But my friends won't love me like you  
No, my friends won't love me like you  
Oh, my friends will never love me like you
