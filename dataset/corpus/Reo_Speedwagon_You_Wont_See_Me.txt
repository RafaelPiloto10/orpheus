Why can't we see eye to eye?  
I feel you don't want to try  
Cause you won't see me as I am  
If you can't accept in me  
The good with the bad  
Then you won't see me cry again  
You won't see me  
  
Why'd you want to go and walk away?  
I have got some things to say  
But you won't see me as I am  
If you can't accept in me  
The good with the bad  
Then you won't see me try again  
You won't see me  
I'll be movin on, I'll be long gone  
  
You are in my range  
I am in your sight  
You say, things don't change  
I say, they just might  
  
You just might find that you can trust in me  
If you look at more than just what you want to see  
But you won't see me as I am  
If you can't accept in me  
The good with the bad  
Then you won't see me around here again  
You won't see me  
I'll be movin on, I'll be long gone
