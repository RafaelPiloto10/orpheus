The fire's dying out  
All the embers have been spent  
Outside on the street  
Lovers hide in the shadows  
You look at me  
I look at you  
There's only one thing  
I want you to do  
  
Kiss me  
I want you to kiss me  
Like a stranger once again  
Kiss me like a stranger once again  
I want to believe that our love's a mystery  
I want to believe that our love's a sin  
I want you to kiss me like a stranger once again  
  
You wear the same kind of perfume  
You wore when we met  
I suppose there's something comforting in knowing what to expect  
But when you brushed up against me  
Before I knew your name  
Everything was thrilling  
'Cause nothing was the same  
  
I want you to kiss me  
I want you to kiss me  
Like a stranger once again  
Kiss me like a stranger once again  
  
I want to believe our loves a mystery  
I want to believe our loves a sin  
Oh will you kiss me like a stranger once again  
I want you to kiss me like a stranger  
Kiss me like a stranger once again
