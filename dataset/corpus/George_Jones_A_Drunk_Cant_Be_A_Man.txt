He embarrasses his child and wife  
Lord he leads a miserable life  
But still he thinks the bottle is his right hand  
Yes and he can tear down more  
Than he's ever built before  
A man can be a drunk sometimes  
But a drunk can't be a man  
  
He lets his business lag behind  
For the nightlife he can find  
Why he does all this he'll never understand  
And in the morning when he wakes up  
Lord he can't wait to fill his cup  
A man can be a drunk sometimes  
But a drunk can't be a man  
  
For he goes from Doctor Jekyll to Mr.Hyde  
He seem proud to have a devil for his guide  
Still he keeps on reaching out  
Lord he needs a helping hand  
But a man can be a drunk sometimes  
But a drunk can't be a man  
Yes a man can be a drunk sometimes  
But a drunk can't be a man
