Hungry people don't stay hungry for long  
They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong  
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long  
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn  
  
Spirit of Jackson now scream from the ruins  
Through factory chains and the ghost of the union  
Forgotten remains disappear to the new home  
Knife, the thrust, the life burns to the raw bone  
  
Blood on the floor but the tear is still dryin'  
Cover the spread sheets, the Dow Jones skyin'  
Cell block, live stock, the bodies, they buyin'  
Old South order, new northern horizon  
  
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be  
Living been warfare, I press it to cd  
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be  
Living been warfare, I press it to cd  
  
A fire in the master's house is set  
A fire in the master's house is set  
A fire in the master's house is set  
A fire in the master's house is set  
  
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long  
They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong  
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long  
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn  
  
Yo, yo, check the high tech terror, it's the new order athletes  
Peer into the eyes of the child already on trial  
All this rippin' families apart, get 'em on file  
Convictions fit the stock profile all the while  
  
Films of dogs ripping through homes, ripping skin from bones  
Yes, the new millennium homes  
Or privatizing through private eyes and an era rising  
Of the Old South order, new northern horizon  
  
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be  
Living been warfare, I press it to cd  
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be  
Living been warfare, I press it to cd  
  
A fire in the master's house is set  
A fire in the master's house is set  
A fire in the master's house is set  
A fire in the master's house is set
