You were born with a face that would let you get your way  
  
  
You know you're much too fine and free, Ivory  
Yeah you had everything you wanted child, that is until the day  
You've been dressed in a vest, every minute of your day  
  
  
You walk into a room, stand in a lit shade  
  
Is your timer too high for me, Ivory  
  
Ivory  
  
How does it feel to be so high  
Ivory  
  
  
How long how long will it take for you to cry  
Ivory  
  
I'm in need  
  
  
Ivory  
  
  
I'll touch your soul, might even touch your brain  
Ivory  
  
I know you can't see me  
I know your blind  
  
  
  
Come back come back and see  
Ivory  
So good to me  
  
  
Ivory
