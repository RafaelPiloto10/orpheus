Oh I am just a vagabond  
A drifter on the run  
And elequant profanity  
It rolls right off my tongue  
  
And I have dined in palaces  
Drunk wine with kings and queens  
But darling, oh darling  
You're the best thing I've ever seen  
  
Won't you roll um easy  
So slow and easy  
Take my independence  
With no apprehension or tension  
You walking talking paradise  
Sweet paradise  
  
Well I've been across this country  
From Denver to the ocean  
And I never met girls that could sing so sweet  
Like the angels who live in Houston  
Singing "Roll me easy"  
So slow and easy  
Play the concertina  
I'll be your temptress  
And baby I'm defenceless  
Singing harmony in unison  
Sweet harmony  
Gotta hoist your flag and then beat your drum
