Come on nature, I don't want to read a book or talk about the world  
Come on nature, I just want to spend some time being boy to the girl  
Come on nature, let me show the way that I've been feeling all along  
Come on nature, just because I don't feel weak don't mean I feel so strong  
  
I've been known to ask a few more favours than I should of you  
And in time I'm sure I'll still want things that you could never do  
If she wasn't mine, if I was stepping out of line,  
But she's mine and I'm in line and she's the best I've ever seen  
  
Come on nature, let me show the way that I've been feeling all along  
Dark brown hair, green eyes and white skin  
You perfect every color that she's in  
  
Come on nature, I don't want to read a book or talk about the world  
Come on nature, I just want to spend some time being boy to the girl  
Her and me, I could be complete if you could let it be  
My desire, is to stretch myself inside her body's fire  
  
If I stumbled in then I could say that I had been to the chamber  
Where your greatest work of art was on display.
