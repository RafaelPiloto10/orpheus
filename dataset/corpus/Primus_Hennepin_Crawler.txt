Peddle it around the world

You get to touch that pie in the sky  
  
He'll show his crusty old pickle for a nickel  
Must say I'd rather not  
He tried to show a girl off of Florence street  
He's damn lucky he didn't get caught  
Fell asleep on night with a lit cigarette  
As he tried to drink away his pain  
When a fireman doused his burnt out shack  
All they found was a greasy stain  
  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go

And peddle your cares away  
You can ride the Hennepin Crawler for a dollar  
You best be prepared to pay  
'Cause when you ride the Hennepin Crawler for a dollar  
There's no friends or cuttin' deals  
You can ride the Hennepin Crawler for a dollar  
Sweat's gonna grease them wheels  
  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go  
  
He tried to buy a lotta ore for a quarter  
Way back in the olden days  
He sold his soul for a donut hole  
He could muster the nerve to ask for a raise  
She sold sea shells and other things  
Down by the old sea shore  
When she sold her song to a beer commercial  
She looked like a filthy whore  
Ha ha  
  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go

You feel that burn in your thigh  
'Cause when you ride the Hennepin Crawler for a dollar  
You get to bite that pie in the sky  
You get to bite that pie in the sky  
You get to bite that pie in the sky  
You get to bite that pie in the sky  
You get to bite that pie in the sky  
  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go
