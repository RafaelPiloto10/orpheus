On the first page of our story  
The future seemed so bright  
Then this thing turned out so evil  
Don't know why I'm still surprised  
  
Even Angels have their wicked schemes  
And you take that to new extremes  
But you'll always be my hero  
Even though you've lost you're mind  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
Ohh I love the way you lie  
  
Now there's gravel in our voices  
Glass is shattered from the fight  
In this tug of war you'll always win  
Even when I'm right  
  
'Cause you feed me fables from your hands  
With violent words and empty threats  
And it's sick that all these battles  
Are what keeps me satisfied  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
Ohh I love the way you lie  
  
So maybe I'm a masochist  
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave  
'Til these walls are goin' up  
In smoke with all our memories  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
Ohh I love the way you lie.
