Sometimes I like to sit and watch the clouds for hours  
It's just so extra-ordinary  
Standing in the pouring rain just because it's raining  
It's all so fascinating  
All that I need is what I see or rather what I feel  
You believe what you wanna believe  
And that's alright with me  
And that's alright to feel what you're feeling  
You know it makes no difference to me  
And I don't mind, I don't need no reason  
If it's good enough for you it's good enough for me  
And if I told you I could see what you can't see  
Would you say it's my imagination?  
'Cause what is real is only your reality  
It needs no explanation  
All that I need is what I see or rather what I feel  
You believe what you wanna believe  
And that's alright with me  
And that's alright to feel what you're feeling  
You know it makes no difference to me  
And I don't mind, I don't need no reason  
If it's good enough for you it's good enough for me  
Sometimes it's hard  
To know which way to go  
Just when you think you won't figure it out  
You'll know  
Sometimes I like to sit and watch the clouds for hours  
It's just so extra-ordinary  
Standing in the pouring rain just because it's raining  
It's all so fascinating  
Sometimes I like to sit and watch the clouds for hours  
Standing in the pouring rain just because it's raining  
All that I want is what I see or rather what I feel  
Rather what I feel  
Do you feel like I feel?  
All that I want is what I feel  
Do you feel like I feel?  
Do you feel like I feel?  
Do you feel like I feel?
