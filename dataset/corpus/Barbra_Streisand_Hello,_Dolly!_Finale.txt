[Horace:]  
Hello, Dolly!  
Well, hello, Dolly!  
It's so nice to have you here  
Where you belong  
I never knew Dolly  
Without you, Dolly  
Life was awfully flat  
And more than that  
Was awfully wrong  
[Dolly:]  
Here's my hat, Horace!  
I'm staying where I'm at, Horace!  
Dolly will never go away...  
  
[Horace:]  
Wonderful woman!  
  
[Both:]  
Again. ..  
  
[Townspeople:]  
Put on you Sunday clothes  
When you feel dawn and out  
Strut down the street and have your picture took  
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about  
That Sunday shine is a certain sign  
That you feel as fine as you look!  
  
Take the someone whose arms you're in  
Hold onto her tight and spin  
And one two three, one two three, one two three  
Look!  
  
[Cornelius:]  
I held her  
For an instant  
But my arms felt sure and strong  
  
[All:]  
It only takes a moment  
To be loved a whole life long...  
  
[Men:]  
Yes, it takes a woman  
A dainty woman  
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife  
Oh yes, It takes a woman  
A fragile woman  
To bring you the sweet things  
In life!  
  
[All:]  
Well, well, hello, Dolly!  
Well, hello, Dolly!  
It' so nice to have you back  
Where you belong  
You're looking swell, Dolly!  
We can tell, Dolly!  
You're still glowin'  
You're still crowin'  
You're still goin' strong  
You'll see the crowd swayin'  
For the band's playin'  
One of your old favorite songs  
From way back when  
  
Dolly  
Wow, wow, wow, fellas  
Look at the old girl now, fellas!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Dolly, you'll never go away  
Dolly, you'll never go away  
Dolly, you'll never go away  
Again!
