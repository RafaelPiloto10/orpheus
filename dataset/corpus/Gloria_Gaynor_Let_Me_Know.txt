I get a little peck and you're after to bed  
No warmth, no hug, no kind words are said  
Will you dream of me or someone new instead, oh  
Just love me and mean it, I'll follow you blind  
Lately I feel like a heart left behind  
I just can't stand still till you make up your mind  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
  
I'll take it, I'll make it  
Ooh, yes, I will  
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Listen, listen  
  
I'm livin' each minute with all that I've got  
Each breath is in pardon, each heartbeat is hot  
That's the way we were way back, you forgot [he forgot, he forgot], ooh  
You leave me so empty, it's makin' me sad  
To know that our good thing has turned for the bad  
Both of us are here, but where's the love we had  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
  
Let me know, let me know  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
  
I'll take it  
Heaven knows I'll make it  
  
I get a little peck and you're after to bed  
No warmth, no hug, and no kind words are said  
Will you dream of me or someone new instead, listen  
Just love me and mean it, I'll follow you blind  
Lately I feel like a heart left behind  
I just can't stand still till you make up your mind, listen  
  
I get a little peck and you're after to bed  
No warmth, no hug, no kind words are said

But lately I feel like a heart left behind  
I just can't stand still till you make up your mind  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right

Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right
