Open heart surgery  
That is what you do to me  
Cut me up, set me free  
That is what you do to me  
  
Now I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
I'm walking in a fire with you  
I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
When I walk into you  
I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
I'm walking in a fire with you  
I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
When I walk into you  
Into you, into you, into you, into you, into you  
  
Heart attack up your sleeve  
You can make me believe  
I would grow from the ground  
After you burn me down  
  
Now I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
I'm walking in a fire with you  
I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
When I walk into you  
  
I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
  
I'm walking in a fire with you  
I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
When I walk into you  
Into you, into you, into you, into you, into you  
Into you, into you, into you, into you, into you  
  
You burn me up, you burn me up  
You burn me up, and I love it  
You burn me up, you burn me up  
You burn me up, and I love it  
Now I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
I'm walking in a fire with you  
I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
When I walk into you  
I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
I'm walking in a fire with you  
I'm walking in, walking in a fire  
When I walk into you  
Into you, you burn me up  
You burn me up, you burn me up  
And I love it
