Why I've heard people say  
"Why is this tree bent?"  
Why they don't have God enough to know  
That's the way that it was meant  
  
Why is this little baby born  
All twisted and out of shape  
We're not to question what he does  
'Cause God makes no mistakes  
  
Why I've heard people say  
"Why is my child blind"  
Why is that old drunk still livin'  
When a daddy like mine is dyin'  
  
Our blessed father gives us life  
Has the power to take it away  
There's no reason for what he does  
God makes no mistakes  
  
Why I've heard people say  
"God cannot be alive"  
And all the things that people say  
Has to be a lie  
  
When they're down and out  
And they need a hand and their very souls at stake  
If they'll call on him and just believe  
God makes no mistakes
