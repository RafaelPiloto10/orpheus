Hey, her mind is on a different level  
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel  
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil  
She fuck, she suck, she swallow, man, it's like a triple double  
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble  
Just because they fuck ya girl don't mean them niggas love ya  
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up  
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"  
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"  
She said, "Daddy, what you think?", "Little girl, you're growin' up  
Growin up"  
  
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on  
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"  
She said "Daddy what you think?" "little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up"  
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song  
  
Mama couldn't never reach her  
Brother tried his best to teach her  
She thinks she's ready for the world  
Just look at daddy's little girl  
Just look at daddy's little girl  
Just look at daddy's little girl  
  
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl  
  
Can I get a witness, this is Sade mixed with Shawty Lo  
Ey, Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?  
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario  
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio  
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though  
Make me wonder where your father go?  
She said, "Don't analyze me, nigga, hold up  
Is that green on your table? Well if so, then roll it up  
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"  
She said "Daddy, what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up, growin' up"  
  
Hey, and blow a couple sacks and she gone  
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"  
She said, "Daddy what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up"  
Hey, listen, baby girl, they playin' your song  
  
Mama couldn't never reach her  
Brother tried his best to teach her  
She thinks she's ready for the world  
Just look at daddy's little girl  
  
Mama couldn't never reach her
