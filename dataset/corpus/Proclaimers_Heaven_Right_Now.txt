She's everything  
A married man  
Should look for in a girl  
She's married too  
But not to you  
And that's part of the thrill  
She's the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibi's your alibi, it's watertight  
  
She's old enough  
To know of love  
And know that this is not  
But young enough  
To not be willing  
To settle for what she's got  
She's the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibi's your alibi, it's watertight  
  
And if you get caught  
You're going to hell  
But it's heaven right now  
  
She's the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibi's your alibi, it's watertight  
  
She's everything  
A married man  
Should look for in a girl  
She's married too  
But not to you  
And that's part of the thrill  
She's the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibi's your alibi, it's watertight  
  
She's the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibi's your alibi, it's watertight  
  
Oh, and you're going to hell  
But it's heaven right now
