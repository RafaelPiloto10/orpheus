When the last eagle flies, over the last crumbling mountain  
And the last lion roars, at the last dusty fountain  
In the shadow of the forest, though she may be old and worn  
They will stare unbelieving  
At the Last Unicorn  
  
When the first breath of winter, through the flowers is icing  
And you look to the north, and a pale moon is rising  
And it seems like all is dying, and would leave the world to mourn  
In the distance hear her laughter  
It's the Last Unicorn  
I'm alive I'm alive  
  
When the last moon is cast, over the last star of morning  
And the future is past, without even a last desperate warning  
Then look into the sky where through, the clouds a path is formed  
Look and see her how she shimmers, it's the Last Unicorn  
I'm alive I'm alive!
