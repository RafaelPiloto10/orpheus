How glad the many millions  
Of toms and dicks and Williams  
Would be to capture me  
But you had such persistence  
You wore down my resistance  
I fell and it was swell  
  
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo  
How I won you I will never, never know  
It's not that you're attractive  
But, oh my heart grew active  
When you came into view  
  
I've got a crush on you, sweetie-pie  
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh  
I never had the least notion  
That I could fall with so much emotion  
Could you coo!  
Could you care?  
For a cunning cottage  
We could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
Cuz I've got a crush, my baby on you  
  
Could you coo!  
Could you care?  
For a cunning cottage  
We could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
Cuz I have got a crush, my baby on you
