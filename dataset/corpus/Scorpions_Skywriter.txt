You have got a body to  
To make a man just lose his mind  
To give me a shiver send it down to my spine  
It's all because of  
You have got a body to  
To bring a man down on his knees  
Just let me inside don't leave me begging please  
Don't ever go  
Everybody knows  
That I'm under the spell of your love  
Got nothing but you on my mind  
That's the way it goes  
It's no wonder you're tearing my heart  
Simply in pieces tonight  
You have got a body to  
To make a man just sell his soul  
Right to the devil I think after all  
I should have known  
Everybody knows  
That I'm under the spell of your love  
Got nothing but you on my mind  
Everybody knows  
And I wonder if you know it too  
I skywrite your name way up high  
In the sky in the sky in the sky  
To bring a man down on his knees  
Just let me inside don't leave me begging please  
Don't ever go  
Everybody knows  
That I'm under the spell of your love  
Got nothing but you on my mind  
That's the way it goes  
It's no wonder you're tearing my heart  
Simply in pieces tonight  
Everybody knows  
That I'm under the spell of your love  
Got nothing but you on my mind  
Everybody knows  
And I wonder if you know it too  
I skywrite your name way up high  
In the sky in the sky in the sky  
Skywriter
