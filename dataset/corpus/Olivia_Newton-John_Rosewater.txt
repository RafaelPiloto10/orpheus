In my room,where I used to sleep with you  
Things have changed  
All that's left are the memories of two  
Two who loved and dreamed where  
The trees seem to whisper your name  
But I don't like to go there  
'Cause Rosewater no longer feels the same  
Through the glass  
The sun shows the knocks on the wall  
seasons pass and you know how it looks in the fall  
Here at my Rosewater,the glass is a deeper green  
And a calm surrounds her  
when love was here,the warmest place I've ever been  
As I walk the echo of empty,I hear  
And I feel that this house is not home  
And now we're not here,It's lonely  
The stairs seem to beckon me to stay  
But dreams are better treasured  
Than slowly eaten away  
Christmas time,when snow filled your garden with while  
Then the moon's cold patterns on windows at night  
Now you'll make a new home  
With people as hopefull as we  
Over their dreams and their secrets  
But don't ever,please don't ever  
Rosewater,forget about me  
Forget about me
