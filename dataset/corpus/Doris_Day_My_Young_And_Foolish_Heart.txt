My young and foolish heart  
Makes me do the things I shouldn't  
That nine times out of ten  
I wouldn't do  
My young and foolish heart  
Never lets me use discretion  
In my manner of expression  
Every time I'm with you  
So, if my arms enfold you  
While I speak of love  
Remember what I told you  
Upon my soul, I can't control  
The recklessness of...  
My young and foolish heart  
Can be choosey and selective  
But you're the one objective  
Of my young and foolish heart  
[Bridge:]  
So, if my arms enfold you  
While I speak of love  
Remember what I told you  
Upon my soul, I can't control  
The recklessness of...  
My young and foolish heart  
Can be choosey and selective  
But you're the one objective  
Of my young and foolish heart
