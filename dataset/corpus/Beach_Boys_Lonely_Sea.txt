The lonely sea  
The lonely sea  
It never stops  
For you or me  
It moves along  
From day to day  
  
That's why my love  
That's why my love  
You'll never stay  
You'll never stay  
  
This pain in my heart  
These tears in my eyes  
Please tell the truth  
You're like the lonely sea (sea)  
Sea (sea)  
The lonely sea (sea)  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
(Lonely sea lonely sea)  
(Lonely sea lonely sea)  
Lonely sea
