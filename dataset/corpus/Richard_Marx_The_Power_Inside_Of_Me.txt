Seek and you shall find what you may already have.  
Sometimes it's your own shadow standing in your path.  
I have spent my life with a vision of myself,  
But I may have been somebody, somebody else.  
I feel a change in the tide  
As I hold my heart open wide.  
  
Never  
Knew what I could be.  
I never felt the power inside of me.  
Now I stand in all the wonder  
That the mirror couldn't see.  
I have the power inside of me, yeah.  
I have the power inside of me.  
  
Every time I held a rose, I only felt the thorns.  
I feel like today's the day I finally was born.  
Now that I see me through these eyes,  
I can do more than fantasize.  
Never  
Knew what I could be.  
I never felt the power inside of me.  
Now I stand in all the wonder  
That the mirror couldn't see!  
I have the power inside of me, oh woah.  
Inside of me,  
Inside of me!  
Yeah.
