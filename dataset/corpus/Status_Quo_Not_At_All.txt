Might say yes, might say no  
It's like watching the river flow  
Might be shallow, may be deep  
I won't lose any sleep, no, oh no  
Not at all will I take a fall for you  
Not at all 'cause you want it all  
And you try it on like a sad old song  
Don't you think it's wrong  
How you carry on and on?  
I won't worry, I won't fret  
Are you really that lonely yet?  
If you listen, what you hear  
Is it somebody saying so, oh no  
Not at all will I take a fall for you  
Not at all 'cause you want it all  
And you try it on like a sad old song  
Don't you think it's wrong  
How you carry on and on?  
Not at all will I take a fall for you  
Not at all 'cause you want it all  
And you try it on like a sad old song  
Don't you think it's wrong  
How you carry on?  
Not at all will I take a fall for you  
Not at all 'cause you want it all  
And you try it on like a sad old song  
Don't you think it's wrong  
How you carry on?  
Not at all
