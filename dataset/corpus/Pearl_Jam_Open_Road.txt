Can I have some water up?  
  
(You're the man Eddie)  
  
(Eddie, you're the man)  
  
There's no way to tell to be sure  
Ticket I'm a-wantin'  
This bus it's makin' way too many stops  
I can't get a-movin'  
Where's my destination?  
I take a deep swallow in my frustration  
I'm takin all I got  
It fits in this little bag  
All my life I had empty pockets  
All my life I saw evil eyes in old dark sockets  
I cut 'em off  
I cut 'em off  
I said, "I don't need them to make life work"  
I cut 'em off  
I cut 'em off  
I'll never think twice if to them I never ever talk  
  
So here I go  
I'm finally on my way  
Once I said goodbye  
That was my last wave  
Here I am on the, on the open road  
I've never felt better then when I am alone (Eddie)
