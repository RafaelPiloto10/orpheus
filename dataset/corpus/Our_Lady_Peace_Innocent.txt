Oh, Johnny wishes he was famous  
Spends his time alone in the basement  
With Lennon and Cobain and  
A guitar and a stereo  
  
While he wishes he could escape this  
But it all seems so contagious  
Not to be yourself and faceless  
In a song that has no soul  
  
I remember feeling low  
I remember losing hope  
I remember all the feelings  
And the day they stopped  
  
[Chorus]  
We are  
We are all innocent  
We are all innocent  
We are  
We are [Repeat x2]  
  
Oh, Tina's losing faith in what she knows  
Hates her music, hates all of her clothes  
Thinks of surgery and a new nose  
Every calorie is a war  
  
And while she wishes she was a dancer  
And that she'd never heard of cancer  
She wishes God would give her some answers  
And make her feel beautiful  
  
I remember feeling low  
I remember losing hope  
I remember all the feelings  
And the day they stopped  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day  
You'll have to let it go  
You'll have to let it go, no  
One day  
You'll stand up on your own  
You'll stand up on your own, yeah  
  
Remember losing hope  
Remember feeling low  
Remember all the feelings  
And the day they stopped  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]  
  
(Interwind 2nd chorus and next verse)  
  
One day  
You'll have to let it go  
You'll have to let it go, no  
One day  
You'll stand up on your own  
You'll stand up on your own, yeah  
  
We are  
We are all innocent
