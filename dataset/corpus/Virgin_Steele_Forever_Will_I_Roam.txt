Colder now, cold as the grave this town  
darkness falls the death of another soul  
empty lives the sins of the desperate  
shattered dreams a moments betrayal, forever will I roam  
forever will I roam  
  
[Chorus:]  
Forever will I roam a touch for a moment a scar for life  
Silent drifter on a highway side  
The heart of an angel, a killer's eyes  
  
Sacrifice, slaughter the love we made  
Blood and sand a victim of innocence  
Crime of pride, killing emotion  
Shroud of Tears inherit the wind, Forever will I roam  
Forever will I roam  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Speak to me, who are you anyway ?  
Vision of long drawn pain  
Calling and pleading  
Baring the guilty one again  
  
Colder now, cold as the grave this town  
Darkness falls, the eyes of a nameless stranger close  
  
[Chorus]
