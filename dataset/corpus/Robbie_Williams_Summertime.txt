This is how I pray for the summertime  
This is how I pray for the summer  
Got my my glass of shandy  
Now I feel fine  
This is how I pray in the summer  
  
If the more you pray  
The more you stay  
The less it's gettin' you down  
  
If the more you pray  
The more you stay  
The less it's gettin' you down  
  
Autumn time leaves fallin' all around  
Wintertime follows soon  
Little bunnies freezin' in the snow  
Winter's such an ugly brute  
  
Mid city blues gettin' you down  
Take a break from the strain  
Get out your card  
And drink a glass of wine  
Admit it you feel great  
It's the summertime  
  
This is how I feel in the summertime  
This is how I feel in the summer  
Got my glass of shandy  
Now I feel fine  
This is how I play, yeah  
  
This is how I feel in the summertime  
This is how I feel in the summer  
Got my glass of shandy  
And I feel fine  
This is how I play, yeah  
  
And if your love has met it's sad refrain  
Believe me you will love again  
All the best laid plans of mice and men go wrong  
It's written in this song, oh  
  
This is how we feel in the summertime  
This is how we feel in the summer  
What's mine is yours  
What's yours is mine  
This is how I play, yeah  
  
This is how we feel in the summertime  
This is how we feel in the summer  
Take it back to the summer 89  
This is how I play, yeah oh  
  
This is how we feel in the summer, oh  
  
The Mondays the Roses  
Blocking all your noses  
Wearing baggy clothes  
In our Buffalo poses  
Bank tellers stroppy little fellas  
Loved up in the clubs  
Of football thugs  
No malice  
A dicky dread locks  
Boozin' off your socks  
Big fish little fish  
Card board box  
Gimme french kiss  
I?ll love you from the rain  
I dream of Santa Ana on the road to Mandalay  
In the summer time  
Where the weather is hot  
In the summer time  
Where the weather is hot  
On my mind  
On my mind  
In the summer time  
Where the weather is hot  
In the summer time  
I got shivers  
Down my spine
