Why, oh why, oh why should I care for someone,  
Who doesn't care for me?  
I played the game I was subject of, it was all in vain 'cause I fell in love
with someone,  
Who doesn't care for me, for me.  
I hate the game and what it costs, to feel the pain for the love I lost to
someone,  
Who doesn't care for me.  
  
Why should I even care for someone,  
Who doesn't really care for me?  
I'm not excited lovin' someone,  
Who doesn't really care for me.  
  
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh ...  
Ohhh, ohhh ...  
Ohhh ...  
  
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh ...  
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh ...  
Ohhh, ohhh ...  
  
I've come to think that I never learn, it feels so bad 'cause I yearn and
yearn for someone,  
Who doesn't care for me.  
Why, oh why, oh why should I care for someone,  
Who doesn't care for me?  
Who doesn't care for me.  
Who doesn't care for me.
