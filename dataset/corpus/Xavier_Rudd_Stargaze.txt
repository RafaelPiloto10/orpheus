Stargaze, I feel it with everything you do  
And I like this and I do this all along  
This connection founded from day one  
Obviously peaceful staring to the stars  
She came my way yeah, when everything was tangled now  
I'm seeing clearer with every move, yeah  
See the sun is shining, ah you've every reason now  
I got something now and I got you, you, you, you  
Oh yes, we falling we falling from the sky  
And I caught you and I did this and I know why  
As she came my way yeah, when everything was tangled now  
And I'm seeing clearer with every move, yeah  
See the sun is shining, ah you've every reason now  
And I got something now, hey I got you, you, you, you, you, yeah  
Surprise  
Surprise  
I said
