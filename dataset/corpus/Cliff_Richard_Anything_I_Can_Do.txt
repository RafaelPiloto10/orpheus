Oh darlin' I can see that there's something  
Gettin' to you inside  
Well just remember you got nothing to hide  
''cause darlin' I'm just sitting here waiting  
Waiting till you give me a sign  
Make it soon and baby you'll make it on time  
''cause if there's anything that you want  
Just come running to me  
And if there's anything that you need  
Just come running to me  
If there's anything I can do then I'll do it  
Anything to make you see  
If there's anything I can do (darling)  
Just come running to me  
And darling just keep on believing  
Never let the feeling go  
Take it easy you'll do the right thing I know  
''cause darling there's a dream I've been dreaming  
Telling me that you're on your way  
We're gonna make it we're gonna make it today  
''cause if there's anything that you want  
Just come running to me  
And if there's anything that you need  
Just come running to me  
If there's anything I can do then I'll do it  
Anything to make you see  
If there's anything I can do (darling)  
Just come running to me  
(if there's anything that you want)  
Come runnin'-runnin' runnin' runnin'  
(and if there's anything that you need)  
Come runnin'-runnin' runnin' runnin'  
If there's anything I can do then I'll do it  
Anything to make you see  
If there's anything I can do (darling)  
Just come running to me  
-solo-  
''cause if there's anything that you want  
Just come running to me  
And if there's anything that you need  
Just come running to me  
Come runnin' come runnin' ooh ooh  
Don't you hesitate you just come running  
Run run run come runnin'  
Just gotta run my way  
Anytime night-day...
