Fatal beauty, the chokin' kind  
Dangerous feeling in this heart of mine  
How can you love me  
And treat me so unkind  
You got me floppin' like a fish in a pan  
Ain't no way to treat your man  
  
Maydell  
Baby won't you please love me  
Oh Maydell, sure put the squeeze on me  
I don't know why I love you,  
You put me through hell  
I can't break your spell, Maydell  
  
Fire spreads quick through the neighborhood  
Talk is cheap when the story's good  
Nobody said you did, but everybody said that you would  
You got me feelin' like a dog, chasin' his tail  
I know I'll never catch you - you play the game too well  
  
Maydell  
Baby won't you please love me  
Oh Maydell, sure put the squeeze on me  
Well I don't know why I love you,  
You put me through hell  
I can't break your spell, Maydell  
  
Every time I try to walk away,  
Just walk away  
You bat them eyes, beg me to stay,  
Honey won't you stay  
Ruby red lips, callin' my name  
Forget about the sorrow and the shame  
Maydell  
  
Well every time I try to walk away,  
Ooo just walk away  
You bat them eyes, beg me to stay,  
Honey won't you stay  
Ruby red lips, callin' my name  
Forget about the sorrow and the shame  
  
Maydell  
Baby won't you please love me  
Oh Maydell, sure put the squeeze on me  
Well I don't know why I love you,  
You put me through hell  
I can't break your spell  
  
Maydell  
Baby won't you please love me  
Oh Maydell, sure put the squeeze on me  
Well I don't know why I love you,  
You put me through hell  
I can't break your spell  
Can't break the spell  
Can't break the spell, Maydell  
Ohhh  
Ohh babe
