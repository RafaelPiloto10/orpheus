Sittin' after supper  
Watched the f.b.i.  
Asked for the cigarette  
I got no reply  
Then you dropped your culottes  
Revealing rubber underpants  
Sweat was forming in my shoes  
But you ended our romance  
I been refused  
I lost my shoes  
Last Monday morning  
Minus 20 degrees  
Walked to unemployment  
On my knees  
Dogs in the ocean  
Figs in the sea well come on baby  
And wakka-wakka-wakka with me  
Bought a kodak brownie  
Developed film at home  
Took some shots of sister  
Pants were full of loam  
Took a couple back views  
Took some up front  
Three tries wallet size  
I was lookin' at that cunt  
I been refused  
I lost my shoes.
