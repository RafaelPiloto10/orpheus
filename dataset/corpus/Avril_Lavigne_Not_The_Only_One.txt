He'd already asked for my number  
When will he call?, I wonder  
I'd give it away on a Friday  
I haven't heard a friggin' now it's Wednesday  
I don't know what he's thinking,  
He can leave me alone and I'll be waiting  
I don't think so  
There's other fish in the sea  
Who would love to swim with me  
  
You're not the only one  
Out there for me,  
And I know (and I know),  
You're not the only one  
Who's gonna be  
For me (for me)  
  
There's other fishes in the sea  
There's other fishes in the sea  
  
You finally called and I'm not home  
Don't even bother at all  
Can't remember what he looks like  
It's been 14 days, that's not my type  
I know they're not all like that  
There's gotta be some that don't think they're all that  
Yes I know so,  
There's other fish in the sea  
Who would love to swim with me  
  
You're not the only one  
Out there for me,  
And I know (and I know),  
You're not the only one  
Who's gonna be  
For me (for me)  
  
There's other fishes in the sea  
There's other fishes in the sea (in the sea)  
There's other fishes in the sea  
There's other fishes in the sea (fishes in the sea)  
  
You're not the only one  
Out there for me,  
And I know (and I know),  
You're not the only one  
Who's gonna be (be)  
For me (for me)  
  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)
