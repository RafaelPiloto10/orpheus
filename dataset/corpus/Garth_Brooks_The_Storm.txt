She sits among the pieces of broken glass and photographs  
Reluctantly releases the last of what was her past  
It struck without a warning or did she just ignore the signs  
In those dark clouds forming behind her silver lines.  
  
Then the door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain.  
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane.  
Oh, she's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore.  
She's alive but can she survive the storm.  
  
A broken jewel box dancer lies in pieces down the hall.  
She's finding out the answers don't change nothing at all.  
It's time that she stopped searching for who's to blame or what went wrong.  
The only thing for certain is he's gone,  
she's got to move on.  
  
Then the door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain.  
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane.  
She's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore.  
She's alive but can she survive the storm.  
  
Someday days just roll on by without a gray cloud in the sky.  
She keeps telling herself, "I will make it on my own".  
And her friends they've all gone back to their lives,  
Thinking she will be alright,  
As she races through the night to make it home.  
  
The door it slams like thunder and the tears they fall like rain.  
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane.  
Oh, she's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore.  
She's alive but can she survive the storm.
