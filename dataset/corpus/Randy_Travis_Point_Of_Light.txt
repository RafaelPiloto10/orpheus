There is a point when you cannot walk away,  
When you have to stand up straight and tall,  
And mean the words you say.  
There is a point you must beside,  
Just to do it 'cause it's right,  
That's when you become a point of light.  
  
There is a darkness that everyone must face,  
It wants to take what's good and fair,  
And lay it all to waste.  
And that darkness,  
Covers everything inside,  
Until it meets a single point of light.  
  
All it takes  
Is a point of light  
A ray of hope  
In the darkest night  
If you see what's wrong  
And you try to make it right  
You will be a point of light  
  
There are heroes,  
Whose names we never hear,  
A dedicated army of quiet volunteers.  
Reaching out to feed the hungry,  
Reaching out to save the land,  
Reaching out to help their fellow men.  
  
There are dreamers  
Who are making dreams come true  
Taking time to teach the children,  
There's nothing they can't do.  
Giving shelter to the homeless,  
Giving hope to those without,  
Isn't that what this land all about.  
  
One by one, from the mountains to the sea,  
Points of light, are calling out to you and me.  
  
All it takes  
Is a point of light  
A ray of hope  
In the darkest night  
If you see what's wrong  
And you try to make it right  
You will see a point of light  
  
If you see what's wrong  
And you try to make it right  
You will be  
A point of light.
