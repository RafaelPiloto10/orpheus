You know I feel so bad, children  
Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day  
Yes, I do, y'all  
  
Don't you know I feel so bad, children  
Oh, Lord, like a ballgame on a rainy day  
  
Whoa, since I lost my woman  
You see I have to shake my head  
And then I walk away  
I have to walk away  
  
Y'all listen to this  
  
I just wanna tell you people  
I wanna tell you just how I feel  
Can you hear me now  
  
I wanna tell all you people out there  
I wanna tell you just how I feel  
Oh, how I feel  
  
I feel so bad, I feel so bad  
Because my women  
She gave me a dirty deal  
The child messed up my mind  
Oh, yes, she did  
  
Now listen, y'all  
I got one more thing  
I want to talk to you about  
Wait a minute  
  
Sometimes I want to leave here  
Then again I want to stay, yeah  
Did you hear what I said  
  
Sometimes I want to leave  
This town, yes, I do  
Then again I want to stay  
  
You see, the thing is  
I already got my suitcase packed up  
So I guess I'll have to catch a train  
And then I'll ride away  
  
Said I'm gonna move  
Gonna move on  
Gonna move on  
Lord, I wanna move  
  
Since the woman been gone  
I ain't had no love  
That's what I want  
That's what I need  
  
A little dab'll do me  
Ooh, sock it to me, Lord  
Somebody help me  
Help me find my way...
