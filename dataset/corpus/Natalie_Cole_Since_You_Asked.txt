What I'll give you since you asked  
Is all my time together  
Take the rugged sunny days  
The warm and rocky weather  
Take the roads that I have walked along  
Looking for tomorrows time  
Piece of mind  
  
As my life spills into yours  
Changing with the hours  
Filling up the world with time  
Turning time to flowers  
I can show you all the songs  
That I never sang to one man before  
  
We have seen a million stones  
Lying by the water  
You have climbed the hills with me  
To the mountain shelter  
Taking off the days  
One by one  
Setting them to breathe  
In the sun  
  
Take the lilies and the lace  
From the days of childhood  
All the willow winding paths  
Leading up and outward  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for  
  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for  
Nothing more
