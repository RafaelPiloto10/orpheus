To kiss and tell, it's just not my style.  
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart,  
Broke it right in two, and it took some time but I'm feelin' like  
I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna kiss a girl  
I wanna hold her tight  
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight  
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow  
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world  
I wanna kiss a girl  
  
It's that moment when you start closin' in  
First you're holding back, then surrenderin'  
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing.  
Do you wanna try?  
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah.  
Are you ready? Are you ready, to cross that line, put your lips on mine?  
  
(Put your lips on mine baby)  
  
Do you wanna try?  
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?  
  
I wanna kiss a girl  
I wanna hold her tight  
Maybe make a little magic baby  
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow  
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely  
  
[Chorus]
