Uh, uh huh  
Gangster  
  
[Verse 1]  
I though it was love  
Didn't wanna admit that  
When I looked back  
It was lust  
Too bad I had to learn a lesson  
They're against me  
You were with me  
But you never let your old thang go  
I don't care to know why  
Girl I guess some things  
Can't be explained  
  
[Chorus]  
It is what it is (what it is)  
I don't know what to call it  
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else)  
  
It is what it is (what it is)  
Just don't let yourself get caught up (uh huh)  
When it's really something else  
  
[Verse 2]  
Know that is okay  
Felt something going on  
For every time that I thought it (uh)  
Girl I bet that's what it was  
Called myself being down for you (ice cold)  
Just know that  
Before I knew you I already knew you  
How you get down (uh)  
But if that's your thang, babe  
I ain't mad at you  
It's cool  
Just know I did it too  
  
[Chorus]  
It is what it is  
I don't know what to call it (don't know what to call it)  
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else)  
It is what it is (what it is)  
Just don't let yourself get caught up (aww girl)  
When it's really something else (yeah, yeah  
Take it to the bridge  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm not saying that two wrongs can make it right  
It ain't too late for us to try (yeah)  
Do we put back together  
Or we say goodbye? (ha)  
  
[Usher Talking]  
Give me another chance  
You did it too shit  
It's all good, baby  
We even, right?  
Well how can I smile, shit?  
It's better to smile than to frown anyday  
Yeah listen  
  
[Chorus]  
It is what it is  
I don't know what to call it (don't know what to call it)  
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (Girl I'm feeling something else)  
  
It is what it is (what it is)  
Just don't let yourself get caught up (get caught up)  
When it's really something else (if you want to get to be with me baby)  
  
It is what it is (what it is)  
I don't know what to call it (call it)  
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (uh, uh uh yeah yeah come on)  
  
It is what it is (what it is)  
Just don't let yourself get caught up (caught up, when I)  
When it's really something else (oh my)  
To the bridge  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm not saying that two wrongs can make a right  
But it ain't too late for us to try (baby)  
Do we put back together  
Or we say goodbye? (come on ya'll)  
  
[Chorus: until end]  
It is what it is (what is)  
I don't know what to call it (don't know what to call it uhhh uhh)  
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (gonna give my love)  
It is what it is (what it is)  
Just don't let yourself get caught up (caught up oh no, no)  
When it's really something else (gonna give my love)
