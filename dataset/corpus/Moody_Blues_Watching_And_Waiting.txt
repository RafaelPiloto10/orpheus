Watching and waiting  
For a friend to play with  
Why have I been alone so long  
Mole he is burrowing his way to the sunlight  
He knows there's some there so strong  
  
'Cause here there's lot of room for doing  
The thing you've always been denied  
Look and gather all you want to  
There's no one here to stop you trying  
  
Soon you will see me  
'Cause I'll be all around you  
But where I come from I can't tell  
But don't be alarmed by my fields and my forests  
They're here for only you to share  
  
'Cause here there's lot of room for doing  
The things you've always been denied  
So look and gather all you want to  
There's no one here to stop you trying  
  
Watching and waiting  
For someone to understand me  
I hope it won't be very long
