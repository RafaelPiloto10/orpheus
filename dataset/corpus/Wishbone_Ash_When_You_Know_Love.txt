She was born in a spirit of brightness  
Knew just how to deal with poison wine.  
Be very brave, she taught me to behave  
On the road that is so long.  
Be not afraid of tears,  
When you know the love  
Then you can know no fear.  
When you know love  
You can know no fear.  
She looks on from her realm within the other  
Now she's fighting hard to keep her sovereignty.  
She will live forever  
In her spirit of brightness  
She will always deal with poison wine.  
To stay alive  
She taught me to survive  
In the face of every trial.  
Be not afraid of tears  
When you know the love  
Then you can know no fear.  
When you know love  
You can know no fear.
