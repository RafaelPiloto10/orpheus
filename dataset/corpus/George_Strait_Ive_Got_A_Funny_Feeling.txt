Well my baby's wearin' a permanent smile  
A satisfied look I ain't seen for awhile  
I ain't had no rings, fulfilled any dreams  
But somethin's come over my baby it seems  
  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my honey  
Lord I love that child, love to see her smile  
But these circumstances ain't funny  
Where lies a danger, is he a stranger or a pal  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal  
  
If I came home early, lord what would I find?  
Maybe I'd rather just walk around blind  
I know baby loves me, lord I understand  
I love how emotions can get out of hand  
  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my honey  
Lord I love that child, love to see her smile  
But these circumstances ain't funny  
Where lies a danger, is he a stranger or a pal  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal  
  
Wherever he is, well I'm callin' his bluff  
I'm gonna start wearin' that good smellin' stuff  
And I'll be the lover that I used to be  
Whatever she's missin', she'll get it from me  
  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my honey  
Lord I love that child, love to see her smile  
But these circumstances ain't funny  
Where lies a danger, is he a stranger or a pal  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal  
  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my gal
