I can't live with you  
But I can't live without you  
I can't let you stay  
Ooh but I can't live if you go away  
I don't know just how it goes  
All I know is I can't live with you  
  
Yeah I'm having a hard time  
I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair  
You may think that I don't care  
But I traveled a long road to get hold of my sorrow  
I tried to catch a dream  
But nothing's what it seems  
Love is saying baby it's all right  
When deep inside you're really petrified  
Lover turns to hater  
On this escalator  
  
I can't live with you, yeah  
But I can't live without you  
I can't breathe if you stay  
But I can't bear you to go away  
I don't know what time it is  
All I know is I can't live with you  
  
We're stuck in a bad place  
We're trapped in a rat race  
And we can't escape  
Maybe there's been some mistake  
We're trying to make a high score  
We're walking through a closed door  
And nobody's winning  
We're just sinning against ourselves  
  
Hold on baby tell me it's all right  
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside  
Passions screaming hotter  
Doin' what we gotta do, yeah  
  
I can't live with you I can't live with you  
I can't live I can't live  
I can't I can't live with you  
But baby I'll never ever leave you  
  
I can't live with you  
But I can't live without you  
Cause I'm in love with you  
Ooh and everything about you  
  
I can't live with you  
No I just can't live I just can't live  
I can't live with you  
Yeah and I can't live without you  
Through the madness through the tears  
We've still got each other  
For a million years, yeah  
  
Ooh yeah  
Yeah, I can't live without you, yeah yeah  
I can't live without you  
Yeah yeah, oh oh oh  
I can't live without you  
I can't live without you  
I can't live without you  
Oh oh, I can't live without you, baby baby baby  
Without you  
I can't live without you
