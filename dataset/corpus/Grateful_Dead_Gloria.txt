Want to tell you about my baby, you know she comes around  
Just about five feet-four from her head to the ground  
You know she comes around here just about midnight  
She makes me feel so good, she makes me feel alright  
  
And her name is G.L.O.R.I.A G.L.O.R.I.A  
Gloria I want to to shout it all night  
Gloria I want to to shout it all day  
  
She comes around here just about midnight  
She only come to make me feel good, she makes me feel alright  
She comes walking down my street, she comes up to my house  
Knockin' on my door, now she comes to my room  
  
A she makes me feel alright  
And her name is G.L.O.R.I.A. G.L.O.R.I.A.  
Gloria I want to to shout it all day
