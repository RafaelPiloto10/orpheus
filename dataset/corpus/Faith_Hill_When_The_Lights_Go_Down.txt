When the lights go down  
He'll be fillin' a pan with a broom in his hand  
In some dive across town  
He'll be wiping the bar, moppin' the floor  
Countin' his tips, lockin' the doors  
Wrestling the devil that tells him to pour another round  
  
When the lights go down  
She'll be callin' her friends from her Mercedes Benz  
But it's too late now  
They were there for the fame, the flash and the thrill  
For the drop of the name, the parties, the pills  
As another star falls form the Hollywoody Hills without a sound  
  
[Chorus]  
When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be  
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see  
When you feel that hole inside your soul  
And wonder what you're made of  
Well we all find out  
When the lights go down  
When the lights go down  
  
At the end of the day when this game that I play  
Has gone another round  
As I lay there alone on this big empty bed  
With nothing but thoughts of you in my head  
I think of the things that I wish I had said  
When you were still around  
  
When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be  
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see  
And I wonder if all my life's about the sum  
Of all my fear and all my doubts  
When the lights go down  
  
[Chorus]
