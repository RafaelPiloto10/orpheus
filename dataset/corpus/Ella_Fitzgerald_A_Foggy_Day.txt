I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people i knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do, what to do, what to do  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
  
But as i walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day i've known  
  
A foggy day, in London town  
Had me low, had me down  
I viewed the morning, with much alarm  
British museum, had lost its charm  
  
How long i wondered,  
Could this thing last  
But the age of miracles, hadn't past  
For suddenly, i saw you there  
And through foggy London town,  
The sun was shining everywhere  
  
For suddenly, i saw you there  
And through foggy London town,  
The sun was shining everywhere  
  
Everywhere  
Everywhere  
Everywhere
