Watch him ride into the sunset  
He'd have the little fat guy  
Right along his side  
Echoing off the canyon, Hey Cisco  
From Pancho 'n' pretty soon  
The black sombrero would reply  
Hey Pancho what's happening mi amigo  
It's getting somewhere near the end,  
This winding trail  
When we've raced around the corner  
For the final dusty time  
Mr Renaldo 'n' Carillo's  
Going to jail  
  
Can't open no more supermarkets  
Duncan's sombrero's hanging  
Up there with his guns  
Some cigarro sucking slag  
Under a cheap Hollywood chandelier  
Says 'Cisco, Kid you know  
Your day is done  
Let me know how you are doin'  
Mr. Renaldo  
If you need me I could be  
A friend for life  
There don't seem any point  
We should throw 'way  
All these years  
Why don't we saddle up  
And ride out one more time  
  
What they doing to my friend  
What they doing to my man  
Don't matter when  
I'll stay to the end  
Hey Cisco  
Let's go out in style  
We're going down together
