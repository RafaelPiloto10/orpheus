I never knew what a kiss could mean  
Until the first time I kissed you,  
You took my love in the palm of your hand  
An' showed me what a woman could do  
Now I don't want sugar coated loving  
Just silver tongue tenderness,  
You gotta give me a certain satisfaction  
The kind of love you seal with a kiss  
  
An' spit it out, spit it out, spit it out  
If you don't like it  
Spit it out, spit it out, spit it out  
If you don't like it  
  
I can remember, I can recall  
When I first set my eyes on you,  
I'll never forget the thrill of it all  
Dreaming of the things we could do  
Baby, you must be crazy,  
Fooling with a man like me,  
'cause I roll my dice with a heart of ice  
An' make it clear to see  
  
Spit it out, spit it out, spit it out  
If you don't like it  
Spit it out, spit it out, spit it out  
If you don't like it  
  
I never knew what a kiss could mean  
'Til the first time I kissed you,  
You took my love in the palm of your hand  
An' showed me what a woman could do  
Your sweet caress an' tenderness  
Can take the pain away,  
The things that you do make a queen out of you  
An' make me a king for a day  
  
If you don't like it, spit it out  
  
Now I know what your love can do  
I'll be hanging 'round your door,  
An' I'm gonna love you baby,  
I'll give you more than you bargained for  
  
Spit it out, spit it out, spit it out  
If you don't like it  
Spit it out, spit it out, spit it out  
If you don't like it  
  
Spit it out, if you don't like it
