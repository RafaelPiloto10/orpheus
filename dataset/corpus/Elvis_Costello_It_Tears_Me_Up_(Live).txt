I see you walk with him  
I see you talk to him  
It tears me up, oh, it tears me up  
And I can't stop crying  
Oh, baby, I can't stop crying  
  
I see you kiss his lips  
And squeeze his fingertips  
It tears me up, oh, baby, it tears me up  
And there's nothing I can do about it  
  
Oh, baby, baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you?  
It's a faithless world we're livin' in  
When I turn around and there you are with my best friend  
Sometimes when you pass me on the street  
  
You look at me as if to say I'm sorry my, sweet  
And being sorry might be enough  
Then you look back at him and [unverified] a smile  
And that makes me feel kinda rough  
  
Oh, darlin', it tears me up  
I see you smile at him  
You never tire of him  
It tears me up  
  
Oh, baby, it tears me up  
There's nothing I can do about it  
Baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you?  
Still hungry for something I can't have  
  
Oh, it tears me up so bad  
Still hungry for something I can't have  
Tears me up so bad  
Can't you see I'm still in love with you?  
Still hungry for something I can't have  
  
Baby, please, please, please  
I'm still hungry for something I can't have  
It tears me up so bad  
Oh, oh, it tears me up so bad  
Tears me up so bad
