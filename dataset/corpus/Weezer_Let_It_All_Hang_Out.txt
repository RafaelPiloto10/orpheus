I was driving this morning and sat in traffic on the way to work, work  
Soon as I got in, my boss was tripping and acting like a freaking jerk, jerk  
Me and my girl ain't speak in weeks and I can't remember the reason why, why,
why  
On top of that it's a recession, I feel like Jay-Z, this can't be life, life  
  
[Chorus]  
Tonight I'm leaving all my worries and my problems in the house  
I'm going out with my homies and we gonna let it, gonna let it  
All hang out, let it all hang out  
It's the last day of the weekend, boy I need to release  
And let it all hang out, let it all hang out  
I'm going out with my homies and we gonna let it all hang out  
  
Time for me to leave this place, don't feel like its going to come, come, come  
I got bills on top of bills and I don't know where I'm getting my money from,
from  
The walls feel like their closing in,  
I honestly don't feel like I can make it, make it, make it  
I'm so mad and I can't take it, that's why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Me and JD chilling in the shack  
Sharing Chiclets from the same pack  
One hundred and eighty-proof vitamin water  
Energy flavor  
Take us to your daughter  
I want to see you pretty ladies on the dance floor (dance floor)  
Put your hands up in the air like you don't care no more (we don't care no
more)  
We gonna hit the town tonight, we were born to rock  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Let it all hang out)  
I'm going out with my homies, and we gonna let it all hang out
