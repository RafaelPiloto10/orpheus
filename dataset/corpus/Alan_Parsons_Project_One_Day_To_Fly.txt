(elliott, english)  
  
Where does a dream belong  
Locked in the mind on the edge of time  
Like a ship lost in a storm  
How do we find the key  
Longing to see, through the artist's eye  
Maybe only birds can fly  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
One day to fly  
  
Someone said and I believe  
Try if you dare, you can walk on air  
A dream is all you need  
A circle that takes you high  
Lighter than air as the earth goes by  
Through a spiral in the sky  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
  
Just a charcoal sketch on canvas  
Made them laugh but now they see  
That the artist had a vision  
That the wind could set us free  
It's a bridge until tomarrow  
Taking us beyond the sun  
As the artist paints his picture  
The story's just begun  
  
Analyzing, criticizing  
Fear of the unknown  
Theorizing, visualizing  
The road to take us home  
If it takes forever  
Someone's gonna fly  
We may never get to heaven  
But still we're gonna try  
  
Watching the birds  
As they sail on the wind  
One day to fly
