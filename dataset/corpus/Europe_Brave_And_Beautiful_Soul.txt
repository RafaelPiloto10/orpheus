Well, here's to you all cynical  
Here's the ammunition that you need  
Here's another song about empathy  
Please yourself, think what you will  
  
In her light that shines I fall apart  
(Fall apart)  
Her life is blessed and I don't understand  
Her brave and beautiful soul  
(Brave and beautiful soul)  
  
Here's to you all sensible  
Never taking time to stand for something  
Hey, the future always come 'round here too soon  
I just can't leave here doing nothing  
  
In her light that shines I fall apart  
(Fall apart)  
In her darkness how she wins my heart  
Her brave and beautiful soul  
(Brave and beautiful soul)  
  
An emotional response  
Sometimes better than an intellectual one  
  
In her light that shines I fall apart  
(Fall apart)  
Her life is blessed and I don't understand  
Her brave and beautiful soul  
(Brave and beautiful soul)
