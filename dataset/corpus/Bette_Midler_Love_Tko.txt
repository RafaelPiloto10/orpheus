Oooooh  
  
Lookin' back over my years  
I guess I've shed some tears.  
Told myself time and again  
This time I'm gonna win.  
  
But another fight. Things ain't right.  
I'm losing again.  
It takes a fool to lose twice  
And start all over again.  
  
I think I better let him go.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO.  
Let it go, baby.  
I think I better let him go.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO. Ohh, yeah.  
  
I tried to take control of the love.  
He took control of me.  
See you lose all thought and sense of time.  
You have a change of mind.  
  
Takin' the bumps and the bruises  
And all the pain of a two-time lose.  
And I try to hold on. My faith is gone.  
It's just another sad song.  
  
So I think I gotta  
Gotta let it go  
I gotta let him go.  
Let it go, baby.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO.  
Oh, yes it does, yes it does.  
  
I think I gotta  
Gotta let it go  
Mmmmmmm.  
Let it go, baby.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO.  
  
Boy, whatcha want me to do? Can't stand up to you.  
No no no no.  
  
I try to take control of the love.  
It took control of me.  
See you lose all thought and sense of time.  
You have a change of mind.  
  
Taking the bumps and the bruises  
And all the pain of a two-time lose.  
Then I try to hold on. My faith is gone.  
It's just another sad song.  
  
I think I better  
Better let it go  
I better let him go.  
Let it go, baby.  
'Cause it looks like another love TKO.  
  
Yeah, I better  
Better let it go  
I gotta let him go.  
Let it go, Miss M.  
Another love, love TKO.  
  
Ooohhhh, boy you got me turned around and around and around.  
Around and around.  
Everybody's got to cry sometime.  
That's what they say. I heard them say.  
  
Everybody's gonna cry sometime.  
Mama says that they did, that they did.
