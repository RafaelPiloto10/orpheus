Your sweet expression the smile you gave me  
The way you looked when we met  
It's easy to remember so hard to forget  
I hear you whisper I always love you  
I know it's over and yet  
It's easy to remember but oh so hard to forget  
So I must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight  
I'd rather dream than have that lonely feeling stealing through the night  
Each little moment is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
It's easy to remember but so hard to forget  
So I must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight  
I'd rather dream than have that lonely old feeling stealing through the night  
Each little moment is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
It's easy to remember and so hard to forget
