I thought I knew, the magic of you  
And then, you kissed me  
Dear, when you kissed me  
I simply stood there and gazed, completely amazed  
I walked around, both feet on the ground  
And then, you kissed me  
Dear, when you kissed me  
I found myself on a cloud, apart from the crowd  
I had nothing to glow about  
You came by  
Now I know all there's to know about  
Things like stars in the sky  
I will confess I thought for awhile  
That you'd resist me  
But then you kissed me  
And now I'm in love  
I will confess I thought for awhile  
That you'd resist me  
But then you kissed me  
And now I'm in love  
You kissed me  
And now I'm in love
