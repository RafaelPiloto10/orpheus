Suddenly before my eyes  
Hues of indigo arise  
With them how my spirit sighs  
Paint the sky with stars  
  
Only night will ever know  
Why the heavens never show  
All the dreams there are to know  
Paint the sky with stars  
  
Who has placed the midnight sky  
So a spirit has to fly?  
As the heavens seem so far now,  
Who will paint the midnight star?  
  
Night has brought to those who sleep  
Only dreams they cannot keep  
I have legends in the deep  
Paint the sky with stars  
  
Who has placed the midnight sky  
So a spirit has to fly?  
As the heavens seem so far now,  
Who will paint the midnight star?  
  
Place a name upon the night  
One to set your heart alight  
And to make the darkness bright  
Paint the sky with stars.
