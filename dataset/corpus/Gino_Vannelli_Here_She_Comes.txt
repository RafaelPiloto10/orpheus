Here she comes the ghost of venus de milo  
A touch of madness streaks through her hair  
She'll tear your heart with a poisonous arrow  
She'll rob your soul if you look at her square  
.......... do I dare?  
Here she comes ..... such a beautiful sight  
Here she comes ..... oh I wish that I might  
Hear she comes the wildest cat in the jungle  
A beast of beauty beyond compare  
I watch the stalkers stalk but they stumble  
The fools rush into vanity fair  
............ but she's not there  
Here she comes ..... such a beautiful sight  
Here she comes ..... oh I wish that I might  
And all the green eyed women  
Swaying to the rhythm  
Here she comes ..... such a beautiful sight  
Here she comes ..... oh I wish that I might  
Here she comes  
Here she comes
