Fly away with me tonight  
Take me on a one-way flight in your lovin' arms  
And everything's gonna be alright  
You're the one who took my hand  
When no one else could understand  
You're the one who moves me  
Like nobody else can  
  
In your eyes I see the light  
It's your emotions glowing bright  
So keep the fires burning  
And let it warm me through the night  
You can be a part of me  
'Cause you're what love was meant to be  
You and me baby we'll set the flame inside free  
  
Take me down to where I want to be  
Turn around, the man who lives inside of me  
Take me down and lose me all night long  
Hold me close and make me strong  
Take me down, take me down tonight  
You don't have to stay forever  
Let's just put our hearts together  
And share another night in ecstasy  
We know that it's feelin' better  
Every time we come together  
Maybe love was meant for you and me
