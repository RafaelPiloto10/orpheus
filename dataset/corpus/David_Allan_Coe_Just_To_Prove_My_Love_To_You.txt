I could walk across kansas in A new york minute  
Climb the colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through arizona like A flat land lizard  
If I thought it'd do me any good at all  
I could swim lake erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat A west virginia coal miner's shoes  
Drink the mississippi river if it took A month of sundays  
Just to prove my love to you  
  
Chorus:  
I remember well the first time I kissed you  
Cuss things ain't been the same ever since  
You got me thinkin' I could eat A ten-Penny nail  
And spit out A barbed wire fence  
Well there ain't A living creature gonna ever come between us  
I fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
If that ain't enough I'd start it all over  
Just to prove my love to you  
  
I could ride my pony through the eye of A hurricane  
Climb mount everest on A string  
Jump niagara falls in A burnin' barrel  
And bring ya back A hoop smoke ring  
Wrestle alligators in the okefenokee  
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do  
If you just say the word  
I'd catch that great speckled bird  
And bring it back to you  
  
Chorus:  
I remember well the first time I kissed you  
'cause things ain't been the same ever since  
You got me thinking I could eat A ten-Penny nail  
And spit out A barbed wire fence  
Well there ain't A living creature gonna ever come between us  
I fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
If that ain't enough I'd start it all over  
Just to prove my love to you  
  
I could walk across kansas in A new york minute  
Climb the colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through arizona like A flat land lizard  
If I thought it'd do me any good at all  
I could swim lake erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat A west virginia coal miner's shoes
