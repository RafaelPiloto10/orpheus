All of my life  
I been searching  
For someone to find me  
I have been looking  
Waiting for your arms  
To pull Me  
  
You took Me  
In from the cold  
And out of the dark  
You have taken Me  
Into your heart  
  
Chorus  
  
You are my home  
You are the one that I come to  
You are the shelter I run to  
To keep Me safe from the cold  
You are my home  
You are the love  
That completes me  
You are the touch  
That has freed Me  
I look in your eyes  
And I know  
You are my home  
  
You were the light in the window  
When I couldnt find my way  
You led my heart to  
Want them to place me  
Here besides you  
  
You are where I always will be  
You are where I belong  
I've been looking for you  
For so long  
  
You are my home  
You are the one that I come to  
You are the shelter I run to  
To keep Me safe from the cold  
You are my home  
You are the love  
That completes me  
You are the touch  
That has freed Me  
I look in your eyes  
And I know  
You are my home  
  
And I'll never be alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, You are my home  
  
I look in your eyes  
Te miro a los ojos  
Why me haces sentir  
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby  
You are my home  
You are my home
