Please don't show your soul to me  
I think I'd see the light shine through  
And please don't greet me on the street  
I'd like to see a world without you  
Please don't change your uniform  
And start to mourn the thousands dead  
And please wear what you've always worn  
And don't be drawn by what I've said  
'cause I've found there's nothing more  
That I could say to you  
Nothing I could do to change your mind  
Change your ways and your tune  
So please don't feel you have to sway  
Or move away from how you feel  
And please say what you mean to say  
And always stay with a heart of steel
