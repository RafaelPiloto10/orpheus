Lost in a dream in the arms of the night  
Two lonely prisoners of our own device  
Don't let me go. Hold on together  
You want to know if love can be real  
I want to take everything I can steal  
Love on the line, it's now or never.  
Why can't the night last forever.  
  
This could be Paradise  
Holding you here by my side  
If we just close our eyes  
We'll be in Heaven tonight.  
  
Run through the night down streets of desire  
Burning my soul, my heart's on fire  
Give up the fight, it's sweet surrender  
With trembling hands we reach for it all  
Two desperate hearts waiting to fall  
I need you now, now more than ever.  
  
Why can't the night last forever.  
  
This could be Paradise  
Holding you here by my side  
If we just close our eyes  
We'll be in Heaven tonight.  
  
This feels like Paradise  
I see the world in our eyes  
If we just hold on tight  
We'll be in Heaven tonight.
