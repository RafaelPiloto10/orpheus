All the photographs are peeling  
And colors turn to gray, he's stayin'  
In his room with memories for days, he faced  
An undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced  
By the loss of one he could not replace  
And there's no reason that she'd pass  
And there is no god with the plan, it's sad  
And his holiness is proof, it's sad  
He could only love you, it's sad  
The door swings through a passing fable  
A fate we may delay, we say  
Holding on, to live within our embrace  
Eleven nights, he laid in bed  
Hoping that dreams would bring her back, it's sad  
And his holiness is proof, it's sad  
He could only love you, it's sad  
Holding his last breath, believing  
He'll make his way  
But she's not forgotten  
He's haunted  
He's searching for escape  
If just one wish could bring her back, it's sent  
And his holiness is proof, it's sad  
He will always love you, it's sad
