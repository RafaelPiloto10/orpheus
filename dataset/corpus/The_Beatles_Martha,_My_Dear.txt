Martha, my dear  
Though I spend my days in conversation, please  
Remember me  
Martha, my love  
Don't forget me  
Martha, my dear  
  
Hold your head up, you silly girl  
Look what you've done  
When you find yourself in the thick of it  
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you  
Silly girl  
  
Take a good look around you  
Take a good look you're bound to see  
That you and me were meant to be  
With each other  
Silly girl  
  
Hold you're hand out, you silly girl  
See what you've done  
When you find yourself in the thick of it  
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you  
Silly girl  
  
Martha, my dear  
You have always been my inspiration  
Please, be good to me  
Martha, my love  
Don't forget me  
Martha, my dear.
