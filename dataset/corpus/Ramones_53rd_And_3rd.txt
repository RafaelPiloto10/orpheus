If you think you can, well, come on man  
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam  
I said, no more of your fairy stories  
'Cause I got my other worries  
  
53rd and 3rd, standin' on the street  
53rd and 3rd, I'm tryin' to turn a trick  
53rd and 3rd, you're the one they never pick  
53rd and 3rd, don't it make you feel sick?

Then I took out my razor blade  
Then I did what God forbade  
Now the cops are after me  
But I proved that I'm no sissy

53rd and 3rd, 53rd and 3rd  
53rd and 3rd, 53rd and 3rd  
53rd and 3rd, 53rd and 3rd  
53rd and 3rd, 53rd and 3rd
