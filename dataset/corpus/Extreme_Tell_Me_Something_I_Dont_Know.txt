Sun going up,  
Making its rounds  
It keeps on moving,  
Painting the town  
Before you know it,  
She's sinking low  
So tell me something . . .  
  
Something I don't already know  
I don't know?  
  
Toward the south,  
Then turning north  
Whirlwind spinning,  
On a circular course  
The answer my friend,  
Returns to blow  
So tell me something . . .  
  
Something I don't already know  
I don't know?  
Tell me something  
I don't know?  
  
As for the wise men who pursue  
Their knowledge  
Same as the fool, free falling  
Prey to folly  
Can only one fate befall  
Them both  
So tell me something . . .  
  
[Chorus:]  
If every song been sung,  
Under the sun  
What's left for me then,  
Eat drink and have fun  
It must go on, as for the show  
So tell me something . . .
