Wise men say these are the facts of life  
What ya can't read, you gotta write  
What you don't know can hurt you, welcome to the wasteland  
Hail Mary, hear me now - I'm in need of Sanctuary  
Yes, these are hard times to be livin' in  
Out in the Wasteland where love's a give away  
I fall on my face like a rebel in the dirt  
  
Sanctuary, Give me some protection  
Baby, Baby cover me  
  
Feelin' lost and so afraid  
Just tryin' to keep the handle on the blade  
Been such a long time runnin'  
Behind these walls inside of me  
Ain't nothin' clear as far as I see  
Looks like a storm cloud breakin'  
Off in the distance, I hear a drivin' beat - a drivin' beat  
The sun goes down like a rebel in the dirt  
  
Sanctuary, Give me some protection  
Baby, Baby cover me  
Sanctuary, Give me some affection  
by, Baby shelter me  
Heartache gonna worry me down -- I don't like it  
  
Show me mercy, peace of mind  
Stand beside me in these troubled times  
Give me a reason to believe in now  
Love and affection, they seem so far away, so far away  
All I can do just to make it through the night  
  
Sanctuary, Give me some protection  
Baby, Baby cover me  
Sanctuary, Give me some affection  
Baby, Baby shelter me  
  
Sanctuary, Sanctuary  
Sanctuary, Sanctuary
