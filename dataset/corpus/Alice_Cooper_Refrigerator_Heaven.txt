I'm freezing, I'm frozen, I'm icicle blue  
(So low, low cool)  
Cyber, neurotic, technicians imbue  
(So low, low cool)  
I've been admitted to Refrigerator Heaven  
Until they discover the cure for cancer, I'm low  
Refrigerator Heaven  
So low, Refrigerator Heaven  
  
I'm ice packed, I'm hand-stashed, I'm waiting for you  
I'm older and younger, preserved in a tomb  
I've been admitted to Refrigerator Heaven  
I feel like I (told you a heart)  
I won't get back 'till the sun sets down on the moon  
Won't get back 'till m' sun sets down on the moon
