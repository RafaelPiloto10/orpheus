I've been on the road too long  
Moving in the wrong direction  
I don't know where I belong  
I don't know what I will do if I can't get  
Back home  
  
Troubles I got all my own  
They don't fit no other person  
The memories keep rolling on  
And I don't know what I will do if I can't get  
Back home  
  
I don't fit, but I don't give a damn  
I won't quit, cause I know who I am  
And I'll admit, that I've been on the left  
  
Bit by bit, I'll review my plan  
This is it, I'll do the best I can  
Trust and understand  
  
Cause I know that I am loved  
Cause I'll be on my way  
Got no need to stay 'round here  
  
Cause I been on this road too long  
Going in the wrong direction  
And I don't know where I've come from  
All I know is I will die if I don't get  
Back home
