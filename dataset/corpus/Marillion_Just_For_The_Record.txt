Many's the time I've been thinking about changing my ways  
But when it gets right down to it it's the same drunken haze  
I'm serving a sentence to write life's sentences  
It's only when I'm out of it I make sense of this  
  
Just for the record I'm gonna put it down  
Just for the record I'm gonna change my life around  
  
Just a revolutionary with a pseudonym  
Just a bar room dancer on my final fling  
Just another writer paying off my dues  
Just finding inspiration well that's my excuse  
  
Just for the record I'm gonna put it down  
Just for the record I'm gonna change my life around  
  
Just another empty gesture with an empty glass  
Just another comic actor behind a tragic mask  
But I've got no discipline got no self control  
Just a little less painful here when my back's against the wall  
  
It's too late, I found, it's too far, I'm in two minds  
Both of them are out of it at the bar  
When you say I got a problem that's a certainty  
But I can put it all right down to eccentricity  
It's just for the record it's just a passing phase  
  
Just for the record I can stop any day
