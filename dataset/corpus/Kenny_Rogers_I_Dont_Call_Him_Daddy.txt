It was six in the morning  
When I made the county line  
There's someone I got to talk to  
I can't get it off my mind  
  
He's just a kid  
And he's in a pretty rough spot  
Two dimes to make a phone call  
That's about all I've got  
  
How's my boy today?  
I know it's been three weeks  
But you know how far I've got to go  
To make those loose ends meet  
  
How's your mama now  
With her new live-in friend  
Oh how I hate the wounds  
That never seem to mend  
  
[Chorus:]  
And he says I don't call him daddy  
but he takes care of things  
When you pick me up on Friday  
Are you gonna bring me anything?  
Oh don't worry dad ya know  
It don't matter what we do  
I don't call him daddy  
He could never be like you  
Never be like you  
  
God bless their little hearts  
They're the ones who really pay  
When mom and dad can't get along  
And go their seperate ways  
In a way I'm glad there's someone  
There to fill the empty place  
Tears of understanding  
Streak down a dirty face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He is quite a little man  
Growing up as fast as he can  
And I don't get to see him  
Half as much as I had planned  
There's so much I need to tell him  
So precious little time  
A little rain on the window  
In a little way goodbye  
  
[Chorus x2]
