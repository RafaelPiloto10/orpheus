Let me love you, come close to me  
Locked in my arms, you'll still be free  
  
[Refrain]  
Don't be frightened  
My half flyin' blue bird  
'Coz my love has no walls  
No walls, no ceilings  
No walls, no ceilings, no floors  
Go on and fly high in the sky  
I'll never try to burn your wings  
  
All my love songs are just for you  
Sing them with me and when you do  
  
[Refrain]  
Don't be frightened  
My half flyin' blue bird  
'Coz my love has no walls  
No walls, no ceilings  
No walls, no ceilings, no floors  
Go on and fly high in the sky  
I'll never try to burn your wings  
  
... Fly high in the sky  
  
Instrumental  
  
All my love songs are just for you  
Sing them with me and when you do  
  
[Refrain]  
Don't be frightened  
My half flyin' blue bird  
'Coz my love has no walls  
No walls, no ceilings  
No walls, no ceilings, no floors...
