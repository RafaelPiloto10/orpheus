On the firefly platform of sunny goodge street  
A violent hash-smoker shook a chocolate machine  
Involved in an eating scene  
Smashing into neon streets in their stillness  
Smearing their eyes on the crazy kali goddess  
Listening to sounds of mingus mellow fantastic.  
"my, my", they sigh.  
In dull house rooms with coloured lights swinging  
Strange music boxes sadly tinkling  
Drink in the sun shining all around you.  
"my, my", they sigh.  
The magician, he sparkles in satin and velvet,  
You gaze at his splendour with eyes you've not used yet.  
I tell you his name is love, love, love.  
"my, my", they sigh.  
"my, my", so high.  
"my, my" they sigh.  
Hmm, hmm.  
Hmm, hmm.  
Hmm, hmm.
