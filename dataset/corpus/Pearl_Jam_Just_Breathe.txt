Yes, I understand that every life must end, aw huh,  
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, aw huh,  
Yeah, I'm a lucky man to count on both hands  
The ones I love  
  
Some folks they have one yeah  
Others they got none, aw huh  
  
Stay with me  
Let's just breathe  
  
Practiced are my sins  
Never gonna let me win, aw huh,  
Under everything, just another human being, aw huh,  
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world  
To make me bleed  
  
Stay with me  
You're all I see  
  
Did I say that I need you?  
Oh, oh, did I say that I want you?  
Oh, oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see  
No one knows this more than me  
As I come clean  
  
I wonder every day  
As I look upon your face, aw huh,  
Everything you gave  
And nothing you would take, aw huh,  
Nothing you would take  
Everything you gave  
  
Did I say that I need you?  
Did I say that I want you?  
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see  
No one knows this more than me  
As I come clean, I, I  
  
Nothing you would take  
Everything you gave  
Hold me till I die  
Meet you on the other side
