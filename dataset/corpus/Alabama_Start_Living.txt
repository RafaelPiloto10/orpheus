He just can't wait to graduate  
He's marking time and counting days  
He'll toss that cap and watch that tassel fly  
So he can start living  
Yeah, finally start living  
'Cause he's got big plans  
And he'll have time on his hands  
To start living  
  
Before he knows ten years are gone  
A dead-end job, a mortgage loan  
He wonders where the chances passed him by  
To really start living  
Yeah he wants to start living  
And soon he's sure  
He can finally afford  
To start living  
  
He'll read more books  
He'll make more love  
He'll talk more to the man above  
He'll watch the sunset in the west  
And visit Mexico  
He'll learn to cook, he'll play some ball  
He'll write that book, he'll make that call  
He'll take the time  
Some other time  
Someday he'll do it all  
  
Well sittin' in the barber chair  
He sees the silver in his hair  
Those golden years are comin' right behind  
And then he'll start living  
He'll really start living  
Yeah he feels tired  
Ah, but soon he'll retire  
And start living  
  
He'll read more books  
He'll make more love  
He'll talk more to the man above  
He'll watch the sunset in the west  
And visit Mexico  
He'll learn to cook, he'll play some ball  
He'll write that book, he'll make that call  
He'll take the time  
Some other time  
Someday he'll do it all  
  
Well the doctor says, I've got bad news  
Afraid there's nothing we can do  
And all at once the tears are in his eys  
He'll never start living  
Never really start living  
Yeah he had big plans  
But there's no time on his hands  
To start living  
  
When he sees the pearly gates  
He'll really start living
