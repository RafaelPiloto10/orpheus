I've lived through things I cannot say  
Back then we dreamt of yesterday  
It seemed as if the only way  
And now we look for hope and pray  
  
[Chorus:]  
If I had a second chance  
I'd make amends  
Only to find myself  
Losing in the end  
If I had a second chance  
I'd make amends  
Only to find myself  
Losing, losing  
  
It came up from the deepest sea  
God gave it life and reason to be  
His Shadow rose above the highest tree  
And still his face we could not see  
  
[Chorus:]  
[Chorus:]  
  
Repeat first verse
