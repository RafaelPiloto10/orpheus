War!!!  
  
Our government is fucked  
Sure to bring us down  
The media incites civil unrest  
Hatred can bring you down  
  
[Chorus]  
War!!!  
I don't want your war  
War!!!  
We don't need your war  
We don't need your war  
War!!!  
  
Military beasts starvin' countries  
Drama brings you to your knees  
Spill your blood to save humanity  
Dyin' for the food we feed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our government is fucked  
Sure to bring us down  
The media incites civil unrest  
Hatred can bring you down  
  
Injustice drives you crazy  
It drive l.a. insane  
In this generation  
Hatred is the name  
  
[Chorus]  
War!!!  
  
L.A. '92  
  
Bastard magic should make you cry  
The answer to the question is we ain't gonna die  
  
L.A. '92  
  
Police can make me under stress  
While all L.A.'s a fuckin' mess  
Don't patronize my fuckin' ass  
Some heads will get crashed  
  
L.A. '92  
  
Billy's got himself a gun  
He's goin' to fuckin' war  
He won't revert to sticks and stones  
Just bullet holes and broken bones  
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos  
Don't give a fuck!  
  
Covert body knock ya down  
No weight support so taken down  
The juk-jock, a lock in a cell  
We ain't got shit, now had enough  
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos  
Don't give a fuck!  
  
Disorder!!! [Repeat x8]
