You were right, I was wrong  
Please forgive me, come back home  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Don't you know I love you so?  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Everyday I love you more?  
Just can't go on since you've gone  
Feel so blue over you  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Don't you know I love you so?  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Everyday I love you more?  
Please come back, need you so  
I won't ever let you go  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Don't you know I love you so?  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Everyday I love you more?  
Cries for you night and day  
Please come back home and stay  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Don't you know I love you so?  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Everyday I love you more?
