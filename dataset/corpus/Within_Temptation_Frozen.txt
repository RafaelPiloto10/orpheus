I can't feel my senses  
I just feel the cold  
All colors seem to fade away  
I can't reach my soul  
  
I would stop running  
If I knew there was a chance  
It tears me apart to sacrifice it all  
But I'm forced to let go  
  
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?  
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen but what can I do?  
  
I can feel your sorrow  
  
You won't forgive me  
But I know, you'll be alright  
It tears me apart that you will never know  
But I have to let go  
  
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?  
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen but what can I do?  
  
Everything will slip away  
Shattered pieces will remain  
When memories fade into emptiness  
Only time will tell it's tale, if it all has been in vain  
  
I can't feel my senses  
I just feel the cold  
  
Frozen  
What can I do?  
Frozen  
  
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?  
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen, Frozen
