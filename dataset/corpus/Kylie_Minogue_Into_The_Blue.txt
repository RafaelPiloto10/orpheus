I drew the smile upon my face  
I paved the road that would one day leave me lonely  
No angels too good to fall from grace  
If she lets go of whatever keeps her holy  
  
But I'm still here holding on too tight, to everything that I left behind  
I don't care if the world is mine  
'Cause this is all I know  
  
When I got my back up against the wall  
Don't need no one to rescue me  
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle  
Yeah, tonight I'm running free  
Into the blue, into the blue  
With nothing to lose, into the blue  
  
I'm not ashamed of all my mistakes  
'Cause through the cold  
I still kept the fire burning  
These memories that I can't erase  
Always remind me I'm on an endless journey  
  
But I'm still here holding on too tight  
To everything that I left behind  
I don't care if the world is mine  
'Cause this is all I know  
  
When I got my back up against the wall  
Don't need no one to rescue me  
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle  
Yeah, tonight I'm running free  
Into the blue, into the blue  
With nothing to lose  
Into the blue  
  
I'll go where nobody knows  
Wherever the wind is blowing  
Even if I'm alone  
  
When I got my back up against the wall  
Don't need no one to rescue me  
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle  
Yeah tonight I'm running free  
Into the blue, into the blue  
With nothing to lose  
Into the blue
