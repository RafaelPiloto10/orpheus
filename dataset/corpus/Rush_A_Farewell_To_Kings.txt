When they turn the pages of history  
When these days have passed long ago  
Will they read of us with sadness  
For the seeds that we let grow  
We turned our gaze  
From the castles in the distance  
Eyes cast down  
On the path of least resistance  
  
Cities full of hatred  
Fear and lies  
Withered hearts  
And cruel, tormented eyes  
Scheming demons  
Dressed in kingly guise  
Beating down the multitude  
And scoffing at the wise  
  
The hypocrites are slandering  
The sacred halls of truth  
Ancient nobles showering  
Their bitterness on youth  
Can't we find  
The minds that made us strong  
Can't we learn  
To feel what's right and wrong  
  
Cities full of hatred  
Fear and lies  
Withered hearts  
And cruel, tormented eyes  
Scheming demons  
Dressed in kingly guise  
Beating down the multitude  
And scoffing at the wise  
Can't we raise our eyes  
And make a start  
Can't we find the minds  
To lead us closer to the heart
