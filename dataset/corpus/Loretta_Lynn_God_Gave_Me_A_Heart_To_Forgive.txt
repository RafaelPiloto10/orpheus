It's midnight now and I'm still all alone  
It's always late each night when you come home  
I stay and take each heartache that you give cause God gave me a heart to
forgive  
Yes I could call these tears my closest friends  
They stay with me till you come home again  
You brought me every mis'ry that there is but God gave me a heart to forgive  
You hurt me as much as you can  
Then you tell me that you're just weak like any other man  
Still you're the only reason that I live and God gave me a heart to forgive  
[ steel ]  
You hurt me as much as you can...
