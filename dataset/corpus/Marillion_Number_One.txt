You sound truly heartbroken  
You can do it. you're a pro  
Agony from every pore. and such control  
The orchestra swoops and the drum samples roll  
You hold the high scream into the key change for the outro  
It's another number one  
And that's exactly where you're comin' from  
But can you play me a song  
For the deliberate loser  
Like an olympic ice skater you've put in the hours  
Learned the routines and the high scoring loops  
And even before you sing the sweet opening line  
You're know that you're scorin at least 5.9  
Here come the flowers  
I saw them gathered all around you  
Hangin' on your every word  
You were telling them you're masterplan  
World domination  
... any way you can  
  
Don't you ever wonder if this will to win is a weakness?  
Don't you ever wonder...
