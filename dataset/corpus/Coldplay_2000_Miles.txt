She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far  
The snow came down  
Get's colder day by day, I miss her  
  
I hear children singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
In these frozen and silent nights  
Sometimes in a dream, you appear  
Outside under the purple sky  
Diamonds in the snow sparkle  
  
And our hearts were singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
2000 miles is very far through the snow  
I think of you wherever you go  
2000 miles is very far through the snow  
I think of you wherever you go  
  
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far  
The snow came falling now  
Get's colder day by day, I miss you  
  
I hear people singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
I hear people singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
I hear people singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
I hear people singing  
It felt like Christmas time
