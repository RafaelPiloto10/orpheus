It's rainin' on me  
Watch the cab drive you away  
I see the night bein' eatin' up  
By just another day  
I guess I'd better accept  
That we just didn't have a lot to say  
Except goodnight  
I guess it's goodnight  
  
The city workers  
Cleanin' up the streets  
An old man wrapped in rags and newspaper  
Lies asleep on the corner of the street  
Whatever we had  
Lies in a heap at your feet  
Goodnight  
I guess it's goodnight  
  
A crowd of people, aw shit
