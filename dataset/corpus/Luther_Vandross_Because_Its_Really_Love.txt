I used to be afraid  
That you were never gonna love me this way  
But I feel better now  
No-one could ever say  
To me, "It's such a shame you're a lonely guy"  
Because your love is mine  
And now we know our love is ever so true  
I think we know it 'cause you feel the way I do  
I can't imagine me without you, my dear  
And I'm so glad about the reason that you came here  
  
Because it's love  
Because it's love  
Because it's really love  
Because it's love  
Because it's "all the way" love  
Because it's really love  
  
Ooo, girl you gotta stay  
'Cause I wanna fill your day with happiness  
'Cause I'm in love you see  
There's so much I wanna say  
And you'll hear the words to make you fall in love  
Deep in love with me  
I used to say "I love you" everyday  
To make you really know  
To trust in the things I say  
But look at me now and you can clearly see  
The love I feel for you  
You don't need words from me  
  
When you walked into the crowded room  
You sent my rocket to the moon  
But little did I know you would change my life  
But you kept saying "Take it slow"  
I love you for the things you know  
'Cause I'll never spend another lonely night?at night  
  
I wanna be your friend  
After the lovin' ends  
It's not over then  
You see it just begins  
And all anyone can say  
Is, "Ooo, wee you've got it made  
And may the best of love always come your way"  
  
And I don't worry how much I fall  
When the feelin' starts to call  
Because it's really love  
And all my worries fall into place  
When I think about your face  
Because it's really love
