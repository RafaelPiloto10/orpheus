When I was just a little baby  
I didn't have many toys  
But my mama used to say son  
You got more than other boys  
Now you may not be good looking  
And you may not be too rich  
But you'll never ever be alone  
Cause you've got lucky lips  
  
Lucky lips are always kissing  
Lucky lips are never blue  
Lucky lips will always find  
A pair of lips so true  
Don't need a four-leaf clover  
Rabbit's foot or a good luck charm  
With lucky lips you'll always have  
A baby in your arms.  
  
I never get heartbroken  
No, I'll never get the blues  
And if I play that game of love  
I know I just can't lose  
When they spin that wheel of fortune  
All I do is kiss my chips  
And I know I'm bound to win, yeah  
'cause I've got lucky lips.  
  
Lucky lips are always kissing  
Lucky lips are never blue.  
Lucky lips will always find  
A pair of lips so true.  
Don't need a four-leaf clover  
Rabbit's foot or good luck charm  
With lucky lips I'll always have  
A baby in your arms.
