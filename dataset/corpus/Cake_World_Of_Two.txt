I don't want to hear you whisper  
I don't want to orbit your world of two  
  
There's only room for you  
In your world of two  
  
I don't like to hang around you  
I don't want to live in your world of two  
  
There's only room for you  
In your world of two  
  
It's not that I don't like you  
But it's not that I don't love you  
It's not that I don't think you are  
Two of the most  
Perfectly  
Beautiful  
People in your world  
  
In your world of two  
There's only room for you  
In your world of two  
There's only room for you  
In your world of two  
In your world of two  
There's only room  
There's only room  
There's only room  
For you
