Leaving town I found a flower that I could deserve  
Someone moves and someone's bound to get their feelings hurt  
I'm loving you, you're out of range  
Wanted you you're out of range  
As I walked out into a world I feel a sudden chill  
I was bleeding put it good onto a daffodil  
Loving you, you're out of range  
Wanted to, you're out of range  
  
I don't want too much more than  
Than to be reborn  
In the morning  
Reborn so I can feel you  
The thorns are blooming with ya  
I feel you  
  
I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times  
Barely there, your voice is crackin' up across state lines  
Loving you, you're out of range  
Wanted you, you're out of range  
Skies of ecstacy we're breaking well I do believe  
The tears of God were falling down upon my swollen cheeks  
Loving you, you're out of range  
Wanted you, you're out of range  
I don't want too much more than  
Than to be reborn  
In the morning  
Reborn so I can feel you  
The thorns are blooming with ya  
I feel you  
I know it hurts when it's taken away  
I tell you that I could be living  
Today with you or without you, ok  
Washed by the rain and it's all gonna change  
I don't want too much more than  
Than to be reborn  
In the morning  
Reborn so I can feel you  
The thorns are blooming with ya  
I feel you  
No sir, not too much more than  
Than to be reborn  
In the morning  
Reborn so I can feel you  
The thorns are blooming with ya  
I feel you
