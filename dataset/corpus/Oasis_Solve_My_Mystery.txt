They took my faith  
They put it in a headlock and  
They sealed my fate  
Somewhere inside the world  
In which they live  
Because I failed  
They constantly ignore me and  
They told me I lost my mind but  
I believe that I rule the world  
  
I'm singing out my revolution song  
Like nothing else matters  
And you can pitch your gold against my soul  
But I bet you get shattered  
And there's a million houses in my heart  
It won't be long  
It won't be long  
Till I solve my mystery  
  
It would for me  
What do I believe in and  
A masterkey  
Is somewhere inside of the world in which I live  
And what for they  
They will speak for no-one  
And I may have lost my mind  
But I believe that I rule my world  
  
I'm singing out my revolution song  
Like nothing else matters  
You can pitch your gold against my soul  
But I bet you get shattered  
And there's a million houses in my heart  
It won't be long  
It won't be long  
Till I solve my mystery  
  
And I'm singing out my revolution song  
Like nothing else matters  
And you can pitch your gold against my soul  
But you gotta get shattered  
And there's a million houses in my heart  
And it won't be long  
It won't be long  
Till I solve my mystery  
Till I solve my mystery
