If you tell me what to do  
I could do it quite well  
Give detailed desires, I'd be tryin' like hell  
You could leave a little clue  
I would follow it through  
You got to say somethin'  
If there's anything you want me to do  
  
Let me be the slave you can faithfully flog  
Let me be your dog  
  
I got no way a'knowin' what show is in town  
I could be your pacifier  
I could be your favorite hound  
Just gimme some proof, I'll deliver in style  
On a hot tin roof, I'll be burnin' the tiles  
  
Let me be the friend of a friend  
Of a stepmother's brother  
Of the slave you can faithfully flog  
Let me be your dog  
  
Roll me right over, I'll crawl and I'll beg  
Casanova rover, bitin' your leg  
Cause what goes around, comes around  
Simple as that  
You'd be doin' yourself a favor  
Cuttin' the crap  
  
Let me be your cross-breed, off the lead  
Chasin' my tail  
I could make you feel better  
Like a check in the mail  
Like a poll-position for the closin' down sale  
Like a hog in a synagogue  
Let me be your dog  
  
Call me Rover  
Let me be your dog  
C'mon baby, I'll be good  
Like I know I could  
Let me be your dog  
Hey baby, please baby  
Let me be your dog
