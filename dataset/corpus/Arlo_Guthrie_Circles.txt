Chorus:  
All my life's a circle  
Sunrise and sundown  
Moon rolls through the nighttime  
Till daybreak comes around  
All my life's a circle  
Still I wonder why  
Seasons spinning 'round again  
Years keep rolling by  
  
Seems like I've been here before  
Can't remember when  
I got this funny feeling  
We'll all be together again  
No straight lines make up my life  
All my roads have bends  
No clear cut beginnings  
So far no dead ends  
  
Chorus  
  
I've met you a thousand times  
I guess you've done the same  
Then we lose each other  
It's like a children's game  
But now I find you here again  
The thought comes to my mind  
Our love is like a circle  
Let's go 'round one more time  
  
Chorus
