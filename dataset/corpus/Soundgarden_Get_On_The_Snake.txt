Get on the snake  
With a swarm of motor flys  
Get on the snake  
Under the cola colored sky  
  
Don't worry, everything's clean  
Road worthy, hungry and mean  
  
Get on the snake  
Where the metal river bleeds  
Get on the snake  
Where you never will believe  
  
Hey baby, what's your disease  
My hearts bleeding  
I'm dying to leave  
  
Get on the snake  
Where the water turns to steam  
Get on the snake  
With a suicide machine  
  
Don't worry, everything's clean  
Road worthy, hungry and mean  
Hungry and mean  
Hungry and mean
