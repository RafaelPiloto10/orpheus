Outside, the world's a mindless child  
Outside  
Outside, reflects the worst of styles  
Outside  
Inside when you're in my arms  
A mindless child is still to be born  
Inside, baby, when we come inside  
  
Outside, the politics of greed  
Outside  
Outside, misbehavior seethes  
Outside  
Mindless repression dominates the street  
While I kneel down and kiss your feet  
Inside, baby, when we come inside  
Outside  
  
Outside, they don't think they breed  
Outside  
Outside, emotion determines need  
Outside  
Outside, the world's a mindless child  
That we could bring to life in your arms  
Inside, baby, when we come inside  
  
Outside, the politics of hate and greed  
Outside  
Outside, the world's a mindless child  
Outside  
But when I hold you in my arms  
It's a mindless child that you want  
Inside, no matter 'bout the world outside  
  
Inside, a baby's what you want inside
