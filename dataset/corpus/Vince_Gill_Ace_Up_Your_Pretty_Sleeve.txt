I take it out on you  
I take it out on me  
Don't take to a cruel world  
Very gracefully  
I'm the cause and effect  
Of my own four-letter words  
Baby, I'm a good man  
No matter what you heard  
And I'll be there for you  
When you need me to be  
I'll be the sun at your door  
I'll be the wind in your trees  
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see  
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
Oh yes, I will  
I'm sharp with my tongue  
I know I cut you inside  
But I make a concerted  
Effort at times  
To try to be more  
Than a fool in your eyes  
Baby, I love you  
Don't you realize?  
That I'll be there for you  
When you need me to be  
I'll be the sun at your door  
I'll be the wind in your trees  
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see  
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
Oh, up your pretty sleeve, baby  
And I'll be there for you  
When you need me to be  
I'll be the sun at your door  
I'll be the wind in your trees  
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see  
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
And if I've nothin' at all on the surface to see  
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
Oh yes, I will  
An ace up your pretty sleeve
