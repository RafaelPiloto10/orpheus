I've been travelin' down the country ever since I can remember  
And the people that I meet just suit me fine  
But anywhere you see me going chances are that I've done been there  
So when I need a little peace of mind  
I go home home where the mockingbirds are singin' a pretty melody  
Home home where nothing short of heaven's waiting there for me  
  
Picture the morning sun a white rail fence and watch the meadow glisten  
There's a newborn baby calf down in the barn  
Have you morning cup of coffee in the country air oh listen  
It's a hundred million miles away from harm  
I go home  
Where nothing short of heaven's waiting there for me
