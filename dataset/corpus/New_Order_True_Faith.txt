I feel so extraordinary  
Something's got a hold on me  
I get this feeling I'm in motion  
A sudden sense of liberty  
I don't care 'cause I'm not there  
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow  
Again and again I've taken too much  
Of the things that cost you too much  
I used to think that the day would never come  
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun  
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near  
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear  
I used to think that the day would never come  
That my life would depend on the morning sun...  
  
When I was a very small boy,  
Very small boys talked to me  
Now that we've grown up together  
They're afraid of what they see  
That's the price that we all pay  
And the value of destiny comes to nothing  
I can't tell you where we're going  
I guess there was just no way of knowing  
I used to think that the day would never come  
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun  
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near  
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear  
I used to think that the day would never come  
That my life would depend on the morning sun...  
  
I feel so extraordinary  
Something's got a hold on me  
I get this feeling I'm in motion  
A sudden sense of liberty  
The chances are we've gone too far  
You took my time and you took my money  
Now I fear you've left me standing  
In a world that's so demanding  
I used to think that the day would never come  
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun  
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near  
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear  
I used to think that the day would never come  
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
