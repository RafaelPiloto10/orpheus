You say that you miss him  
I can tell by the way you kiss him  
Get yourself together  
And you'll be alright  
You say that you love him  
Now he's gone so please forget him  
Get yourself together  
And you'll be alright  
I'm just like you so take my lead  
You see me as a friend but  
I'm a friend in need  
  
Get yourself together  
And you'll be alright  
  
So if you feel that you need me  
I'm here beside you  
Can't you see me?  
Get yourself together  
And you'll be al-right  
  
Get yourself together  
You're gonna be alright
