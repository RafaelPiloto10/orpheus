If I had a hammer I'd hammer in the morning  
I'd hammer in the evening all over this land  
I'd hammer out danger I'd hammer out a warning  
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters ah ah all over this
land  
If I had a bell I'd ring it in the morning I'd ring it in the evening all over
this land  
I'd ring out danger I'd ring out a warning  
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters ah ah all over this land
yeah  
If I had a song I'd sing it in the morning I'd sing it in the evening all over
this land  
I'd sing out danger I'd sing out a warning  
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters ah ah all over this land  
Well I've got a hammer and I've got a bell  
And I've got a song to sing all over this land  
It's a hammer of justice it's a bell of freedom  
It's a gonna be about love between my brothers and my sisters ah ah all over
this land  
Well I've got a hammer and I've got a bell...
