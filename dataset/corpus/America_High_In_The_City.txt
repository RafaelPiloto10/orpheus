Now I'm high in the city  
Feel the evening air  
The crowds in the city  
Compete for a share  
It's all so busy, a complete affair  
Down here...  
As I walk through marble  
Finding my way out to daylight  
One drinking orange vodka  
Someone inside here  
Will give us a ride dear  
I know a place where we both can go  
To set our hearts on fire  
I know the city's the only show  
Can I take you for a ride  
I can make you satisfied  
All 'n all it's worth your while  
Change that frown back to a smile  
Tonight  
Do or die in the misty city  
All night long  
A nightclub in the middle  
Tappin' time to my song  
Catch hell for leavin'  
They are always wrong  
Down here...  
As I walk through marble  
Finding my way in the night-light  
Two people sit and argue  
Someone inside here  
Will give them a ride clear  
I know a place where we both can go  
To set our hearts on fire  
I know the city's the only show  
Can I take you for a ride  
I can make you satisfied  
All 'n all it's worth your while  
Change that frown back to a smile  
Tonight
