[Verse:]  
Just a nick of time before I'm home with you  
Just a little while I'm on my way  
I can see you smiling feel your love so true  
Just a little pins on the paint  
  
[Verse:]  
When I think of heaven I see fields of gold  
And angels singing softly just for me  
It would be the sweetest thing that I'll behold  
Stronger than my old magnolia tree  
  
[Chorus:]  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
Every road I travel leads me back to you  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
  
[Verse:]  
Got no time for hurrying I'll keep my pace  
I don't care if people pass me by  
Know my journey's over when I see your face  
Loving arms and sprung on in your eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
Every road I travel leads me back to you  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
  
[Verse:]  
Just a nick of time before I'm home with you  
Just a little time I'm on my way  
I can see you smiling feel your love so true  
Just a little pins on the paint  
  
[Chorus:]  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
Every road I travel leads me back to you  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
  
When I'm s'pposed to be (x4)  
I'm with you  
When I'm s'pposed to be (x4)  
I'm with you  
When I'm s'pposed to be (x4)  
I'm with you
