Now I fall to the ground  
I can't get up, well never mind  
I know you'll pull me up by my bones  
And say I'm sand to polished stone  
Today's gone and it won't be long  
Before we fall asleep and forget what we've done  
We won't get up 'cause today is fun  
We're alone  
  
Now you bite my tongue  
And when the alcohol's gone  
I won't feel a thing  
So you can't carry on  
  
Today's gone and it won't be long  
Before we fall asleep and forget what we've done  
We won't get up 'cause today is fun  
We're alone  
  
It's numb  
It's numb  
It's numb
