Gotta get up, get down  
Ooh ooh, baby baby  
  
Looking for some education  
Made my way into the night  
All that bullshit, conversation  
Baby can't you read the signs?  
  
I won't bore you with the details, baby  
I don't even wannna waste your time  
Let's just say that maybe  
You could help to ease my mind  
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right  
  
But if you're looking for fast love  
If that's love in your eyes, it's more than enough  
Had some bad love  
Some fast love, is all that I've got on my mind  
  
(ooh ooh, baby baby)  
Ooh, yeah yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby)  
What's there to think about baby?  
(ooh ooh, baby baby)  
Hey baby, oh yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby)  
  
Looking for some affirmation, made my way into the sun  
My friends got their ladies, they're all having babies  
But I just want to have some fun  
  
I won't bore you with the detail baby  
You gotta get there in your own sweet time  
Let's just say that maybe, you could help  
To ease my mind, baby, I ain't Mr. Right  
  
But if you're looking for fast love  
If that's love in your eyes, it's more than enough  
Had some bad love  
Some fast love, is all that I've got on my mind  
  
So close I can taste it now baby, so close  
  
In the absence of security, I made my way into the night  
Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me  
And I see lovin' in his eyes  
I miss my baby, oh yeah, I miss my baby tonight  
So why don't we make a little room  
In my BMW, babe, searchin' for some peace of mind  
Hey, I'll help you find it  
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion  
  
Oh you really oughta get up now, that's right  
Oh you really oughta get up
