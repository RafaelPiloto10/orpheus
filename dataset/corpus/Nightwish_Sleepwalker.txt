Close your eyes  
Feel the ocean where passion lies  
Silently the senses  
Abandon all defenses  
  
A place between sleep and awake  
End of innocence, unending masquerade  
That's where I'll wait for you  
  
Hold me near you  
So close I sear you  
Seeing, believing  
Dreaming, deceiving  
  
A place between sleep and awake  
End of innocence, unending masquerade  
That's where I'll wait for you  
  
Sleepwalker seducing me  
I dare to enter your ecstasy  
Lay yourself now down to sleep  
In my dreams you're mine to keep  
  
(Sleepwalk with me)  
  
Sleepwalker seducing me
