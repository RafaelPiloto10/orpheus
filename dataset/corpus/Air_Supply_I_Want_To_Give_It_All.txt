Here I am again  
I've come to see you smile  
I know you understand  
I have to say again  
It's only for awhile  
  
And still you're always here  
Just waiting for my call  
I wish I knew a Way  
To give more than I do  
I want to give it all  
  
CHORUS  
It doesn't happen every day  
But it happened to me once before  
Those early years I threw away  
Now I only have to hear your voice  
To make me feel so sure  
That your love is why  
I want to give it all  
  
Don't the minutes fly  
And hours just seem so few  
With days apart so long  
It's hard to spend my time  
When I'm so far from you  
  
And still you're always there  
Just waiting for my call  
I wish I knew a way  
To give more than I do  
I want to give it all
