I need a strong girl  
Cause war's where I'm going  
I need a war girl  
Who wants to show 'em  
  
Good people want to be  
Really what they are  
But if you try, you will fry  
Plenty before catching fire  
  
I need a strong girl  
Who works on tension  
I need a gendarme  
Cause I'm after ascension  
  
When the guns raise, hit my back  
On a naked day  
I know I will testify  
No matter what I have to say  
  
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
Strong girl, she's like a ocean  
  
I need an eagle  
To be my scanner  
Cause a liar  
Can look like a winner  
  
All the animals  
Are running with the pack  
I'm outside, tell you why  
I don't wanna fight 'em back  
  
Strong girl, she's like an ocean  
Strong girl, she's like an ocean  
Yeah  
  
Strong girl, she's like an ocean  
Strong girl, she's like an ocean  
  
Strong girl, strong girl
