Last night I realized  
There's no point in compromise  
I guess it's time we said it's over  
'cause I been watchin' you  
Searchin' for something' new  
Go find it now 'cause it's all over  
What's the sense in bitterness  
It only leads to emptiness  
I thought that we'd find happiness  
But we've run out of track and we won't get it back  
'cause it's over, it's all over  
It's all over, it's over  
I'm gonna have to live with this  
The one thing that I will miss  
Is coming to you when my day is over  
I'll come home to loneliness  
My life all in a mess  
Just wishing we were never over  
You read about it every day  
Another love has gone astray  
But who would think we'd end this way  
We've run out of track and we won't get it back  
And it's over, it's all over  
It's over, it's all over  
I remember when you said to me  
Take care when you share your love  
Before you give it all so easily  
Be sure that you can give enough  
Look what happened to us  
It's all over, it's over  
Over, it's all over  
It's all over, it's all over  
We've run out of track and we won't get back  
'cause it's over  
No more me, no more you  
It's over  
It's all over
