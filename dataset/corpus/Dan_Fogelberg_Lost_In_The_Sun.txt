Every night I ask myself that same old question why  
And every day the answer seems more distant  
I always knew the final truths lay just beneath the lies  
But I never thought they'd be this hard to find  
I never thought they'd be this hard to find  
  
Every time I try to put this puzzle in to place  
There always seems to be a piece that's missing  
And through the eyes of someone else I look in to my face  
And can't believe the sorrow there I see  
I can't believe this lonely man is me  
  
The faster we run  
The further away the dreams that we chase become  
Lost in the sun  
Spinning and turning, blind in the burning  
Light of day, we have to turn away

But I never thought they'd take this long to find  
I never thought they'd be this hard to find  
  
The faster we run  
The further away the dreams that we chase become  
Lost in the sun  
Spinning and turning, blind in the burning  
Light of day, we have to turn away
