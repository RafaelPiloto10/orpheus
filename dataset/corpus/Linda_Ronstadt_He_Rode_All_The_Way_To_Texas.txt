A light shines from my window  
I just can't sleep no more  
Lord, it hurts so much to be alone  
But the real men never do admit  
That it's them that might be wrong  
At least that's what he told me in his song  
  
He rode all the way to Texas  
On an old freight train  
Didn't miss the girl he left behind  
He rode all the way to Texas  
Didn't shed a tear  
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind  
  
The freedom that he sings about  
I guess I'll never know  
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain  
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low  
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train  
  
He rode all the way to Texas  
On an old freight train  
Didn't miss the girl he left behind  
He rode all the way to Texas  
Didn't shed a tear  
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
