I know  
That my love for  
You is real  
It's somethin' true  
That we do  
Just somethin' natural  
That I feel  
When you walk in the room  
When you're near  
I feel my heart skips a beat  
The whole world disappears  
And there's just you and me  
Falling head over feet  
Let's take a chance, together  
  
[Chorus]  
I know, I know, I know, I know,  
We're gonna make it  
Cause no one else can  
Make me feel the way that you do  
I promise you  
I know, I know, I know, I know,  
We're gonna get there  
Today, tomorrow,  
And forever we will stay true  
I promise you  
  
They say,  
That we're just too young to know,  
But I'm sure heart and soul  
That I'm never letting you go  
When it's right, it's right  
And this is it  
'Cause I'm walking on air  
Every single time that we kiss  
You make the angels sing  
You give the songbird wings  
You make everything better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll never let you down  
I'll always hear you out  
There is nothing you can mount,  
Come and fight  
You listen when I speak  
You make my knees go weak  
And I just want you by side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're gonna make  
I promise you, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I promise you  
I promise you  
I promise you
