In a way I'm glad it's over  
Even though it's gonna hurt me once you're gone  
But I can learn to live without you  
Give me time and I can make it on my own  
  
'Cause lovin' you to me came easy  
Now, losing you will change my life no doubt  
In a way I'm glad it's over  
In another way it turns me inside out  
  
In a way I guess it's better  
Even though there's nothing good about goodbye  
But I know I couldn't hold you  
Now, you've found your wings and you need room to fly  
  
It's for sure I'm gonna miss you  
But I guess that's what goodbye is all about  
In a way I'm glad it's over  
In another way it turns me inside out  
  
On the one hand I know, I'll be better off once you're gone  
But I find a lot of heartache on the other  
And I can't say I'm looking forward to those nights I'll spend alone  
And I wonder will there ever be another  
  
'Cause loving you to me came easy  
Now, losing you will change my life no doubt  
In a way I'm glad it's over  
In another way it turns me inside out  
  
In a way I'm glad it's over  
In another way it turns me inside out
