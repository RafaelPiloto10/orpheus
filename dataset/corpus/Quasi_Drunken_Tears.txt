Warms you up inside  
Soothes your wounded pride  
But your gold turns to lead  
As it goes to your head  
And you cry  
Drunken tears once again, my friend  
  
So what if you're not the genius  
You always thought you were?  
Nobody hears the brilliant words  
Between your ears  
And you cry  
Drunken tears once again, my friend  
  
Here's some ancient truth  
Dredged up from your youth  
A voice from way back when  
Long lost love that might have been  
And you cry  
Drunken tears once again, my friend  
  
Go ahead, I don't mind your drunken tears
