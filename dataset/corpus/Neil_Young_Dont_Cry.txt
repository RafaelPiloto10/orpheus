Don't cry my sweet girl  
Nothin' I say is written in stone  
Don't cry my sweet love  
You won't really be alone.  
  
I'll help you pack your things  
I'll walk with you out to the car  
I'll hold on to the ring  
I won't forget the way things are.  
  
My sweet love.  
  
Your disappointed eyes  
Are haunting me like my big lies  
I see you glaring now  
I see you staring in the fire.  
  
My sweet love.  
  
Don't cry my sweet girl  
Nothin' I say is written in stone  
Don't cry my sweet love  
You won't really be alone.  
  
My sweet love, my sweet love.  
  
Don't cry my sweet girl  
You won't really be alone  
Don't cry my sweet girl  
You won't really be alone  
Don't cry my sweet girl  
You won't really be alone.
