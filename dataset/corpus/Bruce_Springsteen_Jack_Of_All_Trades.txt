I'll mow your lawn, clean the leaves out your drain  
I'll mend your roof to keep out the rain  
I'll take the work that God provides  
I'm a Jack of all trades, honey, we'll be alright  
  
I'll hammer the nails, and I'll set the stone  
I'll harvest your crops when they're ripe and grown  
I'll pull that engine apart and patch her up 'til she's running right  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
  
A hurricane blows, brings a hard rain  
When the blue sky breaks, feels like the world's gonna change  
We'll start caring for each other like Jesus said that we might  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
  
The banker man grows fatter, the working man grows thin  
It's all happened before and it'll happen again  
It'll happen again, they'll bet your life  
I'm a Jack of all trades and, darling, we'll be alright  
  
Now sometimes tomorrow comes soaked in treasure and blood  
Here we stood the drought, now we'll stand the flood  
There's a new world coming, I can see the light  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
  
So you use what you've got, and you learn to make do  
You take the old, you make it new  
If I had me a gun, I'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright  
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be alright
