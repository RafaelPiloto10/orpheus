We got something don't you know it's true?  
We got something don't feel it too?  
We got something, we got something to do  
Not a mushy line that I'm pushing on you  
Just another blue-note sung slightly out of tune  
We got something, we got something to do  
  
Prayer for peace, prayer for peace  
Prayer for peace.  
  
It may appear that we've been sleeping through our years  
And we've been living in an imaginary world  
But we know what  
We know what we got  
And if the choice was your of love eternally  
Or destruction of the world by some atomic energy  
The you'd know what  
You know what we got  
  
Prayer for peace, prayer for peace  
Prayer for peace. (repeat)  
We got got got, we got got got, we got we got something  
We got we got got got, we got got got, we got we got something  
Prayer for peace, prayer for peace  
Prayer for peace. (repeat)
