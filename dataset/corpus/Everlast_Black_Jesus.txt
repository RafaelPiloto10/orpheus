They call me White Devil, Black Jesus  
Heaven closes, hell freezes  
Egos trippin, scripts keep flippin  
Bloods keep bloodin, Crips keep crippin  
Time keeps slippin and I keep fallin  
I can't see but I hear them callin  
Ballers ballin, players playin  
Haters fightin, righteous payin  
Dawn breakin Manhattan keep makin  
Brooklyn keep takin, shook ones keep shakin  
No time for fakin, not me  
I ain't jumpin no bars, just risin like cream  
And if you diggin the scene, you feelin the vibes  
Throw your hands in the air, scream out you alive  
  
Singin  
Na-na-na-na-na  
Singin  
Na-na-na-na-na  
Singin  
Na-na-na-na-na  
Singin  
Na-na-na-na-na  
  
They call me Black Jesus, White Moses  
Heaven freezes, hell closes  
be -boy poses, punk rock chicks  
The kids are alright but I need my fix  
If you dig in the mix, feelin the drugs  
If you keepin it real, if you livin like thugs  
I spit kisses and hugs like .45 slugs  
Come back on the one and kiss my love gun  
Got a look that'll kill, voice that'll carry  
Half a dozen women that I think I want to marry  
Got trouble on my mind, I'm refusin to lose  
And still I gotta find me someone to abuse  
So won't you run spread the news, help say the word  
You jump the fuck back and just act like you heard  
  
They call me  
White Devil, Black Jesus  
Heaven closes, hell freezes  
Black Jesus, White Moses  
Heaven freezes, hell closes  
  
Singin  
Na-na-na-na-na  
Singin  
Na-na-na-na-na  
Singin  
Na-na-na-na-na  
Singin  
Na-na-na-na-na  
  
Singin  
(Waaaah-wah-wah-waaaaah  
Shooby-doo-waaah  
Waaaah-wah-wah-waaaaah)  
  
They call me white sinner, black martyr  
Livewire, firestarter  
Jungle Brother, redneck cracker  
Freak of nature, new world slacker  
Sex junkie lookin for a dealer  
You could play the leper, girl, and I could play the healer  
Shit is only gettin realer, baby, haven't you heard  
That the Bird, Bird, Bird, yes, the Bird is the word  
It go one for the troubled, two for the times  
Three for my homies and four for the dimes  
Singin lemons to the limes to the break of dawn  
Excuse me (six minutes) Everlast, you're on  
And it go on and on like a rolling stone  
Baby, anywhere I lay my hat is my home  
  
They call me  
White Devil, Black Jesus  
Heaven closes, hell freezes  
Black Jesus, White Moses  
Heaven freezes, hell closes  
  
Singin  
Na-na-na-na-na (repeated till end)
