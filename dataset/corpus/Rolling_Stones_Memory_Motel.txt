Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl  
Her eyes were hazel and her nose was slightly curved  
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel  
It's on the ocean I guess you know it well  
It took a starry night to steal my breath away  
Down on the waterfront her hair all drenched  
In spray  
  
Hannah baby was a honey of a girl  
Her eyes were hazel her teeth were slightly curved  
She took my guitar and she began to play  
She sang a song to me, stuck right in my brain  
You're just a memory of a love that used to be  
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so  
Much to me  
  
She got a mind of her own and she use it well, yeah  
Well she's one of a kind  
Got a mind  
She got a mind of her own, yeah, and she use it mighty fine  
  
She drove a pick-up truck painted green and blue  
The tires were wearing thin she done a mile or two  
And when I asked her where she headed for  
(Back up to Boston I'm singing in a bar)  
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge  
My nerves are shot already the road ain't all that smooth  
  
Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone  
I keep on a feeling that gnawing in my bones  
  
You're just a memory (just a memory) of a love that used to mean so  
Much to me  
(just a memory)  
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so  
Much to me  
You're just a memory girl, you're just a sweet  
Old memory  
And it used to mean so much to me  
  
Sha la laa la  
Sha la laa la  
Sha la laa la  
Sha la laa la  
  
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so much to me  
  
She got a mind of her own and she use it well  
Mighty fine she's one of a kind  
She got a mind of her own  
She's one of a kind and she use it well  
  
On the seventh day my eyes were all aglaze  
We been ten thousand miles and been in fifteen states  
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind  
I hit the bottle and I hit the sack and cried  
What's all this laughter on the twenty-second floor?  
It's just some friends of mine and they're busting  
Down the doors  
  
It's been a lonely night at the Memory Motel  
  
You're just a memory girl just a memory  
And it used to mean so much to me  
You're just a memory girl you're just a memory  
And it used to mean so much to me  
You're just a memory girl you're just a sweet old memory  
And it used to mean so much to me  
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so  
Much to me  
  
She's got a mind of her own and she use it well yeah  
Well she's one of a kind
