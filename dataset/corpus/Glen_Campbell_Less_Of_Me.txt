Let me be a little kinder  
Let me be a little blinder  
To the faults of those about me  
Let me praise a little more  
  
Let me be when I am weary  
Just a little bit more cheery  
Think a little more of others  
And a little less of me  
  
Let me be a little braver  
When temptation bids me waver  
Let me strive a little harder  
To be all that I should be  
  
Let me be a little meeker  
With the brother that is weaker  
Let me think more of my neighbor  
And a little less of me  
  
Let me be when I am weary  
Just a little bit more cheery  
Let me serve a little better  
Those that I am strivin' for  
  
Let me be a little meeker  
With the brother that is weaker  
Think a little more of others  
And a little less of me
