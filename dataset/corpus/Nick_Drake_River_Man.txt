Betty came by on her way  
Said she had a word to say  
About things today  
And fallen leaves.  
  
Said she hadn't heard the news  
Hadn't had the time to choose  
A way to lose  
But she believes.  
  
Going to see the river man  
Going to tell him all I can  
About the plan  
For lilac time.  
  
If he tells me all he knows  
About the way his river flows  
And all night shows  
In summertime.  
  
Betty said she prayed today  
For the sky to blow away  
Or maybe stay  
She wasn't sure.  
  
For when she thought of summer rain  
Calling for her mind again  
She lost the pain  
And stayed for more.  
  
Going to see the river man  
Going to tell him all I can  
About the ban  
On feeling free.  
  
If he tells me all he knows  
About the way his river flows  
I don't suppose  
It's meant for me.  
  
Oh, how they come and go  
Oh, how they come and go.
