If the satcheting of gentlemen  
Gives you grievance now and then  
What's needed are some memories of planing lakes  
Those planing lakes will surely calm you down.  
Nothing frightens me more  
Than religion at my door  
I never answer panick knocking  
Falling down the stairs upon the law,  
What law?  
There's a law for everything  
And for Elephants that sing to keep  
The cows that agriculture won't allow  
Hanky Panky nohow  
Hanky Panky nohow  
Hanky Panky nohow ohhhhhhh  
There's a law for everything  
And for Elephants that sing to keep  
The cows that agriculture won't allow  
Hanky Panky nohow  
Hanky Panky nohow  
Hanky Panky nohow ohhhhhhh
