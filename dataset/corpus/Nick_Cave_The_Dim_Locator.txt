Inanimational items elude I, and  
In-an-emotional-motion I swallow my  
Motive of quicker location is slammed  
My dim chance of skipping this thick world is thin  
They call me Dim  
I am the Dim Locator  
Dim Locator  
Loco, lomo, loco, lomo l'wow, wow, wow  
(same as above)  
Intrigueinometry treads on my trail  
Entriggering traps for a gross gang of ghost types  
Who later are packed in a cast iron trunk  
These things have been known, to get out of their wraps  
Don't call me Dim  
I am the Dim locator  
Dim Locator  
Loco, lomo......  
Fog fished and filtered is filling my case book, of  
Friends who fall foul of my files trip and breakneck  
Are stacked in the woodshed for further good use  
There's some certain people who shouldn't start fires  
So call me Dim!  
I am the Dim Locator!  
Dim Locator!  
Don't call me Dim!
