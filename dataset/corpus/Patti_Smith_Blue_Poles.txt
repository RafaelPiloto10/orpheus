Mother as I write the sun dissolves  
Blood life streaming cross my hand  
And these words, these words  
Hope dashed immortal hope  
Hope streaking the canvas sky  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
  
We joined the long caravan  
Hungry dreaming going west  
Just for work just to get a job  
And we never got lucky  
We just forged on  
And the dust the endless dust  
Like a plague it covered everything  
Hal fell with the fever  
And mother I did what I could  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
  
We prayed we prayed for rain  
I never wanted to see the sun again  
  
All my dresses you made by hand  
We left behind on the road  
Hal died in my arms  
We buried him by the river  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
