Tower to the skies  
An academy of lies  
And what goes up  
Surely must come down  
And we felt the mighty blow-up  
With the walls coming down  
Or something like that  
most of us are quite pleased  
With the same old song  
And all of a sudden I'm relatively sane  
With everything to lose and nothing to gain  
Or something like that  
man of wisdom and man of compromise  
Man of weak flesh in an armored disguise  
All fall down  
  
"if it's right you can tell" echos myron like a siren  
With endurance like the liberty bell  
And he tells you of the dreamers  
But he's cracked up like the road  
And he'd like to lift us up, but we're a very heavy load  
And we're finally here and shit yeah it's cool  
And shouldn't it be - or something like that
