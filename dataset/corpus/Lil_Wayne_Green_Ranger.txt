[J. Cole]  
When this shit drop, I was like 16  
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing  
Big dreams, say about some ripped jeans  
Nigga got a job, have my little?  
Worst fear is getting robbed for my last 50 dollars that I had left over  
5 dollars in they pocket, nigga in his left shoulder  
Minimum wage 5.15. 132s on the whip  
Kept my shit clean  
Actually that was my momma shit  
But I'm driving round town on my Obama shit  
Middle class my ass, just to get a tank of gas  
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit  
But, yeah I'm headed for a scholarship  
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip  
That's why them niggas don't like me and always wanna fight me  
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely  
I know the game I'm an expert  
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?  
Nigga I'm gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone  
And I aint fuck yet cause her momma always home  
God damn, Lor-Lord have Mercy  
Please God don't let this little broad have herpes  
My nigga says she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee  
Gold medals if we gave hoes?  
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos  
Spiderman sheets got us singing falsetto  
Tall white tee's, can't believe we used to wear those  
White folks looking at us like we're weirdos  
But we was only kiddo's  
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittles  
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle  
Tryna get the Diddy, cause I murder instrumentals  
It's that good old fashioned Mark Jackson  
Fucked then I'll pass, y'all Utah Jazz  
And ya'll borin', I don't play nigga I'm Mark Madsen  
That's why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian  
I'm not asking my nigga I don't need favours  
I'm in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger  
My team major, we party like teenagers  
I'm in the green Range, nigga I'm the green ranger  
(I fucking ran out of breath)  
Team major, we party like teenagers  
I'm in the green Range, nigga I'm the green ranger

[Lil Wayne]  
I don't even like this beat, but fuck it  
I'm only gon spit a few bars cause I don't like this beat  
  
Bitch I'm not old news, I'm more like gold shoes  
She eat my whole dick, she like Whole Foods  
They say I'm old school, but I dropped out  
Drop ya body off at a cops house  
They throwing up them bricks, you better box out  
My niggas got enough white to build Barack house  
I got my drawers on, Sam Rothstein  
44 on my waist, Rick Ross jeans  
I've been faded, stone wash jeans  
New pussy new money, New Orleans  
50 up in that uzi, g-g-g-unit  
I murk you with that bitch scratch the serial number, re-use it  
I'm from the N-O, stretch you niggas out like limo's  
Uzi go zit-zit-zit-zit-zit, that's pimples  
I'm bout to go banana puddin'  
Haha, you a dyke cause your man a pussy  
Hit you from the blindside no Sandra Bullock  
Never bite the hand that feeds you, always watch the hand that's cooking  
Tunechi, D4 Hoe  
Shout out Cole  
You already know what it is, Cole World  
Wayne's World

Special delivery at your front door
