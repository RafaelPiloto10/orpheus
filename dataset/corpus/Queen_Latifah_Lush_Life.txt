I used to visit all the very gay places  
Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails.  
  
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces  
With distant gay traces  
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales.  
  
Then you came along with your siren of song  
To tempt me to madness!  
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness  
Of a great love for me.  
  
Ah yes! I was wrong  
Again,  
I was wrong.  
  
Life is lonely again,  
And only last year everything seemed so sure.  
Now life is awful again,  
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore.  
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,  
All I care is to smile in spite of it.  
  
I'll forget you, I will  
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.  
Romance is mush,  
Stifling those who strive.  
I'll live a lush life in some small dive  
And there I'll be, while I rot  
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..
