I came so far for beauty  
I left so much behind  
My patience and my family  
My masterpiece unsigned  
  
I thought I'd be rewarded  
For such a lonely choice  
And surely she would answer  
To such a very hopeless voice  
  
I practiced all my sainthood  
I gave to one and all  
But the rumors of my virtue  
They moved her not at all  
  
I changed my style to silver  
I changed my clothed to black  
And where I would surrender  
Now I would attack  
  
I stormed the old casino  
For the money and the flesh  
And I myself decided  
What was rotten and what was fresh  
  
And men to do my bidding  
And broken bones to teach  
The value of my pardon  
The shadow of my reach  
  
But no, I could not touch her  
With such a heavy hand  
Her star beyond my order  
Her nakedness unmanned  
  
I came so far for beauty  
I left so much behind  
My patience and my family  
My masterpiece unsigned
