All I do is dream of you the whole night through  
Where the dawn I still go on dreaming of you  
You're every thought you're everything you're every song I ever sing  
Summer, winter, autumn and spring  
  
And where them all and 24 hours a day  
Let be spent in sweet content dreaming away  
When skies are gray when skies are blue  
Morning, noon and nighttime too  
All I do the whole day through is dream of you  
  
And where them all and 24 hours a day  
Let be spent in sweet content dreaming away  
When skies are gray when skies are blue  
Morning, noon and nighttime too  
All I do the whole day through is dream of you
