And didn't you see me in the glass  
And didn't you hear me you never listen past  
And didn't I see you gone to seed  
And the only reason is that you're too young greed  
  
You're out there on your own  
Your face turned to stone  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever  
  
You're in perhaps you'll listen a judge like you  
In your sweet life innocence that's nobody's fault  
You've never had it quite so good  
Because you didn't know that you even could  
  
At times it's been too old  
Your judge turned to gold  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever  
  
And it's been a long, long time been a long, long wait  
And then you thought you'd beat us at the pearly gates  
You better leave your number, oh and we'll call you  
You must admit your problem and it's heckling you  
  
The time has come to pay  
Turns out you've been the prey  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever
