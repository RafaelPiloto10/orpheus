You can write me a letter  
But I wont tell you where I am  
Oh you can send me a postcard baby  
But I wont tell you where I stand  
Well I'm right outside of your window  
And I'm walking on through your love  
And I'm giving you all I can babe  
But I know what youve been thinking of  
And now baby it's time  
Baby it's time  
To draw the line  
Draw the line  
  
You may have good intentions  
And I may be dead wrong  
If what you see here isn't love babe  
Its cause I'm too tired to be that strong  
Now I'm burned out on your affection  
Because it comes from a jaded tongue  
And I'm burned out on your direction baby  
I know I'm not the only one  
Baby it's time  
Baby it's time  
To draw the line  
Draw the line  
  
Draw that line baby  
Draw that line yeah  
Keep it straight  
Keep it close  
And tell me  
What do you have in mind  
  
I'm gonna take this heartache  
I'm gonna turn it all inside out  
I'm gonna find every livin last drop of love  
Until I'm too sure to have any doubt  
Now you can love me if you want me  
Or you can turn away and tell me to go  
Now you can write me a letter  
You can send me a postcard  
But don't tell me what you're thinking  
If you really don't know baby  
Baby it's time to draw the line  
Draw the line  
Yeah draw that line
