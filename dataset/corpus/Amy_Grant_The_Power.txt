A king is crying from his throne  
He had a queen but now she's gone  
What is this magic that we seek  
The mighty strong turn mighty weak  
Every good girl hears it  
Every bad boy fears it  
No matter what i see  
I believe, i believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
The power touches me  
The power helps us see  
The power holds my hand  
The power drives me crazy  
  
A flower grows, an old man dies  
And through it all we still survive  
A poor man screams but no one hears  
Ain't nothing changed much through the years  
Every bad day needs it  
Every good day breeds it  
No matter how it feels  
When it's real you know it's real  
Stronger than any bomb that any man has ever made  
  
(repeat chorus)  
And it won't take long to understand  
Just how amazed i am  
  
Hey, hey  
Open up your eyes and see  
It won't take long to understand  
Just how amazed i am  
  
Every good day needs it  
Every bad day needs it  
No matter what i see  
I believe, i believe  
Stronger than any bomb any man has ever made  
  
(repeat chorus twice)  
The power drives me crazy  
If i believe and you believe  
And we believe everything is gonna be all right  
All right  
It just might  
  
(the power)  
(the power)  
(the power)  
(the power)
