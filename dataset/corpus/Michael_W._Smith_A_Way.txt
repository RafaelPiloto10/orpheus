[Verse 1]  
Caught in a dream of where  
I want to be wrapped in a web of where I am  
I feel a wall between what is and what should be  
You find me waiting for a miracle  
You hear me praying for a plan  
You are the only one prepared to rescue me  
  
[Chorus]  
Then You take away the distance  
Found between the truth and me  
And You give a simple reason  
To my restless rhyme  
Whoa, hide me in the heaven  
You have held within your hand  
And make a way to find a way  
To soothe my mind  
  
[Verse 2]  
There is a way that might seem right to me  
A dim reflection of what's good  
Just an illusion of the best that I can be  
But there's another path You offer me  
I wish I always understood  
Some way You see right through my thoughts and know my needs  
  
[Chorus]  
Then You take away the distance  
Found between the truth and me  
And You give a simple reason  
To my restless rhyme  
Whoa, hide me in the heaven  
You have held within your hand  
And make a way to find a way  
To soothe my mind
