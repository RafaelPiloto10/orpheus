I turn and walk away  
Then I come 'round again  
It looks as though tomorrow  
I'll do pretty much the same  
I must turn down your offer  
But I'd like to ask a break  
You know I'm ready to give everything  
For anything I take  
Someone called my name  
You know I turned around to see  
It was midnight in the mission  
And the bells were not for me  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
Ten years ago, I walked this street  
My dreams were riding tall  
Tonight I would be thankful Lord  
For any dream at all  
Some folks would be happy  
Just to have one dream come true  
But everything you gather  
Is just more that you can lose  
Someone called my name  
You know I turned around to see  
It was midnight in the mission  
And the bells were not for me  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
All the things I planned to do  
I only did half way  
Tomorrow will be Sunday  
Born of rainy Saturday  
There's some satisfaction  
In the San Francisco rain  
No matter what comes down  
The mission always looks the same  
Someone called my name  
You know I turned around to see  
It was midnight in the mission  
And the bells were not for me  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain  
Come again, walking along  
In the mission in the rain
