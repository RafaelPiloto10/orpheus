Last night I saw you walking  
Past my bed late at night,  
And the moon shone  
Through your gown.  
Such a fine memory,  
I think I'm gonna take it with me.  
And later as you were sleeping,  
Sleeping next to me,  
I felt your hair on my skin.  
Such a fine memory,  
I know I'm gonna take it with me.  
I'm going to take it  
Far as I go.  
I'm going to take it  
Far as I go.  
And later as I was driving,  
And the sky was getting light,  
And the sun came  
Through the trees,  
I had a fine memory,  
Such a fine memory.
