Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
  
Strange, strange, strange, it's a dichotomy  
But it was never quite weird  
Or quite normal for me  
Take a break, take a breath and let's see where we're at  
Those damn bedbugs are sleeping up in my head  
All day, all night  
  
You telling my story  
But you don't know my name  
It's a hickory dichotomy  
You're messing with my brain  
  
Selling the story  
Are you holy or lying  
Hickory dichotomy  
I tell you the truth then you bite  
  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
  
Brave, brave, brave  
As the apostles go  
Is it a hickory hypothesis  
Or one man show?  
Take a rest  
Or take a ravel  
In the light of lights  
But them tall tale teasers  
Keep sneaking in my show tonight  
Alright  
  
You telling my story  
But you don't know my name  
It's a hickory dichotomy  
You're messing with my brain  
  
Selling the story  
Are you holy or lying  
Hickory dichotomy  
I tell you the truth then you bite  
  
You telling my story  
But you don't know my name  
It's a hickory dichotomy  
You're messing with my brain  
  
Selling the story  
Are you holy or lying  
Hickory dichotomy  
I tell you the truth then you bite  
  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on  
Alright, alright, alright, come on
