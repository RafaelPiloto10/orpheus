Walking in the pouring rain  
Walking with Jesus and Jane  
Jane was in her turtleneck  
I was much happier then  
  
If I were to ask you  
What would you do with yourself?  
If I were to tell you  
Would you just talk to yourself?  
  
Am I asking oh for so much?  
I'm not asking to be understood  
Am I asking oh for so much?  
I'm just looking for a brand new friend  
A brand new friend  
  
Walking in the pouring rain

Am I asking oh for so much?  
You could do anything you wanted to  
Am I asking oh for so much?  
No, just something that I can hold down  
'Cause it's all downhill now  
  
So let me count the times that we swore and lied that we'd  
Tie ourself to the railway line  
Let me count the times when of course we lied  
Well we knew no better, it was no crime  
Let me count the times  
  
I, well I don't know when I, when I'll be content  
But I do know I need a brand new friend
