Happy I'm floating  
Around on my feet now  
You make me go dizzy  
I'm weak at the knees  
I feel like I'm walking  
Round ten feet tall  
  
Well you say I'm faking  
And I say don't worry  
The way that I bubble  
There's something in the make  
I feel like I'm walking  
Round ten feet tall  
  
Right, the chemistry is right  
This boy has reached his height  
The feeling just goes on and on...  
From strength to strength  
I'm ten feet long  
  
I feel like I'm walking  
Round ten feet tall
