Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Exchange the cold days for the sun  
A good time and fun  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Exchange your troubles for some love  
Wherever you are  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Longing for the sun you will come  
To the island without name  
Longing for the sun be welcome  
On the island many miles away from home  
Be welcome on the island without name  
Longing for the sun you will come  
To the island many miles away from home
