With a voice, you could hear all the way to the rocky top  
Play by play for thirty-one years it never stopped  
We heard 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
Quarterback rolled right, it was a long throw down field to willie Gault For a  
Second no one knew if it was caught  
We heard 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
Your voice painted us a picture of all the losses and the wins  
And it's so hard to imagine a game without your voice again  
Saying 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
So thank you John what a run it's been fun for us all  
All the way are hearts pounded when you called  
20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
So thank you John
