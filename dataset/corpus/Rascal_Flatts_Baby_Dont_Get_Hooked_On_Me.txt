Girl, you're getting that look in your eyes  
And it's starting to worry me  
See, I ain't ready for no family ties  
No woman's gonna hurry me  
  
Just keep it friendly girl  
'cause I don't wanna leave  
If you start clinging to me  
You know that I can't breathe  
  
Baby, Baby, don't get hooked on me  
Baby, Baby, don't get hooked on me  
'Cause I'll just use you and I'll set you free  
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me  
  
You've been my hot lovin' woman  
And it's hot where you've been touching me  
And I can tell by your trembling lips  
You've been seeing just a little too much of me  
  
Now don't let your life get all tangled up in mine,  
'Cause I'll just use you, I can't take no clinging vine  
  
Baby, Baby, don't get hooked on me  
Baby, Baby, don't get hooked on me  
'Cause I'll just use you and I'll set you free  
Baby, Baby, don't get hooked on me  
  
Baby, Baby, don't get hooked on me  
No, no, no, Baby, Baby, don't get hooked on me, no  
'Cause I'll just use you and I'll set you free, set you free  
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me
