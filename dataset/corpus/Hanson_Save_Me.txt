Loving you like I never have before  
I'm needing you just to open up the door  
If begging you might somehow turn the tides  
Then tell me to I've got to get this off my mind  
  
I never thought I'd be speaking these words  
I never thought I'd need to say  
Another day alone is more than I can take  
  
Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need  
I just want to be by your side  
Won't you save me, I don't want to be  
Just drifting through the sea of life  
  
Listen please, don't walk out the door  
I'm on my knees, you're all I'm living for  
  
I never thought I'd be speaking these words  
Heaven thought I'd find a way  
Another day alone is more than I can take  
  
Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need  
I just want to be by your side  
Won't you save me, I don't want to be  
Just drifting through the sea of life  
  
Suddenly the sky is falling  
Could it be it's too late for me  
If I never said I'm sorry, then I'm wrong, I'm wrong  
  
Then I hear my spirit calling  
Wondering if she's longing for me  
And then I know that I can't live without her  
  
Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need  
I just want to be by your side  
Won't you save me, I don't want to be  
Just drifting through the sea of life  
  
Won't you save me  
Won't you save me  
Won't you save me
