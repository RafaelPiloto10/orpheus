You said that you'd be true  
Baby said that you'd be true  
I don't care, I don't care  
I don't care, I don't care  
I don't want you  
Don't want you  
I don't want you anymore  
You said that you'd be mine  
Baby said that you'd be mine  
I don't care, I don't care  
I don't care, I don't care  
I don't want you...  
I want you I want you to stay  
But I guess that it just can't be that way  
You said that you'd be true  
Baby said that you'd be true  
I don't care, I don't care  
I don't care, I don't care  
I don't want you...  
Don't want want you...
