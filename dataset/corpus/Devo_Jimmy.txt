Well I kinda feel sorry for jimmy  
Yeah but you don't know the whole story he wasn't a nice guy  
What ya mean?  
Let me tell ya  
  
Jimmy's in a wheel chair and I don't care  
He used to walk his dog  
And then he'd beat him good  
Like his pretty wife  
  
And now they're up and gone  
And jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care  
He was the president  
Of a company  
  
He kept his workers poor  
He'd lie and cheat and steal  
Well when justice strikes  
Well every once in a while  
  
It makes a bullseye hit  
Well every once in a while  
He used to yell and scream  
Until his son would cry  
  
Then he'd run him down  
Well he don't run no more  
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care  
He got big and fat  
  
And he was ridin' high  
Makin' lots of cash  
Trashin' others' lives  
Now jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care  
  
Lord he had it comin'  
Now he's cryin' in his beer  
Lord have mercy on this man
