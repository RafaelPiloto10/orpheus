(Dolly Parton)  
It's a dirty job  
But somebody's got to do it  
Better get to it  
Somebody's gotta do it  
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes  
Any work at all  
Is better than none  
Better buckle down to it  
Gotta get the job done  
Gotta earn my pay... I gotta earn my pay  
I can't wait around on the lottery  
And there ain't no millionaires  
Lookin' for me  
And somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody  
I can think of better things  
I'd rather do  
I might get lucky  
And I'm hopin' to  
But until I do  
I gotta compromise  
The job ain't much  
But at least it's mine  
It beats standin'  
In the unemployment line  
Put pride aside  
And I'll improvise  
Even if I do get a better job  
Somebody else  
Has gotta fill my spot  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody  
Somebody  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
It's a dirty job  
It's a low-down dirty job  
Somebody  
Even if the rules are too hard to follow  
Even when pride is too hard to swallow  
It's another day so it's another dollar  
That's what it's all about, Oh  
It's a dirty job  
But somebody's got to do it  
Better get to it  
Somebody's gotta do it  
Whatever it takes  
Gotta keep the faith  
Any work at all  
Is better than none  
Better buckle down to it  
Gotta get the job done  
Gotta earn my way  
And it's a workin' day  
The job ain't much  
But at least it's mine  
It beats standin'  
In the unemployment line  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody  
Somebody  
It's a dirty job  
Somebody's gotta do this low-down dirty job  
Somebody  
It's a dirty job, it's a dirty job  
It's a low-down dirty job  
Somebody  
Somebody  
Somebody
