A tree has grown on the spot  
Where her body did rest  
Blood seeped in the soil  
From the knife in her chest  
  
The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail  
I wonder how the bugs remember Gail  
  
Oh, what a lovely young girl  
Everybody would say  
You can still hear her laugh  
In the shadows on a cold winter day  
  
A dog dug up a bone and wagged his tail  
I wonder how the dog.. remembers Gail  
  
The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail  
I wonder how that I'll remember Gail
