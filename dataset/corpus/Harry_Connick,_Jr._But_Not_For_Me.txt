They're writing songs of love  
But not for me  
A lucky star's above  
But not for me  
  
With love to lead the way  
I've found more clouds of gray  
Than any russian play  
Could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall  
And get that way  
Hi ho! alas!  
And also, lackaday!  
  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of her kiss  
I guess  
She's not for me  
  
It all began so well  
But what an end  
This is the time  
A fellow needs a friend  
  
When every happy plot  
Ends with a the marriage knot  
And there's  
No knot for me
