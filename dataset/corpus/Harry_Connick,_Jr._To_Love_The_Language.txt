I is just what I was,  
And am ain't who I be.  
To love the language,  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi.  
  
Ax', ya "x," what talks in tongues.  
Say: "never mo', neither me."  
To love the language,  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi.  
  
Stayin' by my mama's,  
In slippers and pajamas.  
Where there's always somethin' good to eat.  
Bettin' strawberries,  
Honey, and cherries,  
And pecan-pies, oh, so sweet.  
  
With a dew-rag on my brow.  
Jasmine, wysteria and fleur-de-lis.  
To love the language,  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi.  
  
If you won't work fo' a livin',  
And live life leisurely.  
Pull up a screen po-ch,  
Flop out in a rockin' chair.  
To love the language,  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi.
