You need someone to hide behind  
I don't mind, well I don't mind  
You need to be alone to unwind  
That's alright, that's alright  
  
Sure I know it's hard  
You know that it's that way for everyone  
for everyone  
Somethings go wrong  
They sink so low you even blame the sun  
Blame it at the ...  
Of the shadows on the wall  
They're not as bad as they appear  
Could it be that it's the season of the shark  
  
You need someone to help you through  
well, I don't know, I don't know  
Someone to take a chance for you  
I don't know, I don't know  
  
I want to be the one to make you fell okay right now  
Someway somehow  
When I fall short  
I sink so low I even blame the clouds  
Blocking out the sun  
And the shadows on the wall  
That is why you fell alone  
Could it be that it's the season of the shark  
  
Please don't be afraid  
No matter how much out there scares you so  
Scares you so  
Just look around  
If it's not me, then someone else you know  
You're not alone at all  
Ignore the shadows on the wall  
They don't mean a thing  
Could it be that it's the season  
I believe that it's the season of the shark  
Could it be that it's the seas
