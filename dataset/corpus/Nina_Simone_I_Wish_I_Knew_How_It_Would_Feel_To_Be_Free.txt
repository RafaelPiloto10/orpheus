I wish I knew how  
It would feel to be free  
I wish I could break  
All the chains holding me  
I wish I could say  
All the things that I'd like to say  
Say 'em loud say 'em clear  
For the whole round world to hear  
I wish I could share  
All the love that's in my heart  
Remove every doubt  
It keeps us apart  
And I wish you could know  
What it means to be me  
Then you'd see and agree  
Every man should be free  
  
I wish I could live  
  
Like I'm longin' to live  
I wish I could give  
What I'm longin' to give  
And I wish I could do  
All the things I'd like to do  
You know they'll still miss part of you  
Yes sir  
And I'm way way over due  
  
I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky  
How sweet it would be  
If I found out I could fly  
So long to my song  
And look down upon the sea  
And I sing because I know  
I would see you  
I sing because I know  
I would see you  
And I sing because I know  
I would see you  
To be free, yeah
