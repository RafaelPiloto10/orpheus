Waiting for the moon to come and light me up inside  
And I am waiting for the telephone to tell me I'm alive  
Well I heard you let somebody get their fingers into you  
It's getting cold in California  
I guess I'll be leaving soon  
  
Daylight fading  
Come and waste another year  
All the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn  
When we see the early signs that daylight's fading  
We leave just before it's gone  
  
She said "Everybody loves you,"  
She says, "Everybody cares"  
But all the things I keep inside myself  
They vanish in the air  
If you tell me that you'll wait for me  
I'll say I won't be here  
I want to say goodbye to you  
Goodbye to all my friends  
Goodbye to everyone I know  
  
Daylight fading  
Come and waste another year  
All the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn  
When we see the early signs that daylight's fading  
We leave just before it's gone
