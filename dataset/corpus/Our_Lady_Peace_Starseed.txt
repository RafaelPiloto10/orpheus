I let go of the world that was holding  
A passenger that could not fly  
In search of souls  
Souls in search of something  
Let it go  
Let it slide  
When I find out what went on  
I'll bring it back  
It won't be easy  
They won't believe how a man  
He could drown  
In a starseed  
I hoped to find why this world wasn't glowing  
Glowing it darkens as we end this ride  
I've fallen back under the equator  
I'm back inside, I'm back inside  
When I find out what went on  
I'll bring it back but it won't be easy  
They won't believe the man he could  
But I'd choose starseed over nothing  
Nothing
