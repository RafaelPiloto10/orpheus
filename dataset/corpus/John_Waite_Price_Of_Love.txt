Girl sometimes it seems to me  
That I don't say the things I should  
To you I act like I'm no good  
And you wait for me patiently  
This house  
Is not a home without you  
It takes two hearts to share  
Your eyes will always see through me  
And bring me to my knees  
And I will always turn to you  
You're everything I need  
And through the good and bad times  
You have always been there  
We hold each other close  
You tell me its alright  
The nights we fight about it  
Never dream of giving up  
That's the price of love  
Love sometimes it makes us cry  
Forgive me when I get it wrong  
Sometimes it's hard  
To be that strong  
And oh I would do anything  
For you I'd turn the stars around  
I'd find the way somehow  
This time you'll see I'll build  
A bridge to you again  
Love shines to sweep away the past  
We're more than lovers more than friends  
And through the good and bad times  
You have always been there  
We hold each other tight you tell me it's alright  
The nights we fight about it  
Never think of giving up  
That's the price of love  
Your eyes will always see through me  
And bring me to my knees  
And I will always turn to you  
You're everything I need  
And through the good and bad times  
You have always been there  
We hold each other close you tell me its alright  
And sometimes I can't give enough  
That's the price of love  
That's the price of love  
That's the price of love
