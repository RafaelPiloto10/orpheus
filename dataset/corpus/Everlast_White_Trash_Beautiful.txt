White trash beautiful, trailer park queen  
She slings hash at the diner from eleven to five  
She married a boy from school, thought he was oh so cool  
But all he can do for money is drive  
Out late hauling freight on interstate five  
Prayin' he'll see home before his baby arrive  
  
White trash beautiful, there's something you should know  
My heart belongs to you  
And you could have found a better guy  
I'll love you till the day I die, I swear to God it's true  
I'm coming home to you  
I'm coming home to you girl  
  
He lights a cigarette, his eyes half open  
He won't be home tonight but she keeps hopin'  
Drinkin' himself to sleep is his only way of copin'  
She waits for him every night, she leaves the front door open  
It's four am, and doin' 95  
Tryin' to stay awake and make it home alive  
  
White trash beautiful, there's something you should know  
My heart belongs to you  
I know you could have found a better guy  
I'll love you till the day I die, I swear to God it's true  
I'm coming home to you  
I'm coming home to you girl  
  
Her lips stay painted red, her name tag's crooked  
Her heart's been gone a while with the truck driving man that took it  
He keeps her photograph on his rearview mirror  
She prays for him every night, she hopes that he can hear her  
  
White trash beautiful, there's something you should know

I'm coming home to you girl  
I'm coming home to you  
I'm coming home to you girl  
I'm coming home to you
