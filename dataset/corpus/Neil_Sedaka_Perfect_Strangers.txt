An afternoon of sad affairs  
Shared in the hope of mending broken dreams  
The constant struggle after simple pleasures  
Finds us perfect strangers, you and I  
  
You know I hate to see you cry  
And through the tears that fall like winter rain  
You say you're tired of merely just surviving  
We've so much in common that we're  
  
[Chorus:]  
Perfect strangers singing perfectly in tune  
From separate corners of the room  
Held together by our hunger to get by  
Perfect strangers, you and I  
  
Let's make a toast to no regrets  
Wet down the painful sting of sweet love lost  
Let evening find us whispering in our whiskey  
Come and sit beside me for a while  
  
You know I love to see you smile  
And if perhaps you're only passing through  
At least we tried to reach an understanding  
And for just one moment we were  
  
[Chorus x 2]
