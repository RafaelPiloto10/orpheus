It will be whatever it is you're looking for  
It will be whatever it is you need  
It will be better even though I know you're not sure  
Remember the rain even comes down in Shangri-La  
Look up as it soaks into your skin and remember who you are and  
  
Come on home when the road you've been walking gets too long  
Don't be scared in case the grass you thought was greener isn't there  
You can come on home  
  
If you find the sun won't shine through every window  
If you find a moonlit night still makes you blue  
If you find out why you feel the way you do  
Glance over your shoulder boy you know I'll be there  
I've found in the past you know, sometimes life isn't fair so  
  
Come on home when the road you've been walking gets too long  
  
Don't be scared in case the grass you thought was greener isn't there  
You can come on home  
When lifes isn't fair don't go there  
You can come on home
