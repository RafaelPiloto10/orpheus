She came and she touched me  
With hands made of heaven  
Reflections sent spinnin'  
Through a face laced in mist  
Now I stand where she left me  
Buried deep 'neath her shadow  
And the mirror plead sadly  
Does it all come to this  
And I wonder: Will she call my name?  
  
The wind careens madly  
Through wide windows paneless  
Fragrancies mingle  
In a room full of shade  
The peons pick partners  
And waltz cross the ceilings  
But the violins whisper  
That I've been betrayed  
Tryin not to look ashamed  
  
The drunkards drink deeply  
From cups full of nothingness  
Ghost lovers laugh  
At the games that they play  
The moments do somersaults  
Into eternity  
Cling to their coattails  
And beg them to stay  
Saying I got nothing to hide  
  
Illusions projected  
On walls made of Tiffany  
Mad minuets to  
A sad satin song  
A harlequin mandolins  
Harmonize helplessly  
Hoping that endlessly  
Won't last for long  
Praying that their God ain't dying  
  
Then I turn and I see her  
In a dress made of moonlight  
Teardrops like diamonds  
Run slow down her face  
Her arms surround me  
Like chains made of velvet  
And the demons fall faithfully  
Into their place  
And the rivers run with jewels  
  
Now the morning lies open  
The night went quite quickly  
Memory harmlessly  
Fractures and fades  
All the poets do push-ups  
On carpets of rubber foam  
Loudly they laugh  
At some joke that's been made  
And the wise men speak like fools
