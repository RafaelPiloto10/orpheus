What happened to Bruce, Eddie, and Paul?  
Paul and Eddie had it good  
But Paul loved his cocaine and Eddie hated punks  
So after a couple years  
Eddie broke it off with Paul to look for a new man  
  
Paul got fucked, fucked by Steve  
Eddie's at the Red Lion looking for a new steed  
Searching for a beau who sings in falsetto  
  
What happened to Bruce, Eddie, and Paul?  
What happened to Eddie, Paul, and Bruce?  
Bruce and Samson knew  
Eddie was looking for a long term, stable relationship  
With Paul no longer around,  
Bruce left Samson for Eddie cause Steve convinced him to  
  
Kudos to Paul, fuck you Bruce  
How you supposed to rock n' roll without substance abuse  
Number of the Beast is in bed with Rob and Judas Priest
