I used to be the first one to cry  
So afraid of a lonely tomorrow.  
Heartache was all that I had  
To call my own- so all alone.  
You came along and gave to my life  
Something more than the pain and the sorrow.  
Now that you're with me, we'll never be alone,  
In love, in love.  
Chorus:  
I believe  
In the love that you gave,  
I believe  
In the life that you saved,  
I believe how you make me feel  
Today  
I believe in you  
Night after night, I waited alone  
For something deeper than yesterday's feelings.  
Never believing that love would ever come  
To me- oh no.  
Then there was you, and out of the blue,  
Once a heart that was broken was healing.  
Love is the reason we'll never be alone,  
Oh no- oh no  
Chorus  
I still believe,  
Believe in something right.  
'cause I love you for believing in me.  
I believe in you.  
Chorus
