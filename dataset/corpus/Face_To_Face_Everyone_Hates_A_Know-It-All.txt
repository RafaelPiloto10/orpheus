In a flash I'll change the universe or at least the world  
I knew I'm so sick and tired of watching those who say  
And never do you're right and this waiting seems to last  
For hours as I wait impatiently and it's hard to find  
The strength inside to be who I should be you're right  
  
Why should I believe the words you're telling me are true?  
It doesn't seem like anybody feels the way I do I'm not  
Too proud to say when I was wrong everyone hates a know-it-all  
So I thought I'd change the universe and the world I  
Thought I knew but it seems that change is relative to  
What we believe is true you're right
