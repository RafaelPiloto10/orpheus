I love when the day is new  
We get to start all over  
But the thing is sometimes getting through the day  
Is just one big hustle  
  
The world is waiting, dawn is here  
Ain't got time to waste, we need to work, my dear  
Hurry, hurry can't delay  
Get up and start today, it's time to ...  
  
Hustle  
Oh, trying to keep things together  
Working all day, finding a way ...to hustle  
Soon I'll be back to you  
But first I got a lot to do  
  
We learn to fight to survive  
And that's how we manage to stay alive  
Then we let the night settle in  
Then I get to see my babe again  
  
I know you're waiting patiently  
You're home before I am, and so you wait for me  
Anticipation', I rush I do  
I'm coming back to you, I've got to  
  
Hustle  
Oh, I can't stay in this place  
I've got to see my baby's face (Hustle)  
Sure as I breathe and live  
I've got a lot of love to give  
  
You're my lady, I'm your man  
Let's turn the music up  
I think it's time to dance  
Night has fallen  
Spirits rise  
Ain't no compromise, we came to ...  
  
Hustle  
Up all night, don't stop yet  
Just let the music make you sweat and  
Hustle  
Forget about the work we do  
I just wanna be with you
