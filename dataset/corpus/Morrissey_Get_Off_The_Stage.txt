Oh, you silly old man  
You silly old man  
You're making a fool of yourself  
So get off the stage  
  
You silly old man  
In your misguided trousers  
With your mascara and your Fender guitar  
And you think you can arouse us?  
  
But the song that you just sang  
It sounds exactly like the last one  
And the next one  
I bet you it will sound  
Like this one  
  
Downstage, and offstage  
Don't you feel all run in?  
And do you wonder when they will take it away?  
This is your final fling  
  
But then applause ran high  
But for the patience of the ones behind you  
As a verse drags on like a month drags on  
It's very short, but it seems very long  
  
And the song that you just sang  
It sounds exactly like the last one  
And the next one  
I bet you it will sound  
Like this one  
  
So, get off the stage  
Oh, get off the stage  
And when we get down off of the stage  
Please stay off the stage - ALL DAY !  
  
Get off the stage  
Oh, get off the stage  
And when we've had our money back  
Then I'd like your back in plaster  
  
Oh, I know that you say  
How age has no meaning  
Oh, but here is your audience now  
And they're screaming:  
  
"Get off the stage"  
Oh, get off the stage  
Because I've given you enough of my time  
And the money that wasn't even mine  
Have you seen yourself recently?  
  
Oh, get off the stage  
Oh, get off the stage  
For whom, oh...  
For whom, oh...  
For whom, oh...  
For whom, oh...  
  
Get off the stage  
Get off the stage  
Get off the stage  
  
For whom the bell tolls
