Talk talk talk people are hammering in my brain  
Say so much nothing it's making me insane  
Telling out those rumors its gonna get hard to take  
Goes on and on what you gotta tolerate  
But never you mind, hey, don't waste your time  
  
[Chorus]  
Move on, let it ride  
Move on, leave it all behind  
Shine it on, shine your light  
Don't look back just leave it all behind I'll see you some other time  
Move on  
  
Them friends of many are really known by none  
Forever high school jealousy 101  
Make so much misery in this clich town  
They just love to get it up for the big let down  
But never you mind, hey don't waste your time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See you on the flip side
