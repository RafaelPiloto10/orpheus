Good morning heartache  
You old gloomy sight  
Good morning heartache  
Thought we said goodbye last night  
  
I tossed and turned  
Until it seemed you had gone  
But here you are with the dawn  
Wish I'd forget you  
  
But you're here to stay  
It seems I met you  
When my love went away  
Now every day I start by  
  
Saying to you  
Good morning heartache, what's new?  
Stop haunting me now  
Can't shake you no how  
  
Just leave me alone  
I've got those Monday blues  
Straight through Sunday blues  
Good morning heartache  
  
Here we go again  
Good morning heartache  
You're the one who knew me well  
Might as well get used to you  
  
Hangin' around  
Good morning heartache  
Sit down
