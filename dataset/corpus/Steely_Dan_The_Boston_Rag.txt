Any news was good news  
And the feeling was bad at home  
I was out of mind and you  
Were on the phone  
Lonnie was the kingpin  
Back in nineteen sixty-five  
I was singing this song  
When Lonnie came alive  
  
[Chorus]  
Bring back the Boston Rag  
Tell all your buddies  
That it ain't no drag  
Bring back the Boston Rag  
  
You were Lady Bayside  
There was nothing that I could do  
So I pointed my car down  
Seventh Avenue  
Lonnie swept the playroom  
And he swallowed up all he found  
It was forty-eight hours til  
Lonnie came around  
  
[Chorus]
