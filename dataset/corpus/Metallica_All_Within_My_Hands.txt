All within my hands  
Squeeze it in, crush it down  
All with my hands  
Hold it dear, hold it suffocate  
  
All within my hands  
Love to death, smack you 'round and round and  
All within my hands  
Beware  
  
Love is control  
I'll die if I let go  
  
Hate me now  
Kill all within my hands  
Hate me now  
Crush all within my hands  
Squeeze all within my hands  
Choke all within my hands  
Hate me now  
Trap all within my hands  
Hurry up and hate me now  
Kill all within my hands  
  
All within my hands  
Take your fear, pump me up  
All within my hands  
Let you run, then I pull your leash  
  
All within my hands  
Under thumb, under to myself  
All within my hands  
Beware  
  
Love is control  
I'll die if I let go  
  
Hate me now  
Kill all within my hands  
Hate me now  
Crush all within my hands  
Squeeze all within my hands  
Choke all within my hands  
Hate me now  
Trap all within my hands  
Hurry up and hate me now  
Kill all within my hands again  
  
I'll die if I let go  
Control is love, love is control  
I'll fall if I let go  
Control is love, love is control  
  
I will only let you breathe  
My air that you receive  
Then we'll see if I let you love me  
  
Kill kill kill kill kill
