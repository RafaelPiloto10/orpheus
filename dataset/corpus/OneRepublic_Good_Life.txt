Woke up in London yesterday  
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly  
Don't really know how I got here  
I got some pictures on my phone  
  
New names and numbers that I don't know  
Address to places like Abbey Road  
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want  
We're young enough to say  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh this has gotta be the good life  
This has gotta be the good life  
This could really be a good life, good life  
  
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight  
Like this city is on fire tonight  
This could really be a good life  
A good, good life  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
To my friends in New York, I say hello  
My friends in L.A. they don't know  
Where I've been for the past few years or so  
From Paris to China to Colorado  
  
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out  
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now  
We all got our stories but please tell me  
What there is to complain about  
  
When you're happy like a fool  
Let it take you over  
When everything is out  
You gotta take it in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight  
Like this city is on fire tonight  
This could really be a good life  
A good, good life  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
A good good life  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Hopelessly  
I feel like like there might be something that I'll miss  
Hopelessly  
I feel like the window closes oh so quick  
Hopelessly  
I'm taking a mental picture of you now  
'Cause hopelessly  
The hope is we have so much to feel good about  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight  
Like this city is on fire tonight  
This could really be a good life, oh yeah  
A good, good life  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh yeah, a good good life, good life  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Whoah, woah, listen,  
  
To my friends in New York, I say hello  
My friends in L.A. they don't know  
Where I've been for the past few years or so  
From Paris to China to Colorado  
  
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out  
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now  
We all got our stories but please tell me  
What there is to complain about
