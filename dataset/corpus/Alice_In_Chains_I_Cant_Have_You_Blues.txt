I can't have you blues  
I got the I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you...  
Nothings the same, need my fix of you  
A crack in the mirror, pictures split in two  
I can't believe you slipped away  
I been drinking too much cause I'm trying to forget your face  
And if I always try to do, all the things you want me to  
I've been letting myself down to an early grave  
And if I always try to do, all the things you want me to  
I've been letting myself down to an early grave  
Nothing stays the same, in this game  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you...  
Nothings the same, need my fix of you  
A crack in the mirror, pictures blank too  
I can't believe you slipped away  
I been drinking too much cause I'm trying to forget your face  
And if I always try to do, all the things you want me to  
I've been letting myself down to an early grave  
Nothing stays the same, in this game  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues
