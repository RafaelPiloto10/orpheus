Adjectives on the typewriter  
He moves his words like a prize fighter  
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell  
  
The man on the street might just as well be  
The man on the street might just as well  
The man on the street might just as well be  
  
Outside, outside the world  
Out there you don't hear the echos and calls  
But the steel eye,  
Tight jaw  
Say it all  
Say it all  
  
But the white paint,  
Plastic saints  
Say it all  
Say it all  
Say it all  
  
Say it all,  
Say it all,  
Say it all,  
Say it all,  
Say it all,  
Say somebody,  
Has got to say it all  
Somebody  
Has got to say it all  
  
I'm so nervous  
I'm so tense  
My heart can't forget about this self defense  
The air is so hot  
And my breath comes fast  
I thumb the cool blade but I know this can't last  
  
I thumb the cool blade but I know this can't last  
  
Outside, outside the world  
Out there you don't hear the echos and calls  
But the steel eye,  
Tight jaw  
Say it all  
Say it all  
  
But the white paint,  
Plastic saints  
Say it all  
Say it all  
Say it all  
  
Say it all,  
Say it all,  
Say it all,  
Say it all,  
Say it all,  
Say somebody,  
Has got to say it all  
Somebody  
Has got to say it all  
  
Yeah, adjectives on the typewriter  
He moves his words like a prize fighter  
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell  
  
The man on the street might just as well be  
The man on the street might just as well  
The man on the street might just as well be
