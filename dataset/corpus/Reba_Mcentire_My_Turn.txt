Turn out the light  
Turn yourself over to me  
Turn off the world  
Turn my feelings free  
  
Just enjoy the pleasure  
For the pleasure pleases me  
You've been turning me on all night long  
Now it's my turn  
  
You have reached the woman in me  
Through the man in you  
Let me be that woman  
Before the lovin's through  
  
You just turn yourself over to me  
While I turn my feelings free  
You've been turning me on all night long  
Now it's my turn  
  
All night long  
I've been driven to your touch  
Haven't had time to give  
I've been taking so much  
  
I know you want to hold me  
But darling you've done enough  
You've been turning me on all night long  
Now it's my turn  
  
You have reached the woman in me  
Through the man in you  
Let me be that woman  
Before the lovin's through  
  
You just turn yourself over to me  
While I turn my feelings free  
You've been turning me on all night long  
Now it's my turn  
  
All night long  
I've been driven to your touch  
Haven't had time to give  
I've been taking so much
