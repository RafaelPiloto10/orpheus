She's got pizazz  
Like a razzmatazz  
I'd like to slide it in  
But where do I begin  
  
Wastes all my money  
Spends all my time  
I ain't got no luck  
Can't change her mind  
  
Blame it on you  
I can't stand up  
Blame it on you  
I'm keepin' my mouth shut  
Blame it on you  
I can't see straight  
Blame it on you  
Uh-oh, too late  
  
I want a little reaction  
How 'bout a kiss or two?  
She said, "Jump back honey,"  
I said, "no can do."  
  
Why do you always make a fool out of me?  
I can't get no nookie  
Just plain to see  
  
Wastes all my money  
Spends all my time  
I ain't got no luck  
Can't change her mind  
  
Blame it on you  
I can't get no sleep  
Blame it on you  
I'm in six feet deep  
Blame it on you  
Well I guess it's true  
Blame it on you  
Yes, I do  
  
I blame this whole damn mess, honey  
Right on you  
  
Now listen little girl, let me explain  
Why you got me in such a terrible way  
She's got pizazz  
Like a razzmatazz  
I'd like to slide it in  
But where do I begin  
  
Blame it on you  
I can't get no sleep  
Blame it on you  
I'm in six feet deep  
Blame it on you  
Well I guess it's true  
Blame it on you  
Yes, I do
