Thought I'd go crazy when you said goodbye  
I didn't have that far to go  
But I made a wrong turn somewhere in the night  
Down a long and lonely road  
  
[Chorus]  
To Honkytonkville, an ideal  
Home away from home sweet home  
Honkytonkville where I don't feel  
A thing since you've been gone  
Where the future's always bright  
In the glow of neon lights  
Livin' high on Barstool Hill in Honkytonkville  
  
There's friendly faces everywhere I turn  
Droppin' quarters in the slot  
Lord knows that we've all got memories to burn  
And that's why that jukebox plays around the clock  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Livin' high on Barstool Hill in Honkytonkville
