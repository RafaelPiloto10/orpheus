In Love I just wanna hold my baby high above  
I want this hand in it's rightful glove  
Have people saying god damn she's fine  
Me responding with damn right she's mine  
Even though your gone, I try and carry on  
Its sad but it's true, me and you  
Were through  
But people still think they know us and they don't know shit  
But I want you to know I'm sorry and I still love you britt  
But now I've come to see, our destiny will never fit  
And that's why now I look back being once lost then found  
Its getting tougher with you not around  
Your the only thing that got me to smile  
I guess our love was a truthful denile  
Sometimes I remenice at what we had  
Not knowin I was causing my baby to be sad  
I never once tried to cause you this pain  
Its crazy how one person can make you go insane  
Ill admit me and you we had our bad times  
We fought, yea but people act like it's a fuckin crime  
No couples perfect, everyone faces bullshit  
All I ever tried was to show you I loved you britt  
But it's sad cause the image I portray the pieces don't fit  
All this time how could it be, my destiny will never be you and me  
But I wish people could see, how much I'm so crazy  
In love with you, it's true I wish it was still me and you  
Doin what we use to do, I wish they really knew  
And I wish theyd know I'd never let anything bad happend to you  
I got your back to the fullest, baby nems one to stay truest  
But times were tough, and shit got rough  
Every other day same shit breakin up and we fought  
But just know britt my rhymes are true  
Britt please know I'll forever Love you  
It just sucks cause there's a few out there that got Nems back  
People always tellin me get your fuckin life on track  
But in order to do that I need you back  
And that's why you don't know what you got till it's gone  
I'm so sorry that our love was always off and on....
