Tell me that I'm your own, my baby  
Hello my baby, hello my honey  
Hello my ragtime, summertime gal  
Send me a kiss by wire, by wire  
Baby, my heart's on fire, on fire  
If you refuse me, honey, you lose me  
And you'll be left alone, oh baby  
Telephone, and tell me, tell me  
Tell me I'm your very own, oh
