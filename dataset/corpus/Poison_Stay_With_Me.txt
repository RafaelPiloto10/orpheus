Vietnam was '66  
Two best friends take a bad hit  
And never saw it come  
But it's all there  
One was a rich boy, a doctors son  
The other the father of a girl age one  
Never had the change to hold his daughters hand  
  
New york flat in '76  
Two girlfriends shoot a bad fix  
Never woke up saw heaven before it saw them  
One was a daughter of a prominent man  
The other the mother of a girl age ten  
Who walked in and saw mama sleeping in gods hands  
And she cried  
  
Chorus  
Stay with me  
Mama won't you stay here with me  
You promised you would never leave  
Stay with me  
Oh won't you stay here with me  
Mama, hold my had and stay with me  
  
Years go by, the girl's 23  
Had a rough go, but she's on her feet  
The man so rough  
A few good years, a wedding ring  
Wasn't enough to fulfill his dreams  
He came home from work one day and said I'm leaving you  
She cried...  
  
Chorus  
Stay with me, honey  
Won't you stay right here with me  
You promised you would never leave  
Stay with me, whoa whoa  
Stay right here with me  
Won't you hold my hand stay with me  
  
Emergency room, number four  
A woman cried out as the child is born  
She stares into eyes and says  
My life's had it's ups and downs  
But for yours I will be around  
I will always be around  
And she cried  
  
Chorus  
Stay with me, whoa whoa  
Won't you stay right here with me  
I promise I will never leave  
Stay with me, oh  
Won't you stay right here with me  
Child, you hold my had stay with me  
Child, you hold my hand stay with me.
