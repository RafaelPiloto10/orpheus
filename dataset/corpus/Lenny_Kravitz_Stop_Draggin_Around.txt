Thinking positivity  
If you want to be with me  
I'll take you to the promised land  
Come on baby take my hand  
  
Stop draggin' around  
  
Higher and higher and higher we get  
I'll freak you like a sex-o-lette  
You say you want to be my wife?  
I'll take you to another life, come on  
  
Stop draggin' around  
  
Come on baby take my hand  
I'll take you to the promised land  
  
Stop draggin' around
