Tiamat, Adramelch, Acheron, Baal  
Burning up the city 'neath unholy citadel  
Summoning Leviathan, ready to attack  
Evil one awakens all the gods of Metal Black  
We come alive at the dawn of the night  
We're raising hell and you know that it' right  
The music screams on a wing and a prayer  
We turn the volume up, come watch if you dare  
Hear me calling - Join the pack  
Raised in hellfire - Metal Black  
This ain't no music for light hearted folk  
We tell it straight to the rich and the broke  
We're long haired punks and we don't give a care  
We turn the mayhem up, join if you dare  
Hear me calling - Join the pack  
Raised in hellfire - Metal Black  
A celebration of everything loud  
This is the music to incite a crowd  
Satanic forces lays everything bare  
We turn the danger up, feel it in the air  
Hear me calling - Join the pack  
Raised in hellfire - Metal Black  
Venom's calling - Join the pack  
Raised in hellfire - Metal Black yeah  
Metal Fucking Black
