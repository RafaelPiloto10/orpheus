Look at the sad goodbyes  
Everyday's are killing time  
Sun coming up outside  
No men are born this time  
Saturday's child stays home  
Nothing to say So long  
  
Well, well, well,  
Another day  
Well, well, well,  
Another day, day, day  
  
Grocery store  
Ten bucks  
Just making change for plastic cherries  
Up in a tree, jaybird  
Looking at me, no word  
Everyone looks  
We can't see  
We can't be ignored easily  
  
Well, well, well,  
Another day  
Well, well, well,  
Another day  
  
Soft within the wayward things  
Like ecstasy  
The sound of trees  
Most anything  
What a baby sees  
  
Beautiful face, alright  
Many a place, outta sight  
Old woman there with red shoes  
One million balloons, all used  
Drive over hills, forget your fear  
Getting it out of second gear  
  
Well, well, well,  
Another day  
Well, well, well,  
Another day
