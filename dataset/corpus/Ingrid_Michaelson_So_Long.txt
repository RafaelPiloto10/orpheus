You've made me into someone  
Who should not hold a loaded gun  
And now you sit upon my chest  
Knock out my wind, knock out my best  
  
And so long to no disasters and mornings too  
And so long to ever afters, so long to you  
  
I am soft for only you  
Impale me with your tongue, it's true  
And slices of me piled sky high  
The same old me to the naked eye  
But I can't find myself tonight  
  
And so long to no disasters and mornings too  
And so long to ever afters, so long to you
