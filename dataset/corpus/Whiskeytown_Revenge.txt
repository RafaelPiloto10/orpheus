Whatever happened to you?  
You've changed.  
And I'm still wrong (? ? ? ? ? )  
I know you wanted to stay so long  
And I'm still alone (? ? ? )  
There were no secrets  
There were no stories  
There was no one around  
There were no reasons  
There was no questions  
There is no point now  
Whatever happened to you?  
You've changed.  
And I'm still (? ? ? ? ? )  
I know you wanted to stay so long  
(? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? )  
So tell me your secret  
Did you want to see me pull my guns (? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? )  
So tell me your secret  
There were no stories  
Nobody won  
I'll give you a reason  
And I'll wage a war (? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? )  
With a punch from your face (? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? )  
I'll stand my guard  
I'll give you a reason  
You might see it  
You might hate it  
You might never know your name (? ? ? ? ? ? )  
  
So tell me a secret  
Tell me one more lie
