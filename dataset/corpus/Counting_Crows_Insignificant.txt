Can you see me up on a building  
From down on the pavement  
Or out in the crowd?  
  
Can you see me, in the glare of the lamp post?  
Cause I am walking a tightrope  
Into the moon.  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want feel so different,  
But I don't want to be insignificant  
And I don't how to see the same things different now.  
  
Oh, can you see me? I am one in a million  
Yeah, I'm Icarus falling, out of the sun.  
She sees me falling, a line of spotlights and chalk lines.  
Through night black as a bedroom  
And white as a lie.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Diving through the dark, while the night turns blue  
And you wear your intentions, as I wear my intentions  
So clear.  
  
[Guitar Bridge]  
  
If you see me, wading through water  
Or come drowning a river  
Right in front of the world  
  
Hey you can wash your face and hands in the stream of my anger  
Cause it's as bright as white paper  
As dark as a girl  
  
[Chorus: x2]
