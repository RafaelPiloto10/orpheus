Purple haze, all in my brain  
Lately things they don't seem the same  
Actin' funny, but I don't know why  
Excuse me while I kiss the sky  
  
Purple haze, all around  
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down  
Am I happy or in misery?  
What ever it is, that girl put a spell on me  
  
Help me  
Help me  
Oh, no, no  
  
Ooo, ahhh  
Ooo, ahhh  
Ooo, ahhh  
Ooo, ahhh, yeah!  
  
Purple haze all in my eyes  
Don't know if it's day or night  
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind  
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?  
  
Ooo  
Help me  
Ahh, yea-yeah, purple haze  
Oh, no, oh  
Oh, help me  
Tell me, tell me, purple haze  
I can't go on like this  
Purple haze  
You're makin' me blow my mind  
Purple haze, n-no, nooo  
Purple haze
