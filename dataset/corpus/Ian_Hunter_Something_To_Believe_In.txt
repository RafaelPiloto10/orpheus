Well, I lay underneath an ageless sky  
I watched the universe breathing  
There's more going on up there than meets the eye  
Give me something to believe in  
Which way's in and which way's out  
Every step is misleading  
Well, which way is up which way is down?  
You gotta have something to believe in  
Oh, let me dream, let me dream  
I spend my whole life dreaming  
I've been lucky but I'm still mean  
You gotta have something to believe in  
I didn't mean to hurt the people I hurt  
I was full of fear and loathing  
I wasn't up to much but I was all I had to go on  
Couldn't find nothing to believe in  
I don't like all them man made religions  
They all need a little spiritual healing  
They don't cut across race, they don't cut across culture  
But we all need something to believe in  
So you believe what you want to believe  
Just stay true to your feelings  
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another now  
Gotta have something to believe in  
Well, I lay underneath a royal throne  
The gaudy paint was peeling  
Half an inch deep and twice as cheap  
Oh, give me something to believe in  
Fat Fred always packing lead  
On the corner dealing  
Makes more in a night than I can make in forty days  
Give me something to believe in  
Now people worship what they see  
Looks can be deceiving  
Violence rages in abandoned hearts  
'Cause they ain't got nothing to believe in  
The chill chill is a bitter pill  
When it comes to leaving  
'Cause there ain't no easy way outta here  
When you ain't got nothing to believe in  
Just woke up in Sarajevo city  
I watched all those mothers screaming  
Kids getting shot and for what and for what?  
Give me something to believe in  
Now there's fire outside, mud that slides  
Earthquakes shake the region  
Willy and the Poorboys lost in America  
They ain't got nothing to believe in  
For every seed of knowledge found  
For every grain of reason  
For every shred of decency  
There's something to believe in  
Now I lay me down to rest  
In the silence of the evening  
And the moon road shines from here to eternity  
I've got something to believe in  
You believe what you want to believe  
Just stay true to your feelings  
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another  
I've got something to believe in
