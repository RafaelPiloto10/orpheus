I don't remember what day it was  
I didn't notice what time it wa-as  
All I know is that I fell in love with you  
And if all my dreams come true  
I'll be spending time with you...  
  
Every day's a new day in love with you  
With each day comes a new way of loving you  
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander  
And if all my dreams come true  
I'll be spending time with you  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow (yesterday)  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But, darling, not as much as tomor-orrow-ow  
  
Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away  
Cupid, we don't need you now, be on your way  
I thank the Lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger  
And I always will be true  
I know you feel the same way too  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow (yesterday)  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But, darling, not as much as tomor-orrow-ow  
  
Every day's a new day, every time I love you  
Every way's a new way, every time I love you  
Every day's a new day, every time I love you  
Every day's a new day [fade]
