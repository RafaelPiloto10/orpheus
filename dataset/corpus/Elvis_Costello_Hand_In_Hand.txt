No, don't ask me to apologize  
I won't ask you to forgive me  
If I'm gonna go down, you're gonna come with me  
  
You say, "Why don't you be a man about it  
Like they do in the grown-up movies?"  
But when it comes to the other way around  
You say you just want to use me  
Oh, you and you wonder whether  
It's gonna be syndicated  
You sit with your knees together  
All the time your breath is bated  
  
Hand in hand  
No, don't ask me to apologize  
I won't ask you to forgive me  
If I'm gonna go down, you're gonna come with me  
  
Don't you know I got the bully boys out  
Changing someone's facial design  
Sitting with my toy room lout  
Polishing my precious china  
Don't you know I'm an animal  
But don't you know I can't stand up steady  
But you can't show me any kind of hell  
That I don't know already  
  
Hand in hand  
No, don't ask me to apologize  
I won't ask you to forgive me  
If I'm gonna go down, you're gonna come with me  
Hand in hand, hand in hand, hand in hand
