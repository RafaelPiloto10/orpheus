I hear the sonic sound of brakes  
As you whisper in my ear  
I hold your head between my sweaty hands  
And shout loud for all to hear  
Anita say the word  
  
I smell gasoline and I feel the heat  
As we make love standing up  
In the alley behind your street  
Glow and crumble girl  
I want you but I don't want your world  
Anita say the word...  
And I will walk with you almost anywhere  
Back to al's bar, baby hand in hand  
All them local boys will know that I'm your new man  
  
Hey see anita, yeah she's my scary girl  
All black blue eyes and blue blackened hair  
I can taste the heaven waiting there  
Shake and tremble, broken grace  
I admit it, I'm in love, but out of place  
Anita say the word...  
And I will sleep with you in that misfit way  
With the tv noise so loud it soothes my fears  
And the flickering light bathes your face  
  
I wake from the drugs and the fear  
In the night outside the world reverberates  
Blue shadows in our loft, downtown L. A.  
Outside the world reverberates  
I need the strength I see in her  
I need the love I feel inside  
We talk about leaving behind the hell we're in  
We laugh about making it out alive  
  
Yeah, see anita, yeah  
She's my pretty girl  
Blind eyes to the world outside  
No more so than the rest of the world...  
No more so, than any other girl  
It makes no sense to me...  
Yeah anita, say the word
