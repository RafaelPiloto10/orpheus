The skies are filled with Your glory  
The oceans mirror Your grace  
How deep, how high, how wonderful You are  
The earth is telling Your mystery  
The heavens singing Your praise  
How deep, how high, how wonderful You are, You are  
We're living to tell Your story now  
Your glory and grace, O God  
  
Gloria, Gloria!  
Heaven and earth sing how great You are  
Gloria, Gloria!  
To You evermore  
  
The nails, the thorns and the offering  
As you surrendered Your breath  
How deep, how high, how wonderful You are  
Now we're becoming and offering  
Singing with every last breath  
How deep, how high, how wonderful You are, You are  
  
Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory  
Yours is the anthem, and the honor, and the story
