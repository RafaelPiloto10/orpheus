Now when I learned to play the ukulele,  
I used to practice day and night.  
My pals all roared as I fumbled at a chord,  
But I couldn't get the darned thing right.  
  
They laughed when I started to play, they laughed so hearty.  
Only two lessons I had, I went up the scale and down the scale,  
It wasn't so bad  
But one chap, he said "Oh what a mug, why you can't learn that way"  
He took the uke off me and said "Now I'll have a try"  
Just then the 'g' string bust and flew right into his eye.  
He laughed when I started to play, but he didn't laugh again all day  
  
Oh they laughed when I started to play, oh they laughed so hearty  
Strip poker that's a good game,  
Once I lost my trousers to a gambling dame  
But when, I started shuffling the cards, then the luck came my way.  
I won a frock and undies, she was left I declare  
As bare as any savage and as savages are bear  
She laughed when I started to play,  
But she didn't laugh again that day.  
  
Now once I watched a game of water polo,  
With players from a ladies school.  
The girls all cried "Won't you make up a side?"  
So I dashed into the bathing pool.  
They laughed when I started to play, oh how they laughed so hearty.  
In goal, I paddled about, a big ball in the water soon I started to clout.  
Each time, that it came bobbing back, well I smacked it away.  
Just then the ball turned over and a girl said "No larks",  
"Seven times you've hit me where I can't show the marks."  
She laughed when I started to play,  
But she didn't laugh again that day.
