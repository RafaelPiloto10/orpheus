Emily, Emily, Emily  
Has the murmuring sound of may  
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels  
And the laughter of children at play  
  
Say Emily, Emily, Emily  
And we fade to a marvelous view  
Two lovers alone and out of sight  
Seeing images in the firelight  
As my eyes visualize a family  
They see Emily, Emily  
  
(and we fade to a marvelous view)  
Two lovers alone and out of sight  
Seeing images in the firelight  
As my eyes visualize a family  
They see Emily, Emily  
Too
