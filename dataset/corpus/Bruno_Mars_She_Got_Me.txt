I gotta find my way out of this bill, you got me into,  
My baby's sleepin and the night is dead,  
It's like in dreamin that walls are closing in on me,  
I just wanna know that your okay...  
  
I wanna find out why, you choose to stay, baby,...  
You got me going crazy...  
  
Ooo... My baby say I'll be oh... No... That she'd let me breathe outside my
words, ooo... My baby say I'll be oh... No... That she'd let me breathe it
like a creamy note...  
  
Everyday's the same, your word, life, when all you come and goes in me, I keep
seeing that, your all brown hair and your white wedding gown, baby I'm missing
you...  
  
I wanna find out why, you choose to stay oh,... Oh ya,... Ooo... My baby say
I'll be oh... No... That she'd let me breathe outside my words, ooo... My baby
say I'll be oh... No... That she'd let me breathe it like a creamy note...  
  
I can't stop this, all this dating mood, I got to my time... I ooo... I can't
get, I don't wanna get this way, see from his misery...  
  
I wanna find out why, you choose to stay, baby,... You got me going crazy...  
  
Ooo... My baby say I'll be oh... No... That she'd let me breathe outside my
words, ooo... My baby say I'll be oh... No... That she'd let me breathe it
like a creamy note...  
  
I promise to love ya, hold ya, even when time got hard and I can still see us
being forever, but now weir falling apart...  
  
I wanna find out why, you choose to stay, baby... You got me, ooo... My baby
say I'll be oh... No... That she'd let me breathe outside my words, ooo... My
baby say I'll be oh... No... That she'd let me breathe it like a creamy
note...
