She's so fine  
How about a nine on a ten scale  
With long legs straight on up to her lunch pail  
Sweet little wishbone, oh yeah  
Don't want to break her in half  
Lick up one side and down the other  
Always makes her laugh  
She take me down, down, down to the bottom  
I got everything you wanted  
Give you everything you need  
Still you want that sugar daddy over me  
She want a sucker, sucker in a 3 piece  
A sucker all dressed up in a 3 piece suit  
I'm on fire with just one look  
Got me a brand new number  
In my little black book  
But she don't like the way I dress  
She don't like the way I wear my hair  
But when I roll you over baby, you don't care  
Just take me down, down, down, down to the bottom  
Give me everything I want  
Give me everything I want  
You don't want that sugar daddy, not over me  
She want a sucker, sucker in a 3 piece  
A sucker all dressed up in a 3 piece suit  
Oh say it isn't so, baby  
You want to sucker  
He just a sucker  
He just a sucker  
Look at all that money, baby  
Ya know your sugar daddy  
You're a sugar mama  
You're both a bunch of suckers  
Oh how he got a big ole belly  
A stone bald head  
Now, listen here, honey  
That ain't down your alley, no  
He's just a sucker in a three piece  
Sucker in a three piece suit  
Sucker.  
Stone cold, sugar daddy  
Sucker all dressed up in a three piece suit
