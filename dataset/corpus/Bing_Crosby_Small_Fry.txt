Small fry, struttin by the pool room  
Small fry, should be in the school room  
My, my put down that cigarette  
You ain't grown up high and mighty yet  
Samll fry, dancin for a penny  
Small fry, countin up how many  
My, my just jlisten here to me  
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea  
You practice peckin all day long to eome old radio song  
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes  
You better listen to your (maw, pay)  
and someday practice the law  
and then you'll be a real success  
Ys, small fry, (you) kissed the neighbor's daughter  
Small fry, (should) stay in shallow water  
Seems I should take you cross my knee  
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea  
You've got your feet all soakin wet  
You'll be the death of me yet  
Oh me, oh my, small fry
