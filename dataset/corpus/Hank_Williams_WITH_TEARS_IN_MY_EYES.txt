With tears in my eyes, dear, I begged you to stay  
You couldn't forgive me, so you went away  
I made a mistake, dear, by tellin' you lies  
Now I lay awake, dear, with tears in my eyes  
  
No more to be sweetheart, no more to be friend  
Please give me a chance, dear, and I'll make amends  
My yesterdays haunt me, my weary heart cries  
I just can't go on, dear, with tears in my eyes  
  
If you ever need me, oh please let me know  
Wherever you lead me, I'm willin' to go  
The past is a flower, that withers and dies  
I'll wake up tomorrow, with tears in my eyes  
  
With tears in my eyes, dear, I begged you to stay  
You couldn't forgive me, so you went away  
I made a mistake, dear, by tellin' you lies  
Now I lay awake, dear, with tears in my eyes
