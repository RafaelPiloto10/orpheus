I need a lady, not somebody shady  
Need someone to be close to  
Somebody cozy, not somebody nosey  
Help me see my whole day through  
  
Someone to share the load  
Somebody to walk the road I live on, live  
  
Good Lord send me, good Lord mend me  
Send me down someone for me  
Said I won't be choosy  
You could send me a floosy  
Send me anybody you please  
Somebody say you will  
Somebody further still  
Somebody, some, somebody for me  
Now won't you send me somebody  
Yeah, somebody  
  
Won't you send me somebody  
Now won't you send me somebody  
Well, call for somebody  
Scream loud and bloody  
Call woman, woman, come on to me  
Save for tomorrow  
Share all your sorrow  
Misery enjoys company  
Yes it does, yes it does
