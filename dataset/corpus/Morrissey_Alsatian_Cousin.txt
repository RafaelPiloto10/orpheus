Were you and he lovers?  
And would you say so if you were?  
On a forecourt  
On a Friday  
Passing my way  
Oh...  
  
Were you and he lovers?  
And if you were, then say that you were!  
On a groundsheet  
Under canvas  
With your tent-flap  
Open wide  
  
A note upon his desk  
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"  
Leather elbows on a tweed coat  
-Oh!-  
Is that the best you can do ?  
So came his reply :  
"But on the desk is where I want you!"  
  
So I ask (even though I know):  
Were you and he lovers ?
