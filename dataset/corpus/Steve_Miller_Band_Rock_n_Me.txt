Well I've been lookin' real hard  
And I'm tryin' to find a job  
But it just keeps gettin' tougher every day  
But I got to do my part cause I know in my heart  
I got to please my sweet baby, yeah  
  
Well, I ain't superstitious  
And I don't get suspicious  
But my woman is a friend of mine  
And I know that it's true that all the things that I do  
Will come back to me in my sweet time  
  
So keep on rock'n me baby  
Keep on a rock'n me baby  
Keep on a rock'n me baby  
Keep on a rock'n me baby  
  
I went from Phoenix, Arizona  
All the way to Tacoma  
Philadelphia, Atlanta, L.A.  
Northern California where the girls are warm  
So I could be with my sweet baby, yeah  
  
Keep on a rock'n me baby

And you know that it's true  
That all the things that I do  
Are gonna come back to you in your sweet time

All the way to Tacoma

Northern California where the girls are warm  
So I could hear my sweet baby say
