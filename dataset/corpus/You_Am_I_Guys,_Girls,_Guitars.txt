There's a guy singing in the edge of the room  
Making sounds through a face like a prune  
He's got them fancy checkered pants and a chip in his tooth  
Oh no, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Suffocating from patchouli and smoke  
Here's the fifty-first song that he wrote  
About the girl who split fifty weeks ago  
Oh no, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
And there's a weight sitting real heavy down there on his shoulder  
The patented moves growing colder  
The seventh chord just keeps getting older  
  
Oh my soul, just hit me if I get on a roll  
But this all sounded so good in the bedroom cold  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
But its only a 2 AM tune  
With a bridge lifted from "My Aim Is True"  
From the setlist drink to the practice room  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
But there's a weight sitting real heavy down there on his shoulder  
The patented moves growing colder  
The seventh chord just keeps getting older  
  
And he knows just as sure as this microphone stinks  
There's a change coming through and he ain't going home alone tonight  
  
And there's a weight sitting real heavy down there on his shoulder  
The seventh chord just keeps getting older  
Is it me or is the room getting colder  
  
Oh, we're going down, but don't it sound sweet  
Feel the dust building up at our feet  
The seventh chord just keeps getting older
