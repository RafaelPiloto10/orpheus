Rearview crosses  
Railroad ties  
Oh, Hail Marys  
Friday nights  
Heartbeat baby  
Low-beam lights  
God, I miss when you were mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Back when that song was a song  
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on  
Every beat, every line, every word, every time  
When a road was a road  
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you  
Money was gas, dreams were dust  
Love was fast and we were us  
  
Shotgun sunset  
A cool mint kiss  
Backseat promise  
Breaking it  
Floorboard feeling  
County lines  
God, I miss when you were mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a sleepy town, just jumping in  
Far too young to know that summers end  
We were us, we can't go back  
It's what it is, but God I miss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every beat, every line, every word, every single time  
I just close my eyes and you're ridin shotgun  
You and me, baby, on the run  
I can feel your heartbeat, baby
