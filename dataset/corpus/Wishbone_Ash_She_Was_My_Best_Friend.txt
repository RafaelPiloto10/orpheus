The daylight train comes so slowly  
And now it's so easy to see.  
Warm at night  
She sleeps so tight.  
She gave me comfort  
Made me smile  
She was my best friend for a while.  
Well, I was no hurricane  
A daylight dream of mine.  
She comes with the sun.  
In the morning sun  
We shared the mystery of a power.  
She was an angel in my darkest hour.  
As I close my eyes  
I can see her face  
Feel inside a rhythm  
I can feel her warm embrace.  
She comes with the sun  
In the morning sun  
She gave me comfort  
Made me smile.  
She was my best friend for a while.
