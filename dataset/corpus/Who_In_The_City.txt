Come along  
Into the city  
Where the girls are pretty  
And you can't go wrong  
  
Take your time  
No need to hurry  
Don't have to worry  
Cause it won't take long  
  
Well you can surf in the city  
You can swim in the pools  
Do anything you want  
Because there ain't no rules  
Drive your super-stock carbur to the long highway  
And you can drag.  
  
In the city in the falling right  
The kids are hip and they can dance all night  
In the city all the girls are pretty and they go...  
Come along  
Into the city  
Where the girls are pretty  
And you can't go wrong  
  
Well you can surf in the city  
You can swim in the pools  
Do anything you want  
Because there ain't no rules  
Drive your super-stock carbur to the long highway  
And you can drag.  
  
In the city in the falling right  
The kids are hip and they can dance all night  
In the city all the girls are pretty and they go...  
  
In the city, into the city...
