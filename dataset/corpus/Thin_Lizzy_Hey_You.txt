You're living in a small town  
The people there are cold  
Just living in a small town  
Just doing as you're told  
You move up to the jungle  
You find that it's a hell  
When you slip, you fall, you stumble  
They lock you in a cell  
  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you, all your friends told you in your small town  
Hey you, you've got it made  
  
Just living in your home town  
Sometimes it's kinda cruel  
Living in your home town  
Where they treat you like a fool  
You move up to the city  
You find that it's tough  
And it doesn't seem very pretty  
Now you're sleeping in the rough  
  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you  
You've got it made  
Hey you  
You're heading for the big time  
Hey you, you've got it made  
You're headed for a life of crime  
  
Living in this jungle  
It's like living in a hell  
When you slip, you fall, you stumble  
They lock you in a cell  
You move out to the country  
For something you have done  
You're living in the country  
Why don't you go back to where you come from?  
  
Hey you, you've got it made [Repeat: x5]  
  
Forget all these backslappers  
You don't stand a chance  
Why don't you go home?  
Go right back to where you come from  
Don't get involved in this masquerade  
This big city is going to eat you up  
All the backslapping  
Hey you, you've got it made
