It's not my sun, man, and if it's not shinin'  
When I wake up tomorrow morning, hmm, that'll be all right with me  
They're not my birds, man, and if they're not singin'  
When I wake up tomorrow morning, hmm, that'll be all right with me  
I don't believe I'm where I'm goin', I find many a mile  
If you don't like me, help me to change I'm still looking for a style  
She's just a woman if she should be gone  
When I wake up tomorrow morning, hmm, that'll be all right with me  
Well, I'm not a brave man but I'm not a slave man  
If all I ever am is free, that'll be all right with me  
I don't believe I'm where I'm goin', I find many a mile  
If you don't like me, help me to change I'm still looking for a style
