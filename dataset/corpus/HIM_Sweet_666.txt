There are things you should know,  
  
And the distance between us seems to grow.  
  
But you're holding on stronger,  
  
And oh how hard it is to let go.  
  
Oh so hard to let go.  
  
I'm waiting for your call,  
  
And I'm waiting to take your 666 in my heart.  
  
And I'm longing for your touch,  
  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart (oh my love)  
  
I'm losing my faith in you,  
  
But you don't want it to be true  
  
But there's nothing you can do,  
  
And there is nothing you can do, yes I've lost my faith in you.  
  
Waiting for your call and I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart.  
  
And I'm longing for your touch, and I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart,
right here in this heart.  
Ooh right here is this heart, ow, my love.  
  
"And I know it's too late,  
Oh my god it's a long way! "  
  
I'm waiting for your call, and I'm ready to take your sweet 666 in my heart,  
  
I'm longing for yout touch and I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart,  
  
I'm ready for the fall and I'm ready to take your sweet 666 in my heart,  
  
Longing for your touch and I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart,  
Right here in this heart,  
  
Right straight through my heart,  
  
Right here in my heart.
