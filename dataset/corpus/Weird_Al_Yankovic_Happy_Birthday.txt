Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
Well, it's time to celebrate your birthday, it happens every year  
We'll eat a lot of broccoli and drink a lot of beer  
You should be good and happy that there's something you can eat  
A million people every day are starving in the street  
  
Your daddy's in the gutter with the wretched and the poor  
Your mama's in the kitchen with a can of Cycle Four  
There's garbage in the water  
There's poison in the sky  
I guess it won't be long before we're all gonna die  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
Well, what's the matter little friend, you think this party is the pits  
Enjoy it while you can, we'll soon be blown to bits  
The monkeys in the pentagon are gonna cook our goose  
Their finger's on the button, all they need it an excuse  
  
It doesn't take a military genius to see  
We'll all be crispy critters after World War III  
There's nowhere you can run to, nowhere you can hide  
When they drop the big one, we all get fried  
  
(Come on boys and girls, sing along, ok?)  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
wow! (background screaming, sound effect)  
  
Well there's a punk in the alley and he's looking for a fight  
There's an Arab on the corner buying everything in sight  
There's a mother in the ghetto with another mouth to feed  
Seems that everywhere you look today there's misery and greed  
  
I guess you know the Earth is gonna crash into the sun  
But that's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun  
So if you think it's scary, if it's more than you can take  
Just blow out the candles and have a piece of cake  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Wow!  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
(Happy Birthday!)  
  
And a pinch to grow an inch!
