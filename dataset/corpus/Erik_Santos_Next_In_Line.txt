What has life to offer me  
When I grow old  
What's there to look forward to  
Beyond the biting cold  
'Cause they say it's difficult  
Yes, stereotypical  
  
What's there beyond sleep, eat, work in this cruel life  
Ain't there nothing else 'round here but human strife  
They say it's difficult  
Yes, stereotypical  
You gotta be conventional  
You can't be so radical  
  
So I sing this song to all of my age  
For these are the questions  
We've got to face  
For in this cycle that we call life  
We are the ones who are next in line  
We are next in line

We are next in line... Oooh... Ohh...  
We are next in line  
  
And we gotta work, we gotta feel  
Let's open our eyes and do whatever it takes  
And we gotta work, we gotta feel  
Let's open our eyes(ooohhh)
