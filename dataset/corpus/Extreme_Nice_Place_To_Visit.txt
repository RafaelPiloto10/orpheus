Not really lookin' for, for nothing special,  
Just someplace that I can call my own,  
I'm growing tired of, of running wild,  
It's time I settled down  
Bridge:  
There seems to be some lights on,  
But ain't nobody home  
I think I see some lights on,  
But there ain't nobody home  
Ain't being choosy, but  
Don't want no floozy,  
And that's not much to ask  
  
Chorus:  
She's a nice place to visit (3x)  
But I wouldn't want to live her,  
Nice place to visit  
Hey, is anybody home?  
Seeing is believing,  
But looks can be deceiving,  
What you get ain't always what you see  
I like what' s down there,  
But no one is upstairs,  
I think there's bats in the belfry  
Chorus  
I don't know what's come over me,  
I'm blinded by the scenery,  
Nice place to visit,  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
I'm coming back because of you,  
Nice place to visit, visit, visit...  
Bridge  
This big bad wolf knows  
Which way the wind blows,  
And which little piggy's house is made of brick,  
Must have vacated, or mislocated,  
There's just toys, toys in the attic  
Chorus (hey, is anybody home? )  
Knock, knock, who's there?  
She's a nice place to visit (2x)
