You say you want  
Diamonds on a ring of gold  
You say you want  
Your story to remain untold  
  
But all the promises we make  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You say you'll give me  
A highway with no one on it  
Treasure just to look upon it  
All the riches in the night  
  
You say you'll give me  
Eyes in a moon of blindness  
A river in a time of dryness  
A harbor in the tempest  
But all the promises we make  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You say you want  
Your love to work out right  
To last with me through the night  
  
You say you want  
Diamonds on a ring of gold  
Your story to remain untold  
Your love not to grow cold  
  
All the promises we break  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You, all I want is,  
You, all I want is,  
You, all I want is,  
You
