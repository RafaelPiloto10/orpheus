Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
  
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
I used to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But I'm not afraid  
This rover crossed over  
  
If I never have a cent  
I'll be rich as Rockefeller  
Gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny side of the street
