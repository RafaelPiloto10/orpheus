The alarm rang for days  
You could tell from conversations  
I was waiting by the screen  
I couldn't recognize my photograph  
Me, I disconnect from you  
  
I was walking up the stairs  
Something moved in silence  
I could feel his mind decaying  
Only inches away from me  
And I disconnect from you  
  
Please don't turn me off  
I don't know what I'm doing outside  
Me and the telephone that never rings  
If you were me what would you do?  
Me, I disconnect from you
