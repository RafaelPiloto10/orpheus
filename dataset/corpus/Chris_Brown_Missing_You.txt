Layin' here  
All out of ideas  
Ain't picked up the phone  
In so damn long  
I got the lights off  
And I aint sleep bout a week  
You got a man in defeat  
And that's the picture of me  
The last time we spoke  
I said goodbye  
You had this look on your face  
So many tears in your eyes  
And I tried  
To say it was for the best  
But now I regret my choice  
  
And if I had it to do all over  
I would find me another way  
To express what's on my mind  
And try to find me the words I wanna say  
And now I'm to hurt to love another  
But I'm too proud to ask you back  
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song  
But I needed to tell you that  
When I  
  
When I first let you go I aint know that it would hurt  
But I miss you  
I aint never had it bad  
But each day is gettin worse cuz I miss you  
Baby  
Sorry  
The things I said and the things I did  
If you want to hurry home cuz I'm sittin here alone  
Cuz I miss you  
  
You had heart enough to handle me  
But I kept my heart out of reach  
Feeling strong enough to carry us  
Still I violated every trust  
Is it too late  
I wonder to say I'm sorry  
Too late  
I wonder to bed your pardon  
All I think about is how I messed it up  
And all I think about is how I need ya love  
  
And if I had it to do all over  
I would find me another way  
To express what's on my mind  
And try to find me the words I wanna say  
And now I'm to hurt to love another  
But I'm too proud to ask you back  
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song  
But I needed to tell you that  
When I  
  
When I first let you go I aint know that it would hurt  
But I miss you  
I aint never had it bad  
But each day is gettin worse cuz I miss you  
Baby  
Sorry  
The things I said and the things I did  
If you want to hurry home cuz I'm sittin here alone  
Cuz I miss you  
  
And If I can see you  
I'll tell you that I'm sorry  
I'll tell you that it's my fault  
And I don't wanna be alone  
And if I can hold you  
I'll love you like I never did before  
And then I would love you more  
Never ever let you go  
  
I swear that if I had it to do all over (had it to do)  
I would find me another way (find another way)  
To express what's on my mind  
And try to find me the words I wanna say  
And now I'm to hurt to love another (too hurt to love)  
But too damn proud to ask you back (too proud to ask you back)  
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song  
But I needed, I needed to tell you that  
  
When I first let you go I aint know that it would hurt  
But I miss you  
I aint never had it bad  
But each day is gettin worse cuz I miss you  
Baby  
Sorry  
The things I said and the things I did  
If you want to hurry home cuz I'm sittin here alone  
Cuz I miss you ...
