Are you ready for the day that we pray for  
Already holding what is real?  
You know the soul finds its own evolution  
And this is the only love I feel  
  
And I tell you, I'm keeping up the strength  
I gotta try 'cause you ain't getting past this heart of mine  
I'm out here waiting for you with all I've got to give  
And I accept this life we live  
  
I'll be your lover and I'll be your friend  
I'm gonna follow you right to the end  
I wasn't made to tell you lies  
I only came to make you realize  
  
I'll be your hero and I'll be your clown  
You pick me up, you let me down  
Don't make me stumble, don't make me wait  
'Cause come tomorrow, will be too late  
  
Come tomorrow, oh, come tomorrow  
  
I got to turn away my face  
'Cause you blind me with your light  
Can you catch up to me?  
You know I love you in the black of night  
This sacred ritual, this journey has begun  
And we try, we try to carry on  
  
And you innocents, you get to find the things in life  
That get you through  
(One more dance)  
And deep inside, the things you were  
No one ever knew  
  
(One last chance)  
Let me make it happen  
This world we have foreseen  
(Ooh)  
And I will tell you how I feel  
  
Love will be better for wearing your ring  
I'm gonna give you everything  
I wasn't made to tell you lies  
I only came to make you realize  
  
I'll be your hero and I'll be your clown  
You pick me up, you let me down  
Don't make me stumble, don't make me wait  
'Cause come tomorrow, will be too late  
  
Come tomorrow, come tomorrow  
Come tomorrow, come back tomorrow  
Come tomorrow, come tomorrow  
Come tomorrow, ah, come tomorrow
