Say na na for crying at loud baby  
  
For crying at loud baby  
  
I'd beg for you dance for you  
  
Say na na ...  
  
I'd beg for you dance for you  
  
But you left me you beat me  
  
Na na na na na na  
  
But you left me you beat me  
  
Na na na na na na  
  
'cause i'd beg for you dance for you  
  
'cause i'd beg for you dance for you  
  
And after all  
  
The way you locked at me that day  
  
You make me fell so blind  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Say na na...
