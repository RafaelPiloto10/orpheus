Sometimes I wonder what it's like  
To be living life on the other side  
Please don't make me feel like I don't know  
What's out there  
Proof is written in the sky  
Hey won't you listen to me now  
It makes no difference if I wish upon a star  
The only absolute is that the Word of Life  
Is written on my heart  
Oh I believe  
Yes, I believe  
  
Hey look at me, living life for you  
When it's good, when it's hard  
You know me, you know my heart  
Yea, yea, yea I give up anything at all  
When you call  
All I know it's worth it all  
  
I know you're scared to let me know you  
I know you got a heavy kind of soul  
And I know it's harder to believe in love when you're  
Feeling all alone  
They're taking bets on who the lover of your soul  
And your heart is gonna be  
They're taking on all the things that get you down and out  
The moment you believe  
I believe in you  
Yes, I believe in you
