Oh, yeah  
Check me out on the good side here  
Well, my baby's on the corner and she's lookin' so fine  
Put one and one together and it blowed my mind  
A man needs love to live, I'm the living proof  
Catch that smile and I hit the roof  
We'd double check but you keep on walking  
I'm in love  
Once over  
I'm overdone  
So this is love?  
Ooh, I need your lovin'  
Come on baby, take me home  
So this is love?  
Ooh, I need your lovin'  
I'm just skin and bones  
Goin' out my way, knowin' my way around  
The grass is never greener and there's plenty around  
All other girls, they'd be put to shame  
Over the edge and here I'll stay  
Got me on pins and needles  
And she knows she's mine and ain't lettin' go  
So this is love?  
Ooh, I need your love  
Baby, take me home  
So this is love?  
Ooh, I need your lovin'  
I know  
Got me on pins and needles  
Yes, she knows she's mine and ain't lettin' go  
So this is love?  
Ooh, I need your love  
So this is love?  
Ooh, I need your love  
Baby, got to have your love  
Ooh, I--ooh I need, got to have that love  
Baby, baby, still love  
So this is love?  
So this is love?
