Sittin' in a Hong Kong bar  
Sweet dreams of you darling  
Ah when we were sweet sixteen  
Mama makin' love in the belly of an old freight train  
Life was so simple and easy  
Oh the sun went down  
You took care of the children darlin'  
Then you felt like movin' away,  
Lord now you didn't stand and stare  
You felt like movin' and leavin' darlin'  
Didn't I treat you fair  
It's all right now darlin'  
It's alright now darlin'
