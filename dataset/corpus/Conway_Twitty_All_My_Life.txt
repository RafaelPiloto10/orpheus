Maybe it's the way you kiss me  
Or that twinkle in your eye  
Maybe it's the way you hold me  
And keep me satisfied  
Just as long as you love me  
I guess it doesn't matter why  
You're the one I've dreamed of  
All my life.  
  
Maybe it's the way I sometimes catch you  
With my reflection in your eyes  
Maybe it's the times I tease you  
And you laugh until you cry  
Just as long as you love me  
I guess it doesn't matter why  
You're the one I've dreamed of  
All my life.  
  
Maybe it's the way you kiss me  
Or that twinkle in your eye  
Maybe it's the way you hold me  
And keep me satisfied  
Just as long as you love me  
I guess it doesn't matter why  
You're the one I've dreamed of  
All my life.  
  
You're the one I've dreamed of  
All my life...
