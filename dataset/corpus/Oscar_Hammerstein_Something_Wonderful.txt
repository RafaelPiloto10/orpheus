This is a man who thinks with his heart,  
His heart is not always wise.  
This is a man who stumbles and falls,  
But this is a man who tries.  
  
This is a man you'll forgive and forgive,  
And help protect, as long as you live...  
He will not always say  
What you would have him say,  
But now and then he'll do  
Something  
Wonderful.  
  
He has a thousand dreams  
That won't come true,  
You know that he believes in them  
And that's enough for you.  
  
You'll always go along,  
Defend him when he's wrong  
And tell him, when he's strong  
He is  
Wonderful  
He'll always  
Needs your love  
And so he'll get your love.  
A man who needs your love  
Can be  
Wonderful.  
  
She'll always go along  
Defend him when he's wrong  
And tell him when he's strong  
He is wonderful.  
He'll always need her love  
And so he'll get her love  
A man who needs your love  
Can be wonderful.
