My baby lives in shades of blue  
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude  
He lives in California too  
He drives a chevy Malibu  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He lives for love, he loves his drugs  
He loves his baby too  
  
But I can't fix him, can't make him better  
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
My baby lives in shades of cool  
Blue heart and hands and aptitude  
He lives for love, for women, too  
I'm one of many, one is blue  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He prays for love, he prays for peace  
And maybe someone new  
  
But I can't help him, can't make him better  
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable
