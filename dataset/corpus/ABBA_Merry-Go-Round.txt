I have tried in vain never had success  
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess  
I have lost my only friend  
Now it seems I have to start again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Looking for someone  
Who would want to stay  
I might find her  
With a bit of luck one day  
  
But who knows  
So until then  
I can only try and try again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round
