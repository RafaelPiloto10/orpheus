We used to swim the same moonlight waters  
Oceans away from the wakeful day  
  
My fall will be for you  
My fall will be for you  
My love will be in you  
If you be the one to cut me  
I'll bleed forever  
  
Scent of the sea before waking afterwards  
Brings me to thee  
Into the blue memory  
  
My fall will be for you  
  
Into the blue memory  
  
A siren from the deep came to me  
Sang my name my longing  
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine  
Worth everything I may ever be  
  
The Child will be born again  
That siren carried him to me  
First of them true lovers  
Singing on the shoulders of an angel  
Without care for love n' loss  
  
Bring me home or leave me be  
My love in the dark heart of the night  
I have lost the path before me  
the one behind will lead me  
  
Take me  
Cure me  
Kill me  
Bring me home  
Every way  
Every day  
Just another loop in the hangman's noose  
  
Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home  
Every way, every day  
I keep on watching us sleep  
  
Relive the old sin of  
Adam and Eve  
Of you and me  
Forgive the adoring beast  
  
Redeem me into childhood  
Show me myself without the shell  
Like the advent of May  
I'll be there when you say  
Time to never hold our love  
  
My fall will be for you
