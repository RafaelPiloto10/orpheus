Our prayers have been answered  
I finally arrived  
The healing that had been delayed  
Is now realized  
No one's in a hurry  
There's no schedule to keep  
We're all enjoying Jesus  
Just sitting at His feet  
  
If you could see me now  
I'm walking streets of gold  
If you could see me now  
I'm standing tall and whole  
If you could see me now  
You'd know I've seen His face  
  
If you could see me now  
You'd know the pain's erased  
You wouldn't want me  
To ever leave this place  
If only you could see me now  
  
My light and temporary trials  
Have worked out for my good  
To know it brought Him glory  
When I misunderstood  
Though we've had our sorrows  
They can never compare  
To what Jesus has in store for us  
No language can share
