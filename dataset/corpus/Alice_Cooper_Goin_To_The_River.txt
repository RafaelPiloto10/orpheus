Well I'm goin' to the river, gonna jump off a boat and drown  
Yes, I'm goin' to the river, gonna jump off a boat and drown  
Because the gal I love, she's gone and left this town  
Well when she left me, I bowed my head and cried  
When she left me, I bowed my head and cried  
I Never thought I'd be, I'd be the one to cry  
  
So if you see my baby, tell her goodbye for me  
If you see my baby, tell her goodbye for me  
'Cause I'm tired of livin', baby livin' in misery  
That's why I'm goin' to the river, gonna jump off a boat and drown  
Yes, I'm goin' to the river, gonna jump off a boat and drown  
Because the gal I love, she's gone and left this town
