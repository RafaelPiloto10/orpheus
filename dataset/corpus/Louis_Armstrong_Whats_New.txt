What's new?  
How is the world treating you?  
You haven't changed a bit  
Lovely as ever I must admit  
  
Oh, what's new?  
How did that romance come through?  
We haven't met since then  
Gee, but it's nice to see you again  
  
What's new? Probably I'm boring you  
But seeing you is grand  
And you were sweet to offer your hand  
I understand, adieu  
  
Pardon my asking what's new  
Of course you couldn't know  
I haven't changed: I still love you so  
  
Oh, what's new? Probably I'm boring you  
But seeing you is grand  
And you were sweet to offer your hand  
Mama, I understand, adieu  
  
Pardon my asking what's new  
Of course you couldn't know  
I haven't changed: I still love you so
