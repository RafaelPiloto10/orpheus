Master!  
Apprentice!  
Heartborne, 7th Seeker  
Warrior!  
Disciple!  
In me the Wishmaster  
  
Elbereth  
Lorien  
  
A dreamy-eyed child staring into night  
On a journey to storyteller's mind  
Whispers a wish speaks with the stars the words are silent in him  
Distant sigh from a lonely heart  
"I'll be with you soon, my Shalafi"  
Grey Havens my destiny  
  
Master!...  
  
Silvara  
Starbreeze  
  
Sla-Mori the one known only by Him  
To august realms, the sorcery within  
If you hear the call of arcane lore,  
Your world shall rest on Earth no more  
A maiden elf calling with her cunning song  
"Meet me at the Inn of Last Home"  
Heartborne will find the way!  
  
Master!...  
  
Wishmaster  
Crusade for Your will  
A child, dreamfinder  
The Apprentice becoming...  
  
Master!...
