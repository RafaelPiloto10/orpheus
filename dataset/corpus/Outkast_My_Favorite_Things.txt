[Chorus: x2]  
Buy me diamonds and rubies  
I'm crazy 'bout Bentley's  
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses  
Wine me and dine me  
Bring those platinum rings  
Those are a few of our favorite things  
  
What i need is a gentleman  
Who does the best he can  
There to hold my hand  
I want you to understand  
Of course i want diamonds and expensive things  
Cause a girl's gotta have her favorite things  
  
Oh, that's what you like nice type of life  
Platinum at night flat diamond light  
Well that's so bright  
You looking right ass kinda tight  
Don't spend the night  
Roll with the g, oh we could be right you and me  
Like fantasy I'll make you real  
So what the deal  
Girl tell Randy just how u feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I would like a man who would  
Take care of business  
And still have the time to  
Take me on a shopping spree  
What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine.  
With what we have lets put it together and we can shine  
  
I know what you want  
And i got what you need  
I believe you should be rolling with me  
I take you around, out on the town  
And show you the way that a boy liquors down  
Whenever you're ready girl we can go now  
And we can do things you don't even know how  
I know that you know that i'm feeling your style  
So tell me what you do just to make you go wow uh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me tell you what di's is all about  
Simplicity easy to please but i like expensive things  
For me you can buy diamonds and pearls  
Just some of the little things i like in my world  
  
So you like wining and dining and shining  
Gliding the riding pushing them hot wicks  
Wanna come get with a real pimp  
There lots of flaws stuck on it  
I'll make you a shopohollic  
Buying you stuff until you vomit  
Blowing credit copper on ya  
Even if ya didn't want it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What do ya want?
