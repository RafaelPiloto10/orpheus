Don't care where you come from  
As long as you're a black man  
You're an African  
  
No mind your nationality  
You have got the identity of an African  
  
'Cause if you come from Clarendon  
And if you come from Portland  
And if you come from Westmoreland  
You're an African  
  
[Chorus]  
No mind your nationality  
You've got the identity of an African  
  
'Cause if you come Trinidad  
And if you come from Nassau  
And if you come from Cuba  
You're an African  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No mind your complexion  
There is no rejection  
You're an African  
  
'Cause if your plexion  
High  
High  
High  
If your complexion low, low, low  
And if your plexion in between  
You're an African  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No mind denomination  
That is only segregation  
You're an African  
  
'Cause if you go to the Catholic  
And if you go to the Methodist  
And if you go to the Church of Gods  
You're an African  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No mind your nationality  
You have got the identity of an African  
  
'Cause if you come from Brixton  
And if you come from Weesday  
And if you come from Wingstead  
And if you come from France  
Brooklyn  
Queens  
Manhattan  
Canada  
Miami  
Switzerland  
Germany  
Russia  
Taiwan
