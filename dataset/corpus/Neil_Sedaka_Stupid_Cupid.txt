My fine feathered friend with your cute little pranks,  
I would like to express my thanks,  
I trusted you implicitly,  
But what a double-crosser you turned out to be.  
Stupid Cupid you're a real mean guy,  
I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly,  
I'm in love and it's a crying shame,  
And I know that you're the one to blame.  
Hey hey, set me free.  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me.  
I can't do my homework and I can't think straight,  
I meet her every morning 'bout half past eight,  
I'm acting like a lovesick fool,  
You've even got me carrying your books to school.  
Hey hey, set me free.  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me.  
You messed me up for good right from the very start,  
Hey now, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart.  
You got me jumping like a crazy clown,  
And I don't feature what you're putting down,  
Well since I kissed her loving lips of wine,  
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine.  
Hey hey, set me free.  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me.
