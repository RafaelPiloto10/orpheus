Wonder if you belong, think you've got it down  
Does it still feel the same, now that he's not around  
Born to lose, Born to lose, make your mind up no fooling round  
Now that I know, I could never be, I would never be the only one.  
Wonder how it all began, as if that mattered anyway  
There's someone else you're always wanting, every single day  
Born to lose, born to lose, make your mind up no fooling round,  
Now that I know, I could never be, I would never be the only one.  
  
Born to lose, Born to lose, make your mind up no fooling 'round  
Now that I know, I could never be, I would never be the only one.
