Saturday sun came early one morning  
In a sky so clear and blue  
Saturday sun came without warning  
So no-one knew what to do  
Saturday sun brought people and faces  
That didn't seem much in their day  
But when I remembered those people and places  
They were really too good in their way  
In their way  
In their way  
Saturday sun won't come and see me today  
  
Think about stories with reason and rhyme  
Circling through your brain  
And think about people in their season and time  
Returning again and again  
And again  
And again  
but Saturday sun has turned to Sunday's rain
