Everybody has the right to be wrong, at least once  
Everybody has the right to be dunce-like, once-like  
Not being too smart is, is no disgrace  
What sets you apart is smilin' with egg on your face  
  
It's naive to make believe that you're right, it's not bright  
Only fools go walking on thin ice, twice  
  
You and life can skip the strife and you'll both get along  
All it takes is simply saying, you're wrong when you're wrong  
And everybody has the right to be wrong  
  
You and life can skip the strife and you'll both get along  
All it takes is simply sayin', you're wrong when you're wrong  
And everybody has the right to be  
  
It can be a real delight to be  
And I'd fight, fight for the right to be wrong, at least once
