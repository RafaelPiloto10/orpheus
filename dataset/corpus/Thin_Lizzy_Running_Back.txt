I'm a fool now that it's over  
Can you guess my name?  
I make my money singing songs about you  
It's my claim to fame  
  
When they say it's over  
It's not all over, there's still the pain  
  
I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
Oh I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
  
If I said I was sorry  
Would you still leave me?  
I never thought you'd go 'till you did  
Believe me  
  
When they say it's over  
It's not all over completely  
  
'Cause I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
Yes I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
  
I miss that girl  
  
The show is over  
And we must all go home  
Just leave me by myself  
I'll be alright here on my own  
  
If it's all over, it's all over  
And I'm all alone  
  
And I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
Don't you know I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again
