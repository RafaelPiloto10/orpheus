Well, I'm a huboon baby  
I'm a cross between a human and an ape  
I'm all decked out  
I'm gonna hoot, I'm gonna root, I'm gonna rape  
  
People look at me and laugh and make fun of my face  
I laugh right back  
I don't want to be part of the human race  
I did it to myself  
Now somebody's gonna be sorry  
  
Well, I'm a huboon baby  
Gonna mess around with all you fools  
I'm all pumped up, gonna romp, bone and stomp  
I'm gonna rule  
  
I had the operation  
Nothing else left to do  
Well lookit here, I've been hurt  
Gonna hurt you  
  
Now, somebody's gonna be sorry  
Like all you wankers and you slime  
And you right-wing pinheads  
Who make screwing a big crime  
You titty-twisted up my life  
And pissed on all my dreams  
You made me hate myself  
Now come on shoot me  
Set me free  
  
I did it to myself  
Now somebody's gonna be sorry  
  
Well, I'm a huboon baby  
I'll grow up to be the president  
I'm upside-in, I'm really tweaked  
I'm really freaked, I'm really bent  
Big town mommas better hurry  
Hide your little girls  
I'll jump their bones  
I'll sniff 'em out 'round the world
