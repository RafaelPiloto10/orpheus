Treasures in the jars of clay  
Let the light shine out of darkness  
Fallen down but not destroyed  
It's just another trial by fire  
  
In my song I'll send a prayer  
Do you know me, do you hear me  
Where the will to face this shame  
It's just another trial by fire  
  
Hello Mr. Moon  
Can I have some time with you  
Trouble keep me runnin'  
You can see it comin'  
I know who shines down on you  
  
Hello Mr. Moon  
I've come back to talk to you  
All my life I'm runnin'  
From the love that's comin'  
Saving grace please pull me through  
  
In my doubt I can't believe  
Like a wave tossed where the wind blows  
Tears of faith temper my soul  
Just another trial by fire  
Just another trial by fire
