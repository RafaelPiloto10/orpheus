Been thinking 'bout you all night  
Guess you got me in a spell  
But I think that I'l be all right  
Even if I don't get well  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms  
  
I can still remember  
What you told me with your eyes  
One kiss, now it's down to this  
Guess it's time you realized  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms  
  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms  
  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms
