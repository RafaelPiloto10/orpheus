And another one bites the dust  
But why can I not conquer love?  
And I might've got to be with one  
Why not fight this war without weapons?  
And I want it and I wanted it bad  
But there were so many red flags  
Now another one bites the dust  
And let's be clear, I trust no one  
  
You did not break me  
I'm still fighting for peace  
  
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you won't see me move no more  
Cause I've got an elastic heart  
I've got an elastic heart  
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart  
  
And I will stay up through the night  
Let's be clear, I won't close my eyes  
And I know that I can survive  
I walked through fire to save my life  
And I want it, I want my life so bad  
And I'm doing everything I can  
Then another one bites the dust  
It's hard to lose a chosen one  
  
You did not break me (You did not break me, no, no)  
I'm still fighting for peace  
  
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you won't see me move no more  
Cause I've got an elastic heart  
  
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart  
But your blade it might be too sharp  
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard  
But I may snap when I move close  
But you won't see me move no more  
Cause I've got an elastic heart  
  
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart

I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard

But you won't see me move no more  
Cause I've got an elastic heart
