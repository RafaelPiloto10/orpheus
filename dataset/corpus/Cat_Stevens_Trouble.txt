Trouble  
Oh trouble set me free  
I have seen your face  
And it's too much too much for me  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble can't you see  
You're eating my heart away  
And there's nothing much left of me  
  
I've drunk your wine  
You have made your world mine  
So won't you be fair  
So won't you be fair  
  
I don't want no more of you  
So won't you be kind to me  
Just let me go where  
I'll have to go there  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble move away  
I have seen your face  
And it's too much for me today  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble can't you see  
You have made me a wreck  
Now won't you leave me in my misery  
  
I've seen your eyes  
And I can see death's disguise  
Hangin' on me  
Hangin' on me  
  
I'm beat, I'm torn  
Shattered and tossed and worn  
Too shocking to see  
Too shocking to see  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble move from me  
I have paid my debt  
Now won't you leave me in my misery  
  
Trouble  
Oh trouble please be kind  
I don't want no fight  
And I haven't got a lot of time
