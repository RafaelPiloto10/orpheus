It's just another simple voice mail message  
I'll pick you up and we'll do dinner by the fire  
And we'll watch it snow  
It's from a year ago  
Baby I love you and I can't wait to see you tonight  
I've been thinking 'bout you all day long  
She pushes nine to save  
She still can't erase  
  
'Cause it makes her feel close  
Makes her smile it's like he's with her almost  
Till the tears take over she's still in hell  
But she tells herself she's ready to let him go  
Cause that makes her feel close  
  
It's just a worn out Notre Dame t-shirt  
She's gotten mad and tried to throw  
That thing away at least a hundred times  
But she's got it on tonight  
He used to wear it on the weekend just running around  
Probably he forgot he even left it behind  
She says it keeps her warm  
Oh, but it's so much more  
  
It makes her feel close  
Makes her smile it's like he's with her almost  
Till the tears take over  
She's still in hell  
But she tells herself  
She's ready to let him go  
Cause that makes her feel close  
  
Just sayin' goodbye  
Getting on with her life  
Maybe give love another try  
One more try  
One more try  
  
It makes her feel close  
Makes her smile it's like he's with her almost  
Till the tears take over  
She's still in hell  
But she tells herself  
She's ready to let him go  
'Cause that makes her feel close
