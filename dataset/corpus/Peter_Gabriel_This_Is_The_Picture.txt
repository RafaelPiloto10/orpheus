Excellent birds  
  
Flying birds  
Excellent birds  
Watch them fly, there they go  
Falling snow  
Excellent snow  
Here it comes. Watch it fall  
  
Long words  
Excellent words  
I can hear them now  
  
This is the picture, this is the picture  
This is the picture, this is the picture  
  
I'm sitting by the window  
Watching the snow fall  
I'm looking out  
And I'm moving, turning in time  
Catching up. Moving in  
Jump up! I can land on my feet. Look out!  
  
This is the picture, this is the picture  
This is the picture, this is the picture  
  
Looking out. Watching out  
When I see the future I close my eyes  
I can see it now  
  
I see pictures of people, rising up  
Pictures of people, falling down  
I see pictures of people  
They're standing on their heads, they're ready  
They're looking out, look out!  
They're watching out, watch out!  
They're looking out, look out!  
They're watching out, watch out!  
  
I see pictures of people  
I see pictures of people
