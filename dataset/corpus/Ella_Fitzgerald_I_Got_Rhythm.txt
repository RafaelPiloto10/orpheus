Days can be sunny with never a sigh  
Don't need what money can buy  
Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs  
Why shouldn't we sing along?  
I'm chipper all the day  
Happy with my life  
How do I get that way?  
Look at what I've got:  
  
I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
I've got daisies in green pastures  
I've got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Old man trouble I don't mind him  
You won't find him 'round my door  
I've got starlight  
I've got sweet dreams  
I've got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Old man trouble, I don't mind him  
You won't find him 'round my door  
I've got starlight  
I've got sweet dreams  
I've got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Oh, I've got rhythm  
I've got music  
I've got daisies in green pastures  
I've got starlight  
I've got sweet dreams  
I've got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
I've got rhythm, I've got rhythm
