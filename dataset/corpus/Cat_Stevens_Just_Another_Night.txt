I remember standing here  
Right on this very same site  
I was dying but for you  
It was just another night  
You once rocked me in your world  
You bought me my first shoes  
I was just another lonely child  
Oh and you were much amused  
  
So you took me and you dressed me well  
All for your friends to see  
Drained my body calmly till  
There was no more left in me  
Then you walked out and you cut me cold  
Out on the road somewhere  
Why it happened well I don't know  
And I still have no idea  
  
But everybody needs a friend sometimes  
You need a little help  
And who knows maybe one day you'll seek mine  
Only time will tell  
You once held me in your arms  
You made me feel so right  
I was flying but for you  
It was just another night  
  
But everybody needs a little help  
Whether or not you think you really do  
Everybody needs a little help  
Now the time has come for you  
  
I ain't looking to fight no wars  
No more talking trash  
I'm not seeking any more pain  
Cause I've had enough of that  
But don't you worry it's alright  
If you should come around  
Any night or any day  
I won't ever let you down
