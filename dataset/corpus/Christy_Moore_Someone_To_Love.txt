I wish I had someone to love me,  
Someone to call me his own,  
Someone to sleep with me nightly,  
I weary of sleeping alone.  
Meet me tonight in the moonlight,  
Meet me tonight all alone,  
I have a sad story to tell you  
I'm telling it under the moon.  
Tonight is our last night together,  
Nearest and dearest must part,  
The love that has bound us together  
Is shredded and torn apart.  
I wish I had ships on the ocean  
Lined with silver and gold  
Follow the ship that he sails in  
A lad of 19 years-old.  
I wish I had wings of a swallow,  
Fly out over the sea  
Fly to the arms of my true love  
And bring him home safely to me.
