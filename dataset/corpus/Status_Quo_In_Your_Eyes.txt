Doesn't she look so well  
With her long black hair and (?) she can tell  
Doesn't she know so well  
She can cast a spell with that look of heaven  
In her eyes, in her eyes  
In your eyes, your eyes  
  
Now I can't get to sleep  
I dream and dream all the day through  
Doesn't seem to matter though  
Doesn't seem to worry me  
I can't get to sleep  
I dream and dream, honest I do  
Honest I do, dream of you  
  
Couldn't we be away  
On a different day could be so unusual  
Couldn't we try to be  
What the others say, what they think they see there  
In your eyes, in your eyes  
In your eyes, your eyes  
  
Now I have been a fool  
I've been in love, haven't we all  
Everybody does it though  
Every time we keep going back again  
I've made that mistake  
I dream and dream honest I do  
Honest I do dream of you  
  
Wouldn't it feel the same  
Is it just a game that we play from time to time  
Wouldn't I feel so good  
If I understood what I see is written there  
In your eyes, in your eyes  
In your eyes, your eyes  
  
Now when towards the end  
I'm feeling blue and everything's wrong  
Doesn't matter at the time  
Doesn't matter this time anyway  
I can't get to sleep  
I dream and dream, honest I do  
Honest I do dream, oh I can't get to sleep  
I dream and dream, honest I do  
Honest I do dream of you
