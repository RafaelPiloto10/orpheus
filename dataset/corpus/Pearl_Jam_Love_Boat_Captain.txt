Is this just another day, this God forgotten place?  
First comes love, then comes pain. Let the games begin,  
Questions rise and answers fall, insurmountable.  
  
Love boat captain  
Take the reigns and steer us towards the clear, here.  
It's already been sung, but it can't be said enough.  
All you need is love  
  
Is this just another phase? earthquakes making waves,  
Trying to shake the cancer off? stupid human beings,  
Once you hold the hand of love, it's all surmountable.  
  
Hold me, and make it the truth,  
That when all is lost there will be you,  
Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing  
And there's just one word I still believe  
And it's  
  
It's an art to live with pain, mix the light into grey,  
Lost nine friends we'll never know, two years ago today  
And if our lives became too long, would it add to our regret?  
  
And the young, they can lose hope cause they can't see beyond today,  
The wisdom that the old can't give away  
Hey,  
Constant recoil  
Sometimes life  
Don't leave you alone.  
  
Hold me, and make it the truth,  
That when all is lost there will be you.  
Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing  
And there's just one word that I still believe and it's  
Love, love. Love. Love. Love.  
  
Love boat captain  
Take the reigns, steer us towards the clear.  
I know it's already been sung, can't be said enough.  
Love is all you need, all you need is love,  
Love, love,  
Love.
