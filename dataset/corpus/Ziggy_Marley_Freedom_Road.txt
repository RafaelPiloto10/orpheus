That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,  
Marching down freedom's road.  
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me,  
From marching down freedom's road.  
  
Hand me my gun, let the bugle blow loud,  
I'm on my way with my head a-proud,  
One objective I've got in view,  
Is to keep a hold of freedom for me and you  
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,  
Marching down freedom's road.  
  
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me,  
From marching down freedom's road.  
  
Ought to be plain as the nose on your face,  
There's room in this plan for every race,  
Some folk think that freedom just ain't right,  
Those are the very people I want to fight.  
  
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,  
Marching down freedom's road.  
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me,  
From marching down freedom's road.  
  
Now, Hitler may rant, Hirohito may rave,  
I'm going after freedom if it leads me to my grave.  
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,  
I'm marching down freedom's road.  
  
United we stand, divided we fall,  
Let's make this land safe for one and all.  
I've got a message, and you know it's right,  
Black and white together unite and fight.  
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,  
Marching down freedom's road.  
  
Ain't no fascists gonna stop me, no Nazis gonna keep me,  
From marching down freedom's road
