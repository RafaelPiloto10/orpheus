Supermarket flashbacks  
Show arms and legs in plastic sacks  
Fat men twelve bananas high  
Die while all the women cry  
Love-love gets sucked away  
On big fat lips while people pray  
Boy plus girl make mess out of sex  
No babies come  
What happens next  
De-evolution self-execution no-solution  
I'm a potato and I'm so hip  
Teenage hoodlums stand in line  
Donate blood to pay for crime  
Butchers steal doctor's tools  
Sow pretty heads on dogs and mules  
Hi-fi systems men in pairs  
Tape bodies falling down the stairs  
Father-son teams split the cost of nighttime girls but all is lost  
To de-evolution self-execution  
No-solution  
I'm a spudman I got eyes all around  
Martian feet turn dirt and stone  
For buried treasure human bone  
Madison men tattoo ads on  
Ten year olds with sucker pads  
Rockets rust attack decay things  
Fall apart while spacemen play  
Now daddy zero drops his brown  
Godowngodowngodown  
To de-evolution self-execution  
No-solution  
I'm a spudgun I'd like to shoot'em all!!
