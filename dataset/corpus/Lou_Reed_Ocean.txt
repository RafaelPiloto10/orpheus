Here comes the ocean  
and the waves down by the sea  
Here comes the ocean  
and the waves where've they been ?  
  
Don't swim tonight my love  
The sea is mad my love  
It's known to drive men crazy  
Now come that murder seeks  
The castle is dead and reeks  
The madness can make you lazy  
  
Here come the waves  
down by the shore  
Washing the rocks that have been here  
centuries or more  
  
Down by the sea  
  
Here come the ocean  
and the waves down by the sea  
Here comes the ocean  
and the waves where've they been ?  
  
Castles glowing at night  
Towers above out fright  
What did happen here  
Now comes it in my head  
I serve you bread on a pledge  
Think of your mouth for dinner  
  
But here come the waves  
down by the sea  
Washing the eyes of the men  
who have died  
  
Down by the sea  
  
Here come the waves  
Here come the waves  
Here come the waves  
Here come the waves
