It took five women to getcha off of my mind  
It took five months, a plenty good wasted time  
But it just took five minutes when I saw your face again  
To fall in love all over, I guess with you I'll never win  
  
March was a cold one in more ways than one  
Went down to the nightclub lookin' for the sun  
Lookin' for a light that could brighten up a day  
That's been darker than a hole since you went away  
  
April usually brings showers  
This time it was a hurtin' kind  
This woman said she wanted my baby  
I told her I'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind  
To fall in love with someone that I barely knew  
The baby would never really have a father  
Cause I still, 'cause I still, 'cause I still, still, still, huh  
Be stuck on you  
  
It took five women to getcha off of my mind  
Get off my mind, baby  
Fallin' in love all over...you I'll never win  
  
May was her name, she was jumpin'  
Jumpin' from plane to plane  
Actress or model or somethin'  
Can't even remember her first name  
  
June brought an Easter bunny  
Needless to say, hmph, that girl was late  
Told a made-up story to a busy-body of our only date  
What a sketch!  
  
July was a heartbreak, extraordinary  
Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary  
It felt so much, so much like yours  
But it only made me, made me want you more  
She's gone, she's gone but you're still here  
I want you very...huh, it's you I fear  
  
But it took five women to get you off my mind  
It took five months, five months, a plenty good wasted time  
But it just took five minutes and I saw your face again  
I fell in love all over with you, I guess I'll never win  
(I'll never win)
