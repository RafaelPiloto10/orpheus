[Chorus:]  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
  
[Verse:]  
It's like spending time with you  
Just doing absolutely nothing  
That makes me happy  
When you're at work putting on your  
T-shirt and I love it, absolutely love it  
  
[Hook:]  
It's the smile of a child  
It's your eyes, it's your hair  
It's the touch of your skin,  
That's what gets me there  
It's also enticing  
Waking up from a nice dream  
To a beautiful morning with you by my side  
That's nice  
[Chorus:]  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
  
[Verse 2:]  
It's like walking through the sprinklers  
Smelling every flower one by one  
Mmm, yeah, makes me happy, yeah  
It's like telling me you love me, showing me you love me baby, my pretty baby  
  
[Hook:]  
It's the smile of a child  
It's your eyes, it's your hair  
It's the touch of your skin,  
That's what gets me there  
It's also enticing  
Waking up from a nice dream  
To a beautiful morning with you by my side  
That's nice  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
  
[Verse 3:]  
It's like Saturday, ohh, four day weekend, ohh, Hiding and seeking with you  
Like we do, it's beautiful  
  
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohhhhh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy
