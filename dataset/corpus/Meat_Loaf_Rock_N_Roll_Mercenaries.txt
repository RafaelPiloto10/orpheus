(Talking, talking, wealth, talking, money, talking, power  
Talking, horses, talking, fun, talking, self, talking, power  
Talking, diamonds, talking, ego, talking, man, talking, wealth)  
(And talking, power)  
(And talking, power)  
  
Money is power, power is fame  
  
[Chorus]  
Talking about rock 'n' roll mercenaries  
Soldiers of fortune by some other name  
I'm talking about rock 'n' roll mercenaries  
Money is power, 'n' power is fame  
  
Everything you pay to hear, just listen  
Everything to catch your ear, just listen  
Whatever it takes, they're ready to sell  
Anything and everything they do it themselves  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Young are the victims so easily (swayed, slain)  
(As some given are poisoned, all continuous placed)  
Our conscience is a load, so heavy to carry, for a rock 'n' roll mercenary  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It starts with a game, see how they play  
Till all of the laughter is faded away  
It's not for the song, it's not for the love  
It's just for the gold and there's never enough, never enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's not for the song, it's not for the love  
It's just for the gold, there's never enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Rock 'n' roll mercenaries)  
  
(Talking, talking)  
(Talking, talking)  
(Talking, talking)  
(Talking, talking)  
  
Rock 'n' roll mercenaries, ooh, talkin' about  
Rock 'n' roll mercenaries,
