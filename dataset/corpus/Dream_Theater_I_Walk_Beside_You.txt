There's a story in your eyes  
I can see the hurt behind your smile  
For every sign I recognize  
Another one escapes me  
  
Let me know what plagues your mind  
Let me be the one to know you best  
Be the one to hold you up  
When you feel like you're sinking  
  
Tell me once again  
What's beneath the pain you're feeling  
Don't abandon me  
Or think you can't be saved  
  
I walk beside you  
Wherever you are  
Whatever it takes  
No matter how far  
Through all that may come  
And all that may go  
I walk beside you  
I walk beside you  
  
Summon up your ghost for me  
Rest your tired thoughts upon my hands  
Step inside this sacred place  
When all your dreams seem broken  
  
Resonate inside this temple  
Let me be the one who understands  
Be the one to carry you  
When you can walk no further  
  
Tell me once again  
What's below the surface bleeding  
If you've lost your way  
I will take you in  
  
I walk beside you  
Wherever you are  
Whatever it takes  
No matter how far  
Through all that may come  
And all that may go  
I walk beside you  
I walk beside you  
  
Oh, when everything is wrong  
Oh, when hopelessness surrounds you  
Oh, the sun will rise again  
The time you swim against will carry you back home  
So don't give up  
Don't give in  
  
I walk beside you  
Wherever you are  
Whatever it takes  
No matter how far  
Through all that may come  
And all that may go  
I walk beside you  
I walk beside you
