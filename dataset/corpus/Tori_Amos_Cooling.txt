Maybe I didn't like to hear  
But I still can't believe Speed Racer is dead  
So then I thought I'd make some plans  
But fire thought she'd really rather be water instead  
  
And Peggy got a message for me  
From Jesus  
And I've heard every word that you have said  
And I know I have been driven like the snow  
  
This is cooling  
Faster than I can  
This is cooling  
Faster than I can  
  
But do I hate what she is  
But do I want to be her  
And don't we love something fresh  
Anything new, virgin  
  
Woman you got too many brambles  
Hiding under these bushes  
Woman you got too many brambles  
But I always liked a good storm  
I'm always good for a storm  
  
So then love walked up to like  
And said I know that you don't like me much  
Let's go for a ride  
This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple tree  
  
And is your place in heaven  
Worth giving up these kisses  
These, these kisses  
  
And Peggy got a message for me  
From Jesus  
And I've heard every word that you have said  
And I know I have been driven like the snow, but  
  
This is cooling  
Faster than I can  
Hey yes, faster than I can  
Hey, this is cooling  
This is cooling
