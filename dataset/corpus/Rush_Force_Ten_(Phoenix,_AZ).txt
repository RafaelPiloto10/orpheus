City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Greeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be christmas day  
Strings of street lights, even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids hunch  
This is santa's big scene  
And above all the bustle you hear  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be christmas day
