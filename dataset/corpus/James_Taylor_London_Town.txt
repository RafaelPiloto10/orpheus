I do believe, I must believe,  
I think I can begin again.  
Become again the man I was back when.  
So I'm walking on your streets again,  
Feeling now as I did then,  
I've since become a different man.  
London Town, turn be around, London Town,  
Carry me back, oh, London Town,  
Lost and found, and I feel like going back  
  
I can remember lots of time and space,  
If I lose the name,  
Still I know the faces.  
Time as come and left its traces.  
London Town, turn be around, London Town,  
Carry me back, oh, London Town,  
Lost and found, and I feel like going back.  
  
When I grew too old and dull to rock 'n roll,  
Like to hold on tight to you, darling.  
And when my fires have all burned out,  
I'd like to think I can still think about  
The things I used to sing about  
When I was spending all my time alone.  
By myself and on my own,  
Seldom seen and quite unknown.  
London Town, turn be around, London Town,  
Carry me back, oh, London Town,  
Lost and found, and I feel like going back.  
Yes, I feel like going back.
