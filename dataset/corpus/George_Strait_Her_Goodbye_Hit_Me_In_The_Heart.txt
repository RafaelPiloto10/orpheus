There's never been a man  
who could bring me down  
I've walked away from the toughest of towns  
But her last words tore me apart  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Brought me to knees like a shot from the dark  
Her sweet love found its mark  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
  
Her soft warm touch took me by surprise  
I was blinded by the love in my eyes  
The moment she left I felt the pain start  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Brought me to my knees  
like a shot from the dark  
Her sweet love found its mark  
Her good bye hit me in the heart
