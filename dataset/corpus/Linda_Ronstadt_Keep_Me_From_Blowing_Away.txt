Well I spent my whole lifetime  
In a world where the sunshine  
Finds excuses for not hangin' 'round  
I squandered emotions  
On the slightest of notions  
And the first easy loving I found  
But soon all the good times  
The gay times and play times  
Like colors run together and fade  
Oh Lord if you hear me  
Touch me and hold me  
And keep me from blowing away  
  
There's times when I trembled  
When my mind remembered  
The days that just crumbled away  
With nothing to show  
But these lines that I know  
Are beginning to show in my face  
  
Oh Lord if you're listening  
I know I'm no Christian  
And I ain't got much coming to me  
So send down some sunshine  
Throw out your lifeline  
And keep me from blowing away  
  
Oh Lord if you hear me  
Touch me and hold me  
And keep me from blowing away
