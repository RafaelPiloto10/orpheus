Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
Santa's on his way he's filled his sleigh with things  
Things for you and for me  
  
It's that time of year when the world falls in love  
Every song you hear seems to say  
"Merry Christmas, may your new year dreams come true"  
And this song of mine in three quarter time  
Wishing you and yours the same thing too  
  
Happy holidays there is snow in the air  
Silver bells and sleighs everywhere  
People that you meet on any street will smile  
It's the season to care  
  
There are songs to sing every family?s a choir  
Toys to wrap and bring to the tree  
Your own wishing star is not so far from view  
Wish a wish or two and I promise you  
Christmas wishes can and do come true
