Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'  
Into the future  
  
I want to fly like an eagle  
To the sea  
Fly like an eagle  
Let my spirit carry me  
I want to fly like an eagle  
Till I'm free  
Oh, Lord, through the revolution  
  
Feed the babies  
Who don't have enough to eat  
Shoe the children  
With no shoes on their feet  
House the people  
Livin' in the street  
Oh, oh, there's a solution  
  
I want to fly like an eagle  
To the sea  
Fly like an eagle  
Let my spirit carry me  
I want to fly like an eagle  
Till I'm free  
Fly through the revolution  
  
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'  
Into the future  
  
I want to fly like an eagle  
To the sea  
Fly like an eagle  
Let my spirit carry me  
I want to fly like an eagle  
Till I'm free  
Fly through the revolution  
  
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'  
Into the future  
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'  
Into the future
