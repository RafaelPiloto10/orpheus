You're always too busy  
Why don't you go with me  
Don't act like you don't hear me  
Neglected  
You're guilty  
He noticed no one was with me  
I started getting so friendly  
He told me I was so pretty  
I flirted  
I'm guilty  
  
I have no reason to lie  
I told you a thousand times  
I needed you by my side, but you were nowhere to be found  
But you pushed your luck  
Now it's all messed up  
But you went too far when you broke my heart and I found my guy  
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs  
Then I guess that makes me guilty  
  
Guilty x6  
  
Stop wondering a thing but  
I want you so bad it's danger  
It's true and nobody's angel  
Convict me  
Guilty  
You ain't no...  
So good for...  
It's not like I did it on purpose  
The verdict is nothing  
He needs me  
Guilty

Ain't nothing more
