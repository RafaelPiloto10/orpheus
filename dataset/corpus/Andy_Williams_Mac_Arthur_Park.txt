Spring was never waiting for us, girl  
It ran one step ahead  
As we followed in the dance  
Between the parted pages and were pressed  
In love's hot fevered iron  
Like a striped pair of pants  
  
I recall the yellow cotton dress  
It was foaming like a wave  
On the ground around your knees  
The birds, like tender babies in your hands  
And the old men playing  
Checkers by the trees  
  
MacArthur Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet green icing flowing down  
Oh, someone left the cake out in the rain  
And I don't think that I can take it  
Cause it took so long to bake it  
And I'll never have that recipe again  
Oh, no, oh no  
  
There will be another song for me  
For I will sing it  
There will be another dream for me  
Oh, someone will bring it  
  
I will drink the wine while it is warm  
And never let you catch me looking at the sun  
And after all the loves of my life  
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one  
Little girl  
  
I will take my life into my hands, I will use it  
I will win the worship in their eyes oh and I will lose it  
I will have the things that I desire  
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky  
  
And after all the loves of my life  
After all the loves of my life  
I'll be thinking of you  
And wondering why  
  
MacArthur Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet, green icing flowing down  
Oh, someone left the cake out in the rain  
And I don't think that I can take it  
Cause it took so long to bake it  
And I'll never have that recipe again  
Oh no, oh no, no
