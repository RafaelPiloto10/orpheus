Well I've gont to stop livin' the way I do  
And give my heart back to you  
All those nights away from home  
Caused my lonely heart to roam  
Now I've got start livin' the way I do  
  
I've spent a lifetime hurting you  
And I expect someday you'll say we're through  
It ain't two late for me to change  
So please dono't write our final page  
Still I've got to stop livin' the way I do  
  
I've gone from honeymoons to heartaches  
From faithful love to a fool  
From hangin' out in honkey tonks  
With any girl but you  
  
Well I've got to stop livin' the way I do  
And give my heart back to you  
All those nights away from home  
Caused my lonely heart to roam  
Now I've got to stop livin' the way I do  
  
I've said all that I can say  
But you turned and walked away  
It's too late to stop livin' the way I do
