I'm looking for a religious girl  
With child-bearing hips and a wedding veil  
But i'm saddened to report sir, it's not easy  
This town is full of those cynical girls  
Walking two steps behind forty-five-year-olds  
I can't bear to hear those church bells ring again  
So driver can't you drive me a little more slowly  
I've gotta go  
Can't you find me some george jones on your radio  
I've gotta go, can't say no, to the church
