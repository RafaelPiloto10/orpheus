[Verse:]  
To Who was and is to come  
To the One Who sits on the throne  
To the One Who has freed us from sin by His blood  
To the Alpha and Omega  
To the King of every King  
To the definition of love I will sing  
  
Ooh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
(Be all) Glory honor and power  
  
[Chorus:]  
Praise His Name  
  
[Verse 2:]  
To the holy Lamb of God  
To the great I am  
To the One Who has stretched out His arms to save every man  
To the One Who deserves the praise  
To the One Who knows our ways  
To the Truth, the Way, and the Life  
I will say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ooh  
  
[Ending]  
To Who was and is to come  
To the One Who sits on the throne  
To the Truth, the Way, and the Life  
I will say
