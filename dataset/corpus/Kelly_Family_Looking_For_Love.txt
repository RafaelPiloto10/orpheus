Looking for love, but you just don't seem to give it. I'm the one who mostly
need it... Pushing me around... (I'm so hungry for your love!)  
When you come around, you pretend that you don't see me. Do you know that I do
need you, keeping me away? (I'm so hungry for your love!)  
  
You need chance in the shadows that you leave. I'm so afraid! You don't seem
to gave!  
  
I was looking for love, but you just don't seem to give it. Is anybody there
who give it? Someone help me out! (I'm so hungry for your love!)  
  
Won't let go off your soul, won't let go off yourself! Won't let go off your
soul, won't let go off yourself!  
  
With the help in love we can follow. There's a need in the dark. With the help
in love we can follow. There's a need in the dark.  
  
Won't let go off your soul, won't let go off yourself! Won't let go off your
soul, won't let go off yourself!  
  
I'm so hungry for your love!
