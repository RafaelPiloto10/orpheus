Just like a ship sailing out, on a mornin' tide  
Sailing far away out to sea and the sea is very wide  
You walked away where there's lots of room to hide  
Out into the world and the world is very wide  
But one day, (baby, one day), baby, one day  
  
[Chorus: ]  
I will come to you if it takes everyday left in my life  
I will come to you for there must be someone in my life  
No matter where you are  
I'll find you near or far  
Or I will never love 'til I can love with you  
And I won't really live  
For life without you is like dying  
  
Don't know where you are  
And I don't know if you think of me  
But where you are  
Is the only place I want to be  
Lost in a world of nothing much to do  
That's how I am ever since losing you  
But one day, (baby, one day), oh, baby, one day  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
(I will come to you, ooh, ooh)  
There must be someone in my life  
(I will come to you, ooh, ooh)  
(I will come to you, ooh, ooh)  
Oh baby, there must be someone in my life, baby  
(I will come to you, ooh, ooh)  
Oh, everyday left in my life
