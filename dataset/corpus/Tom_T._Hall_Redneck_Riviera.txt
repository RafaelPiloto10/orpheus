Down here on the Redneck Riviera a drinkin' beer and singing country songs  
Chillin' with the motel door wide open hopin' somethin' good will come along  
Gulf Shores up through Apalachi-cola they got beaches of the whitest sand  
Nobody cares if gramma's got a tottoo or Bubba's got a hot wing in his hand  
Redneck Riviera is where I want to be down here on the Redneck Riviera by the
sea  
Down here on the Redneck Riviera trawlin' up and down Mir-a-cle Mile  
Smoothin' out my tan and disposition and wearin' little other than a smile  
[ trumpet - guitar ]  
On Highway 98 I got a ticket something I ain't never understood  
If driving a convertible is topless why can't I ride my Harley in the nude  
Down here on the Redneck Riviera sign says Smoking Mullet Here Today  
I really don't know what I'm gettin' into but I'm in line to try some anyway  
Redneck Riviera is where I want to be down here on the Redneck Riviera by the
sea  
I got seven dollars for the jukebox twenty more left over for some beer  
Down here on the Redneck Riviera there ain't no better living anywhere  
Now here comes them dreadful possums  
(Down here on the Redneck Riviera down here on the Redneck Riviera  
(Down here on the Redneck Riviera down here on the Redneck Riviera  
(Down here on the Redneck Riviera down here on the Redneck Riviera  
(Down here on the Redneck Riviera down here on the Redneck Riviera  
(Down here on the Redneck Riviera down here on the Redneck Riviera)
