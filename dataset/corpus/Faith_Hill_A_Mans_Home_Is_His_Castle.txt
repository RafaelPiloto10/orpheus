Linda works the diner pourin' coffee slingin' hash  
She said, "I wouldn't have come in today  
"But I really need the cash  
"I know I can't fool anyone 'cause dark glasses tell no lies  
"But make-up won't cover up a blackened eye"  
Oh, oh, oh no  
  
"You see, Jimmy works construction now  
"But yesterday it rained  
"So he went down to the liquor store  
"And by noon he felt no pain  
"I came in an hour late then I let his supper burn  
"Well he hit the roof hit the wall  
"And then it was my turn"  
  
He said "A man's home is his castle  
It always has been and so it remains"  
"But he holds the keys in a fist of rage  
"His home is his castle  
"And mine is a cage  
  
Someone much have heard the noise and they dialed 911  
And the cop that showed up at the door asked,  
"Is there a problem son?"  
Jimmy smiled and said "No sir, just a little fight that's all  
Hey you know how it gets sometimes  
When you're layin' down the law"  
Oh, oh, oh no  
  
"So I pulled out my suitcase I started packin' up my clothes  
"And Jimmy said 'Now Linda, where do you expect to go with those'  
"I told him 'I have tried, but not an ounce of love survives'  
"Well he grabbed my wrist and shouted  
"You're not leavin' here alive"  
  
She said "I'm savin' up my money and when I get the nerve I'll run  
"But Jim don't give up easily so I intend to buy a gun  
"He will never see the way he treats me is a crime  
"Somebody oughta lock him up but I'm the one  
"Who's done the time"  
  
He said "A man's home is his castle  
It always has been and so it remains"  
"But he holds the keys in a fist of rage  
"His home is his castle  
"And mine is a cage"
