Tom johnston  
There's a town south of the border  
South of el paso they say  
Where the nights are long and the winds are warm  
And the women they love to play  
In an old adobe tavern  
Mescal flows like water  
And rita will dance on your table so fine  
You are bound to place your order  
I don't have to think about it  
I don't have to wonder  
Where I'm going to ride tonight  
I'll be riding down the highway south of the border  
As I ride into town and the dust settles down  
And the mariachi music is playing  
I buy me a room from a guy named luis  
It's just up the stairs and it's waiting  
Downstairs rita is dancing  
Just the way her mother has taught her  
So I settle down for the show and a beer  
And wait for that mother's daughter  
I don't have to think about it  
I don't have to wonder  
Where I'm going to ride tonight  
I'll be riding  
When the morning comes and I wake up  
To the sounds of the people below  
There's a note on my bed that is easily read  
Buenos dias and a kiss when you go  
As I ride out of town with my face to the sun  
And the dust is trailing behind  
Soon I'll go back to this sleepy old town  
Back where I know I can find  
I don't have to think about it  
I don't have to wonder  
Where I'm going to ride tonight  
I'll be riding down the highway south of the border
