I woke the other day  
And saw my world has changed  
The past is over but tomorrow's wishful thinking  
I can't hold onto what's been done  
I can't grab onto what's to come  
And I'm just wishing I could stop, but  
  
Life goes on  
Come of age  
Can't hold on  
Turn the page  
  
Time rolls on  
Wipe these eyes  
Yesterday laughs  
Tomorrow cries  
  
Memories are bittersweet  
The good times we can't repeat  
Those days are gone and we can never get them back  
Now we must move ahead  
Despite our fear and dread  
We're all just wishing we could stop, but  
  
Life goes on  
Come of age  
Can't hold on  
Turn the page  
  
Time rolls on  
Wipe your eyes  
Yesterday laughs  
Tomorrow cries  
  
With all our joys and fears  
Wrapped in forgotten years  
The past is laughing as today just slips away  
Time tears down what we've made  
And sets another stage  
And I'm just wishing we could stop  
  
Life goes on  
Come of age  
Can't hold on  
Turn the page  
  
Time rolls on  
Wipe these eyes  
Yesterday laughs  
Tomorrow cries
