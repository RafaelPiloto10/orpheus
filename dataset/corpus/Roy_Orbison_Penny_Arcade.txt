A light shown in the night some way ahead, blue turned into green then it was
red  
And stirring the night love music played the light I saw in the night was a
penny arcade  
  
Hey step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round
the penny arcade  
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored
lights cascade  
And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all
the time  
Roll up and spend your last dime  
  
At first I thought it a dream that I was in, lost, lost in a sea of glass and
tin  
But no, so dipping my hand in the back of my jeans I grabbed a handful of
coins to feed the machine  
  
Hey step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round
the penny arcade  
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored
lights cascade  
And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all
the time  
Roll up and spend your last dime  
  
Oh! step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round
the penny arcade  
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored
lights cascade  
And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all
the time  
Roll up and spend your last dime  
  
Roll up and spend your last, roll up and spend your last, roll up and spend
your last dime!
