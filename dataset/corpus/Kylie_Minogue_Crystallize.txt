When everything is caving in  
A you don't know what you're gonna do  
When everyone is up in arms  
And you don't know what will get you through  
  
When you don't know if you should go or stay  
You only have to turn my way  
  
Baby you can always count on me  
Just come and look deep into my eyes, crystallize  
So don't go running from my loving everything's gonna be alright  
When you and I crystallize  
  
Crystallize, crystallize  
Oh-oh whoa  
  
And now that we are suddenly  
Able to take ourselves away  
Want you to know I won't let go  
Baby I got you all the way  
  
When you don't know if you should go or stay  
You only have to turn my way  
  
Baby you can always count on me  
Just come and look deep into my eyes, crystallize  
So don't go running from my loving everything's gonna be alright  
When you and I crystallize  
  
In the darkness  
When it's all a mess  
And when you're swimming Through a sea of broken promises  
You can find me  
Shining like a laser beam  
  
Feel the light  
  
Baby you can always count on me  
Just come and look deep into my eyes, crystallize  
So don't go running from my loving everything's gonna be alright  
When you and I crystallize
