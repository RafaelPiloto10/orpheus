All my life, You have been with me  
How could I pretend not to see  
I was walking on the line  
I was wasting precious time  
All I know is that you love me  
If I call you will set me free  
It's a promise that you made  
It's a truth that will not fade  
Please help me to remember  
  
My God will never let me down  
My God will turn my world around  
He loves me even though  
I know I don't deserve Him  
My God will never turn away  
He's with me every single day  
He's broken all the chains and  
Set this captive free  
  
Seems to you all your hope is gone  
Never found a love that strong  
It's a chance you have to take  
It's a choice you've got to make  
I hope that you remember  
  
My God will never let me down  
My God has turned my world around  
He loves me even though  
I know I don't deserve Him  
My God will never turn away  
He's with me every single day  
He's broken all the chains  
And set this captive  
  
My God will never let you down  
My God can turn your world around  
He Loves us even though  
We know we don't deserve him  
Our God will never turn away  
He's with us every single day  
He's broken all the chains  
And set this captive free
