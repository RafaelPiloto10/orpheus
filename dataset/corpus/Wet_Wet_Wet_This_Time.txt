Oh, this time  
I'm not gonna let you get away  
Oh, this time  
I'll find a way to make you stay  
When I say I love you  
I'm serious,  
Cause this time  
  
Oh, this time  
I'll make this house a happy home  
There's nothing to change about you girl  
Cause this time  
  
This time  
I won't listen to what my friends say  
Oh, this time  
Gonna do everything my way  
Oh, this time  
I'll change my attitude  
Oh, this time  
I'll make all your dreams come true  
This time  
I won't stand to see you cry before I leave  
Girl you know I'd rather die  
When the sun beats through my window  
I'll be loving you and you'll be loving me  
This time  
  
This time  
I won't listen to what my friends say  
Oh, this time  
Gonna do everything my way  
Oh, this time  
I'll change my attitude  
Oh, this time  
I'll make all your dreams come true  
This time  
I won't stand to see you cry before I leave  
Girl you know I'd rather die  
When the sun beats through my window  
I'll be loving you and you'll be loving me  
This time
