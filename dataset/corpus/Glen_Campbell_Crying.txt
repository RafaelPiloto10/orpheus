I was all right for a while I could smile for a while  
But I saw you last night you held my hand so tight as you stopped to say hello  
Oh you wished me well you couldn't tell  
That I'd been crying over you crying over you  
  
Since you said so long left me standing all alone alone and crying crying
crying crying  
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand can start me crying  
I thought that I was over you but it's true so true  
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do for you  
  
No don't love me and I'll always be  
Crying over you crying over you yes now you're gone but from this moment on  
I'll be crying crying oh crying crying yeah crying crying over you
