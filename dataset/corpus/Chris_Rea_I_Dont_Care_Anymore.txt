I don't care anymore  
All the things i hear you say  
Don't care anymore  
You're always lying anyway  
Got a sweet little girl  
And it's such a sunny day  
I heard it all before  
Gonna hear it some more  
But you must understand one thing  
I don't care anymore  
  
I got a sweet little girl  
And it's such a sunny day  
I heard it all before  
Gonna hear it some more  
I don't care  
I don't care anymore
