[Chorus: x4]  
Down, down, diggy, diggy, down, down (blow)  
Down, down, diggy, diggy, down  
  
Diggedy down, down just look around, my world is goin' down  
Disease is spreadin' everywhere, I can-cannot be found  
This, the season for murder, isn't no reason  
To hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin'  
And every alley-way, they're gettin' high  
On playgrounds they're sellin' crack and every day another baby dies  
Pistol whippin', kidnappin', anything can happen  
Diggedy down, diggedy down with Old Trafford  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Young people, with no education, politicians, deny and segregation  
Young infants, deserted and abandoned  
Step parents, lack in understandin'  
Homelessness, all across the land, war, man against man  
Treachery and evil fillin' our communities  
And all these hypocrites, aiyyo, they're stealin' from our charities  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
People are gettin' hurt, people are gettin' hurt up  
People are gettin' done, people are gettin' done up (we gotta rise)  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Diggedy down, down just look around, my world is goin' down  
Disease is spreadin' everywhere, I can-cannot be found  
This, the season for murder, isn't no reason  
To hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin'  
And every alley-way, they're gettin' high  
On playgrounds they're sellin' crack and every day another baby dies  
Pistol whippin', kidnappin', anything can happen  
Diggedy down, diggedy down with Old Trafford  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Many poisonous chemicals and (uh) boom!  
Many devilish goals are up (uh) soon!  
No love where loves' ya dwell in  
Mother-earth transformed into hell an'  
Ice, murders, conspiracy and (uh) schemes!  
Young boys will reveal their, dreams!  
Handguns in the hands of the young  
And diss all this paranoia, yo, there's much slugs for everyone  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
We need to rise (rise), as if we live with our eyes (eyes)  
Stay away from the hate (hate), before it's too late (before it's too late)  
We go ah  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
We gotta rise
