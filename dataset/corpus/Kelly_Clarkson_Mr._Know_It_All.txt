Mr Know It All  
Well ya think you know it all  
But ya don't know a thing at all  
Ain't it something y'all  
When somebody tells you something bout you  
Think that they know you more than you do  
So you take it down another pill to swallow  
  
Mr bring me down  
Well ya like to bring me down don't ya  
But I ain't laying down, baby  
I ain't going down  
Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be  
Nobody gonna make a fool out of me  
Baby you should know that I lead not follow  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh you think that you know me, know me  
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely  
'Cause baby you don't know a thing about me  
You don't know a thing about me  
You ain't got the right to tell me  
When and where to go, no right to tell me  
Acting like you own me lately  
Yeah baby you don't know a thing about me  
You don't know a thing about me  
  
Mr Play Your Games  
Only got yourself to blame  
When you want me back again  
But I ain't falling back again  
'Cause I'm living my truth without your lies  
Let's be clear baby this is goodbye  
I ain't coming back tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So what, you've got the world at your feet  
And you know everything about everything  
But you don't  
You still think I'm coming back but baby you'll see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mr Know It All  
Well ya think you know it all  
But ya don't know a thing at all  
Yeah baby you don't know a thing about me  
You don't know a thing about me
