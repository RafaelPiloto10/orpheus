If you were the only girl in the world  
And I were the only boy  
Nothing else would matter in the world today  
We would go on lovin' in the same old way  
A Garden of Eden just made for two  
With nothing to mar our joy  
I would say such wonderful things to you  
There would be such wonderful things to do  
If you were the only girl in the world  
And I were the only boy  
I would say such wonderful things to you  
There would be such wonderful things to do  
If you were the only girl in the world  
And I were the only boy
