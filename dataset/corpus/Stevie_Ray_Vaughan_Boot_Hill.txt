Look up on the wall baby, hand me down my shootin' iron  
Look up on the wall baby, hand me down my shootin' iron  
Call your mother long distance, tell her to expect your body home  
  
If the city don't bury you baby, lord knows the county will  
If the city don't bury you baby, lord knows the county will  
  
You made your last mistake, you going way out on that boot hill  
  
Lord I don't want to wax you darlin', 'cause you gave me my first thrill  
Lord I don't want to wax you baby, 'cause you gave me my first thrill  
You did me so wrong, you're going way out on that boot hill
