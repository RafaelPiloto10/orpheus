Once embraced, can't ever be let go  
Once revealed, can't ever be not shown  
Once believed, can't ever lose faith  
Once shared, can't ever be separate  
Once sown, once can't ever be not reaped  
Like the dawn of a brand new day  
With the power of deity  
Well, I can feel it inside of me  
Feel it. Can you feel it?  
  
Once born, can't ever be not conceived  
Once present, can't ever be past  
Once first, once can't ever be not ever last  
  
Returning home of the prodigal  
Holding the intangible  
To believe in a miracle  
Believe it. Can you believe it?  
  
Have you ever been touched?  
Once whoa, really touched?  
Could it ever be too much?  
Whoa-oh-oh, can you tell me?  
  
Once seen, can't ever lose sight  
Once dawn, can't ever be not light  
Once, once felt, once felt  
Can't ever be untouched  
  
The assurance only hope can bring  
With the conviction of the unseen  
See it's greater than everything  
See it, oh can you see it?  
  
Have you ever been touched?  
Once whoa-oh really, really touched?  
Could it ever be too much?  
Whoa-ooh-oh oh, can you tell me?  
Have you ever really touched love once?  
  
(Oh!)  
  
Oh! Have you ever been touched?  
Once whoa-oh-oh really touched?  
Could it ever be too much?  
I don't know. Did you tell me?  
Have you ever really touched  
Once. Whoa-oh really, really touched?  
  
Could it ever be too much?  
Oh-ooh somebody tell me  
Have you ever really touched  
Love once?  
  
Ah, have you ever really touched  
Love once?  
Have you ever really touched love  
Touched love?  
Woooo-ooooo  
Woooo-ooooo  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah  
Wooo-oooo  
Wooo-oooo  
Wooo-oooo-oooo  
Oh, love once. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
