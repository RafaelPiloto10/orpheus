Jimmy was a fly  
Got sucked in by an actor  
And wrapped in a cocoon  
And skin-tight buffoonery  
Now heres the plan...  
  
Scene from esters day  
Of running backward courses  
With a horse of different forces  
Lying wings of films  
That seem to never see the screen  
Couldn't bear to face their dreams  
  
Down and out  
Couldn't bear to shout it out  
  
Brought up on the road  
A sparkle shiny diner  
Is the home for wayward minor  
In a flying car that seems  
To whisper in an ear  
Lets just go get out of here  
  
Down and out  
Couldn't bear to shout it out  
  
Down and out  
Couldn't bear to shout it out...
