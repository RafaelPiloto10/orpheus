Never saw you look quite so pretty before  
Never saw you dress quite so handsome - what's more  
  
I could hardly wait to keep our date  
This lovely Easter morning  
And my heart beat fast as I came through the door  
For...  
  
In your Easter bonnet, with all the frills upon it  
You'll be the grandest fella in the Easter parade.  
I'll be all in clover, and when they look us over  
We'll be the proudest couple in the Easter parade.  
  
On the avenue, Fifth Avenue,  
The photographers will snap us  
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure.  
Oh, I could write a sonnet, about your Easter bonnet  
And of the guy I'm taking to the Easter Parade.  
  
On the avenue, Fifth Avenue,  
The photographers will snap us  
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure.  
  
Oh, I could write a sonnet  
About your Easter bonnet  
And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter Parade.
