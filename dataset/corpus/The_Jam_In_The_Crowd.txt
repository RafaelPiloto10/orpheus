When I'm in the crowd, I don't see anything  
My mind goes a blank, in the humid sunshine  
When I'm in the crowd I don't see anything  
I fall into a trance, at the supermarket  
The noise flows me along, as I catch falling cans  
Of baked beans on toast, technology is the most  
  
And everyone seems just like me,  
They struggle hard to set themselves free  
And their waiting for the change  
  
When I'm in the crowd, I can't remember my name  
And my only link is a pint of walls ice cream  
When I'm in the crowd - I don't see anything  
  
Sometimes I think that its a plot  
An equilibrium melting pot  
The government sponsors underhand  
When I'm in the crowd  
When I'm in the crowd  
When I'm in the crowd  
  
And everyone seems that they're acting a dream  
Cause they're just not thinking about each other  
And they're taking orders, which are media spawned  
And they should know better, now you have been warned  
  
And don't forget you saw it here first  
When I'm in the crowd  
When I'm in the crowd  
When I'm in the crowd  
  
And life just simply moves along  
In simple houses, simple jobs  
And no ones wanting for the change  
When I'm in the crowd  
When I'm in the crowd  
When I'm in the crowd
