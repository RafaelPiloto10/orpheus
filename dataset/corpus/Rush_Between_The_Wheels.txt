To live between a rock and a hard place  
In between time  
Cruising in prime time  
Soaking up the cathode rays  
  
To live between the wars in our time  
Living in real time  
Holding the good time  
Holding on to yesterdays  
  
[Chorus:]  
You know how that rabbit feels  
Going under your speeding wheels  
Bright images flashing by  
Like windshields towards a fly  
Frozen in the fatal climb  
But the wheels of time  
Just pass you by  
Wheels can take you around  
Wheels can cut you down  
  
We can go from boom to bust  
From dreams to a bowl of dust  
We can fall from rockets' red glare  
Down to "Brother can you spare..."  
Another war  
Another wasteland  
And another lost generation  
  
It slips between your hands like water  
This living in real time  
A dizzying lifetime  
Reeling by on celluloid  
  
Struck between the eyes  
By the big-time world  
Walking uneasy streets  
Hiding beneath the sheets  
Got to try and fill the void  
  
[Chorus]
