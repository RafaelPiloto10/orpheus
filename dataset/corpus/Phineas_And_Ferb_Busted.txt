I can see the things you doing  
And you think that I'm naive  
But when I get the goods on you  
She'll finally believe  
  
She says it's all just drama  
But every bubble's got to pop  
She's gonna see just what your doing  
  
And then you're finally gonna have to stop!  
Don't think you're gonna win this time  
'Cause you better believe I'm gonna drop a dime  
On you  
  
I'll getcha! Yeah! I'll getcha ya!  
And when I do you're gonna be Busted!  
Busted!  
I don't wanna put the hurt on you  
But you better believe me when I tell you  
That I finally got the dirt on you  
  
You're busted! (busted!)  
Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light  
This is how it's gonna be  
When she finds out that I was always right  
  
You're busted!  
  
There's a new cop on the beat  
And I'm bringing down the heat  
My eyes are wise to all your lies, cause you're not that discreet  
And I don't care what you've heard  
'Cause there's one six letter word  
It's gonna set me free  
(Gonna set me free)  
It starts with a b  
(Starts with a b)  
It goes B-U-S-T-E-D you are busted!  
  
I don't wanna put the hurt on you  
But you better believe me when I tell you  
That I finally got the dirt on you  
You're busted  
[Think you're gonna win this time]  
Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light  
[Drop a dime on you]  
This is how it's gonna be  
When she finds out that I was always right  
  
You're busted!
