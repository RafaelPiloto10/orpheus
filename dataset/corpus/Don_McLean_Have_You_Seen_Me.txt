Have you seen me I just might be your little baby?  
Have you seen me I'm lookin' at you with grown up eyes?  
Every milk carton and highway billboard sign says maybe.  
Have you seen me or have you only seen my disguise?  
  
I had a fight with mama and she said she couldn't stand me.  
I had a fight with papa and he really likes to swing his fist.  
I'm sick and tired of all those stupid rules they hand me.  
They try to make me feel I have no right to exist.  
  
Have you seen me, well I've seen you.  
I've seen what the grown ups do.  
I've seen I can do that too.  
Have you seen me?  
  
Well I'm older now than I was the day I vanished.  
You might not even know me if you saw me passin' by.  
Others take your place in the dark world of the banished.  
On vicious streets where no one hears me cry.  
  
Well you can't run, you can't hide  
turn your face, walk inside.  
Can't close your doors, because I'm yours.  
Have you seen me?  
  
Well I'm fighting in Nicaragua, I'm fighting in Afghanistan.  
In Israel I wear a gun, in Palestine a rock is in my hand.  
In Africa you see me starve, in America they just throw me away.  
But I'm making history that other kids will read about some day  
  
Have you seen me, well I've seen you.  
I've seen what the grown ups do.  
I've seen I can do that too.  
Have you seen me?  
Have you seen me?  
Have you seen me?  
Have you seen me?
