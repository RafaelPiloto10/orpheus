Always  
Don't cry ima make it better  
Open your eyes don't cry

Open your eyes sunshine

Tell me what your feeling lately  
You just can't keep it all  
Locked up so deep inside  
It's better just to let it go  
Let my chest be your pillow  
Keep you warm when you get cold  
And when you start to fall  
I wanna let you know  
That we all have our reasons  
They come and go like seasons  
Summer, fall, through winter, spring  
All the heart ache that they bring  
Let this rain wash the pain away  
I pray this love is here to stay  
Been there in your heart from the very start  
I swear to you I'm never leavin.  
  
You know me  
I aint no cloudy weather  
And when the sun don't shine ima make it better  
Always  
You know me  
I aint no cloudy weather  
And when the sun don't shine ima make it better  
Always  
Don't cry ima make it better  
Open your eyes don't cry  
Ima make it better  
Always  
Don't cry ima make it better  
Open your eyes sunshine  
Ima make it better  
Always  
  
I'll be your cover, be your shelter  
To protect you from the weather  
Tell me what you need  
Count on me to make it better  
Call on me so late at night  
Just to be your guiding light boo  
So when the rain comes fallin  
Ima be the one to catch you  
I'm gonna take my time with you  
The storm is coming come inside  
I've been there too.  
Nothin ever gonna hurt you  
As long as I'm beside you  
Hold my hand don't close your eyes I'm here  
We're gonna make it through  
  
Hey don't go  
I wanna let you know  
Hey don't go  
I'm gonna miss you so  
  
You know me  
I aint no cloudy weather  
And when the sun don't shine ima make it better  
Always  
You know me  
I aint no cloudy weather  
And when the sun don't shine ima make it better  
Always  
Don't cry ima make it better  
Open your eyes don't cry

Don't cry ima make it better  
Open your eyes sunshine
