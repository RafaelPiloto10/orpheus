I don't want to put no chains on you  
I just wanna be here lovin you  
Cause you touch me in a place  
That puts a smile right on my face  
But I don't wanna be holding you  
Baby only for an hour or two  
I want you with me  
In these arms for all eternity  
  
I don't mean to put you under pressure  
I just wanna spend some time together  
And baby if it's just for one night  
Then give me just one nite with you  
Every day of your life  
One kiss in the morning  
After 100 kisses each night  
Just one night with you  
Everyday for all time  
It would be so right  
Everyday to have just one night  
With you, with you  
  
Hey hey love the things you say  
The way you move  
I'd love to stay here making love with you  
Cause your just so good to hold  
And you rap your arms around my soul  
So come on and take this heart of mine  
You can have it till the end of time  
I want you to be every single part of me  
  
I don't mean to put you under pressure  
I just wanna have your love for ever  
So baby if its just for one nite  
One nite  
Give me just one nite with you  
Everyday of your life  
One kiss every morning  
After 100 kisses each night  
Give just one night with you  
Everyday for all time  
It would be so right  
Everday to have just one night with you  
  
Baby give me your kisses for a lifetime  
Baby show me your smiling face each day  
Baby hold me in your arms forever  
Cause I need you by my side  
And I won't be satisfied  
  
Until you give me just one night with you  
Everyday of your life  
One kiss every morning  
After 100 kisses each night  
Give me just one night with you  
Just one night with you  
Everyday for all time  
It would be so nice  
Everyday to have just one night with you  
One night with you  
Give me one  
Give me just one night with you  
One night for all my life
