I've been thinkin' 'bout  
Thinkin' 'bout sex  
Always hungry for somethin'  
That I haven't had yet  
Well maybe baby, you got somethin' to lose  
Well I got somethin'  
I got somethin' for you  
  
My way, your way  
Anything goes tonight  
My way, your way  
Anything goes  
  
Panties round your knees  
With your ass in debris  
Doing that grind  
With a push and a squeeze  
Tied up, tied down  
Up against the wall  
Be my rubbermade baby  
And we can do it all  
  
My way, your way  
Anything goes tonight
