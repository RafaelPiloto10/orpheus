Brother will kill brother  
Spilling blood across the land  
Killing for religion  
Something I don't understand  
  
Fools like me, who cross the sea  
And come to foreign lands  
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs  
Do you kill on God's command?  
  
A country that's divided  
Surely will not stand  
My past erased, no more disgrace  
No foolish naive stand  
  
The end is near, it's crystal clear  
Part of the master plan  
Don't look now to Israel  
It might be your homelands  
  
Holy wars  
  
Upon my podium, as the  
Know it all scholar  
Down in my seat of judgement  
Gavel's bang, uphold the law  
Up on my soapbox, a leader  
Out to change the world  
Down in my pulpit as the holier  
Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God  
  
Wage the war on organized crime  
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks  
Behind the lines  
Some people risk to employ me  
Some people live to destroy me  
Either way they die  
  
They killed my wife, and my baby  
With hopes to enslave me  
First mistake, last mistake!  
Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants  
Next mistake, no more mistakes!  
  
Fill the cracks in, with judicial granite  
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't  
Thinkin' it  
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away  
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose  
And the lack of mercy killings
