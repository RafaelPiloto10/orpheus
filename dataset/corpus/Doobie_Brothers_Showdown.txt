I never in my life met a girl so low  
Sneakin' out the back door of my house below  
The fog is creepin' in and the moon is full  
I do believe she find what she's lookin' for  
And you know there's gonna be  
Showdown  
You better get ready  
Showdown  
I'm gonna shoot for the heart  
Showdown  
Put your cards on the table  
We're heading for the showdown tonight  
That little girl treat me so mean  
Wicked like the devil in tight blue jeans  
Here I sit with my head hung low  
Waiting for the woman come through that door  
Showdown  
You better get ready  
Showdown  
I'm gonna shoot for the heart  
Showdown  
Put your cards on the table  
We're heading for the showdown tonight  
It won't be easy  
Showdown  
I said it won't be nice  
Showdown  
So you better get ready  
Get ready for the showdown  
Easy come and easy go  
It used to work for me  
But not any more  
If she wants to spend her time with me  
She better know what lovin's for
