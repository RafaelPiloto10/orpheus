another time time after time you make me feel so helpless i i never tried to
change your mind i keep it to myself it's sometimes i've got to tell you is it
this time i'll tell you we've got to go to places somewhere i don't mind it's
special and now you find as time goes by you're left with nothing meaning much
the meaning i will have to try to take your mind to places i wish that i could
help you but you seem less than helpless i always tried to tell you someday
that it'd seem so special time after time what's on your mind you make me feel
so helpless i you never tried what's on your mind you make me feel so helpless
i i feel so helpless i you're left alone with something and i hope for you
it's one thing that something you and yours can hold and hold as something
special and now you find as time goes by you're left with nothing meaning much
the meaning i will have to try what's on your mind so helpless i i feel so
helpless i
