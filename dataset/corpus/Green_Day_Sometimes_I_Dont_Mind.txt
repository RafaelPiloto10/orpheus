You don't look at me no more and I don't  
look at you  
Well that all right pretty baby, cuz I'm just  
looking for something to do  
You're telling me that you don't feel the  
same  
Well that's all right pretty baby, cuz I don't  
mind driving myself insane, sometimes  
I don't mind at all, and then again  
sometimes baby  
I feel like my whole world's gonna fall apart  
When you tell me you don't feel the same,  
but that's all right pretty baby, cuz I don't  
mind being insane  
Sometimes  
You don't talk to me no more, and I don't  
talk to you  
Well that's all right pretty baby, cuz I'm just  
looking for something to prove  
You're telling me that you don't feel the  
same  
Well that's all right pretty baby, cuz I don't  
mind driving myself insane, sometimes  
I don't mind at all, and then again  
sometimes baby  
I feel like my whole worlds gonna fall apart  
When you tell me that you don't feel the  
same, but that's all right pretty baby, cuz  
I don't mind being insane  
Sometimes
