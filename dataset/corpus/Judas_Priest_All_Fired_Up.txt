A burst of speed is all I need to set me free  
A flagging start that stirs the heart to ecstasy  
Raging away I'll go far  
Time waits for no man  
So reach for the stars  
I'm fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
A bolt of light that sears the night of things supreme  
To chase the sun, forever on and live the dream  
Forcing a system aside  
Too fast for this life  
My mind's open wide  
I'm fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
I'm soaring, free falling  
With all emotions roaring  
Like lighting, like thunder  
I'll rip the world as under  
Let's go, hold on  
I'm soaring, free falling  
With all emotions roaring  
Like lighting, like thunder  
I'll rip the world as under  
Raging away I'll go far  
Time waits for no man  
So reach for the stars  
I'm fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
All fired up
