You've chosen me, oh no  
When it happens  
I've chosen you, I don't know  
When it happens  
  
Changes my life to a love song  
This love is so strong  
You've chosen me  
And now that I, I've  
  
I've chosen you  
Oh, oh, my love  
Let it happen  
Changing my life to a love song  
  
Changing my life to a love song  
This road is so long  
I'm a runaway train going off the rails  
My love is so strong  
  
I don't know why, if you  
You've chosen me  
Oh, pass my way  
If it happens
