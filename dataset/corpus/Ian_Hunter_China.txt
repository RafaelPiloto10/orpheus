China, china, the evening's moving in  
See you, soon now, the boat moves with the wind  
China, china, I can see the harbour lights  
Light your, fire, we'll be warm tonight  
  
China, china, the thoughts drift from the sea  
I'm dreaming, of you, wear your dress for me  
China, china, the oceans on the wheel(? )  
The seagulls flying lower now  
China I can feel you by my side  
Across the bay, across the tyne  
Can you hear me say  
  
China, china, wear your hair down low  
Lady, lady, you're frozen to the bone  
China, china, the catch was good today  
The oilskins clinging to my back  
And the lantern gently sways  
  
Oh don't you cry, the kids to bed  
Didn't mean the things I said  
  
China, china, the years go rolling by  
Laughter, sorrow, I will not make you cry  
China, china, think before you speak  
Always remember the ocean hauls as deep  
And if I'm tired of feeling low  
Don't let me sleep, you know  
  
China, china, the men are on the quay  
Drinking, smoking, talking quietly  
The water's calmer now  
All my work is done  
So china, see ya.
