Take your time and tell me  
Where you lie  
I realize  
That we've been found out this time  
  
We should stay together  
If we can  
But what you've planned  
Means there's a difference between  
  
[Chorus]  
What you're gonna say  
In private  
You still want my love  
We're in this together  
And what you're gonna do  
In public  
Say you were never in love  
That you can remember  
  
So discreet  
I never tried to meet  
Your friends or interfere  
I took a back seat between  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What you gonna say, eh  
When you run back to your wife?  
I guess it's just the story of my life  
What you gonna say?  
  
So take your time  
And tell me  
Where did you learn  
Oh, I may publicize  
That there's a difference between  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me what you gonna say  
In private?, oh, oh, oh  
What you gonna say?  
What you gonna do?  
Baby, what you gonna say?
