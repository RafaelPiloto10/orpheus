He never felt that she cared  
Turning to leave  
Feeling her lonely stare  
If only a secret love  
  
Left more than a broken heart  
Like a fool thanks he felt the start  
Of what he hoped for so long  
  
He waits though he knows she's gone  
Alone he climbs  
Until he falls  
  
Only a secret love brings more than a broken heart  
  
Like a fool I have played the part  
Of what I hoped for so long  
The need to belong  
In love
