Afraid to walk the streets  
In the coldness all alone  
The blackness of the night  
Engulfs your flesh and bones  
Hoping for relief  
From the fear you feel inside  
Losing all perspective  
Of reality in the night  
  
[Chorus]  
Running from shadows  
Blinded by fear  
The horror of nightfall  
Is ever so near  
I slowly surround you  
As terror sets in  
Are you afraid of the night  
  
I see the fright in your eyes  
As you turn and run  
But is your mind playing tricks  
On a body so very young  
Feeling as if no one cares  
The fear runs down your spine  
But I know I'll never rest  
Until I know you're mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Afraid to walk the streets  
In the coldness all alone  
The blackness of the night  
Engulfs your flesh and bones  
Feeling as if no one cares  
The fear runs down your spine  
But I know I'll never rest  
Until I know you're mine  
I know you're mine  
Too late to hide  
Too late to save your life  
Tormentor
