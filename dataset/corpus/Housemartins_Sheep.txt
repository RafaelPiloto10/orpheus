Sometimes I get so angry with the simple life they lead  
The shepherds smile seems to confirm my fears  
They've never questioned anything, They've never disagreed  
Sometimes I think they must have wool in their ears  
  
And when you see a cane I see a crook  
And when you see a crowd I see a flock  
It's sheep we're up against  
Sheep we're up against  
  
When I was young they used to get me counting sheep  
But the counting I did was all in vain  
No when I'm tired and I'm trying to get to sleep  
I count humans jumping onto trains  
  
And when you see a cane I see a crook  
And when you see a crowd I see a flock  
It's sheep we're up against  
Sheep we're up against  
  
And when you see a cane I see a crook  
And when you see a crowd I see a flock  
It's sheep we're up against  
Sheep we're up against
