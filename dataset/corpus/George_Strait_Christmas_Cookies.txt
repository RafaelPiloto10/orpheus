I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar  
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe  
The ones that look like Santa Claus  
Christmas trees, bells and stars  
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe  
  
Now, Christmas cookies are a special treat  
The more she bakes the more I eat  
And sometimes I can't get myself to stop  
Sometimes she'll wait till I'm asleep  
She'll take the ones I didn't eat  
And put those little sprinkly things on top  
  
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar  
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe  
The ones that look like Santa Claus  
Christmas trees, bells and stars  
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe  
  
Now those sprinkly things just makes things worse  
'Cause it makes them taste better than they did at first  
And they're absolutely impossible to resist  
Some disappear to who knows where  
But I make sure I get my share  
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss  
  
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar  
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe  
She gets mad that they're all gone  
Before she gets the icing put on  
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe  
  
Now there's a benefit to all of this  
That you might have overlooked or missed  
So now let me tell you the best part of it all  
Every time she sticks another batch in the oven  
There's 15 minutes for some kissin' and'a huggin'  
That's why I eat Christmas cookies all year long  
  
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, sugar  
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe  
The ones that look like Santa Claus  
Christmas trees, bells and stars  
I sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe [x2]
