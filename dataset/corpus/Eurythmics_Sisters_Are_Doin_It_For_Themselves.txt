Now there was a time when they used to say  
That behind every great man there had to be a great woman.  
But in these times of change you know that it's no longer true  
  
So we're comin' out of the kitchen  
  
'Cause there's something we forgot to say to you  
We say:  
  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves  
  
Standin' on their own two feet an ringin' on their own bells.  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves.  
  
Now this is a song to celebrate  
The conscious liberation of the female state.  
Mothers  
Daughters and their daughters  
Too  
  
Woman to woman  
We're singing with you.  
The inferior sex has got a new exterior  
  
We got doctors  
Lawyers  
Politicians  
Too.  
Everybody  
Take a look around  
Can you see  
Can you see  
  
Can you see there's a woman right next to you.  
We say: Sisters are doin' it for themselves  
  
Now we ain't makin' stories and we ain't layin' plans  
  
'Cause a man still loves a woman and a woman still loves a man  
Just the same though -  
  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves.  
Now there was a time when they used to say  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves  
  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
