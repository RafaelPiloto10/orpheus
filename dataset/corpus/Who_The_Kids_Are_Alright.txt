I don't mind other guys dancing with my girl  
That's fine, I know them all pretty well  
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light  
Better leave her behind with the kids, they're alright  
The kids are alright  
  
Sometimes, I feel I gotta get away  
Bells chime, I know I gotta get away  
And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind  
Better leave her behind with the kids, they're alright  
The kids are alright  
  
I know if I go things would be a lot better for her  
I had things planned, but her folks wouldn't let her
