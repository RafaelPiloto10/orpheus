Hey, Jesus hey it's me  
Now I've gone international  
And become very rational  
As you decree  
  
Hey, Jesus it's our day  
Now I can bring them home to you  
Though I may loose out on a few  
Who care to stray  
  
We'll make them see international  
We'll make them be international  
Like you and me  
  
Hey, Jesus it's ok  
Now we have common interests  
And we can help along the rest  
To be like we  
  
We'll make them see internationl  
We'll make them be international  
Like you and me  
  
We'll make them see internationl  
We'll make them be international  
Like you and me  
  
Hey, Jesus you'll agree  
They're going downhill very fast  
And it don't look as though they'll last  
Till judgement day  
  
We'll make them see internationl  
We'll make them be international  
Like you and me  
  
International, international, international, international  
International, international, international, international
