If I'm so lost without a friend  
Tell me, who's this by my side?  
This girl with eyes like gems  
And cool reactions to your lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies  
  
You can't repeat what you put 'round  
All the things that made me cry  
You kicked me when I was down  
And they hurt me all those lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies  
  
I've got my girl and together we're strong  
To laugh at you and prove you wrong  
  
I don't insist that you feel bad  
I just want to see you smile  
Don't ever think you made me mad  
I didn't listen to your lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies  
  
If I'm so lost without a friend  
Tell me, who's this by my side?  
This girl with eyes like gems  
And cool reactions to your lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies  
  
I don't insist that you feel bad  
I just want to see you smile  
Don't ever think you made me mad  
I didn't listen to your lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies
