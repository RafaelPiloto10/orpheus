Baby, there's no way of knowing  
If we've got a good thing going  
Better not believe in true love  
That's what people say  
  
There's nothing fatal in attraction  
I'm just looking for some action  
Better not go chasing rainbows  
That's what people say  
  
Every time i see your face  
Emotion takes control of me  
It turns me round and puts me in a spin  
Oh can't you see  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want to love you  
I want to be the one  
Who's holding you tonight  
I just want to love you  
Every minute of the hour  
Every morning, noon and night  
  
There's gotta be a way to show you  
I'd really like to get to know you  
I could make you happy  
If you'd take a chance on me  
  
Don't want to talk about forever  
Can't you see it's now or never  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Take a change on me  
  
You know it makes me so excited  
Every time i think of you  
It turns me round and puts me in a spin  
Oh can't you see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to love you  
I, i just want to love you  
(holding you tonight)  
I just want to love you  
I, i just want to love you  
(every morning, noon and night)  
  
Take a chance, take a chance, chance  
Take a chance, take a chance  
Take a chance on me  
Take a chance, take a chance, chance  
Take a chance, take a chance  
Take a chance on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to love you  
I just want to love you  
(holding you tonight)  
I just want to love you  
I just want to love you  
(every morning, noon and night)  
  
[Chorus]
