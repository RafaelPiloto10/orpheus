Turn around,  
Go back down,  
Back the way you came,  
Can't you see that flash of fire ten times brighter than the day?  
  
And behold a mighty city broken in the dust again,  
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.  
Turn around,  
Go back down,  
  
Back the way you came,  
Babylon is laid to waste, Egypt's buried in her shame,  
The mighty men are all beaten down, their kings are fallen in the ways,  
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.  
  
Turn around,  
Go back down,  
Back the way you came,  
Terror is on every side, lo our leaders are dismayed.  
  
For theose who place their faith in fire, their faith in fire shall be  
Repayed,  
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.  
Turn around,  
  
Go back down,  
Back the way you came,  
And shout a warning unto the nation that the sword of God is raised.  
Yes, Babylon, that mighty city, rich in treasures, wide in fame,  
  
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.  
The meek shall cause your tower to fall, make a new pyre of flame,  
Oh you who dwell on many waters, rich in treasures, wide in fame.  
You bow unto your God of gold, your pride of might shall be a shame,  
  
For only God can lead His people back unto the Earth again.  
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.  
A Holy mountain be restored, and mercy on that people, that people...
