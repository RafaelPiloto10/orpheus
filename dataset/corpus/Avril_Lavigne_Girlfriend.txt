[Chorus]  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I don't like your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
I think you need a new one  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I could be your girlfriend  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I know that you like me  
No way, no way  
No, it's not a secret  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I want to be your girlfriend  
  
You're so fine  
I want you mine  
You're so delicious  
I think about you all the time  
You're so addictive  
Don't you know what I can do  
To make you feel all right?  
  
Don't pretend  
I think you know  
I'm damn precious  
And, hell yeah  
I'm the motherfuckin' princess  
I can tell you like me too  
And you know I'm right  
  
She's like so, whatever  
You could do so much better  
I think we should get together now  
(And that's what everyone's talkin' about)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can see the way  
I see the way you look at me  
And even when you look away  
I know you think of me  
I know you talk about me all the time  
Again and again  
  
So come over here  
And tell me what I wanna hear  
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear  
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again (and again and again)  
  
Cause she's like so, whatever  
You could do so much better  
I think we should get together now  
(And that's what everyone's talkin' about)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge x 2]  
(Oh)  
In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger  
Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better  
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?  
She's so stupid  
What the hell were you thinkin'?  
  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I don't like your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
  
I think you need a new one  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I could be your girlfriend  
  
No way, no way  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I know that you like me  
  
No way, no way  
No, it's not a secret  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
  
I want to be your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
  
I don't like your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
I think you need a new one  
  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I could be your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I know that you like me  
  
No way, no way  
No, it's not a secret  
Hey, hey  
You, you  
I want to be your girlfriend  
No way, no way  
Hey, hey!
