There's a sickness in my soul  
And I don't know but I been told it's incurable  
There's a darkness in my heart  
Slowly tearin' me apart, it's unbearable  
Drop of blood, a lake of tears  
And baby after all these years you're still beautiful  
And I've been loved and I've been used  
Cut wide open, scarred and bruised  
I'm unbreakable  
  
Flesh it heals I know  
Hearts they never mend  
Lover's come and go girl right now I need a friend  
  
Walk for miles, talk for days  
And I keep trying to change my ways  
It's so difficult  
You kick and scream  
You curse and yell  
Tell me I should go to hell  
It's so typical  
Touch my heart, feel my pain  
Let me know I'm not insane  
You're so merciful  
Break your heart  
I cheat, I lie  
And honestly I don't know why I'm so pitiful  
  
Flesh it heals I know  
Hearts they never mend  
Lover's come and go girl right now I need a friend...yeah  
  
There's a sickness in my soul  
And I don't know but I been told it's incurable  
There's darkness in my heart, that's slowly tearin' me apart  
It's unbearable...yeah  
  
Flesh it heals I know  
Hearts they never mend  
Lovers come and go girl right now I need a friend...yeah  
  
Right now I need a friend  
  
There's a sickness in my soul  
And I don't know but I been told it's incurable
