No time, no time for you  
I got no time, baby  
Got lots of better things to do  
  
Runnin' from the risin' heat  
To find a place to hide  
The grass is always greener  
Growin' on the other side  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
No time, no time for you  
I got no time, baby  
Got lots of better things to do  
  
Tryin' to tell the world  
Somehow of how I feel  
Tell me what you said again  
I can't believe it's real  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Andy, you're a dandy  
You don't seem to make no sense  
Nevermind the furthermore  
The plea is self-defense  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got no time  
I got no time
