When the night has come  
And the land is dark  
And the moon is the only  
Only light we see  
No, I won't be afraid  
No no no no no no  
No, I won't be afraid  
Just as long, just as long  
Just as long as you stand by me  
  
Now darling, darling  
Whenever I'm in trouble  
Darling, won't you stand  
I need just a little helping hand  
Now now now  
And darling, darling  
Won't you stand by me  
  
It the sky we look upon now now  
Should tumble and fall  
All of the mountains may crumble  
May crumble to the sea  
I won't cry, I won't cry  
No no no no no, I won't shed no tears  
Just as long, just as long  
Just as long as you stand by me  
  
Now darling, darling  
I said I need somebody right now  
I need just a little helping hand  
I need someone to come pick me up  
And stand by me  
Come on, come on, baby, yeah  
Come on, come on and stand by me  
  
And darling, darling stand by me  
Come on, pretty baby, and stand now  
Stand, stand by me  
Come on and help me, baby  
I need a little lovin'  
Come on and stand, stand by me  
Whenever I'm in trouble  
Won't you stand by me  
Come on and stand by me, my baby  
Come on  
I need a little bit of love
