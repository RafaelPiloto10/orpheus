In the sea,  
The fish have learned to fly  
On a moonlit night  
On wings of silver  
As the enchanted stars  
Sail serenely by.  
Do they know  
Where do unicorns go?  
Where winged horses fly?  
Narwhals lost at sea  
And never seen again.  
Go.  
Go and ask the magpie  
"Where do unicorns go?"  
In the trees  
The birds have learned to speak  
Many colored  
They keep their secrets  
In a parade of clouds  
Playing hide and seek.  
Do they know  
Where do unicorns go?  
Where winged horses fly?  
Narwhals lost at sea  
And never seen again.  
Does myth  
And mystery lie  
Where the unicorns go?
