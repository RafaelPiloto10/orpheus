The world's gone mad  
And I have lost touch  
I shouldn't admit it  
But I have.  
It slipped away while I was distracted  
I haven't changed  
I swear I haven't changed  
How did this happen?  
  
I didn't feel myself  
Evaporating...  
  
My body has gone  
But my eyes remain  
Hovering. Witnessing.  
Cold as a ghost ..watching the streets  
Sheltering in doorways of  
Venice, Vienna,  
Budapest, Krakow, and Amsterdam  
  
I have become the invisible man  
  
The invisible heart beating against you  
The invisible pulse silently thumping  
  
I shout my name in the public places  
No one seems to notice  
No one understands  
I stand perfectly still  
In the middle of the road  
I hold my nerve  
I hold my nerve  
Hold my nerve  
But the cars don't swerve  
  
I will hear your prayers  
As you whisper alone  
I am the one you felt was close  
Close behind you in St.Stephen  
You lit a candle  
Blessings in the cold night air  
  
I'll feel your breath as you turn to go  
I'll watch you leave  
From somewhere up high  
As you cross the park  
In the Autumn light  
In the Autumn light  
In the Autumn light  
  
If I close my eyes  
I can see where you live  
Climb the winding stairs  
Up to your apartment  
The scent of you preparing  
His evening meal  
I must watch in dread  
When he's cruel to you  
In horrified silence  
As you make love  
I cannot lift a hand  
Lift a hand to stop him  
I don't exist What can I do?  
What can I do?  
  
I will scream in your ear  
As you're passing by  
I will wrap my arms around you  
You won't hear, you won't feel me  
I will walk stride for stride with you  
I will try to help  
When you stumble  
You will stumble through me.  
  
I have become the invisible man  
It's all I am  
Invisible  
  
I have read all your letters  
I know what you contain  
I have dreamt your dreams  
My head..  
My head is haunted  
I will scream again  
'I am perfectly sane'  
'I am perfectly sane'  
But I am  
The invisible man  
I am  
The invisible man  
  
Talk to me  
Acknowledge me  
Confide in me  
Confess to me ... or  
Leave me be  
Leave me be.
