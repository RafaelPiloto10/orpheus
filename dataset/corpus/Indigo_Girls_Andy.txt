Andy  
Do you love me  
Do you think about it  
Will you say  
Turning brushwood  
Into blazes  
Turning summer grass  
Into hay  
Turning sharply  
Past the graveyard  
To the lakefront  
With the black waves  
Licking up the stones  
To the swayed back  
Screened in front porch  
Who could ever stay the weight  
Of flesh and bones  
  
Andy  
Aren't you tired  
From the sun and rain  
And river soaking you  
From the beer cans  
On your dashboard  
And the bullet hole  
Glass spiderweb  
Staining your rear view  
I have watched you  
Watch an empty road  
Is it only her  
Upon which you all  
Of you is depending  
To fill your twenty  
Hour work day  
While all the fences  
In this county still need mending  
Hey  
  
And in the night  
I do my checking  
And fix the broken parts  
With visions of rare beauty  
But in my heart I know I'm second  
Forever fixed in your pursuit  
It is my duty  
Hey  
  
Andy  
Will you toss me  
A little scrap of something  
That I can taste  
Instead of dust from  
All the leaving  
And the smell of summer  
Lying here to waste  
Under the burnt pyre  
Of all the cast away  
The tiny shoots will spring  
Like questions  
Will you take me  
Out to the fenced hill  
Sprinkled with horses  
Wild in resistance to the taming  
Will you break me  
Will you break me
