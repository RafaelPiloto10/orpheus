Yeah, check it out, they say behind every strong man  
Is an even stronger woman  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause she, was put here to defeat me  
Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me  
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need  
Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me  
Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me  
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need  
  
Man, X aint' with that sucka shit  
I'm from a place, where they quick to say "Fuck A Bitch"  
And gettin' grits, off of pussy, try ta get a hitch  
But I'm a bachelor, stackin' it, drinkin', need to quit  
Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own the shit  
You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick  
So who am I? I reply with my government, exchange the numbers  
Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger  
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line  
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time  
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman  
I got twenty twenty cord vision, seein' you comin'  
Livin' my life, I don't need a wife  
But you persist, tryin' ta strengthen our relationship  
But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets  
Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace  
You ain't the one for me!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit  
Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit  
Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets  
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat  
I'm feelin' stuck, had to hustle up  
The ATF hit the house, had me shackled up  
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out  
You never let a brother down, when you stressin' out  
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route  
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out  
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat  
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me  
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was  
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man  
I understand that you love me and you want the best  
But if you want to take the good, you gotta take the rest  
I rock a vest, baby!  
  
Cause I, run these streets for my struggle  
Cause I, carry heat for my troubles  
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?  
Cause I, want family so I'm buildin'  
Cause I, want futures for my children  
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?  
  
And all this time it was you  
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin' you through  
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true  
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I pursue  
I used to think I was the MAN, wasn't havin' a clue  
I wasn't lookin' for no love, but I found it in you  
It's so true, behind every great man is a women  
Every time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come runnin'  
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life  
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight  
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down  
You always given me another reason, I can smile  
Cause you believed in me, when there was nothin' there to see  
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree  
Ugh, nothin' can stop us now, Vera Wang gown  
Watchin' your father, walk his little lady down the isle  
Cause you the one for me!  
  
Cause she, was put here to complete me  
Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me  
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need  
Cause she, won't let go, she won't leave me  
Cause she, won't leave, what she don't need me  
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need  
  
Dedicated to the real ones out there  
Ugh, yeah, this is for you
