I'm a night rider burning the highways, no brakes I ride  
Tasmanian Devil, a mean streak as wide as the sky  
As wild as the night  
Cause I'm a wild screaming eagle  
I thunder and roll down the line  
  
No one can see that I got to be free  
All that I need's just to ride in the breeze  
I'm running today, I'm still bound to stay  
Don't tread on me cause I'm living to be  
S-s-s-s-s-savage  
  
I'm a fur stroking monster, I'll eat you alive  
My heart is my smoking sportster, cross me and you'll not survive  
My wheels are my life  
  
No one can see that I got to be free  
All that I need's just to ride in the breeze  
I'm running today, I'm still bound to stay  
Don't tread on me cause I'm living to be  
S-s-s-s-s-savage  
Don't dare touch me  
Five hundred see-see-see-see-see-see-s  
  
No one can see that I got to be free  
All that I need's just to ride in the breeze  
I'm running today, I'm still bound to stay  
Don't tread on me cause I'm destined to be  
Savage  
To be free, ride in the breeze  
No don't you touch me  
I'm running today, I'm still bound to stay  
Sa-sa-sa-savage
