Shane: we started as friends  
But something happened inside me  
Now I'm reading into everything  
But there's no sign you hear the lightning, baby  
  
You don't ever notice me  
Turning on my charm  
Or wonder why I'm always where you are  
  
I've made it obvious  
I've done everything but say it  
(i've crushed on ya so long, but on and on you get me wrong)  
I'm not so good with words  
Since you never noticed  
The way that we belong  
I'll say it in a love song  
  
I've heard you talk about  
(heard you talk about)  
How you want someone just like me  
But every time I ask you out  
(time I ask you out)  
We never move past friendly no,no  
  
And you never how  
I stare when we're alone  
Or wonder why I keep you on the phone  
  
I've made it obvious  
Done everything but sing it  
(I've crushed on you so long but on and on you get me wrong)  
I'm not so good with words  
And since you never notice  
The way that we belong  
I'll say it in a love song  
Yeah  
  
You are my very first thought in the morning  
  
And my last at nightfall  
  
You are my love that came without warning  
  
Mark and Shane:  
I need you  
I want you to know  
  
I've made it obvious  
So finally I'll sing it  
(I've crushed on you so long)  
I'm not so good with words  
And since you never notice  
The way that we belong  
I'll say it in a love song  
  
And sing it until the day you're holding me  
I've wanted you so long but on and on you get me wrong  
I more then adore you but since you never seem to see  
  
But you never seem to see  
I'll say it in this love song
