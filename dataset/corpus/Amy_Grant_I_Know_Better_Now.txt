Some people always know the right thing to say  
I don't really think I was born that way  
And with the gift of charm, they're well endowed  
I love to watch them float right through a crowd  
I used to think it took a giggly girl  
To win some fame in this mixed around world  
But I know better now  
One day I met a man who showed me love  
There standing on His head was a snow white dove  
And He said,"Once I came down to this mire for you  
But I'm the Son of God, He's your Father too"  
It wasn't long before my new walk began  
Since I found Jesus, my life is in His hands  
Now I have life, no one can take it from me  
And I've a home above I'm waiting to see  
There're many rooms in the House of the Lord  
Why don't you come along and bring someone more?  
I used to think it took a giggly girl  
To win some fame in this mixed around world  
But I know better now  
I know better now, I know better now  
I know better now, I know better now  
I know better now, I know better now  
I know better now  
I know, I know, I know  
I know better now
