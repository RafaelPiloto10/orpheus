I saw an open door and I looked inside it  
But I'd no idea  
What you were hiding  
  
So now I'm holding the bag and it's heavy  
And the conversation stopped  
So much for friendly  
  
And if I told you I was not very good  
At making small talk when I should  
But you have one advantage over me  
At times like this I am lost at sea  
  
[Chorus]  
Why can't I see it for what it really is  
And know it like I know my name  
And if it's all the same I don't like this game  
So let's pack it up  
And call it even  
  
Well I'm not the type to speak  
Just to hear my voice  
And I'm sure you'd hear me out  
If you had the choice  
But your words keep coming out  
Never ending  
And I wonder if I'd have to shout  
The message I'm sending  
  
And if I told you I was dying of thirst  
And the sky was falling just to make it worse  
Would you just smile and continue on  
As if your mouth had a race to run  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I'm glad we had this talk  
I feel better  
And if I've something else to say  
I'll write a letter  
  
And if I told you you were not very good  
At hearing others when you really should  
Would you just smile and push me away  
You can't be bothered there's still words to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's just call it even, even, even
