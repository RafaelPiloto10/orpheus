Everbody wants to be love  
Every once in a while  
We all need someone to hold on to  
Just like a helpless child  
Can you whipser in my ear  
Let me know it's all right  
  
(Chorus) It's been a long time coming  
Down this road  
And now I know what I've been waiting for  
And like a lonely highway  
I'm trying to get home  
Ooo loves been a long time coming  
  
You can look for a lifetime  
You can love for a day  
You can think you got everything  
Everything is nothing when you throw it away  
Then you look in my eyes and I have it all once again  
  
(Chorus) It's been a long time coming  
Down this road  
And now I know what I've been waiting for  
It's like lonely highway  
I'm trying to get home  
Ooo loves been a long time coming  
  
Didn't know I was lost 'til you found me  
Didn't know I was blind but now I see  
  
Can you whisper in my ear  
Let me know its all right  
  
It's been a long time coming  
Down this road  
And now I know what I've been searching for  
It's been long long highway and now I see  
Ooo loves be a long time  
Ooh been a long time  
Loves been a long time...  
coming
