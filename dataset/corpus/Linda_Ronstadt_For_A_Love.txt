(Gilberto Parra)  
  
For a love  
I can't sleep and I live full of passion  
I have a love  
That left forever in my life a bitter pain  
  
Poor me  
This life would be better if it would end  
It's not for me.  
  
Poor me (Ay, my heart...  
Poor me (don't suffer any more...  
How much my suffering in my breast  
That throbs so alone for you.  
  
For a love  
I have cried little drops of blood from my heart,  
You have left me with a wounded soul  
Without compassion...
