I'm in league with Satan  
I was raised in hell  
I walk the streets of Salem  
Amongst the living dead  
I need no one to tell me  
What's wrong or right  
I drink the blood of children  
Stalk my prey at night  
  
[Chorus]  
Look out beware  
When the full moon's high n' bright  
In every way I'm there  
In every shadow in the night  
Coz I'm evil in league with Satan  
Evil in league with Satan  
  
I'm in league with Satan  
Obey his commands  
With the goat of Mendes  
Sitting at his left hand  
I'm in league with Satan  
I love the dead  
No one prayed for Sodom  
As the people fled  
  
I'm in league with Satan  
I am the masters own  
I drink the juice of women  
As they lie alone  
I'm in league with Satan  
I bear the devils mark  
I kill the new born baby  
Tear the infants flesh
