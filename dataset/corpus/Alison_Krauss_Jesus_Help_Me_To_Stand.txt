Through trials, troubles and care  
I know Jesus my savior is there  
Giving me faith through darkest days  
Keeping me on the narrow way  
Jesus savior, help me each day  
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith  
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand  
Jesus savior, help me to stand  
Jesus lived through darkest pain  
Rejected by men, despising the shame  
Man of sorrows, acquainted with grief  
He gave His life so we may be free  
Jesus savior, help me each day  
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith  
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand  
Jesus savior, help me to stand  
I know that Jesus died for me  
Canceled my debt at Calvary  
Rose from the dead, unlocked Heaven's door  
Trust in His love and live evermore  
Jesus savior, help me each day  
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith  
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand  
Jesus savior, help me to stand
