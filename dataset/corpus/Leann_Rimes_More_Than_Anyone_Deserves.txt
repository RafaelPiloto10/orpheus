If I woke up tomorrow  
And my eyes could not see  
In darkness there'd be beauty  
Of the love you shown to me  
  
Cause I love longer and wider  
Deeper and higher  
Cause I've been loved  
More than anyone deserves  
  
If tomorrow for some reason  
Somehow I could not hear  
In silence there'd be music  
Of a love that's always here  
  
Cause I love longer and wider  
Deeper and higher  
Cause I've been loved  
More than anyone deserves  
  
And if I woke up in heaven  
And I could not feel your touch  
Then I want to be your angel  
And I love you just as much  
  
Cause I love longer and wider  
Deeper and higher  
Cause I've been loved  
  
I've been loved  
I've been loved
