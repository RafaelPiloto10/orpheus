Well I ain't proud of what I'm about to do  
All alone up here with you  
With the picture of your man  
Face down upon the night stand, so he can't see  
And I don't like running all the red lights here  
Every time the coast is clear  
Any time you need my lovin'  
You know I'll come running, faithfully  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause he stays so busy with his money  
And you, you get so lonely when he's gone  
And me, I'm just your temporary lover  
'Til your blues are gone  
I'm the man of the house whenever he ain't home  
  
Now the statues on the side of that big gate  
They're laughing as I drive away  
And I can't keep from thinking  
Are they laughing at your old man or at me  
And the only part that I don't like to play  
Is the part when I get up and go away  
I find it mighty hard  
Just keeping this old heart tucked away  
Cause he stays  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the man of the house  
When your other man ain't home
