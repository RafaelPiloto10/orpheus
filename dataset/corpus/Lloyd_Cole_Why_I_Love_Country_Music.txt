Jane is fine always fine  
We're unhappy most of the time  
We don't talk we don't fight  
I'm just tired she's way past caring  
But she says she is fine  
She tells lies most of the time  
What she needs I don't have  
That's not in the hand that I'm holding  
So we drink spanish wine  
She plays country records until the morning  
This is mine all of mine  
She is not she is not mine  
And I feel fine only when I'm sleeping  
Only with the T. V. On  
She and I and empty wine and whisky bottles  
And she write beneath crumpled sheets  
She is everything I need  
But she would rather be any place but here  
Jane is fine always fine  
We're unhappy most of the time  
We don't talk we don't fight I'm just tired  
She's way past caring  
So we drink spanish wine we tell lies  
We're killing and we feel fine  
Well what's the crime?
