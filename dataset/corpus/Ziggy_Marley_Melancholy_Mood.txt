A little collie weed to ease I grief  
Too much agony living in the limits of big city  
A little collie weed to meditate  
Too much insanity in this society  
  
Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood  
  
Rise this morning smile with the sun  
Oh I'm blessed another day has begun  
Everything in life has its purpose  
Find its reason it has its season  
  
Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood  
  
Tears leave my eyes I just want to fly  
Deep down I feel pain  
But I know I must rise again  
  
From this melancholy mood melancholy mood  
Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood
