Toward another  
He has gone  
To breathe an air  
Beyond his own  
Toward a wisdom  
Beyond the shelf  
Toward a dream  
That dreams itself  
  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
  
From the forest  
From the foam  
From the field  
That he had  
Known  
Toward a river  
Twice as blessed  
Toward the inn  
Of happiness  
  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
  
From a chaos  
Raging sweet  
From the deep  
And dismal street  
Toward another  
Kind of peace  
Toward the great  
Emptiness  
  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
  
[ ]  
I stood among them  
I stood alone  
Boy boy  
Just a boy  
Just a little boy  
[ ]  
Just a little boy  
Who will never grow
