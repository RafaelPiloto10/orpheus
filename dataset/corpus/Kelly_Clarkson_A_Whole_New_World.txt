I can show you the world,  
Shining, shimmering, splendid,  
Tell me, princess, now when did  
You last let your heart decide?  
  
I can open your eyes,  
Take you wonder by wonder,  
Over, sideways and under,  
On a magic carpet ride  
  
A whole new world,  
A new fantastic point of view,  
No one to tell us no,  
Or where to go,  
Or say we're only dreaming  
  
A whole new world,  
A dazzling place I never knew,  
But when I'm way up here,  
It's crystal clear,  
That now I'm in a whole new world with you  
  
Now I'm in a whole new world with you  
  
Unbelievable sights,  
Indescribable feeling,  
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling,  
Through an endless diamond sky  
  
A whole new world
