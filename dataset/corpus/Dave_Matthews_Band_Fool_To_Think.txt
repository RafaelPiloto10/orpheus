Look at me dreaming of you  
All I could hope is to have you  
To have you walking with me  
Laughing so in love, we two  
Almost drunkenly  
I did imbibe of this  
Fantasy of you and me  
  
Was I a fool to think?  
The way you looked at me  
I swear you did  
But you looked away too quick  
Was I a fool, was I a fool to think  
That you would take me home  
As if I was yours  
Was I a fool to think at all?  
  
I've grown tired of love  
You are the trouble with me  
I watch you walk right by  
I smile, you do not notice me  
Treat me recklessly  
All you do is toss me pennies out  
But the silence in me is screaming  
Won't you come and get me?  
  
Was I a fool to think?  
The way you looked at me  
I swear you did  
But you looked away too quick  
Was I a fool, was I a fool to think  
That you would take me home  
As if I was yours  
Was I a fool to think at all?  
  
Was I a fool to think?  
The way you looked at me  
I swear you did  
But you looked away too quick  
Was I a fool, was I a fool to think  
That you would take me home  
As if I was yours  
Was I a fool to think at all?  
  
You make a mess of me here  
I dance a thousand steps for you  
If you say yes to me  
I'll be whatever gets you through  
  
You make a mess of me here (was I a fool?)  
I dance a thousand steps for you (was I a fool?)  
Was I a fool, was I a fool to think?  
Am I a fool, am I a fool for you?
