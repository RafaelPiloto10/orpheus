Last night, quietly, she walked through my mind  
As I lay searching for sleep.  
Her soft hand reached out, she whispered my name  
As she brushed a tear from my cheek.  
And then those funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Started walkin' all over my mind.  
It's sad, so sad to watch love go bad,  
But a true love would not have gone wrong.  
I'm just thankful for the good times we've had  
For without them I could not go on,  
With all these funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Walkin' all over my mind.  
I must go on, be strong,  
Tho' a million teardrops may fall,  
Before these funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Stop walk' all over my mind.
