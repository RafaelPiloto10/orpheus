Way back yonder in the days of old  
The men was working but not saving any dough  
Then came a woman looking real cool  
She said to herself, "Now that's my fool"  
  
I'm gonna ball tonight  
I'm gonna ball tonight  
Well, I can't break the rule because  
Every man is some woman's fool  
  
Met a girl on the avenue  
She was shy and I was blue  
Like a teacher and a student in school  
Looked at me and said, "You're my fool"  
  
I'm gonna ball tonight  
We're gonna ball tonight  
Well, I can't break the rule  
That every man is some woman's fool
