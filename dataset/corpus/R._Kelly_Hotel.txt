Ladies and gentlemen, you are listening to the sounds of Swiss Beatz  
We got Cassidy in here, Kels! We in our throwbacks.  
This is for the ladies, we got room keys.  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl you want to come to my hotel, baby I will leave you my room key.  
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl  
And I want to get with you 'cause you's a cutie  
So if you want to come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holler at me  
'Cause we're having an after party  
Checkin' out 6 in the mornin' (six in the mornin')  
  
I be staying in the hotel, not the motel or the Holiday Inn  
If that girl don't participate, well then I'ma take her friend  
But if, mami is with it then, mami can give if,  
Mami a rider, I'ma, slide up beside her mama  
I got a suite, you can creep on through  
I know you tryin' to get your freak on too,  
I do it all for the (ladies) yeah I ball for the (ladies)  
Hit the mall for the (ladies) keep it fly for the (ladies)  
Keep my eye on the (ladies) hot tub for the (ladies)  
Pop bub' for the (ladies) I got love for my (ladies)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We the new Cartel, R.Kel and the kid Cassidy (say what?)  
Girl if your man start actin' up, ask for him or ask for me (say what?)  
'Cause see, we could go get it crackin, but you know what'll happen,  
We be under the covers, makin' love to each other  
I got a double bed, one's to sleep on  
The other one's to get my freak on, it's all for the (ladies)  
Yeah I ball for the (ladies) Hit the mall for the (ladies)  
Keep it fly for the (ladies) Keep my eye on the (ladies)  
Hot tub for the (ladies) pop bub' for the (ladies)  
I got love for my (ladies)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We gon' Chi-town step it out, 'til the club lettin' out  
Then we gon' sex it out, 'til we all checking out  
I got my chicks I'ma bring to the telly  
We 'bout to do the damn thing, sing to 'em Kelly.  
  
It's alright(it's alright) If you want to come with me  
And fulfill your fantasy, baby in my hotel suite  
And it's OK, if you want to party night 'til day,  
I will do anything you say, just come to my hotel.  
  
[Chorus]
