C'mon, get down, c'mon  
  
This beat is so hypnotic  
Feels like it will be getting  
All of the people on it tonight  
  
I sense the situation  
And let the bass line do it  
And get a new creation for life  
  
City games, people doin' what they do  
Feel the change, through the night  
Slow it down, feelin' kind of a desire  
Got a sound for your loving  
  
My baby gets down when the tempo drops  
Never coming round 'till the music stops  
My baby gets down, baby loves the sound  
  
My baby gets down when the music's right  
I'm losing myself in the city lights  
My baby gets down, baby gets on down  
  
Now that the beat's chaotic  
It's best that we be getting  
A little wicked on it tonight  
  
So come a little closer  
So I can whisper to you  
That's got a twist of what I, I like  
  
City games, people doin' what they do  
Feel the change, through the night  
Slow it down, feeling kind of a desire  
Got a sound for your loving  
  
My baby gets down when the tempo drops  
Never coming 'round 'till the music stops  
My baby gets down, baby loves the sound  
  
My baby gets down when the music's right  
I'm losing myself in the city lights  
My baby gets down, baby gets on down  
  
City games, people doin' what they do  
Feel the change, through the night  
Slow it down, feeling kind of a desire  
Got a sound for your loving  
  
My baby gets down when the tempo drops  
Never coming 'round 'till the music stops  
My baby gets down, baby loves the sound  
  
My baby gets down when the music's right  
I'm losing myself in the city lights  
My baby gets down, baby gets on down  
  
My baby gets down when the tempo drops  
Never coming 'round 'till the music stops  
My baby gets down, baby loves the sound  
  
My baby gets down when the music's right  
I'm losing myself in the city lights  
My baby gets down, baby gets on down  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby
