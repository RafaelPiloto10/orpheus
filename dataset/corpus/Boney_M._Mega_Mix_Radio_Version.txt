By the rivers of babylon,where we sat down  
Yeah we wept, remembered zion  
Yeah we wept, remembered zion  
When the wicked carried us away in captivity  
Required from us a song  
Now, how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land  
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain  
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain  
The dark days are gone and the bright days are here  
My sunny one shines so sincere  
Sunny, one so true, I love you  
Freeze  
I'm ma baker, but yer han"s in the air an' gimme all yer money  
  
She's crazy, like a fool what about daddy cool  
Daddy, daddy cool, daddy, daddy cool  
Daddy, daddy cool daddy, daddy cool  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey  
  
There lived a certain man in russia long ago  
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow  
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear  
But the moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear  
He could preach the bible like a preacher, full of ecstasy and fire  
But, he also was a kind of teacher in them put desire  
  
Ra ra rasputin  
Lover of the russian queen  
They put some poison in his wine  
Ra ra rasputin  
Russia's greatest love machine  
He drank it all an' set up in fire  
  
Ra ra rasputin  
Lover of the russian queen  
They didn't quit, they wanted his head  
Ra ra rasputin  
Russia's greatest love machine  
An' so they shot him 'til he was dead  
O those Russians
