Yours 'til the stars lose their glory  
Yours 'til the birds fail to sing  
Yours to the end of life's story  
This pledge to you dear, I bring  
  
Yours in the grey of December  
Here or on far distant shores  
  
I've never loved anyone the way I love you  
How could I, when I was born to be  
Just yours  
  
This night has music, the sweetest music  
It echoes somewhere within my heart  
I hold you near me, oh darling hear me  
I have a message I must impart  
  
Just yours  
When I was born to be just yours
