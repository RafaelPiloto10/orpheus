When you feel safe  
When you feel warm  
That's when I rise  
That's when I crawl  
  
Gliding on mist  
Hardly a sound  
Bring the kiss  
Evils abound  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
Love bites  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
  
Into your room  
Where in deep sleep  
There you lie still  
To you I creep  
  
Then I descend  
Close to your lips  
Across you I bend  
You smile as I sip  
  
Now you are mine  
In my control  
One taste of your life  
And I own your soul  
  
Softly you stir  
Gently you moan  
Lust's in the air  
Wake as I groan  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
Love bites  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
  
Love bites you  
Invites you  
To feast in the night  
Excites you  
Delights you  
It drains you to white  
Love bites  
  
You knew at first sight  
You'd enjoy my attack  
That with my first bite  
There'd be no turning back  
  
So come in my arms  
I strike any hour  
I will return  
To trap and devour  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites
