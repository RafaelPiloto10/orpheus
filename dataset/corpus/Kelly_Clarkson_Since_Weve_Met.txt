My life has been full of mistakes and regrets for that I know  
But without you I feel so cold  
I'm an idiot for making the mistakes I did but will you forgive me?  
Will you forgive me, my love please forgive me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Coz since we've met  
There is something in my life worth fighting for  
God never thought I'd actually find it  
But here it is  
Here you are  
Since we've met  
I found myself more then I ever could of  
God bless your soul, God bless your soul...  
  
Your life I'm not to certain about the regrets I know of  
But with you not here I can't see clear  
You found me on that day tattered and ever so lonely  
And gave me a little smirk  
So please be with me, be with me. My love be with me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
What would I do without you?  
Probably die.  
What would I be without you?  
A lonely soul  
Guys have jerked me round before and I'm well over it but with you here you
break my fall.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oooooooh yeah. Woaaaaah.  
Be mine, be mine, be mine.  
Since we've met  
I... Am... Me.
