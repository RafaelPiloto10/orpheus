Oh stairs ... you look so high tonight  
CLIMBIN' UP with all my might  
Where I got no heart to be  
'Cause he ain't comin' home no more.  
  
Oh room ... I'm all alone with you  
Tell me what's a women to do  
When her man is gone  
And he ain't comin' home no more.  
  
I'm all choked up ... inside me  
Try'na hold back my tears  
You know ... I just can't GET USED  
I just can't USED TO this loneliness  
How AM I gonna face the empty years.  
  
Oh chair ... Oh chair  
You sittin' silent there  
Don't you even care  
That my baby's gone ... yea, yea  
And he ain't comin' home no more  
  
Yes ... for my baby's gone  
And he ain't comin' home no more
