No man, no madness  
Though their sad power may prevail  
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart  
They rise to fail  
  
She is eternal  
Long before nations' lines were drawn  
When no flags flew, when no armies stood  
My land was born  
  
And you ask me why I love her  
Through wars, death and despair  
She is the constant, we who don't care  
And you wonder will I leave her - but how?  
I cross over borders but I'm still there now  
  
How can I leave her?  
Where would I start?  
Let man's petty nations tear themselves apart  
My land's only borders lie around my heart
