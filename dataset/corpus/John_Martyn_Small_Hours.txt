You've been taking your time and you've been living on solid air  
You've been walking the line and you've been living on solid air  
Don't know what's going 'round inside  
And I can tell you that it's hard to hide when you're living on solid air  
  
You've been painting the blues and you've been looking through solid air  
You've been seeing it through and you've been looking through solid air  
Don't know what's going 'round in your mind  
And I can tell you don't like what you find when you're moving through solid
air  
  
I know you, I love you  
And I can be your friend, I can follow you anywhere  
Even through solid air  
  
You've been stoning it cold, you've been living on solid air  
You've been finding it cold, you've been living on solid air  
I don't know what's going on inside  
I can tell you that it's hard to hide when you're living on solid air  
  
You've been getting too deep, you've been living on solid air  
You've been missing your sleep and you've been moving through solid air  
I don't know what's going on in your mind  
But I know you don't like what you find when you're moving through solid air  
  
You've been walking your line, you've been walking on solid air  
You've been taking your time but you've been walking on solid air  
Don't know what's going on inside  
But I can tell you that it's hard to hide when you're living on solid air
