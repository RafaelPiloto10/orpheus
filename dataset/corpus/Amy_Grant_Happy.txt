I wanna look behind your eyes  
And gently brush the hair back from the face  
Cause baby I just realized  
Seeing you there in that light  
Is better to be kind and right  
And I'm about to bridge this kiss between us  
  
'Cause baby I'm ready to dig in  
Ready for more than skin on skin  
This is where love begins  
So I say  
  
I'm gonna tell you bout my man  
'cause it makes you happy  
I wanna brush to hold your hand  
Why know it makes me happy  
I'm gonna love you best I can  
'Cause I know it makes you happy  
  
I know I've made some big mistakes  
I learned the hardest lessons that await  
So adios to foolish pride  
I've got nothing left to hide  
I stand here open wide  
And everything inside of me is saying  
  
Baby I'm ready to dig in  
Ready for more than skin on skin  
This is where love begins  
So I say  
  
I'm gonna tell you you're my man  
'Cause it makes you happy  
I wanna rush to hold your hand  
It makes me so happy  
I'm gonna love you best I can  
'Cause I know it makes you happy  
Oh, why know I'll make you happy  
And I wanna see you happy  
  
I want us to be happy  
  
And we're going to be happy  
  
'Cause baby I'm ready to dig in  
Ready for more than skin on skin  
This is where love begins  
  
I wanna rush to hold your hand  
I wanna see you happy  
I'm gonna love you best I can  
'Cause why know it makes you happy  
Oh, why know I'll make you happy  
Why know I wanna see you happy  
  
I'm gonna tell you you're my man  
I wanna hear you laughing  
I wanna rush to hold your hand  
And I love your smile  
I'm gonna love you best I can  
'Cause that's what makes me happy  
Oh why know I'll make you happy  
And I want us to be happy  
  
I'm gonna tell you you're my man  
I wanna rush to hold your hand  
I'm gonna love you best I can  
'Cause I know it makes you happy
