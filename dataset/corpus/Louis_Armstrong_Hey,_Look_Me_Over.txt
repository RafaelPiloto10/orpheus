Hey look me over  
Lend me an ear  
Fresh out of clover  
Mortgage up to here  
But don't pass the plate folks  
Don't pass the cup  
I figure whenever you're down and out  
The only way is up  
  
And I'll be up like a rose bud  
High on the vine  
Don't thumb your nose  
But take a tip from mine  
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room  
But let me get me some  
And look out world  
Here I come  
  
Yes, hey look me over  
Lend me an ear  
Fresh out of clover  
Mortgage up to here  
But don't pass the plate folks  
Don't pass the cup  
I figure whenever you're down and out  
The only way is up  
  
And I'll be up like a rose bud  
High on the vine  
Don't thumb your nose  
But take a tip from mine  
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room  
But let me get me some  
And look out, world  
Here, I, come...
