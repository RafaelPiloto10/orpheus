Take all your overgrown infants away somewhere  
And build them a home, a little place of their own.  
The Fletcher Memorial  
Home for Incurable Tyrants and Kings.  
  
And they can appear to themselves every day  
On closed circuit T.V.  
To make sure they're still real.  
It's the only connection they feel.  
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, Reagan and Haig,  
Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher, and Paisly,  
"Hello Maggie!"  
Mr. Brezhnev and party.  
"Who's the bald chap?"  
The ghost of McCarthy,  
The memories of Nixon.  
"Good-bye!"  
And now, adding color, a group of anonymous latin-  
American Meat packing glitterati.  
  
Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?  
They can polish their medals and sharpen their  
Smiles, and amuse themselves playing games for awhile.  
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead.  
  
Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye  
With their favorite toys  
They'll be good girls and boys  
In the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial  
Wasters of life and limb.  
  
Is everyone in?  
Are you having a nice time?  
Now the final solution can be applied.
