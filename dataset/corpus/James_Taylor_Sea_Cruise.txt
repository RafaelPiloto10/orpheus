The old man rhythm's gotten in my shoes  
Know you're sittin' here and singing the blues  
So be my guest you got nothing to loose  
Won't you let me take you on a see cruise  
  
I said  
Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe  
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise  
  
I feel like jumping babe won't you join me please  
Oh babe please  
I don't like digging but now I'm on that need  
  
I've got to get the rocking get my hat off the rack  
The boogie woogie's got me like a knife in a back  
I said be my guest you got nothing to loose  
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise  
  
I said  
Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe  
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise  
  
I've got to get the moving babe I ain't lying  
My heart is beating rhythm and it's right on time  
Be my guest you got nothing to loose  
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise  
  
Come on  
Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe  
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise  
  
I feel like jumping babe won't you join me please  
Come on please  
I don't like digging but now I'm on that need  
  
Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe  
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
