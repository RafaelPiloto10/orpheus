Now darling, you should know  
That I'm really, really in love with you  
Although you don't belong to me, darling  
My heart will always belong to you  
There are many, many things all around me  
That will always remind me of you  
I know I'll never forget you darling  
My heart will always belong to you  
Since you've been gone, darling  
Life for me has been so blue  
I guess I'll have to go it alone  
Because my heart will always belong to you  
Although, although I cannot see you  
I could never, never stop lovin' you  
I just hope and pray you'll come back to me, darling  
'Cause my heart will always belong to you
