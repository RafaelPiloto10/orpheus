Day after day, I feel myself slowing down, what does it mean?  
The air has changed, it's getting harder to breathe, or so it would seem  
Sail me away to a distant shore, where every thing's fine  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
A thousand years, lost in the blink of an eye  
If the sky keeps falling, the world will come tumbling down  
In a thousand years  
  
Tell me my friend, can you imagine a place free of boundaries and lies  
There's blood on the wind and it's come all of the way from faraway skies  
Take me away to a different world where every thing's fine  
  
A thousand years, one day for every life  
Just keep on going, we'll find you a home underground, in a thousand years  
  
Sail me away to a distant shore, where every thing's fine  
  
A thousand years, one day for every life  
Just keep on going, we'll find you a home underground, in a thousand years
