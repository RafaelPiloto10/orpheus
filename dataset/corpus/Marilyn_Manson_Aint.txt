I don't care if your world is ending today  
Because I wasn't invited to it anyway  
You said I tasted famous so I drew you a heart  
But now I'm not an artist, I'm a fucking work of art  
  
I got an F and a C, and I got a K too  
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like u  
  
You wanted perfect, you got your perfect  
Now I'm too perfect for someone like you  
I was a dandy in your ghetto with a snow white smile  
But you'll never be as perfect whatever you do  
  
What's my name? What's my name?  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Hold the S because I am an ain't  
  
What's my name? What's my name?  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Hold the S because I am an ain't  
  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
  
I am bone top, a deathset, on a mop stick  
You infected me to diamonds, I took all your shit  
Your sell-by-date expired so you had to be sold  
I'm a suffer-genius and then a sex symbol  
  
You wanted perfect, you got your perfect  
Now I'm too perfect for someone like you  
I was a dandy in your ghetto with a snow white smile  
But you'll never be as perfect whatever you do  
  
What's my name? What's my name?  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Hold the S because I am an ain't  
  
What's my name? What's my name?  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Hold the S because I am an ain't  
  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
  
I got an F and a C, and I got a K too  
And the only thing that's missing is u  
  
I got an F and a C, and I got a K too  
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like u  
  
I got an F and a C, and I got a K too  
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like u  
  
I am the penny in your ghetto with a snow white smile  
Super ego-bitch, I've been evil a while  
  
I am a dandy in your ghetto with a snow white smile  
Super ego-bitch, I've been evil a while  
  
What's my name? What's my name?  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Hold the S because I am an ain't  
  
What's my name? What's my name?  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Hold the S because I am an ain't  
  
What's my name? What's my name?  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Hold the S because I am an ain't  
  
What's my name? What's my name?  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah  
Hold the S because I am an ain't
