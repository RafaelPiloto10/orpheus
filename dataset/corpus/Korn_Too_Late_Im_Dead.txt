Demanding the best psychiatrist, psychic soothsayers  
(Soothsayers)  
Analyzing my instincts, you got I all figured out  
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, you should have said  
I would have hung around a little longer  
Too late I'm dead, you should have said  
I would have hung around a little longer, too late I'm dead  
Fuck everything, everything, everything  
How could you love someone with what they've done? Now  
Done everything, everything, everything  
How could you love someone with what they've done? Now  
Fuck everything, everything, everything  
How could you love someone with what they've done? Now  
Known everything, everything, everything  
How could you love someone with what they've done? Now  
Too late, I'm dead, I made my bed, you should too  
Belong right beside me, the beast is mad, the patient's hanging out  
The trees have all burnt to the ground in this vicinity  
It's a strange retribution to be lying here, so close to what I despise  
Fuck everything, everything, everything  
How could you love someone with what they've done? Now  
Done everything, everything, everything

Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead  
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead  
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, too late
