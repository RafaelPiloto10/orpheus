I sat in the window of my room  
Watched you go away  
It was all I could do  
It was all I could do  
  
Your going away  
To leave me alone  
In all of this sorrow  
In this misery  
  
So look now, my darling  
I'll have to abandon  
All thought of you  
As your going away  
  
I still see your dear little head  
As it touched mine  
Saying goodbye, forever goodbye  
Those words you said to me have broken my heart  
Yes, they've broken my heart  
They were false and did lie  
  
Goodbye, my dear  
Goodbye forever  
Your going away  
Your going away  
  
Death is hard  
But your leaving is worse  
Oh yes, my dear  
Your leaving is worse  
  
Your going, my dear  
Your going forever  
And leaving me all alone with this grief  
  
So how, my dear  
How will I forget you  
When I see your face wherever I go  
When I close my eyes  
It's as though I see you  
Your beautiful blue eyes, your beautiful lie  
  
I sat in the window of my room,  
An' I watched you go away,  
It was all I could do,  
It was all I could do
