I feel the hunger you feel in your touch  
Burnin' my body and soul  
And it's freightnin' just wantin' somebody so much  
So close to losin' control  
But darlin', don't make me surrender too soon  
I'm so afraid of the fall  
Please give it time to be tender  
And pretend that it won't hurt at all  
Slowly, be gentle  
Each step of the way  
I've never been loved before.  
Let me believe  
You won't turn away  
After I've opened the door  
But darlin', don't make me surrender too soon  
I'm so afraid of the fall  
Please give it time to be tender  
And pretend it won't hurt at all  
Please give it time to be tender  
And pretend it won't hurt at all
