Nice to see  
Nice to see you, I've been feeling so blue  
Owning up now 'cause you change my point of view  
It's funny how you do what you do  
It's a very good sign, a really good line for you  
I've been waiting for the heat of the night  
Warming up now and you've got me in your sights  
So tell me what you want me to do  
It's a very good time to tell you I've been thinking of you  
Because you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby  
It's a very good sign, a very good time of life  
Let me tell you, you're a woman with style  
I've been waiting, but you made it all worthwhile  
And all you had to do was to smile  
You're a very good sign and everything's fine, my child  
'cause you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby  
It's a very good sign, a very good time of life, ooh  
Set in my ways I live from day to day happy to be free, hey  
Needing for nothing, always looking for someone who could make me see  
But baby, I was so wrong, I sat here waiting too long  
To have you here with me, oh  
'cause you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby  
It's a very good sign, a very good time of life  
'cause you're wonderful baby and you're beautiful, baby  
It's a very good sign, a very good time of life, oh  
Oh, it's a very good sign, oh yeah, a very good sign  
Yeah, it's a very good time, oh, very good time  
Oh yeah, a very good sign, oh yeah, a very good sign  
Oh, it's a very, very good sign, oh yeah, a very good sign
