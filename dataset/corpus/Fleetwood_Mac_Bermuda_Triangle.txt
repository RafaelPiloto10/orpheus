I guess you've heard about the bermuda triangle  
There's something going on  
Nobody seems to know just what it is  
And the airforce won't let on  
It might be hole down in the ocean  
Yeah or a fog that won't let go  
It might be some crazy people talking  
Or somebody that we ought to know  
Down in bermuda, the pale blue sea  
Way down in the triangle, it's easy to believe  
Now here's one  
You see strange shapes in moonlight  
And shadows in the night  
They said that wingtip seemed to brush their faces  
And strangers stole their sight  
Way down in the triangle  
Where the sea was smooth as glass  
Giving you one answer to a question  
That you never thought you'd ask  
Ah down in bermuda, in the pale blue sea  
Way down in bermuda, yeah it's easy to believe  
Down in the triangle, it's easy to believe  
They came from galveston  
They came from new orleans  
And then from bloomington, and delaware  
The used st. petersburg, they came from tampa  
And then from mexico, it doesn't matter where  
They all completely share,  
All of those ships and planes,  
A great big mystery that cannot be explained,  
Down in bermuda, in the pale blue sea  
Your feeling safe in your harbour  
And everything seems certain  
Right next to palm beach and key biscane  
Behind a velvet curtain  
But then the moon goes grey with worry  
And the sea turns a pale white  
You better believe something strange is going on tonight  
Down in bermuda, ah, the pale blue sea  
Bermuda triangle, yeah, it's easy to believe  
Down in the triangle, it's easy to believe  
They came from galveston  
They came from new orleans  
And then from bloomington, and delaware  
Bermuda, the pale blue sea
