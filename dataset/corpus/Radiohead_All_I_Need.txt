I'm the next act  
Waiting in the wings  
I'm an animal  
Trapped in your parked car  
I am holidays  
That you choose to ignore  
  
You are all I need  
You are all I need  
I'm in the middle of your picture  
Lying in the leaves  
  
I am a moth  
Who just wants to share your light  
I'm just an insect  
Trying to get out of the night  
  
I only stick with you  
Because there are no others  
  
You are all I need  
You are all I need  
I'm in the middle of your picture  
Lying in the leaves  
  
It's all wrong  
It's all right  
It's all wrong
