There's love in the air  
Well, can you feel it now?  
There's love in the air, and that's nice  
  
You're learnin' a lot  
About each other's ways  
You're learnin' a lot, ain't that right?  
  
You work like a dog to try and get it good  
You work with your heart, every day  
You know when you're through  
You're gonna take your friend and get away  
  
To Acapulco (to Acapulco)  
That's where they'll find us  
In sunny blue waters  
Where the sand is warm and friendly  
  
Hey Acapulco, (hey Acapulco)  
I hear you softly calling  
We're sailing around the horn of love  
To Acapulco  
  
It's good and it's bad  
When things are going right  
It's good and it's bad, when they swing  
But you know that you're glad  
You finally get it right  
You know that you're glad, so you sing  
  
But at seventy two, it's hard to get around  
At seventy two, but not now  
It's me and it's you and we can get around  
'Cause we know how  
  
In Acapulco, (in Acapulco)  
That's where they'll find us  
In sunny blue waters  
Where the sand is warm and friendly  
  
Hey Acapulco, (hey Acapulco)  
I hear you softly calling  
We're sailing around the horn of love  
To Acapulco  
We're sailing around the horn of love  
To Acapulco
