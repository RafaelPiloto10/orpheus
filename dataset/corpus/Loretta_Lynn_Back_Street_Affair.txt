You didn't know I wasn't free when you fell in love with me  
And with all your young heart you learned to care  
It brought you shame and disgrace the world has tumbled in your place  
For they call our love a back street affair  
They say you wrecked my home I'm a husband that's gone wrong  
They don't know the sorrow that we have to bear  
For the one that I'm tied to was the first to prove untrue  
Yet they call our love a back street affair  
[ fiddle ]  
Sweetheart I always knew when I fell in love with you  
The heartaches that we would have to bear  
I knew a call gets around and that all over town  
They would call our love a back street affair  
They say I wrecked your life and brought sorrow to your wife  
That I was just a girl who didn't seem to care  
But if they only knew how she slips around on you  
They wouldn't call our love a back street affair  
When the mist rolls away we'll be free to love some day  
And find happiness that we were made to share  
We'll climb a mountain high and the world will hear us cry  
That our love is not a back street affair
