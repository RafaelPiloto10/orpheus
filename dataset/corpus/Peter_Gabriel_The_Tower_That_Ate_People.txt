There's a bump in the basement  
There's a knocking on the wall  
In the pumping of the pistons  
I swear I heard your call  
There's a bump in the basement  
There's a hole in the floor  
There's a guard in the garden  
Locking up the door  
  
There's a rumble in the floorboards  
No shutting out the sound  
And the workers are below me  
Digging underground  
Feel the building all around me  
Like a wrap of armoured skin  
But the more we are protected  
The more we're trapped within  
  
Tell it like it is  
Till there's no misunderstanding  
When You strip it right back  
Man feed machine  
Machine feed man  
  
Tell it like it is  
Till there's no misunderstanding  
Make up what you like  
Man feed machine  
Machine feed man  
  
Brick by brick  
Brick by brick  
Brick by brick  
We're building
