Ooh na na, what's my name  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
What's my name, what's my name  
  
I heard you good with them soft lips  
Yeah you know word of mouth  
The square root of sixty nine is eight something, right?  
'Cause I've been tryna work it out, ow  
Good weed, white wine, uh  
I come alive in the night time  
Okay, away we go  
Only thing we have on is the radio-oh  
Let it play, say you gotta leave  
But I know you wanna stay  
You are waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl  
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl  
Say my name, say my name  
Wear it out, its getting hot, crack a window, air it out  
I can get you through a mighty long day  
Soon as I go the text you goin' right is goin' say  
  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
Whats my name, whats my name  
  
Nor everybody,  
Knows how to work my body  
Knows how to make me want it  
But boy you stay up on it  
You got that something  
That keeps me so off balance  
Baby you're a challenge  
Lets explore your talent  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey boy I wanna see  
If you can go downtown with a girl like me  
Hey boy, I wanna be with you  
'Cause you just my type  
Ooh na na na na  
I need a boy to take it over  
Looking for a guy to put your work up  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Hey boy I really wanna see  
If you can go downtown with a girl like me  
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you  
'Cause you just my type  
  
Ooh na na na na

Looking for a guy to put in work-a  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
Ooh na na, what's my name  
Whats my name, whats my name  
  
Baby you got me,  
And ain't nowhere that I'd be  
Then with your arms around me  
Back and forth you rock me yeah  
So I surrender, to every word you whisper  
Every door you enter, I will let you in  
  
Hey boy I really wanna see  
If you can go downtown with a girl like me  
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you  
'Cause you just my type  
Ooh na na na na  
I need a boy to take it over  
Looking for a guy to put in work-a  
Ooh, ooh  
  
You're so amazing,  
You took the time to figure me out  
That's why you take me,  
Way past the point of turning me on  
You bout to break me,  
I swear you got me losing my mind  
  
Ooh na na, what's my name

Looking for a guy to put in work-a
