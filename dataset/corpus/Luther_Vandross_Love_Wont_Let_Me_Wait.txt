I need to have you next to me in more ways than one  
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin' sun  
  
The time is right, you hold me tight  
And love's got me high  
Please tell me, 'Yes' and don't say, 'No'  
Honey, not tonight  
  
Move a little close to me, you owe it to yourself  
And I will selfishly take a little for myself  
And it's because of you  
That love won't let me wait  
  
Yeah, yeah  
  
The time is right, turn down the lights  
And take my hand, ooh, ooh, yeah  
We'll take a flight and spend the night  
In wonderland  
  
And I need to have you next to me in more ways than one  
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin' sun  
Creep through your window pane  
Because love won't let me wait  
Not another minute  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
  
And I need your love so desperately and only you can set me free  
When I make to you, we'll explode in ecstasy  
And I won't take the blame  
That love won't let me wait  
  
Love won't, no, no, no  
Love won't, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no  
(Love won't let me wait)  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Love won't  
I said  
(Love won't let me wait)  
  
My baby  
My temperature's risin', ooh  
(Love won't let me wait) Won't let me  
  
Not another minute  
(Love won't let me wait) Won't let me  
  
Baby, baby  
(I can't wait) I can't wait (I can't wait) I can't wait, I can't wait (I can't
wait)  
I can't wait, no, no, no, can't wait  
(Wait) No way, no way, no, no, no, no  
No way, no way, no, no  
(Doo,ooh,) Ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,yeah  
(Wait) I cant wait not another minute  
Not another minute (I can't wait, I can't wait) I'll be there (I can't wait)
yes, I will  
I'll be there
