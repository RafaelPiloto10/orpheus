In a couple of hours I'll be drivin' home to the one I love  
So save your breath sweet painted lady it won't be me  
Over the mountain and under the sea  
They'll never be another one like mine for me  
  
It was only an hour or so ago that I sang my song  
Persuaded painted ladies that I could say I'd been free  
Over the mountain and under the sea  
They'll never be another one like mine for me  
  
Mine is always, mine is grand  
Don't you know that the woman that love me she understands  
And can't you see that it's mine for me  
And in a couple of hours I'll be driving home to the one I love  
So save your breath sweet painted lady it won't be me  
Over the mountain and under the sea  
They'll never be another one like mine for me  
You're for me  
  
Mine is always, mine is grand  
Don't you know that the woman that love me she understands  
And can't you see that it's mine for me  
They'll never be another one like mine for me  
They'll never be another one like mine for me  
They'll never be another one like you for me
