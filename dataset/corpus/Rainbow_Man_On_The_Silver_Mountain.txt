I'm a wheel, I'm a wheel  
I can roll, I can feel  
And you can't stop me turning  
Cause I'm the sun, I'm the sun  
I can move, I can run  
But you'll never stop me burning  
Come down with fire  
Lift my spirit higher  
Someone's screaming my name  
Come and make me holy again  
  
I'm the man on the silver mountain  
I'm the man on the silver mountain  
I'm the day, I'm the day  
I can show you the way  
And look I'm right beside you  
I'm the night, I'm the night  
I'm the dark and the light  
With eyes that see inside you  
Come down with fire  
Lift my spirit higher  
Someone's screaming my name  
Come and make me holy again  
  
I'm the man on the silver mountain  
I'm the man on the silver mountain  
Come down with fire  
Lift my spirit higher  
Someone's screaming my name  
Come and make me holy again  
  
I'm the man on the silver mountain  
I'm the man on the silver mountain  
Well, I can help you, you know I can,  
  
I'm the man on the silver mountain  
I'm the man on the silver mountain  
Just look at me and listen  
I'm the man, the man, give you my hand  
I'm the man on the silver mountain.  
Come down with fire  
Lift your spirit higher  
I'm the man on the mountain  
I'm the man on the silver mountain  
I'm the night and the light  
I'm the black and the white  
The man on the silver mountain
