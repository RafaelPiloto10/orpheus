I thought a desires worth any pleasure,  
Can never really be a sin in vain  
One hundred and one shots of opportunity,  
I'd gladly take them all again and again and again  
  
My angel's left me, sorrows are my own  
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own  
Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
  
I promised on my soul, not to get carried away  
It always starts on psychedelic, and then it turns to black  
My head starts swaying, I forgot what was that I was saying  
I don't know where I am, and I'll never, never make it back  
  
I sealed my fate, and I paid my debt  
I fell from grace with deep regret  
  
My angel's left me, sorrows are my own  
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own  
Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
  
My angel's left me, sorrows are my own  
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own  
On my own  
  
Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
  
Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me  
There's nothing left to see, there's nothing left of me
