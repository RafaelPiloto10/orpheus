You can take it to the country you can take it to town  
Take it on the run in the back of some car  
Take it too far if you leave it all around  
Someday you're gonna lose it baby now now  
CHORUS  
You better lay it down  
Right where I can see it  
Lay it down  
You gotta lay it down  
Show me that you mean it  
Lay it down  
You can see it on fire you can burn it to the ground  
You can take it down to hell and back to heaven again  
But I won't take it back if you leave it all around  
To all the king horses and all the king s men  
You better lay it down  
Right where I can see it  
Lay it down  
You gotta lay it downshow me that you mean it  
Lay it down  
You can take it to the country take it to town  
You can take it too far if you leave it all around  
You better lay it down  
Right where I can see it  
Lay it down  
Lay it down  
Right where I can see it  
Lay it down  
Show me that you mean it
