[Bridge 1: Lil Wayne]  
I woke up in that pussy and starting stroking  
You woke up and said "Go baby"  
She said fuck me hard, don't take it easy on me  
Don't do me no favors  
No neighbors  
Pussy like water, got no smell ain't got no flavor  
She treat the tip of my dick like a waitress  
She doing tricks on my dick cause I'm a skater  
  
[Verse 1: Christina Milian]  
We've been drinkin' and they've been talkin'  
But we ain't worried, we just look the other way  
It's time to roll up and get it started

Right in the skate park, riding on your skateboard

So I'ma wear that ass out all night  
You get hard dick all day, pussy always tight  
And warmer than The North Face
