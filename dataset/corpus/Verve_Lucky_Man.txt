Happiness  
More or less  
It's just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
Oh, my, my  
Happiness  
Coming and going  
I watch you look at me  
Watch my fever growing  
I know just where I am  
  
But how many corners do I have to turn?  
How many times do I have to learn  
All the love I have is in my mind?  
  
Well, I'm a lucky man  
With fire in my hands  
  
Happiness  
Something in my own place  
I'm standing naked  
Smiling, I feel no disgrace  
With who I am  
  
Happiness  
Coming and going  
I watch you look at me  
Watch my fever growing  
I know just who I am  
  
But how many corners do I have to turn?  
How many times do I have to learn  
All the love I have is in my mind?  
  
I hope you understand  
I hope you understand  
  
Gotta love that'll never die

Gotta love that'll never die  
No, no  
I'm a lucky man  
  
It's just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
It's just a change in me
