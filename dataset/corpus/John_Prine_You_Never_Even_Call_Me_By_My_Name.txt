[spoken] This is a song I wrote with John Prine 4 years ago (1972) and we
tried to put into one song, everything that had ever been in any of the
country and western songs we had ever heard. Tried to put it all into one
song. Serves us right. This is what came out:  
  
Well it was all I could do to keep from cryin'  
Some times it seems so useless to remain  
You're the one who always tried to change me  
And that is why I will always stay the same  
  
Chorus:  
But I'll hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by my name  
  
No, you don't have to call me Freddy Fender  
You don't have to call me Charlie Pride  
You don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore  
Even though you know you're on my fighting side  
  
Chorus- this verse only:  
And I'm gonna hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain (when nights are cold and lonely)  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by name.  
  
[musical by mouth improv done in a Merle Haggard-like tone -no words]  
  
[spoken] I've seen my name, a few times in the phone book  
[spoken] And on the neon sign above the bar I used to own  
[spoken] And there's only one thing I'm really sure of was that sucker  
You're gonna hear it when my savior calls me home  
  
[spoken] That's a lot to get into one song. We left out all the good stuff.
Dallas, dope, divorce, dead dogs, trains prison Christmas, mothers, farms, and
trucks. Mothers, prison, trucks, trains, farms, Christmas, and dead dogs are
essential, you can't have a good country song without them things. And with
all due respect this song needs mothers, prison, trucks, trains, farms,
Christmas and dead dogs and is that it? Whatever it is - it's also 4 minutes
long already (they're going 'when's he gonna end, when's he gonna end in the
booth back there') So I'll just tack this verse on the end here-  
  
Ever since the dog died and mama went to prison  
Ain't nothin' round this old farm that's been the same  
[Spoken] You know when mom broke out last Christmas  
She drove the getaway laundry truck into a train  
  
Chorus:  
But I'll hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by my name
