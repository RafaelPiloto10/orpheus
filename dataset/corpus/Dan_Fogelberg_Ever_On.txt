May the trail rise up to meet you  
May your heart rejoice in song  
May the skies be fair above you  
As you journey ever on  
  
Ever on--ever on  
Ever on--ever on  
  
And in this planetary circle  
We are but a single stone  
Spinning on our fragile axis  
Through the endless night along  
  
Ever on--ever on  
  
May your love be there to guide us  
May it always keep us strong  
May we walk within your footsteps  
As you lead us ever on  
  
Ever on--ever on
