Come a little closer it's a feeling that I can't deny  
I was weak, but I never thought I'd speak about the darker site  
Is that a tent? I could repent upon the side of the road  
But, I kept on going yeah I headed for another load  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground in the middle of the night  
Oh, I testify  
  
I was laid upon the grave by a preacher's hand I cannot lie  
And, I forsake the many vows I made to be with you tonight  
Could you be the salvation cause I never felt like this before  
And, could you lend me your hand because I'm falling back on the floor  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground in the middle of the night  
Oh, I testify  
  
On a road outside of nowhere, in the middle of the night  
Well I guess I hit rock bottom and the dawn was not in sight  
And a Tempest made of fire, onset the sky aglow  
And a sweet young thing called out my name  
And this is how it goes, she says...  
"Go boy, can you hear them?  
Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes?"  
And I got down on my knees  
  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground and I'm falling back down  
Up from the ground and I testify  
  
Every cut that heals reveals a scar that you can never hope to hide  
All the pain that you restrain keeps building up deep inside  
If you think you're above it then it's you my friend that I implore  
You've got to walk before you run  
See the night before dawn  
Before you pull yourself off the floor  
  
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning  
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening  
Up from the ground in the middle of the night  
Oh, I testify
