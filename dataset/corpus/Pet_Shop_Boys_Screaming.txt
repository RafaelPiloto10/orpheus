I've watched you from a distance  
I've passed you on the street  
I''m obsessed with you  
I don't know what to do  
To make you pay attention  
and fall in love with me  
I'm obsessed with you  
I don't know what to do  
  
Guess there's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
There's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
  
I've called you from the corner  
You don't pick up the phone  
I'm depressed by you  
I don't know what to do  
To make you understand me  
To hear you speak my name  
I''m impressed with you  
I could impress you too  
  
Guess there's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
There's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
  
I've explained it in my letters  
I'm miserable as sin  
I''m obsessed with you  
What am I gonna do?  
  
Guess there's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside  
There's no place to hide  
when you're screaming inside
