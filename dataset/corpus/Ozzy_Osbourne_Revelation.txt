Mother please forgive them  
For they know not what they do  
Looking back in history's books  
It seems it's nothing new  
Oh! Let my mother live  
  
Heaven is for heroes  
All hell is full of fools  
Stupidity, no will to live  
They're breaking God's own rules  
Please let my mother live  
  
Father, of all creation  
I think we're all going wrong  
The course they're taking  
Seems to be breaking  
And it won't take too long  
  
Children of the future  
Watching empires fall  
Madness the cup they drink from  
Self-destruction the toll  
  
I had a vision,  
I saw the world burn  
And the seas had turned red  
The sun had fallen,  
The final curtain  
In the land of the dead  
  
Mother, please show the children  
Before it's too late  
To fight each other,  
There's no one winning  
We must fight all the hate
