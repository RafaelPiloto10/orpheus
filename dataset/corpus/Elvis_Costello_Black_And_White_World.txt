I was looking at the black and white world  
It seemed so exciting  
If you'd only put me back to back with that girl  
When the night's inviting  
With just a little lighting  
There'll never be days like that again  
When I was just a boy and men were men  
You never go from moment to moment  
You're the living double of a single fiction  
You're very colourful with your compliments  
As you feel the finger's friction  
It's a freeze-frame  
Still it's real life  
You don't want to look  
Cause you've seen the film and you've read the book  
I was looking at the black and white world  
Trying to name some pin-up  
Those days she was just a beautiful girl  
Now she's framed and hung up  
I thought she was young  
Up until I saw her last night in close detail  
Though they all fade away when you're so pale  
It's more than just a physical attraction  
It starts with a face and ends up a fixation  
But you're never gonna feel a fraction  
Of the way it used to work on your imagination  
When you were looking at the black and white world...
