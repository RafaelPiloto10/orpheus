Oh, my baby, my baby she don't want me no more  
Ever since she saw his poster in that record store  
She says the way he grinds his molars is really sexy  
She thinks he's so darn dysfunctional and Generation X-why  
She likes his brooding angst and his wild-eyed stare  
Yeah, he's her very favorite slacker multi-millionaire  
  
Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
She's all crazy 'bout that Eddie Vedder  
Once she was mine, but now I better just forget her  
Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
  
Now, every time I see him, well, he looks so grim  
I guess it really must suck to be a rock star like him  
What a pain in the butt to have so much success  
Spending all his time moping and avoiding the press  
But my girl can't get enough of his sullen demeanor  
Like he's some bit tortured genius  
And I'm some kinda wiener  
  
Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
She's got a thing for that Eddie Vedder  
Tell me, what can he do that I can't do better?  
Now my baby's in love with  
I said I said I said my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
Head over heels for that Eddie Vedder  
  
I knew we were headin' for disaster  
When she caught me hangin' out at the Ticketmaster  
Now she's got an unrequited adoration  
For the frustrated, agitated, designated alienated  
Spokesman for the disaffected grunge generation  
  
Well, I don't wear Doc Martens and I don't wear flannel  
And I don't boycott the music video channel  
And I just can't compete with all that money and fame  
But I know two can paly at this kinda game  
Yeah, well, let's just see how jealous she'll get  
When I start stalking Alanis Morissette  
  
Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
She's all crazy 'bout that Eddie Vedder  
Once she was mine but now I better just forget her  
Cause my baby's in love with  
I said I said I said my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
Why'd she have to fall for that Eddie Vedder?  
If she wants to leave me, I guess I better let her  
Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
