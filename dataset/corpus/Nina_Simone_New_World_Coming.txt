  
There's a new world comin'. and it's just around the bend.  
There's a new world comin', this one's comin' to an end.  
There's a new voice callin', you can hear it if you try.  
And its growin' stronger with each day that passes by.  
  
There's a brand new mornin', rising clear and sweet and free.  
There's a new day dawnin', that belongs to you and me.  
Yes, a new world's comin', the one we've had visions of
