If I could smoke a cigarette right now I would  
Rip out of my skin commit the sins oh I could  
If I could break a heart and throw it all away for just one night  
My conscience wouldn't care if I just went ahead and wrecked my life  
  
I want to be destructive  
Trash everything in site  
Beat the Devil at his game  
Abuse myself all night  
I want to bitch the world out  
One loud aching scream  
Don't want anybody wanting anything from me  
  
I'm sick of being perfect with your perfect little smile  
Pick a fight with danger be a stranger to myself for a while  
I want to come unraveled and have it out with my soul  
I'm tired of all the voices telling me which way to go  
I wish you'd silence your opinion  
That's the last thing that I want to know  
  
I want to be destructive  
Trash everything in site  
Beat the Devil at his game  
Abuse myself all night  
I want to bitch the world out  
One loud aching scream  
Don't want anybody wanting anything from me  
  
I'll fell better when I'm sane  
But now I want to feel no pain  
I'm really sick of thinking  
I just want to be destructive  
  
I want to be destructive  
Trash everything in site  
Beat the Devil at his game  
Abuse myself all night  
I want to bitch the world out  
One loud aching scream  
Don't want anybody wanting anything from me
