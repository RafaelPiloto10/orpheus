Sometimes a time comes along  
when it's time to, time to move on  
You'll still be there in everything that I do  
And wherever I go  
I'll remember you  
  
Leaving's not leaving  
'Cause I'm not, leaving you behind  
You'll always be with me, always be with me  
Part of my heart for all time  
Where I'm going , you're going  
Even if it's just in my mind  
Leaving's not leaving  
I'm not leaving you behind  
  
Moments shared there with you  
They're the best times that I ever knew  
They'll still be there when goodbyes are all though  
I'll remember those days  
I'll remember you  
  
Leaving's not leaving  
'cause I'm not, leaving you behind  
You'll always be with me, always be with me  
Part of my heart for all time  
Where I'm going , you're going  
Even if it's just in my mind  
Leaving's not leaving  
I'm not leaving you behind  
  
I'll hold on the memories  
'cause in my heart you'll be here with me  
There's no reason to cry  
Goodbye isn't really goodbye  
  
Leaving's not leaving  
'cause I'm not, leaving you behind  
You'll always be with me, always be with me  
Part of my heart for all time  
Where I'm going , you're going  
Even if it's just in my mind  
Leaving's not leaving  
I'm not leaving you behind  
  
Leaving's not leaving  
Not leaving you behind  
I'm not leaving you  
I'm not leaving you behind  
  
Leaving's not leaving  
I'm not leaving you  
I'm not leaving you behind
