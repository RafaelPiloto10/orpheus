Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
  
I got a crib so fat that  
You'll get lost in that bitch  
I got a car so fast that if I push one button, you won't see nothin'  
I got a feelin' that if it wasn't for me it wouldn't be a lot of you niggas  
Well copy this then  
Spend a million, count another million boy  
  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
  
I woke up in Hawaii today  
For real, I hope don't  
None, these little young niggas try me today  
Uh, 'cause between all of these closets and all of these boxes I got  
Ooh, I got so much swag  
That the people at the airport don't even wanna touch my bag  
Only nigga in first class  
  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
And I roll that weed and get baked off before the plane even take off, nigga I  
Fall asleep  
Catch me on the road gettin' money I'm in a whole different country by the
time I  
Fall asleep uh  
Fall asleep  
  
I'm flyer than most of 'em  
They try and hate, but most love 'em  
Them dollars, got mo' of 'em  
Thanks to who supplyin' what I'm rollin' up  
All this kush in my mind got me slowin' up  
Don't gotta smoke, I get high enough for both of us  
Get a O and blow and get another O and blow another O  
  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep
