Dear Mama  
If some people came by the house lookin' for me  
I'm innocent of anything they say I done  
Now I don't know when I'll be able to write you again  
But I will be back to California to see you  
Your son Ice motherfucking Cube.  
  
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done  
  
Ghetto destroyer paranoia, I need a lawyer  
This bitch named Netoia, say they lookin' for ya  
Got to get the fuck out of here (yeah right)  
This bitch dimmed the lights (nigga, spend the night)  
Bust a quick nut, got to fuck up and gat on  
'cause this the same street I got shot on  
So God bless Don Polla, double-s  
I gotta holla 'cause I'm smokin' on double breath  
Freakin', niggas be leakin', information  
Got the feds seekin', incarceration  
Niggas say my name popped up  
Bitch hop up  
Nigga close the shop up  
They try to stop em  
My cash flow leave me asshole neck it  
Gone in sixty seconds, burn all records  
Nigga gettin' skinny eating dinnies  
Count my pennies, only got a bag fulla twenties  
  
[Chorus]  
Listen, these feds fishin' for this extradition  
I'm on a mission, fuck em, fight em, dine em, ditch em  
I gotta kick rocks, can't pick locks  
Or spend the rest of my life in a shit-?bath  
  
It's so hard to get a room without a credit card  
It's so hard not to let em know where you are  
Tried to get a rent a car  
But he laughed when I showed him cash  
Had to mash 'fore he called the feds on my ass  
Went to Vegas for the weekend  
Met a hoe down freakin'  
Hey bitch, why you sneakin'?  
Grabbed the paper out her hand  
Am I the man on the front page? (Fuck)  
Same height, same age (click-click)  
Rap gauge, put it down the G-way  
Got my hostage suckin' sausage on the freeway  
She say "Let's hear the circle K"  
Ran inside and made the niggas all pay  
It's like I hit the Lotto outside Colorado  
Brought it there for his wallet and my bottle  
That's my motto and I gotta warn ya  
Before I'm through, I'm going back to California  
  
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
My boys you're taught at Illonois  
Set the poise, so I can infiltrate  
All fifty states  
Can't wait till I'm back on my feet  
Switch and shake this bitch in her sleep  
Low key you feds can't see me  
I'm up in D.C. with strike number three  
Clownin', made a little stock to get a little cock  
Now I got niggas bangin' and lootin' rock  
I'm going back to Cali where it's bound with my strikes  
Don't give a fuck who's on the ?marin or the mic  
I should've known when I seen that motherfucker in the lobby  
Looking like he want to rob me (Fuck)  
Federal, don't like no black hetero, sexual, intellectual  
Tried to turn me into a vegetable  
An I'm 'a sue all black and blue  
When I come to- hand cuff (Fuck y'all)  
Big grey bus, scandalous  
'cause they can't stand us  
They get excited and I try to fight it (mama)  
I'm going back to Cali to show, extradited  
  
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done  
I swear I didn't do what they say I done  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey mama, when y'all send pictures you can't send a Polaroid  
Got to be the regular pictures  
An' they got us in here puttin' in computer chips or something  
I don't know.  
Like they playin with us, it's like a game  
It ain't nothin' but a game to them mama  
It's my life
