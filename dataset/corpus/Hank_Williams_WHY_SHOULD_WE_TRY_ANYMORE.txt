What's the use to deny we've been livin' a lie  
That we should have admitted before  
We were just victims of a half hearted love  
So why should we try anymore?  
  
The vows that we make are only to break  
We drift like a wave from the shore  
The kisses we steal we know are not real  
So why should we try anymore?  
  
The dreams that we knew can never come true  
They're gone to return no more  
False love like ours fades with the flowers  
So why should we try anymore?  
  
Our story?s so old, again has been told  
On the past let's close the door  
And smile, don't regret but live and forget  
There's no use to try anymore
