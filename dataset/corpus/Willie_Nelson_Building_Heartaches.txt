Each time that I hold you close, here in my arms  
I'm building heartaches  
Each time that I kiss your lips, so sweet and warm  
I'm building heartaches  
  
And when you say you love me  
We both know it's a lie  
An' just a dream from which I must awake  
  
That each sweet word you tell me  
Is a heartache in disguise  
So I'm building heartaches  
  
When people ask me what I'm doin', here's what I tell  
I'm building heartaches  
And each kiss you give me is a tear that hasn't fell  
So I'm building heartaches  
  
And when you say you love me  
We both know it's a lie  
An' just a dream from which I must awake  
  
And each sweet word you tell me  
Is a heartache in disguise  
So I'm building heartaches
