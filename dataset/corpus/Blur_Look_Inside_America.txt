Good morning lethargy  
Drink pepsi it's good for energy  
The bath's on, smoke in the bedroom  
Sore throat and on my neck a nasty bruise  
And where it came from, well I don't know  
But we played last night, it was a good show  
  
Got the play out, second rate chat show  
It's a nation wide deal, so we gotta go  
Chap from the company says it will be alright  
Got an add on KRO  
And there's an in-store tonight  
Well I built things up  
And then I let them go  
Got to get time share on the radio  
  
Look inside America, she's alright, she's alright  
Sitting out the distance  
But I'm not trying to make her mine  
Looking for America  
With its kooky nights and suicide  
Where the TV says it's alright  
Coz' everybody's hung up on something or other  
  
Steppin' off in 20, so the driver says  
I should sleep tonight  
But I think I'll watch videos instead  
Annie Hall leaves New York in the end  
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again  
And the whole world could have passed through me  
But I don't know if it means much to me  
  
Look inside America  
She's alright, she's alright  
Sitting out the distance  
But I'm not trying to make her mine  
I'm looking for America  
With its kooky nights and suicide  
Where the TV says it's alright  
Coz everybody's strung out on something or other  
  
And the whole world  
Could have passed through me  
But I don't know if it means much to me
