South bound out of Shreveport heading hell bent for his grave  
He reads a sign on the barn door that says the good lord Jesus saves  
But I don't think Jesus knows him 'cause he ain't the Jesus kind  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
He gave the folks a good show at the Shreveport Coliseum  
They all heard he's dying, so they all come out to see  
Friends and neighbors make him happy  
Lord them snuff queens treat him kind  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
Uppers, downers, turn arounders picked him up and laid him down  
His old troubles keep on swimming 'cause their to damn mean to drown  
He keeps looking for an answer I know he's never gonna find  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
Big Bertha, back in Beaumont says he really turns her on  
She hits the floor a dancing, when the DJ plays his song  
You can see somebody loves him, or at least they did one time  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
Uppers, downers, turn arounders picked him up and laid him down  
His old troubles keep on swimming 'cause their to damn mean to drown  
He keeps looking for an answer I know he's never gonna find  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind
