It's your chance take her hand to the floor (when I walk to the floor)  
Girl if you see something you like then let him know  
'Cause you only got one chance, for your first dance  
Yeah you never forget your first dance  
So take advantage of the slow dance  
  
When I close my eyes I see me and you at the prom,  
We've both been waiting so long  
For this day to come  
Now that it's here lets make it special  
I can't deny  
There's so many thoughts in my mind  
The DJ's playing my favorite song ain't no chaperon's this could be  
The night of our dreams  
  
Only if you give, give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly  
If you give, give your first dance to me  
I'm gonna cherish every moment,  
It only happens once, once in a life time  
  
I couldn't ask for more, we're rockin' back and forth  
Under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor  
(I can't deny), so many thoughts in my mind  
The DJ's playing my favorite song, now we're all alone, here's the opportunity  
  
Only if you give, give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly  
If you give, give your first dance to me  
I'm gonna cherish every moment,  
It only happens once, once in a lifetime  
  
Everybody says that we look cute together lets make this a night  
The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close  
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know  
Before the lights go up and the music turns off  
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss,  
Your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll  
Make it before the clock strikes nine  
  
If you just give, give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise I'll be gentle but we gotta do it slowly  
If you give, give the first dance to me we'll cherish every moment,  
It only happens once, once in a lifetime  
  
Girl if you see something you like then let him know  
'Cause you only got one chance for your first dance  
Yeah you never forget your first dance  
So take advantage of the slow dance  
  
If you give, give the first dance to me  
I'm gonna cherish every moment  
'Cause it only happens, once in a lifetime
