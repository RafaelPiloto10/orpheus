Yours till the stars have no glory  
Yours till the birds fail to sing  
Yours till the end of life's story  
This pledge to you, dear, I bring  
Yours in the gray of December  
Here or on far distant shores  
I've never loved anyone the way I love you  
How could I, when I was born to be just yours?
