Drove my car to the top of the hill  
And I looked out across the town  
I got the urge to move again  
I guess I'll never settle down  
  
We talked about things getting better  
But they still looked the same to me  
Could be a near sighted heart  
Seein' what it wants to see  
  
So take me to the highway  
Take me far from here  
These days I'm not seein' anything too clear  
  
Nothin' seems to move fast enough  
When time isn't on your side  
Can't seem to keep the wheels in motion  
No matter how hard you try  
  
I need another point of view  
Someplace I've never seen  
Keepin' my eyes wide open  
Goin' where I've never been  
  
So take me to the highway  
Take me far from here  
These days I'm not seein' anything too clear  
  
I've been lookin' for an answer  
And I've got a long way to go  
But when I reach that place  
I know I'll find what I'm lookin' for
