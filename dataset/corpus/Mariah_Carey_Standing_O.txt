Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh  
  
Here's your standing O  
  
Boy, you remind  
Me of a love that seemed so sublime.  
Your kisses told me oh so many lies  
Shades on like I be stuntin' through the night  
  
But I decided with the eyes  
To keep the world from knowin' what's inside.  
I didn't know oh oh oh oh-oh-oh  
I was a show oh oh oh oh-oh-oh  
  
And your words they had no meaning.  
How didn't I forsee this?  
Happiness and congrats.  
Know that  
I pretend I mean it  
  
[Chorus]  
So cheers, toast, bravo to you.  
Cause you're the man of the hour.  
I'm a have to send you some flowers  
Ohhhhhh  
Cheers, toast, bravo to you.  
The man of the hour.  
You played the one that loved you the most  
So here's your standing O  
Oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Boy so Heres your standing O  
Oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhhh oh  
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it (so here's your standing O)  
  
Here's your standing ovation.  
Doctor, I was too patient.  
Even when you wasn't enough,  
I'm the one that taught you how to love.  
And boy I gave you all of me,  
Parts of affection you couldn't see.  
As you embrace her in your arms give her "my all"  
Give her more than you gave to me.  
  
When you had nothing I gave.  
When you were weak I made you brave.  
You went and leave me with the scars on my heart,  
It's funny how ya'll forget it all.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Round of applause to the  
Biggest fool in the world  
Give 'em all that you got  
And they still ride out into the sunset with the next girl.  
  
Round of applause to the  
Biggest fool in the world  
Give 'em all that you got  
And they still ride out into the sunset with the next girl.  
  
Standing ovation  
Congratulation  
Damn I was down for it  
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it.  
Standing ovation  
Congratulation  
Damn I was down for it  
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it.  
  
All you did was pound on it,  
Gave you my heart  
And all you did was pound on it  
All you did was pound on it
