(Hey man) oh leave me alone you know  
(Hey man) oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta  
(Hey man) I gotta straighten my face  
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place  
  
(Hey man) my schooldays insane  
(Hey man) my works down the drain  
(Hey man) she's a total blam-blam  
She said she had to squeeze it but she... and then she...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh don't lean on me man, cause you cant afford the ticket  
I'm back from suffragette city  
Oh don't lean on me man  
'Cause you ain't got time to check it  
You know my suffragette city  
It's outta sight... she's all right  
  
(Hey man) Ah Henry, don't be unkind, go away  
(Hey man) I can't take you this time, no way  
(Hey man) Doogie don't crash here  
Theres only room for one and here she comes, here she comes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh don't lean on me man, cause you cant afford the ticket  
I'm back from suffragette city  
Oh don't lean on me man  
'Cause you ain't got time to check it  
You know my suffragette city  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suffragette city, suffragette city  
Suffragette city, I'm back  
  
Oh, wham bam thank you ma'am!  
A suffragette city, suffragette city, suffragette city  
One, two, three...  
Suffragette!
