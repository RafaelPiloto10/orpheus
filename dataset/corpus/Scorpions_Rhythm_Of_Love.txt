Let's spend the night together  
I know you want it too  
The magic of the moment  
Is what I've got for you  
The heartbeat of this night  
Is made to lose control  
And there is something in your eyes  
That's longing for some more  
Let us find together  
The beat we're looking for  
  
The rhythm of love  
Keeps me dancing on the road  
The rhythm of love  
Got the groove that hits the bone  
The rhythm of love  
Is the game I'm looking for  
The rhythm of love  
Is the heartbeat of my soul  
  
Let's reach the top together  
One night will never do  
An exploding shot of pleasure  
Is what I've got for you  
Why don't you close your eyes  
And let your feeling grow  
I make you feel the taste of life  
Until your love will flow  
Let us find together  
The beat we're longing for  
  
The rhythm of love  
Keeps me dancing on the road  
The rhythm of love  
Got the groove that hits the bone  
The rhythm of love  
Is the game I'm looking for  
The rhythm of love  
Is the heartbeat of my soul  
  
Let us find together  
The beat we're looking for
