I remember you  
I remember the first time we met  
I may be a sentimental fool  
Forever in your debt  
For something I cannot forget  
I remember you  
  
I remember the first time we spoke  
The sound of your voice like a lover's tongue  
Got in my ear when I'd just begun  
To wonder if springtime was through  
I remember you  
  
How do we change so easily?  
You'll always be a part of me  
I thought you'd never go  
It shows you what I know  
  
I remember the first time we slept  
What a surprise to wake up to  
Someone I hardly knew  
From a sleep to a dream come true  
I remember you
