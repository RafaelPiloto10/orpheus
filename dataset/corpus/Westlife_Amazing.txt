You're like a storm against the window  
Follow me around just like a shadow  
I'll swim a never ending ocean  
Until you bring back your devotion  
  
It's like I live a thousand lifetimes  
Still looking for the one that feels right  
See, moving on just isn't working  
You lit the fire that I'm burning  
  
And all I've been doing is protecting  
A lie for the sake of my pride  
While all the others set me thinking  
We could be more than just amazing  
  
I guess I'm holding on to my faith  
A solid hope I'm heading your way  
And crawling over is so tempting  
We could be more than just amazing  
  
And all I've been doing is protecting  
A lie for the sake of my pride  
While all the others set me thinking  
We could be more than just amazing  
  
I couldn't see it  
I must have believed a lie  
If I admit it would you let me make it right  
Is it all gone  
Oh no  
  
We could be more than just  
We could be more than just amazing  
  
And all I've been doing is protecting  
A lie for the sake of my pride  
While all the others set me thinking  
We could be more than just amazing  
  
And all I've been doing is protecting  
A lie for the sake of my pride  
While all the others set me thinking  
Straight to the point of what I'm feeling  
Oh we could be more than just amazing
