Right from the sky we are born crazy  
Right from the sky we are born to be wild  
Right from the sky we are born crazy  
Right from the sky we are born to be alive  
  
Day by day same of story  
Same of life starts to get boring  
Always working, always strained  
Gotta be quick cause I can't be late  
Always moving in one direction  
Searching for this thing .............  
Can't get lost, gotta be on the track  
When you move ahead you can never look back  
Then time is come when you gotta break free  
To make the choice to be wild, to be happy  
How fun. And don't let your mind go flat  
That's .............. and that's what is said  
Grab it, taste it, hold it, make it  
Don't think about the chance, just take it  
Life is short, no time to be lazy  
Get on your feet, it's time to get crazy  
  
Don't walk that, we walk like this  
Break the rules, I know you won't miss  
Just be crazy, just be wild  
Just be free like an innocent child  
Show the world, you don't give a damn  
Don't let society ruin your plans  
Don't be afraid to say what you feel  
Take a little break, forget that it's real  
Let the masses go their own way  
You go your way, I'll go my way  
Let your mind control your movement  
Who cares that there's no room for improvement  
Jump, shout, dance, scream  
Activate you act in your dreams  
Remember this when it all seems hazy  
Get on your feet, it's time to get crazy
