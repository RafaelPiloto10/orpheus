What's a season in a right if you can't have anything?  
What's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means anything?  
What's the meaning in a crime, it's a fan if anything?  
Where's the meaning in a line? It's a brand, it's a brand  
  
How a culture comes again, it's yesterday  
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyway  
They're only here to talk to friends, nothing new is everyday  
You could shit upon the stage, they'll be fans  
They'll be fans, they'll be fans, they'll be fans  
  
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly  
Steal a sound and imitate, uniform and equally  
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays  
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways
