Come down - your tea is on the table  
Nothing seems to matter anymore  
And if you're good well go out on sunday  
Spend the whole day thinking of you  
Take you sailing across the water  
To a faraway place  
Remember when life was lovely  
Forever was captured in your smile  
When we were young and life was hopeful  
No one threatend our existence  
We were laughing  
They couldn't stop us  
No one in the world  
  
Remember when life was lovely  
Forever was captured in your smile  
When we were young and life was hopeful  
No one threatend our existence  
We were laughing  
They couldn't stop us  
No one in the world
