I can wait to love in heaven  
I can wait for you  
Far away, I'll treat you better  
Better than down here  
'Cause I done wrong  
And I'm a little afraid  
I ain't too strong  
And this ain't easy to say:  
Take this bottle  
Take this bottle  
And just walk away-the both of you  
And let me feel the pain-I've done to you  
I can hope we'll be together  
With a better roof over our heads  
I can hope the stormy weather  
It passes on-it passes on-  
But I've hoped too long  
Hoped for me to change  
That hope is gone  
So listen to what I say:  
Take this bottle
