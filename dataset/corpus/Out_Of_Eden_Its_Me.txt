Here I stand at the door of your heart just knockin'  
Won't you let me in I can take away the sin that lies within  
I know what your wanting to say  
But can only think, can only pray that someone hears  
  
You hide all your secrets in that private place  
If you only knew that you mind is open to my eye  
I know the truth, I know what you need to fill the void in you  
If you only knew that it is me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's me, that you are searchin' for  
It's me, that you are thinkin' of  
It's me, that can't live without  
It's me, It's me  
  
Here I am, but still you try everything  
To give you only what I can  
Always hoping that someone'll understand, oh please  
It all awaits you if you just taste and see  
I am what you need  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What did I do to make you turn so very far away  
What's to lose when you have it all to gain  
I know you, and what you are and what you want to be  
If you only knew it's all in me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It is me, that you're searchin' for  
Nobody else can no one can give you more  
It is me, that you're thinkin' of  
I can show you love, real love
