Who feeds the reindeer all their hay?  
Who wraps the gifts and packs the sleigh?  
Who's helping Santa every day?  
Mrs. Santa Claus  
  
Who keeps his red suit looking nice?  
Who does he turn to for advice?  
Who gives the brownies all their spice?  
Mrs. Santa Claus  
  
She pitter patters all around the workshop  
The whole year long  
Amid the happy clatter of the workshop  
She sings a merry, merry Christmas song  
  
Who reads the notes from girls and boys?  
Turns in the order for their toys  
Fills every heart with wondrous joys
