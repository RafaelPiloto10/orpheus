It's pointless to explain why  
There's nothing I can say  
My words would all be meaningless  
Anyway  
It seems I can't be trusted  
And I don't disagree  
What made you think I ever really  
Wanted to be?  
I can't explain why  
And I don't know when  
I'm ever going to want to  
See her again  
Son don't ask why I came here  
There's nothing I can say  
I don't think I'll be staying very long  
Anyway  
I'm trying to find out why  
I came here at all  
I don't think it was to see you  
After all
