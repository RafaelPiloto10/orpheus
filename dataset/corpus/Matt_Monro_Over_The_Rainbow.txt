Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
There's a land that I heard of  
Once in a lullaby  
  
Somewhere over that rainbow  
Skies are blue  
And the dreams  
That you dare to dream  
Really do come true  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Way above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?  
  
If happy little bluebirds fly  
Beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?
