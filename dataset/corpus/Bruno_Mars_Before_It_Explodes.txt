It's not a question of love,  
Cause our love has never changed.  
But all the little things keep piling up,  
And life keeps getting in the way.  
  
Don't make this harder than it is,  
We both knew it'd come to this.  
Better now than in a year,  
With lots of tears,  
And we both hate each other.  
The fuse has already left,  
So how about a final kiss?  
And just let it go.  
  
Stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
Before it's out of our control.  
Let's stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
We gotta let it go,  
Before it all explodes.  
  
Some things we won't understand,  
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood.  
So let's just turn and walk away,  
And hold on to what was good.  
  
Don't make this harder than it is,  
We both knew it'd come to this.  
Better now than in a year,  
With lots of tears,  
And we both hate eachother.  
The fuse has already left,  
So how about a final kiss?  
And just let it go.  
  
Stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
Before it's out of our control.  
Let's stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
We gotta let it go,  
Before it all explodes.  
  
Before it explodes!  
Before it's out of our control.  
Let's stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
We gotta let it go,  
Before it all explodes.
