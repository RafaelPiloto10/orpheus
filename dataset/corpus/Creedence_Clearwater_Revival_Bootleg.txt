[Chorus]  
Bootleg, bootleg,  
Bootleg, howl.  
Bootleg, bootleg,  
Bootleg, howl.  
  
Take you a glass of water  
Make it against the law.  
See how good the water tastes  
When you can't have any at all.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Findin' a natural woman,  
Like honey to a bee.  
  
But you don't buzz the flower.  
When you know the honey's free.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suzy maybe give you some cherry pie,  
But lord, that ain't no fun.  
Better you grab it when she ain't lookin'  
'Cause you know you'd rather have it on the run.  
  
[Chorus]
