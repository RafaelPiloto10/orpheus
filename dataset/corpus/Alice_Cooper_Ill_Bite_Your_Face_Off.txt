She was a dirty dream cool and clean  
With seduction dancing in her eyes  
She turned around looked me up and down  
She took me by surprise  
  
I tried to run tried to hide  
But my feet were made of clay  
Looked in her eyes I was paralyzed  
I just couldn't get away  
  
She licked her lips they were bloody red  
She had the heart of the living dead  
She pushed me down on a burning bed  
Thought I was in heaven but instead  
She turned her head and she softly said  
  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off little man  
I'll bite your face off you know that I can  
  
She put the whip into cream  
She was a sinners queen oh a delicious angel face  
She'd invite you in c'mon and lick my skin  
You'd sell your soul for another taste  
  
She took my heart my resistance fled  
I loved each lie that I was fed  
She pushed me down on a burning bed  
Thought I was in heaven but instead  
She turned her head and she softly said  
  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off little man  
I'll bite your face off you know that I can  
  
She pushed me down on a burning bed  
Thought I was in heaven but instead  
She turned her head and she softly said  
  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off little man  
I'll bite your face off you know that I can  
  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off
