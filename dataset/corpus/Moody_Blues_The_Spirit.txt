The sun and moon every day,  
Day and night, mark my play.  
See the future in the past,  
Try to change or make it last.  
Go for broke, don't regret,  
Get your hands dirty, get your feet wet,  
Take your place, use me well,  
I'm in your hands so make me tell.  
A broken dream seems unkind  
But I can help for I am time.  
I can heal you.  
It's not a matter of sleight  
Only of sound.  
Let me... feel for you,  
Feel for yourself,  
The love all around.  
I can... lead you.  
Is your soul afraid  
Of what you've made?  
Do you know the way  
The spirit goes?  
  
All around, on the wind  
Distant whispers of what I bring,  
In the day in the night,  
Locked in the words of lovers' delight.  
If I'm lost or mislaid  
Just keep looking, don't be afraid.  
In the eye, on the mind,  
I'm everything and yours to find.  
I'm not far, just discover.  
I'm in you for I am love.  
  
I can heal you.  
It's not a matter of sleight  
Only of sound.  
Let me... feel for you,  
Feel for yourself,  
The love all around.  
I can... lead you.  
Is your soul afraid  
Of what you've made?  
Do you know the way  
The spirit goes?
