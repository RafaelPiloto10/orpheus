Cyrus Jones 1810 to 1913  
Made his great grandchildren believe  
You could live to a hundred and three  
A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid  
So Cyrus Jones lived forever  
  
Gravedigger  
When you dig my grave  
Could you make it shallow  
So that I can feel the rain  
Gravedigger  
  
Muriel Stonewall  
1903 to 1954  
She lost both of her babies in the second great war  
Now you should never have to watch  
Your only children lowered in the ground  
I mean you should never have to bury your own babies  
  
Gravedigger  
When you dig my grave  
Could you make it shallow  
So that I can feel the rain  
Gravedigger  
  
Ring around the rosey  
Pocket full of posey  
Ashes to ashes  
We all fall down  
  
Gravedigger  
When you dig my grave  
Could you make it shallow  
So that I can feel the rain  
Gravedigger  
  
Little Mikey Carson 67 to 75  
He rode his  
Bike like the devil until the day he died  
When he grows up he wants to be Mr. Vertigo on the flying trapeze  
Oh, 1940 to 1992  
  
Gravedigger  
When you dig my grave  
Could you make it shallow  
So that I can feel the rain  
  
Gravedigger  
When you dig my grave  
Could you make it shallow  
So that I can feel the rain  
Feel the rain  
I can feel the rain  
Gravedigger  
  
Gravedigger
