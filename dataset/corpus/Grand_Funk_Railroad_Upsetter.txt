Upsetter  
  
She's a real upsetter,  
Least she's tryin' to all of the time, yeah.  
You know I just won't let her,  
Break this heart of mine, yeahhh ... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ya-yeah.  
  
I got hip to her, yeah, right away boys,  
But my heart just led me along, yeah.  
I'm gonna' slip right away boys,  
'Cause I don't want to sing this song, all night looooooong-oh, yeah.  
  
CHORUS  
Upsetter, got me layin' awake all night.  
Upsetter, like to make me cry, yeah.  
Upsetter, got me layin' awake all night.  
Upsetter, I'd be better to die.  
  
She'll be sorry when I leave her,  
She just won't know what to say, yeah.  
I can't hardly wait to leave her,  
I guess I'll be on my way, yeahhh ... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ya-yeah.
