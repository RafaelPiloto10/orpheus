If you want it, you can have it  
That's what you said  
But I don't want the things that you leave behind  
Take the pictures, take the windows and the walls  
But, baby, won't you leave me my peace of mind?  
Oh, such a waste of time  
Oh, such a waste  
I still want you, baby  
  
Heaven help me, heaven help me  
Talk to strangers, talk to strangers  
Heaven help me  
Over you  
Help me over you  
I can't seem to take these changes  
Everything reminds my heart of you  
  
Thought the first time was the last time  
We'd be here forever  
Now I find I'm having to search again  
It'll happen  
It's gotta happen  
Come together  
I just wish somebody would tell me when  
  
Oh, such a waste of time  
Oh, such a waste  
I still want you, baby  
  
Heaven help, heaven help  
Heaven, heaven, heaven, help me  
Heaven help, heaven help  
Heaven, heaven, heaven, help me  
  
You're someone else's lady  
So sad without you, darlin'  
The gods of love can't help me now  
Heaven help, heaven help  
Heaven, heaven, heaven, help me
