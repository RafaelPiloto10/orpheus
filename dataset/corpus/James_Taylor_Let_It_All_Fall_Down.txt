Sing a song for  
The wrong and the wicked  
And the strong and the sick,  
As thick as thieves.  
For the faceless fear  
That was never so near,  
Too clear to misbelieve.  
Well the sea is jumping salty  
And the porpoise has the blues,  
My recollection's faulty  
And I cannot find my shoes.  
And my wiring is misfiring  
Due to cigarettes and booze,  
I'm behind in my dues,  
I just now got the news.  
He seems to tell us lies  
And still we will believe him,  
Then together he will lead us  
Into darkness, my friends.  
  
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down.  
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down.  
  
The man says stand to one side, son,  
We got to keep this big ball rolling.  
It's just a question of controlling  
For whom the bell is tolling.  
  
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down.  
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down.  
  
There'll be suffering and starvation  
In the streets, young man.  
Just where have you been, old man?  
Just look out of your window, man.  
  
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down.  
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down.  
  
Well, it ain't nobody's fault  
But our own,  
Still, at least we might could  
Show the good sense  
To know when we've been wrong,  
And it's already taken too long.  
So we bring it to a stop  
Then we take it from the top,  
We let it settle on down softly  
Like your gently falling snow  
Or let it tumble down and topple  
Like the temple long ago.  
  
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down.  
Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down.
