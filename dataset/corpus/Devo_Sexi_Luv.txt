Remember luv  
Sexi luv  
Its a breath of fresh air  
On a day when the sun isn't shining  
It's like a rose that grows  
Through the concrete in the middle  
Of a parking deck  
Remember luv  
Sexi luv  
  
A smile as wide as a semi  
Burning bright as the lights on a highway  
Its the city that never sleeps  
Where I wander like a tourist  
With my camera in hand  
Remember luv  
Its all around you  
So let your sexi feelings grow  
Luv  
Sexi luv
