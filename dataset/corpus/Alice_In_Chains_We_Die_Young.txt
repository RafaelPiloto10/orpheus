Scary's on the wall  
Scary's on his way  
Watch where you spit  
I'd advise you wait until it's over  
Then you got hit  
And you shoulda known better  
And we die young  
Faster we run  
Down, down, down you're rollin'  
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer  
Take another hit  
And bury your brother  
And we die young  
Faster we run  
Scary's on the wall  
Scary's on his way  
Another alley trip  
Bullet seek the place to bend you over  
Then you got hit  
And you shoulda known better  
Faster we run  
And we die young
