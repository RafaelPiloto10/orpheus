Baby tell me what you're trying to prove  
Playing games with my heart  
Hey now listen, I ain't gonna take one more night  
You're the one who broke the rules  
And I'm the one who played the fool  
Now you're trying to tell me it's alright  
You should know better than to hurt a friend  
You'll never get another chance again  
  
You'll be back where you started  
I know you won't admit it but you're broken-hearted  
Back where you started  
You think it's gonna be easy but it just gets harder, harder  
  
You had a way with words  
One look and I was under your spell  
I didn't know should I stay or should I run  
You can't deny you told me lies  
Love 'em and leave 'em baby, that's your style  
I'm not afraid to take life as it comes  
You play with fire I guess you'll never learn  
You mess with me babe, you 're gonna get burned  
  
You'll be back where you started  
I know how it feels when you've been discarded  
Back where you started  
You think you got it made but it won't get you far, no it won't get you far  
  
Who's gonna help ya, throw you a lifetime  
I'll tell you one thing, you've really done it this time  
You took your one chance and let it slip away
