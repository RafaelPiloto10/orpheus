Listen to the sound when ya,  
  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty yea yea yea yea  
  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty yea yea yea yea,  
  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty yea yea yea yea,  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty  
  
How do you see yourself inside your mind?  
Do you ever catch yourself step out of time?  
If I had a dollar every time I tried  
I'd be living high and mighty  
  
How do you see yourself inside your mind?  
Who do you look at when you close your eyes?  
If I had a dollar every time I cried,  
I'd be living high and mighty, yea yea yea  
  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty, ma my, ma my, ma my  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty, yea yea yea yea  
  
Then I guess it wouldn't be so bad without you,  
Wouldn't even mind the things that you  
Wouldn't walk away all steamy, cool  
I'd be living high and mighty yea yea yea  
  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty  
Living high and mighty yea yea yea yea,  
Living, ma my ma my ma my  
  
Listen to the sound when ya  
  
I keep a coat rack by my bed  
Up against your closet and next to my head  
Didn't mean to trap your cloths  
Keep the door blocked, closed  
So you can't get in and I can't get out  
Sink into my pillow and dream what it's about  
  
To be living high and mighty  
To be living high and mighty, yea yea yea  
  
Living high and mighty [Repeated]  
  
Ma my, ma my, ma my  
  
I'd be living high and mighty [Repeated]  
  
And keep the door blocked closed  
  
My, my, my,  
Yea, yea, yea
