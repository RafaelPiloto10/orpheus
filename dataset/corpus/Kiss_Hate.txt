Hate, is what I am  
'cause underneath this heart  
There beats the heart of man  
  
You'll wear your crown  
When you're lyin' 6 feet underground  
Don't you think it's odd  
Man was created in the image of god  
  
All you martyrs and saviours  
Go through the same door  
Listen all you butchers, saints and sinners  
We've all been here before  
  
Yes, hate is what I am  
'cause underneath this heart  
There beats the heart of man  
  
So you're lookin' for a saviour  
But I'm here to tell ya  
You gotta save yourself  
Like a lamb to slaughter  
All you ever did was follow orders  
  
All you martyrs and saviours  
Go through the same door  
Listen all you butchers, saints and sinners,  
We've all been here before  
All you martyrs and saviours  
Go through the same door  
  
Hey listen all you butchers, saints and sinners,  
We've all been here before  
Hate hate!  
  
Yes, hate is what I am  
Cause' underneath this heart  
There beats the heart of man, man  
Man!
