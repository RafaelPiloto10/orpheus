Get your forehead into my kiss  
Embrace me, careful darkness  
All my love fades away  
Little Death's reflections of  
Who's the darkest muthafucker on the planet  
Fiction tied to death I know I am it  
Immortal love  
  
Hey, Hey, Hey, Wanna set you free  
Hey, Hey, Hey, Would you die for me  
  
Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, Oh, Oh  
Fuck it up to death it ain't so tragic, no.....  
  
Hatred will, immortal wings  
Vampires and Blackened Children  
Kiss of the from my lips  
Death we are, death we've always been  
Who's the darkest muthafucker on the planet  
Just so close to death I know I am it  
Demon son  
  
Hey, Hey, Hey, Wanna set you free  
Hey, Hey, Hey, Would you die for me  
  
Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, oh, oh  
Fuck it up to death it ain't so tragic, no....  
  
Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, Ahhh gimme something  
Come feel young and special gas of magic  
  
In your forehead, into my kiss  
Embrace me a careful darkness  
Death we are, death we've always been  
Who's the darkest muthafucker  
  
In your forehead, into my kiss  
Embrace me a careful darkness  
Death we are, death we've always been  
Who's the darkest muthafucker  
  
Darkest muthafucker on the planet  
Just so close to death I know I am it  
Demon son  
  
Hey, Hey, Hey, Wanna set you free  
Hey, Hey, Hey, Would you die for me  
  
Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, oh, oh  
Fuck it up to death it ain't so tragic, no....  
Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, Ahhh gimme something  
Come feel young and special gas of magic
