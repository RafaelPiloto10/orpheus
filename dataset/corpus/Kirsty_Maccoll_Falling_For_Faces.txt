He had the kind of face she'd seen on the tv  
He drove her home one night and made her happy  
He used to phone her after work at the weekend  
And took her out when he had some money to spend  
  
Falling for faces, changing places  
Just like the hard cases out on the... [?]  
  
After a while she used to see him every day  
And pretty soon when they had run out of things to say  
Ideas came to her she tried to ignore  
Got what she wanted but now she wasn't so sure  
  
Falling for faces, changing places  
Just like the hard cases out on the... [?]  
The light of the screen grew too bright in her dreams  
She was searching for something she'd lost in her teens  
  
Misunderstandings caused by lack of honesty  
They got him worried, got her feeling guilty  
Felt so sincere but she was easily impressed  
And every time she had the chance she got undressed  
  
Falling for faces, changing places  
Just like the hard cases out on the... [?]  
Falling for faces  
Falling for faces
