Don't dwell on the past  
Love that was lost and didn't last  
That summer bloom is fading fast  
But I'm falling for you  
  
Don't dwell on the pain  
Tears you've cried  
And autumn rain  
That fair weather's here and gone again  
But I'm waiting for you  
  
Don't dwell on the loss  
The fool that would steal break and toss  
That winter's heart will spurn and double-cross  
But I'm yearning for you  
  
Don't dwell on the time  
The seasons change  
And so does the clime  
That old flame has cooled  
But I'm burning for you
