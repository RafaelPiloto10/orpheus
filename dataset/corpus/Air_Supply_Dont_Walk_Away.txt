Why do I say, don't walk away  
You'll be the way you were before, when you don't want me anymore  
  
  
Don't turn around, don't ever leave, a lonely room where empty days  
Are gathering to meet me when you're gone, gone  
How in the world will I go on  
  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay (don't walk away)  
  
  
Chorus:  
Don't walk away (don't walk away), don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)  
Don't turn around (don't turn around), don't let it die (don't let it die)  
When shadows fall (when shadows fall), when day is done (when day is done)  
All through the night (all through the night), all of my life (all of my life)  
Don't walk away  
  
  
Is it a dream, when will it end  
When everything we've ever known has ended and I'm all alone  
  
  
Where will I go, where will I be, the feelings that I've never shown  
Maybe I'll find the answer when you're gone, gone  
How in the world will I go on  
  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay (don't walk away)  
  
  
Chorus repeats 3x
