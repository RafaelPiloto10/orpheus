It was only one hour ago  
It was all so different then  
Nothing yet has really sunk in  
Looks like it always did  
This flesh and bone  
Is just the way that we are tied in  
But there's no one home  
I grieve, for you  
You leave, me  
So hard to move on  
Still loving what's gone  
They say life carries on  
Carries on and on and on and on  
  
The news that truly shocks  
Is the empty, empty page  
While the final rattle rocks  
It's empty, empty cage  
And I can't handle this  
I grieve, for you  
You leave, me  
Let it out and move on  
Missing what's gone  
They say life carries on  
They say life carries on and on and on  
  
Life carries on in the people I meet  
In everyone that's out on the street  
In all the dogs and cats  
In the flies and rats  
In the rot and the rust  
In the ashes and the dust  
Life carries on and on and on and on  
Life carries on and on and on  
Life carries on and on and on and on  
Life carries on and on and on  
Just the car that we ride in  
The home we reside in  
The face that we hide in  
The way we are tied in  
As life carries on and on and on and on  
Life carries on and on and on  
  
Did I dream this belief  
Or did I believe this dream?  
Now I will find relief  
I grieve
