Everybody thinks it's so easy  
Everybody thinks it's so fine  
But everytime I get a little closer to the top  
I find myself at the end of the line  
  
You take a slow ride up  
And a fast one down  
Nothin's gonna stop you spinnin' round and round and round  
  
Everybody's talkin' at me  
But nothin's soundin' right  
They say my future's lookin' brighter  
But I don't see no light  
I got a bottle of hurricane  
It gets me high as a kite  
Now the rain's pissin' down  
And the storm is in sight  
When the shit hits the fan  
You gotta stick to the fight  
  
Everybody says the world owes me  
Everybody wants a free ride  
Well let me tell ya mister  
If you never raise a blister  
Then you might as well have laid down and died  
  
'Cause you ain't gettin' out what you don't put in  
You're never gonna make it if your head is in a spin  
  
Everybody's talkin' at me  
But nothin's soundin' right  
They say my future's lookin' brighter  
But I don't see no light  
I got a bottle of hurricane  
It gets me high as a kite  
Now the rain's pissin' down  
And the storm is in sight  
When the shit hits the fan  
You gotta stick to the fight  
  
Can you feel the heat, yea  
Comin' down on you  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down watcha gonna do  
Feel it comin' down on you now  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
  
Oh, yeah  
When it all comes down  
Can ya feel it, feel it, feel it comin' down on you, yea  
Can ya stick to the fight when the heat's comin' down on you  
When it all comes down  
Ah, take me  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down, yea
