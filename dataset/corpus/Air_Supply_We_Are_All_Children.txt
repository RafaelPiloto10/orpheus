We are all children covered in mud  
Bound by the sacred and searching for love  
We are all children adrift on the sea  
Searching for someone, say come back to me  
  
We are all children covered in mud  
Jam on our faces, we want to be loved  
We are all children growing so fast  
Walking on water, hearts made of glass  
  
If I hold you as close as I can  
We belong to every woman and man  
Everyone who knows  
  
You, me, we are all children  
Us, them, we are all children  
We all are somebody's daughter and son  
  
We are all children covered in mud  
Trapped in the wilderness, stars up above  
Outside we all look shiny and clean  
Inside the voices, are ready to scream  
  
We are all children growing so fast  
Worshipping idols, stuck in the past  
We are all children covered in mud  
Jam on our faces, we want to be loved
