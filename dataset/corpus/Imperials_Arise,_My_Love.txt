Not a word was heard  
At the tomb that day.  
Just shuffling of soldiers feet  
As they guarded the grave.  
One day, two days,  
Three days had past.  
Could it be that Jesus  
Breathed His last?  
  
Could it be that His Father  
Had forsaken him?  
Turned his back on his son  
Despising our sin.  
All hell seemed to whisper  
"Just forget Him, He's dead."  
Then the Father looked down  
To his son and he said...  
  
Arise, My love.  
Arise, My love.  
The grave no longer  
Has a hold on you  
No more death's sting  
No more suffering  
Arise... Arise... My love.  
  
The Earth trembled  
And the tomb began to shake,  
And like lightning  
From Heaven the stone was rolled away.  
And as dead man  
The guards they all stood there in fright  
As the power of love  
Displayed it's might  
Then suddenly a melody  
Filled the air  
Riding wings of wind,  
It was everywhere  
The words all creation  
Had been longing to hear  
The sweet sound of victory,  
So loud and clear.  
  
Arise, my love.  
Arise, my love.  
The grave no longer has a hold on you.  
No more death's sting  
No more suffering  
Arise... Arise...  
  
Sin, where are your shackles?  
Death, where is your sting?  
Hell has been defeated.  
The grave could not hold the king.  
  
Arise, My love.  
Arise, My love.  
The grave no longer  
Has a hold on you  
No more death's sting  
No more suffering  
Arise... Arise... Arise
