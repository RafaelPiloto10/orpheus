Oh my room will always have some people  
You see Johnny Carson is a friend of mine  
And my music box will always play me something  
If something's what I need to ease my mind  
Take what you want  
I'll feel much better  
Don't hang around  
Till I get myself together  
You can leave those pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else will come along and pick 'em up  
Say what the hell  
  
If I don't see you in the morning  
Guess the sun might come up anyway  
And without you here to love and stand beside me  
Guess I just might make it through the day  
If you should call from time to time  
Don't be surprised  
If the voice that answers ain't mine  
'Cause you left the pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else just came along and picked 'em up  
Say what the hell  
  
If you should call from time to time  
Don't be surprised  
If the voice that answers ain't mine  
'Cause you left those pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else just came along and picked 'em up  
Say what the hell  
  
If she don't love me come tomorrow  
If you can't get what you want, want what you got  
And I won't be drugged with words like joy and sorrow  
I won't feel one way or the other  
Like as not  
I'll soon forget you  
Leave my life  
Guess you thought I'd never let you  
'Cause you left those pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else just came along and picked 'em up  
Say what the hell
