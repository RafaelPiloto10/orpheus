Like animals  
Tonight we make it  
You give me an inch,  
I'm gonna take it  
  
I'll steal your love  
Like a thief  
To be as one  
Is my belief  
  
Don't look back and have no regrets  
Like beasts of prey we must feed on it  
I'll be your one, your one and only  
To feel me burn come close and hold me  
  
[Chorus]  
Flesh and blood sacrifice  
Melts the heart like fire and ice  
Flesh and blood like fire to ice  
Are you willing to sacrifice  
  
There's no more time,  
Don't think about  
The flame will die  
If you doubt  
  
It's a game of  
Love and hate  
To lose it all's  
A chance we take  
  
Come to me and take my hand  
It's in the fire that we must stand  
I'll take you down under my gun  
Our flesh and blood will be as one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our blood runs deeper than a river  
The less you need the more I'm gonna give you  
And give you but good  
  
[Chorus]
