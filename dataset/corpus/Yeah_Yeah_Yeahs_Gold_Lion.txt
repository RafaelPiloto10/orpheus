Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,  
Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,  
Take our hands out of control,  
Take our hands out of control  
  
Now, tell me what you saw,  
Tell me what you saw,  
There was a crowd of seeds,  
Inside, outside,  
I must have done a dozen each  
  
It was the height I threw, the weight,  
The shell was crushing you,  
I've been around a few  
  
Tell me what you saw,  
I'll tell you what to...  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh  
  
Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,  
Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,  
Take our hands out of control,  
Take our hands out of control  
  
Outside, inside,  
This is the moon without a tide,  
We'll build a fire in your eyes,  
We'll build a fire when the cover's getting brighter,  
Cold as I, makes the moon without a tide  
  
Tell me what you saw,  
I'll tell you what to...  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh  
  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh
