You look so good to me, you never change  
Lord has it really been so long  
Somehow old mystery, don't matter now  
Or who was right, and who was wrong  
  
We can make a new memory, of you and me  
'Cause I'm losing the ones I been using too long on my own  
We can take it like it ought to be, so easily  
When you luck into lucky lovin' you leave it alone  
  
Feel this heart of mine,  
Lord can't you see how bad that we been missin' you  
These days it's hard to find, or make  
Believe, any dreams worth comin' true  
  
We can take it to eternity, you and me  
'Cause we're better together than we'll ever be on our own  
We can make like it ought to be, so easily  
When you luck into lucky lovin' you leave it alone  
  
We can make a new memory, of you and me  
'Cause I'm losing the ones I been using too long on my own  
We can make it like it ought to be, so easily  
When you luck into lucky lovin' you leave it alone
