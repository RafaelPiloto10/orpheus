I'm gonna walk myself into town and ride on back  
Guess it means you're quick and I'm clean  
My sparkling machine  
It's only forty minutes by feet  
I'll be back in three  
Ride to the hills at night  
To watch the lights go down and your neighbours fight  
'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night  
  
It's a magic carpet and chrome  
Can't reach me by phone  
A new deck of cards through the wheels  
To show you just deep I feel  
In the rear view mirrors I see  
My dust as you're following me  
Drag to the corner at night  
To watch the lights go down and your parents die  
'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night.  
I'm the boy to keep you up at night.  
  
To keep you decent seven days a week  
'Cause it's the second best thing I do with my feet  
Watch your ass 'cause I know where you live  
And which car you drive.  
  
I can look anyone in the eye  
Eat my dust as I leave you behind  
I'll follow you to your house  
Do you want to kiss at mine?  
'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night  
I'm the boy to keep you up at night  
I'm the boy to keep you up at night
