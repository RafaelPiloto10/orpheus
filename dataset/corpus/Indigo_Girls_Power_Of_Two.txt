Now the parking lot is empty  
Everyone's gone someplace  
I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed  
A cooler and a 2-day suitcase  
Cause there's a place we like to drive  
Way out in the country  
Five miles out of the city limit we're singing  
And your hand's upon my knee  
  
So we're okay  
We're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
  
You know the things that I am afraid of  
I'm not afraid to tell  
And if we ever leave a legacy  
It's that we loved each other well  
'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people  
Trying on the treasures of youth  
But a road that fancy and fast ends  
Ends in a fatal crash  
And I'm glad we got off  
To tell you the truth  
  
'Cause we're okay  
We're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
  
All the shiny little trinkets of temptation  
(Make new friends)  
Something new instead of something old  
(But keep the old)  
All you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface  
(But remember what is gold)  
And it's fools gold  
(What is gold)  
Fools gold  
(What is gold)  
Fools gold  
  
Now we're talking about a difficult thing  
And your eyes are getting wet  
I took us for better and I took us for worse  
Don't you ever forget it  
Now the steel bars between me and a promise  
Suddenly bend with ease  
The closer I'm bound in love to you  
The closer I am to free  
  
So we're okay  
We're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two
