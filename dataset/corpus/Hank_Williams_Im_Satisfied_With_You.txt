You don't dress up in satin,  
You don't wear diamond rings,  
But I'm satisfied with you.  
You look just like an angel but you haven't got wings,  
But I'm satisfied with you.  
  
I'd rather have you just the way that you are  
Than change you for somebody new.  
Maybe I could do better if I reached for a star,  
But I'm satisfied with you.  
  
You're not made out of candy  
But you're as sweet as you can be  
So I'm satisfied with you.  
I just can't see no reason why you bother with me,  
But I'm satisfied with you.  
  
I often wonder if it's all a mistake  
It's hard to believe that it's true.  
But If I'm only dreaming, I sure don't want to wake,  
'Cause I'm satisfied with you.  
I'm satisfied with you.
