Dreary days are over  
Life's a four leaf clover  
Sessions of depressions are through  
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true  
  
Long ago and far away  
I dreamed a dream one day  
And now that dream is here beside me  
Long the skies were overcast  
But now the clouds have passed  
You're here at last  
  
Chills run up and down my spine  
Aladdin's Lamp is mine  
The dream I dreamed was not denied me  
Just one look and then I knew  
That all I longed for  
Long ago was you  
  
Chills run up and down my spine  
Aladdin's Lamp is mine  
The dream I dreamed was not denied me  
Just one look and then I knew  
That all I longed for  
Long ago was you  
  
That all I longed for  
Long ago was you
