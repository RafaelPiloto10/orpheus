The railroads and the riverboats  
That bred the mighty men  
That we read about and we dream about  
The men who built this land  
And the farmers and the lumbermen  
And the men who work the mills  
And the poor hard workin' miners  
Who died inside the hill  
  
[Chorus]  
While the rivers that flow  
Are the blood of our land  
And the trucks they keep rumbling  
On the great concrete band  
And the railroads keep pushin'  
To be all they once were  
And nature is calling  
No one's listening to her  
  
And the immigrants by the boat load in a dozen different tongues  
Sang of freedom in the new land  
Climb the ladder rung by rung  
Some to Boston, some to Pittsburgh  
Philadelphia and St. Paul  
And the old ways led to new days  
They were welcome one and all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With the railroads and the riverboats  
And the breadlines far behind  
And the days we sang together long gone but still in mind  
And the men who came before us  
Men who brought us to today  
And the story still unravels from the dreams of yesterday  
  
[Chorus]
