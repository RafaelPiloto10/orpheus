Flying high, touch the sky  
Going to places I never knew  
So goodbye  
And hello, long ago  
  
I can see history  
Standing still, a mystery  
If you will pardon me  
I'm away for the day  
  
Feels so good to be soaring  
'Cause LA was so boring  
Goodbye  
There must be room for growing  
  
Somewhere else and I'm going  
Goodbye  
The days and nights have gone dry  
The last three whole years have flashed by
