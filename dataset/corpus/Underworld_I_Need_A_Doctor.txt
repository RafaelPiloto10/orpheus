In the morning  
Radio jingles  
Drive me mental  
Turning my blood into water (yeah)  
  
Hear the shallow -  
Conversation  
From the station  
Sugar cube a generation (yeah!)  
  
But aah would you take me home?  
Aah - would you know what to do -  
When we got there?  
Aah - may I use your phone?  
I need my mother!  
  
(So) Educate me  
Radio ego  
I will follow  
But what will I find tomorrow (well?)  
  
But aah would you take me home  
Aah to the little white hospital -  
In my head  
Aah - may I use your phone  
I need my mother?!  
  
But aah would you take me home  
Aah would you know what to do -  
When we got there?  
Aah - may I use your phone  
I need a doctor!
