Whenever skies look gray to me,  
And trouble begins to brew  
Whenever the winter winds become too strong,  
I concentrate on you!  
  
When fortune cries nay nay to me,  
And people declare you're through,  
Whenever the blues become my only song,  
I concentrate on you!  
  
On your smile, so sweet, so tender,  
When at first my kiss you declined  
On the light in your eyes, when you surrender,  
And once again our arms intertwine  
And so when wise men say to me,  
That loves' young dream never comes true,  
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,  
I concentrate on you!  
I concentrate, I concentrate,  
On you!
