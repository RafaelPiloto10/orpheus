Did your mother like your Sunday dress  
Astrology eradicated  
So what, so what?  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
  
I'm not out for us to fly or be set free  
So what, so what?  
I'd show you, you'd show me, so much, so much  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
  
Your blood, it flows in from the western sea  
Your eyes, they shine in through this shaded tree  
Oh I believe in you  
These places, they have changed  
I don't know anything but you know me,  
Oh, you know me  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
At all
