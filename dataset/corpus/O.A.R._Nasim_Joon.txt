Caught a train in a dash  
Running hard from my past  
Set to ride this here rail till the end  
Along the way met a queen  
Now, I'm her king  
And we reign our kingdom from a mountaintop  
Where, baby, we can be alone  
  
Almond eyes, royal skin  
This one could do me in  
An I'll live this here life till the end  
We will win, we will win, we're gonna win this here race  
Baby, we can be alone  
My baby, we can be alone  
  
Some day I'll give it all back  
The time you gave  
Now, baby, we can be alone
