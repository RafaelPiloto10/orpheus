Day after day I'll always love you  
Where just to say I'll always love you  
Dear one, your nearness is my treasure  
Dear one, your kiss is rich as wine  
And it's mine, yes it's mine the wonder of you  
Yours, love is yours, because I love you  
To you I give my heart so madly madly beating  
With every beat repeating I'll always love you so  
And it's mine, yes it's mine the wonder of you  
Yours, love is yours, because I love you  
To you I give my heart so madly madly beating  
With every beat repeating I'll always love you so
