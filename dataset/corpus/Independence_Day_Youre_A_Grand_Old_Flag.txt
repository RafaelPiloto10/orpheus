You're a grand old flag,  
You're a high flying flag  
And forever in peace may you wave.  
You're the emblem of  
The land I love.  
The home of the free and the brave.  
Ev'ry heart beats true  
'Neath the Red, White and Blue,  
Where there's never a boast or brag.  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  
Keep your eye on the grand old flag.
