Fate took a freeway to my room  
Said to much while he stayed  
And left too soon.  
Bright on an evening sea,  
He washed in with the tide  
Deep in each other's dreams  
Where all but dreams had died.  
  
Wretched in your thoughts  
Gentle hate within the love you bought.  
  
Words fade like flowers shadowed  
There beneath your wall  
Wind cries from every angle  
Dead leaves left to wait for fall.  
  
And in my darkest hour  
When I can find no light  
My goals are out of sight  
And nothing warms the night.  
  
I close my eyes  
And with such sweet surprise  
I can be anywhere  
I can be anyone.  
  
And in my darkest hour  
When I can find no light  
My goals are out of sight  
And nothing warms the night.  
  
I close my eyes  
And with such sweet surprise  
I can be anywhere  
I can be anything  
I can be anyone  
I can be anyone.
