Lonely man upon the shore  
What on earth are you looking for?  
You're protection is quite clear  
And you're never really near  
Will you ever find what you are looking for?  
  
Seeing others on the shelf  
Only thinking of yourself  
Will you ever start to learn?  
Will your pockets ever burn?  
Will you ever find what you are looking for?  
  
Look at the sky, why do you cry?  
What do you see? Your misery  
  
Look at the sky, why do you cry?  
What do you see? Your misery  
  
Lonely man, you're on your own  
Find someone to take you home  
A friend is what you need  
Would you mind if it was me?  
Maybe then you'll find what you are looking for.  
  
Will you ever find what you are looking for?
