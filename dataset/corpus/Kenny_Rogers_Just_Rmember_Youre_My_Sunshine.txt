Just remember you're my sunshine  
When I'm with you I don't feel any pain  
Just remember that I love you  
Even if I cannot be your man  
I'm not leaving you forever  
But I got business farther down the line  
You got your troubles baby  
I got mine  
  
Hold on, everything will be alright  
Hold on, I got to have a little more time  
Hold on and together we will find  
All the answers, all we need is time now  
  
Just remember that I love you  
When you got no one to hold your hand  
Yes you know I'll be back home  
Just as soon, just as soon as I can  
  
Hold on, everything will be alright  
Hold on, I got to have a little more time  
Hold on and together we will find  
All the answers, all we need is time now
