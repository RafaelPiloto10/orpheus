Smoke in the sky  
Slime in the sea  
Tall timber tumblin' down around me  
Red acid rain  
  
Glows in the night  
Nuclear winter closes down on me  
The light of the world is fading to black  
And the absence of people who care  
  
Is bringing me down, bringing me down  
  
[Chorus]  
God save the queen  
Dear mother earth is dying away  
Time's running out  
One more tomorrow depends on today  
  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide  
Greenhouse condition getting' steamier  
  
Nobody's clean  
Nobody's free  
Nobody's breathin' any easier  
The children of earth are dying each day  
  
And the nightmare of who is to blame  
Is bringing me down, bringing me down  
  
[Chorus]
