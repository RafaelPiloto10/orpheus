Listen to the monkey  
Feeding on your brain  
I feel okay  
No pain!  
  
I'm tired of shocking junkie  
Suckin' on your veins  
Forget no ways  
No ways!  
  
I'm tired of running hunchback  
I've been tripping now for days  
And there is no way  
You don't say!  
  
I got my drip drab velcro moustache  
Keeps them all at bay  
Get yours some day  
Oh yeah!  
  
'Cause we don't love our paycheck  
Battle up your date  
Don't get no love  
No love!  
  
Double takes for feeling  
And empty realities  
'Cause can't get no love  
Get no love!  
  
Come on like eyeball tickler  
Get up of your knees  
And smile above  
Above!  
  
Listen to the monkey  
Feeding on your brain  
I feel okay  
No pain!  
  
I'm tired of shocking junkie  
Suckin' on your veins  
Forget no ways  
No ways!  
  
Desire all you want  
But you got what you need  
Not too much  
Too much!
