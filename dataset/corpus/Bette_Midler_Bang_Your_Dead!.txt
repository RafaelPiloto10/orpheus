"Oh god, oh god. Dumping so early in the evening. I really didn't mean that. I
really didn't mean that."  
  
Above the ground, I'm lifted to the sky,  
And down like a tumbling weed I found myself stranded high and dry.  
A circus ride, oh, it only costs a dime,  
But if you wanna see the fireworks you might have to pay a lifetime.  
  
'Cause love is a carnival  
With lots of laughs, wonderful rides and danger.  
But it feels so good.  
With rockets shootin' in your head,  
'round and 'round and 'round you go.  
Bang, you're dead, baby. Bang, you're dead, baby.  
  
Like a boomerang keeps twisting, twisting in your heart.  
You know the funny part of it is, you always end up where you start.  
You're headed for big clouds. Got the silver lining.  
But you're in for a big surprise.  
There's a river of tears behind it.  
  
'Cause love is a carnival  
With lots of baubles, bangles and beads.  
Beware, beware, beware.  
It feels so good, feels so good.  
With rockets shootin' in your head,  
'round and 'round and 'round you go.  
Bang, you're dead, baby. Bang, you're dead, baby.  
  
Above the ground I'm lifted. Spininng, spinning, spinning out of control.  
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher!  
Above the ground I'm lifted, yeah, to the sky.  
And down like a tumbling weed I found myself stranded high and dry.  
A circus ride, you know it, it only costs a dime,  
But if you wanna see the fireworks you might have to pay.  
Hey, yeah, yeah, to the sky, high. And down like a tumbling weed  
I found myself stranded, stranded.  
Bang, you're dead!
