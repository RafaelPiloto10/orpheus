MC T on a hit and to make sure I don't miss,  
Kick the beat as this fool persists  
  
Step off me, get the hell off, well I'm riding  
Flowing with this funky beat, you suckers keep on tryin'a  
Diss this, uh-uh, I ain't having it  
Sucker duck, understand my schedule work too heavy  
I'm a man, I mean, sometimes it seems hammer claim  
But I can still cop a lean and explain to you  
An MC who's got beef, I'm giving grief to disbelief  
You said that I was new to this well put me on your hit list  
I'm 'quipped to rule, and I squash all the bull  
  
[Chorus: ]  
We got our own ideas!  
We got our own ideas!  
Yeah  
  
Antagonistic action, it's just a fraction  
Oof what I feel for you, I'll take my time in a rhyme  
Yo, let's bust a move, I'm steppin' with confidence  
Yes I know it's evident, a backseat to you that's irrelevant  
You see it's like this, you shot and missed, and now it's my turn  
You learn, you mess with the fire, you burn. and it's a heat up  
Situation sticky  
You're the duck, huh, I won't be picky, I'm bassin'  
You're chasing a dream that I'm livin'  
You stupid pigeon, cause even with the high flow, I keep a low pro  
You step off on me, and that's a sho' nuff n.o.  
I mean a no-go  
Yeah, something like that  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Fuck it, you're tryin' to step on my tip, yeah  
  
I'm a brother with a purpose (pump it up, T)  
So I'll take my time and serve this right  
Despite the negativity,  
Never want society to get the best of me  
You sold out, just another fool, holdin' out  
On the pockets of my brothers tryin' to get clout  
Step back, cast the vapors, your vision's blurred, check out my behaviour  
Calm, cool, never sweat the issue (so what you're saying?)  
What I'm saying is that we're past due  
Gotta stand up and be counted, can't you see the trouble keeps mountin', boy  
And I won't stand for it, so get off  
'Cause I'm about to have a fit  
You can't step unless you step legit  
Enough talk y'all, this is it, let's get ill with this  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
We got our own ideas!  
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
We got our own ideas!  
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
We got our own ideas!  
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
  
As I roast, you toast - can't stand the heat of the aftermath  
The worst you ran with you dis just to get a laugh  
the brother you ridiculed,  
they say you're the king of rules  
yeah, time for school, time for walking,  
I'm stalking, you're talking  
as you run your mouth down, I'm chalking up another way of  
gettin' paid in dividends  
in the end, my friend, its just a verbal blend  
yeah, get with that  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Brothers be jocking, freaks keep clocking  
Brothers be jocking, skeezers are clocking  
  
We got our own ideas!  
Skeezers be on my tip (yeah)  
trying to get with this  
We got our own ideas!  
Skeezers be on my tip (yeah)  
trying to get with this  
Skeezers be on my tip (yeah)  
trying to get with this  
Skeezers be on my tip (yeah)  
We got our own ideas!  
  
Trying to get to this  
Clocking, I got my own ideas,  
And they ain't got nothing to do with what's in here  
See ya next year, 91, in full effect  
I'm getting ign'ant  
(yeah, yeah)  
  
We got our own ideas! (yeah, yeah)
