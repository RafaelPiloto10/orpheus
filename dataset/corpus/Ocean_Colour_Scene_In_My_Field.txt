I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
And I'm love  
I'm in my tree  
  
I take a walk  
Nine hundred miles  
I cross the stile  
I'm in my field  
  
And I'm in love  
And it's for free  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my field  
  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
And I will yield  
I'm in my field  
  
And I'm in love  
Across the stile  
Come in my field  
Just you and me  
  
We'll take a walk  
Nine hundred miles  
And I'm in love  
We'll count the stars  
  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
Well I'm in love  
Just you and me  
  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
Well I'm in love  
I'm in my tree  
  
I take a walk  
Nine hundred miles  
I cross the stile  
I'm in my field
