Outcast, not knowing right from wrong  
Surrounded by women, wine, and song  
Never still always on the run  
Prince of the night, killing with a gun  
  
Now, he's taken a life away  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay  
  
Renegade, he fled from town to town  
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down  
For his head, lies a might price  
He's a wanted man, dead or alive  
  
Where will he go from here  
He's on the run again...nowhere...no, no...  
  
He's got mixed emotions running through his head  
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead  
  
He's on the run, again...(repeat 4 times)  
Tell me when will it end
