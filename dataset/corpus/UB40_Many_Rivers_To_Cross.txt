Many rivers to cross  
But I can't seem to find my way  
Wandering I am lost as I travel along  
The white cliffs of Dover  
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will  
That keeps me alive  
I've been licked, washed up for years and,  
I merely survive because of my pride.  
  
And this loneliness won't leave me alone  
It's such a drag to be in on your own  
My woman left and she didn't say why  
Well I guess, I gotta try.  
Many rivers to cross but where to begin,  
I'm playing for time  
There'll be times when I find myself thinking  
Of committing some dreadful crime.  
  
I've got many rivers to cross  
But I can't seem to find my way  
Wandering I am lost as I travel along  
The white cliffs of Dover  
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will  
That keeps me alive  
I've been licked, washed up for my years and,  
I merely survive because of my pride.
