Watch me as I dance under the spotlight,  
Listen to the people screaming out more, and more  
'Cause I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back,  
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back,  
So captivating when I get it on the floor.  
  
Know y'all been patiently waiting,  
I know you need me, I can feel it,  
I'm a beast, I'm an animal,  
I'm that Monster in the mirror,  
The headliner, finisher,  
I'm the closer, winner.  
Best when under pressure  
with seconds left I show up.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
If you really want more, scream it out louder,  
Get on the floor, bring out the fire,  
And light it up, take it up higher,  
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more.  
  
Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone tight  
Put 'em in the air, if you more (and) more,  
'Cause I can't wait to feel it.  
I go hard, can't stop,  
But if I stop just know that Imma bring it back,  
Never quittin' don't believe in that.  
  
Know y'all been patiently waiting,  
I know you need me, I can feel it,  
I'm a beast, I'm an animal,  
I'm that monster in the mirror,  
The headliner, finisher,  
I'm the closer, winner.  
Best when under pressure  
with seconds left I show up.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more,  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more
