You can't manufacture a miracle  
The silence was pitiful that day.  
A love is getting too cynical  
Passion's just physical these days  
You analyze everyone you meet  
But get no sign, love ain't kind  
Every night you admit defeat  
And cry yourself blind  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you can't wake up in the morning  
Cause your bed lies vacant at night  
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely  
Can't control it, try as you might  
May you find that love that won't leave you  
May you find it by the end of the day  
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely  
Something beautiful will come your way  
  
The DJ said on the radio  
Life should be stereo, each day  
In the past you cast the unsuitable  
Instead of some kind of beautiful, you just couldn't wait  
All your friends think you're satisfied  
But they can't see your soul no, no, no  
Forgot the time feeling petrified, when they lived alone  
  
[Chorus  
  
Some kind of beautiful (will come your way) [Repeat: x4]  
  
All your friends think you're satisfied  
But they can't see your soul no no no  
Forgot the time feeling petrified  
When they lived alone  
  
[Chorus]
