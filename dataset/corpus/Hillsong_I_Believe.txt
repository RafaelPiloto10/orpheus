I said on Sunday how much I want revival  
But then on Monday I can't even find my bible  
Where's power, the power of the cross in my life?  
I'm sick of playing the game of religion  
  
I'm tired of loosing my reason for living  
Where's power, the power of the cross in my life?  
I'm not content just to walk through my life  
Giving in to the lies walking in compromises  
  
Now we cried out as a generation that was lost  
But now is found in the power of the cross  
We believe in You, we believe in the power of the cross and it?s true  
We believe in You, so we lay down the cause that the cross might be found in
You  
  
I'm not satisfied living in my own ways  
I'm not satisfied to do church and walk away  
I'm not satisfied there's no love in my life but You  
I'm not satisfied living in yesterday?s hour  
I'm not satisfied to have the form but not power  
I'm not satisfied oh Lord I am crucified in You
