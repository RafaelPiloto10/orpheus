Pretty little mongo  
Everybody wants her toilet  
Same old story  
She won't let nobody near it  
  
The way she teases them  
It's such a shame  
She's got all the huboons  
Crying out her name  
  
Soo bawls soo bawls  
She's got em howling  
She's got em growling  
Soo bawls soo bawls  
  
She's got em going clean out of their minds  
Soo bawls soo bawls  
There ain't a man in town who wouldn't  
Have her for his daughter  
  
Theys all trade their brains for  
One taste of her toilet water  
1-2-3-4 tell the people what she wore  
They're all trying hard to call her up  
  
But her phone's been disconnected  
Since she sold her butt
