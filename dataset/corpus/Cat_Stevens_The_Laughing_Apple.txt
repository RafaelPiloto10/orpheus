Slowly let me tell you a story of a tree  
An apple tree,  
  
Once in a summertime garden lived a little apple tree  
And the man who owned it wanted it to be picked  
So he sent forth to hire me  
  
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea  
But a never in my traveling days  
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me!  
  
Laugh, oh laugh a little apple  
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful,  
For it will bring you down  
If it ever sees you wearing a frown  
  
So laugh, laugh a little apple  
Well all the apples were hidin'  
Frightened that they might be plucked  
And everytime that somebody passed  
All except that one little apple ducked  
  
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea  
But a never in my traveling days  
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me!  
  
Laugh, oh laugh a little apple  
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful,  
For it will bring you down  
If it ever sees you wearing a frown  
  
So laugh, laugh a little apple
