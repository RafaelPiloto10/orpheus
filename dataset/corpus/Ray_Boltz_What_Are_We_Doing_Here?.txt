What Are We Doing Here?  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Last days, big city  
What a place to live  
High rise accommodations  
Are so executive  
Real life, just around the corner  
Take a walk aroung the block  
Pass by a family in the alley  
Sleeping in a paper box  
Chorus:  
What are we doing here?  
Do we spend our time  
Waiting on heaven?  
What are we doing here?  
Should we pack our bags  
The moment we're forgiven?  
Oh, there's a world  
That needs to know  
Jesus loves them so  
His commission seems quite clear  
What are we doing here?  
They say we are pilgrims  
Just passing through  
Strangers in a strange land  
That's me and you  
One day we'll be up in glory  
Walking on streets of gold  
But right now my feet  
Are on the pavement  
And I just want to know  
Chorus  
I see a starving brother  
In a foreign land  
I see a homeless child  
Reaching out his hand  
I see a world so angry  
I can feel the rage  
I see a city dying  
Filled with crack cocaine  
I hear the lions roar  
The tires squeal  
A generation saying what is real  
If we know the truth  
If we know the way  
There ought to be something  
We can do or say  
We need to make a stand  
Take a walk  
Win this city,  
Do it block by block  
Stand up tall  
And preach it without fear  
If we won't do it  
Then what are we doing here?
