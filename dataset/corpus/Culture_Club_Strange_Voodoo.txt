How can I help you boy  
When I don't even help myself  
I'm useless now as I have always been  
Just like some worthless love song dying on the radio  
We talk in circles til we don't know what we mean  
Ain't No happy ever after  
No big dark man  
Ain't no perfect situation  
Can't you understand  
  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
  
How can I love you boy  
When you don't even love yourself  
I'm useless now as I have always been  
Your lying eyes  
Your thieving hands  
You're such a rogue at times  
But you will always be a part of me  
No happy ever after  
No big dark man  
Ain't no perfect situation  
Ain't no master plan  
  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Ain't no happy ever after  
No big dark man  
Ain't no perfect situation  
Can't you understand  
  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you I keep loving you yes I do
