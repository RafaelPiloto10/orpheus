(This one's for Alexa, okay?)  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah... Ah, ah ah, ah...  
  
Well, it's been building up inside of me for, oh, I don't know how long  
I don't know why but I keep thinking something's bound to go wrong  
But she looks in my eyes and makes me realize and she says  
  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby) Ooh ooh  
  
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut when I started to brag about my car  
But I can't back down now because I pushed the other guys too far  
She makes me come alive and makes me wanna drive when she says  
  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
  
She told me, baby when you race today, just take along my love with you  
And if you knew how much I loved you, baby, nothing could go wrong with you  
Oh, what she does to me when she makes love to me and she says...  
  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
