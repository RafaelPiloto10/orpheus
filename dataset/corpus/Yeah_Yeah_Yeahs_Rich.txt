I'm rich  
Like a hot noise  
Rich rich rich  
I'll take you out, boy  
So stuck up  
I wish you'd stick in to me  
Flesh ripped off  
Raw  
  
Hey!  
Turnin' it  
Beatin' no beat  
The walls are always speakin'  
No want no want no want no speakin' at all  
  
She slipped  
Down a rot drink  
Unzipped  
She doesn't exist  
So unloved  
I took 'em standin' up  
So stuck up  
Raw  
  
I'm rich  
Like a hot noise  
Rich rich rich  
I'll take you out, boy  
I'll take you out, boy  
  
Hey!  
Turnin' it  
Beatin' no beat  
The walls are always speakin'  
No want no want no want no speakin' at all  
Turnin' it  
Beatin' no beat  
The walls are always speakin'  
No want no want no want no speakin' at all  
  
(Rich rich rich rich rich)  
(Rich rich rich rich rich rich)  
(Rich rich rich rich rich rich)  
(Rich rich rich rich rich rich)  
  
Rich rich rich rich rich rich  
Rich rich rich rich rich rich  
Rich rich rich rich rich rich
