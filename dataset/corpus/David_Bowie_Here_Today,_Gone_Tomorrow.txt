You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore  
Stay with them now for they won't see you any more  
Like a gypsy forever on the run  
Stay for a while, while ya look for a whore  
Like that sailor leaves, come back again  
Stay for a while, and they won't see you again  
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run  
Ya stay for a while, then you pick up and go  
  
[Chorus:]  
That's how you show  
Your love for me  
That's how you show  
Your love for me  
You're like  
Here today  
Gone tomorrow  
Each time you call  
You leave a little sorrow  
You're like  
  
Here today  
Gone tomorrow  
Each time you call  
You leave a little sorrow  
You're like  
  
You're like that big, big star, he's tore the town apart  
Givin' everyone to console their aching heart  
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place  
Stay for a while, then you leave without a trace  
That's 'xactly like that star, he tore the town apart  
Leave everyone to console their aching heart  
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place  
Stay for a while, leave without a trace  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You're like  
Here today  
Gone tomorrow  
Each time you call  
You leave a little sorrow  
You're like  
  
Like  
Oooh-huh  
Oh-ho  
Here today  
Gone tomorrow  
Hmmm, like  
You're like  
You're like  
Here today  
Gone tomorrow  
Each time you call  
You leave a little sorrow  
You're like  
You're like  
Here today  
Gone tomorrow  
Each time you call  
You leave a little sorrow  
You're like  
  
Yeah  
Here today  
Here today but gone tomorrow  
(spoken: thank you)
