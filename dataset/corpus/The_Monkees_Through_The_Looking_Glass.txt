You call my name then you run for protection  
I reach out to hold ya' but it's just a reflection  
Throught the looking glass  
  
Now you've been looking at your life through a mirror  
It's time you started seeing things a little bit clearer than  
Through the looking glass  
  
Watch me break through, girl  
I still love you, girl  
  
I think you love me by the way you come on girl  
Then I turn away for a minute, you're gone girl  
Through the looking glass  
  
Ahh...  
You're looking through me  
Like you never knew me  
  
I've got some things that I'm tryin' to show ya  
But you fade away how can I get to know 'ya  
Through the looking glass
