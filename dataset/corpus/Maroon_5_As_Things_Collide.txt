You have this way of dipping in and out of  
Sight as things collide  
Bridges burning softly in the night  
And you have this way of falling in and out of  
Time as it goes by  
Passing silently with no goodbye  
  
And I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do  
  
Telegram came today from a friend  
Saying, "Where in the hell have you been?  
Where are you goin'? "  
I said, "I don't know, does the loneliness show?  
And if so does it ever end? "  
  
And I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do  
  
You have this way of meaning everything and nothing to me  
At the same time  
Returning my hellos with goodbyes  
  
'Cause I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do...  
  
'Cause I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do...  
  
And I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do
