Take me now baby here as I am  
Pull me close, try and understand  
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe  
Love is a banquet on which we feed.  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hand  
Take my hand, come under cover,  
They can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now.  
Because the night was made for lovers,  
Because the night was made for love.  
Because the night was made for lovers,  
Because the night was made for us.  
Have I doubt when I'm alone ?  
Love is a ring, the telephone.  
Love is an angel disguised as lust  
Here in our bed till the morning comes.  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel under your command.  
Take my hand, come under cover,  
They can't touch me now,  
Can touch me now,  
Can touch me now.  
Because the night belongs to lovers,  
Because the night belongs to love.  
Because the night belongs to lovers,  
Because the night belongs to us.  
My love would leave  
No doubt a vicious circle turns and burns.  
Without you, oh I could not live  
Forgive the only person.  
I believe, yes I believe in freedom,  
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now.  
Because the night belongs to lovers,  
Because the night belongs to love.  
Because the night belongs to lovers,  
Because the night belongs to us.  
Because tonight there are true lovers,  
Can we believe in the night we trust.  
Because tonight there are true lovers,  
Because tonight belongs to us.
