747 11 come to bust  
Somebody take me home I wanna live in lust  
When trust is low and stakes are high  
That's all I ever did in Denver was die  
That's all I ever did in New York was die  
That's all I ever did in L.A. was die  
So put em' up, put em' up to the sky  
And wave goodbye to Miss American Pie  
Cuz you been tellin' lies, you took it all and abused it  
Whatever happened to the feel good music?  
Somewhere, somehow, someway, somebody pulled the plug  
And left me sittin' in a dirty little body  
  
I gotta tell you baby life's been good to me  
And I know that makes you mad  
Cause that's something you can't see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And I'll never give that back  
Oh I know you hate that fact  
But you ain't gotta look at me like that  
I said you ain't gotta look at me like that  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
  
You run around pullin' stunts like that  
See never in my life could I front like that  
I ain't cut like that, I couldn't run like that  
I'm a keep it nonfiction and take my hatuh  
Remember back when things looked grim  
I spent a lot of time and money on whims  
I remember the crew, remember the good times  
Remember the orange and I remember the sunshine  
It's all gone that's a thing of the past  
The fact remains that it moves real fast  
So why you sit around hopin' things might change  
I'll be sittin' pretty singin' Hey Pockey Way!  
  
I gotta tell you baby life's been good to me  
And I know that makes you mad  
Cause that's something you can't see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And I'll never give that back  
Oh I know you hate that fact  
But you ain't gotta look at me like that  
I said you ain't gotta look at me like that  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
  
You'll hear me comin' hummin' songs of redemption huh  
I've been oppressed for less that attention  
I got your extension, but I'll probably never call  
Cause this time last year you ain't seen me in your crystal ball  
And I'm uphauled by things you've done  
Left a trail of wrongs and can't account for one  
Now you're done and I'm glad but it's a shame you'd waste it  
You want this so bad you can taste it  
Detroit love can you feel that feel that  
That's stick an move can you feel that feel that  
I'm on the rack for the two triple zero  
Full failure all American Hero  
  
I gotta tell you baby life's been good to me  
And I know that makes you mad  
Cause that's something you can't see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And I'll never give that back  
Oh I know you hate that fact  
But you ain't gotta look at me like that  
I said you ain't gotta look at me like that  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
  
I'm here to tell you baby life's been good to me  
I know that makes you mad  
Cause that's something you can't see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And I'll never give that back  
I know you hate that fact  
But you ain't gotta look at me like that  
I said you ain't gotta look at me like that  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at
