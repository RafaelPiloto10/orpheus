It wasn't that I didn't love you  
I just couldn't make you see  
That as hard as I've tried  
To make it all better  
It was not better for me  
  
The love that I gave you was all around you  
There was nothing left for me  
But I hate to say it  
But I saw it coming  
My feeling were changing  
  
I only say what you want to hear  
When there is a conflict I stay clear  
When he wants loving  
I was in tears  
He knows my fears  
  
I wish I could figure a way around this  
She says, like a sad song  
I don't understand the way that I feel  
I am terrified of being wrong  
Well, I am not happy  
I am not crazy  
Are you listening  
Do you hear  
Everything happens for a reason  
Stay clear  
  
I only say what you want to hear  
When there is a conflict I stay clear  
When he wants loving  
I was in tears  
He knows my fears  
  
When love changes in the flash of an eye  
It leaves people burning by the side of the road  
You stand there you've got nothing to hold  
For the first time you are alone  
  
It wasn't that I didn't love you  
But I just couldn't make you see  
That as hard as I've tried  
To make it all better  
It was not better for me  
  
The love that I gave you was all around you  
There was nothing left for me  
I hate to say it  
But I saw it coming  
My feeling were changing  
  
I only say what you want to hear  
When there is a conflict I stay clear  
When he wants loving  
I was in tears  
He knows my fears  
  
When love changes in the flash of an eye  
It leaves people burning by the side of the road  
You stand there you've got nothing to hold  
For the first time you are alone  
  
That don't mend the sorrow  
Or reinvent the pleasure  
Mend the sorrow  
Reinvent the pleasure  
Oh no, yeah  
That don't mend the sorrow
