Music: Achinoam Nini  
  
Transliteration:  
  
Et ha'even nashakti betsinat chalomah,  
Ki ani hamizmor vehi hadmamah,  
Ki hi hachidah va'ani hechad,  
Ki shneinu koratsnu minetsach echad.  
  
Et ha'even nashakti, et oshrah haboded.  
Hi shvuat emunim veani haboged,  
Ani hacholef vehi hakayam,  
Hi sodot habriah, veani - giluyam,  
Vaeda ki nagati belev ne'elam:  
Ani hamshorer vehi - ha'olam  
  
Translation:  
I kissed the rock in her chilly dream  
For she is the silence and I am the scream  
She is the riddle and I want to know  
Both of us sprung from eternity's bow  
  
I kissed the rock, her lonely crater  
She has sworn loyalty, I am the traitor  
She is forever, I am just passing through  
She's the old secret, I am the new  
  
Her silent heart touched, she helped me to know it:  
She is the universe I am the poet
