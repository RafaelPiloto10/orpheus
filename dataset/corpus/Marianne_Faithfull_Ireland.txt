There is a land that I can go to  
When I have time to rest.  
All the people I love are there  
And those who love me best.  
  
[Chorus]  
Then I heard the wind  
Calling from over the sea  
Saying, "Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?"  
"Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?"  
  
This land I go to when I'm tired  
And need to see and walk in green.  
The people who can laugh and drink  
And see things others have not seen.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There is another side to this pure land,  
A side of blood and guilt and pain  
A side of enemy and friend  
And sorrow at the hearth side stain.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There is a land that I can go to  
When I have time to rest.  
All the people I love are there  
And those who love me best.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?"  
"Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?"
