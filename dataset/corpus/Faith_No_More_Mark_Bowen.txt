Love...it's a beginning  
A justifiable means to an end  
And happiness, that triumphant feeling  
Only comes from within  
But ...you'll...never make the grade  
No you'll never, ever reach that plateau  
You're down below  
And it's where your soul will forever glow  
But it's not that ray of sunshine that feels so warm  
It's just that bottomless inferno  
  
You're in the depths of hell  
And I think that's swell  
And I hope you get well  
  
Well done, fried in and out  
Burned to a crisp, if that's what I wish  
I didn't write the rules  
I just follow them to a tee  
Cause that's me, I'm evil  
I'm hateful, I'm sinful, forgetful, mistrustful  
I'm diseased and contagious  
I'm suicide, homicide, genocide, pesticide  
  
I'm a human bomb  
I'll kill anyone  
And so are you, So don't be coy  
Cause you too can destroy me like a toy  
Not like Mark Bowen  
He never done nothin' to no one  
... That didn't deserve it.
