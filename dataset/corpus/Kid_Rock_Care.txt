Day by day my life gets colder  
My ice grows thin, as I get older  
Peace in peaces, bloody and bruised  
I feel so helpless and confused  
  
'Cause I hear screamin' on the left  
Yellin' on the right  
I'm sitting in the middle tryin' to live my life  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless, feed the poor  
I can't walk on water  
I can't save your sons and daughters  
I can't change the world and make things fair  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do is care  
  
I pray and pray for life's salvation  
Faith is tried and true in tribulation  
Love is lost and lonely, check the news  
And with these open arms I'll wait for you  
  
'Cause I hear screamin' on the left  
And yelling on the right  
I'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For the life of me, I can't see how the devil keeps enticing me  
All you sees a felon, I know god can see whats right in me  
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place  
When the worst case scenario is my birth place  
I'm just tryin to keep from fallin' victim to the murder rate  
Take my life lesson convincing the adolescents  
There's a god up in heaven, sending down blessings  
And your future ain't brighter than your present  
Quit stressin'  
  
They're screamin' on the left  
Yellin' on the right  
While I'm sittin' in the middle trying to live my life  
  
'Cause I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless, feed the poor  
Can't walk on water I can't save your sons and daughters  
I can't change the world to make things fair  
The least that I can do is care  
  
Yeah I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless feed the poor  
I cant walk on water  
I can't save your sons and daughters  
I can't change the world and make things fair  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
Oh is care!
