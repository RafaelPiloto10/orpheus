This is the story about Mona Lisa  
The Mona Lisa  
Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell  
About Mona Lisa and how she suddenly fell  
See everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well  
Now I am taking over to release her from her spell  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone, she's been gone, she's been gone  
She was taken under drowning in her sea  
Running like an angel, she was crying and could not see, oh no  
Now see everyone's watching as she starts to fall  
They want her to breakdown be a legend of her fall  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone, she's been gone, she's been gone  
Ladies does that make you cry?  
Mona Lisa's got to fly, nobody really dies  
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence right here  
God  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
That she's home, that she's home  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
That she's home, that she's home, that she's home
