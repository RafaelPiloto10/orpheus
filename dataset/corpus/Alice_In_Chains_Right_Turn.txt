Inside always trying to get back inside  
But it's so hard to penetrate pig-thick skin  
I'm 'bout as low as I can get  
I'd leave but I can't forget  
Still I wonder why it ain't right, mmm it ain't right, oooh  
Ain't right, mmm it ain't right, yeah  
'Bout as low as she can get  
She'll leave me but she won't forget  
And she wonders why she ain't right, she ain't right  
  
Ain't right, she ain't right  
Now we're as low as we can get  
Can't leave and can't forget  
We ain't right, we ain't right  
Not right, we ain't right  
Well it's hard to believe that somebody tricked you  
when you can see you were only high  
It's all up to you so you gamble  
flat on your face and into the fire
