[Nicole](Diddy)  
It's Bad Boy  
Do it do it do it do it  
Do it do it do it do it  
  
(It feels good to be back, I missed ya)  
Relax your mind, let cha conscious be free  
Ya now rollin with the sounds of the bbe  
Do it do it do it do it  
Do it do it do it do it  
  
(You know what time it is)  
(Report to the dance floor)  
It's bad boy  
(Talk to 'em)  
  
[Nicole]  
See you out the corner of my eye  
Leanin on the wall lookin fly  
I want you to come be with me  
You're the only one I wanna talk to  
But I don't wanna rush  
I'm here when will you make your move?  
  
[Chorus - Nicole]  
I see you, eyein me', I want cha, why don't cha  
Come to me, I can be, what you need, oh baby  
I'm standin, been waitin, I'm yearnin, I'm burnin  
Get to know me, come get to know me  
Come show me, that you wanna know me  
  
[Diddy]  
You know what it is, I'm back in the building  
Security strapped, still stackin a million  
Stump with a stallion, somethin' Italian  
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris  
I'm in it to win it I'm willin to carry  
The game, if you think I'm not look at the carats  
Pop up clean up outta the Phantom  
The people go screamin like an opera anthem  
I did it before, do it again  
I got it to blow, got it to spend  
Lies before, cool as the wind  
Got hits go back like Juice n Gin, yeah  
Shining the best diamond necklaces  
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes  
They know I'm the ish, they wanna get next to it  
That's why she havin'a fit cause she want to get next to him  
  
[Chorus - Nicole]  
I'm here when will you make your move?  
I see you, eyein' me, I want cha, why don't cha  
Come to me, I can be, what you need, oh baby  
I'm standin, been waitin, I'm yearnin, I'm burnin  
Get to know me, come get to know me  
Come show me, that you wanna know me  
  
[Diddy](Nicole)  
Anywhere I appear, they all stop and stare  
Admire your body language speakin loud and clear like  
(I want you to come be with me)  
She be waitin anticipatin for oh so long  
Fantasizing wild thoughts of me comin on like  
(I'm here when will you make your move)  
She diggin my style, my swag, my sway, my swirve  
My way with words, the Boys observe for sure  
You can't fault her my aura called her  
I make miracles like I walk on water  
What you want mama order, it's on my tab  
I'm so bad with the cash, I drop a whole bag  
Where you at girl?  
  
[Chorus - Nicole]  
I'm here when will you make your move?  
I see you, eyein', I want cha, why don't cha  
Come to me, I can be, what you need, oh baby  
I'm standin, been waitin, I'm yearnin, I'm burnin  
Get to know me, come get to know me  
Come show me, that you wanna know me  
  
[Nicole]  
I'm here right now, can't wait no longer  
You were the one who stole my heart  
Can't you see the wait is over  
I need you to come closer  
Please believe it's getting stronger  
You really got me hot  
  
[Chorus - Nicole]  
I see you, eyein', I want cha, why don't cha  
Come to me, I can be, what you need, oh baby  
I'm standin, been waitin, I'm yearnin, I'm burnin  
Get to know me, come get to know me  
Come show me, that you wanna know me  
  
[Diddy and Nicole]  
Do it do it do it do it  
Do it do it do it do it

Do it do it do it do it  
Why don't cha come to me

I'm here, you're here, let's make it happen  
Do it do it do it do it  
Do it do it do it do it
