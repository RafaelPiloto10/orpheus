You swear you've had enough, you're ready to give up  
On that little lie they call love, then out of the blue clear sky  
Fallin' right into your hands, like rain on the desert sand  
It's the last thing you had planned out of the blue clear sky.  
  
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love  
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love  
Surprise your new love has arrived  
Out of the blue clear sky.  
  
Ain't love a funny thing, one day you're givin' up the dream  
And the next you're pickin' out a ring out of the blue clear sky.  
  
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love  
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love  
Surprise your new love has arrived  
Out of the blue clear sky.
