Hey hey

I don't wanna hurt ya  
I just wanna know ya  
Read me your script later baby I'll call ya,  
Body so sick gotta get next to ya  
I've been waitin' all night long to know you're name  
Everything about ya girl I want  
And ya gotta know that  
I don't wanna hurt ya  
I just wanna know ya  
Read me your script later baby I'll call ya  
  
Girl, maybe we need to spend sometime  
Cause you got me gone  
(I'm so gone)  
And I won't wanna be a player once you're mine  
Cause this is  
More than before  
This is real  
I'm an 18 year old grown ass man tryin' to get in you're life  
  
Let go!  
I don't wanna hurt ya, I just wanna know ya  
Read me your script later baby I'll call ya,  
Body so sick gotta get next to ya  
I've been waitin' all night long to know you're name  
I don't wanna hurt ya,  
I just wanna know ya  
Read me your script later baby I'll call ya,  
Body so sick gotta get next to ya  
I've been waitin' all night long to know you're name  
Everything about you girl I want  
And you gotta know that  
I don't wanna hurt ya  
I just wanna know ya  
Read me your script later baby I'll call ya  
  
Most don't get  
All of that brain and the face is so flawless  
She's such a beautiful girl  
And every fantasy at night I dream about is all in you  
If I try  
Would you take me where you are  
That place that many won't ever get a chance to see  
You've been so cold  
(been so cold)  
Maybe, (baby)  
If you let me  
Your flame  
(your flame)  
Will be on again  
Tell me what you want  
(come tell me what you want)  
'cause I won't sleep  
I won't cheat  
Love me  
Its all that you give  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna hurt ya  
I just wanna know ya  
Read me your script later baby I'll call ya  
Body so sick gotta get next to ya  
I've been waitin all night long to know you're name  
I don't wanna hurt ya  
I just wanna know ya  
Read me your script later baby I'll call ya  
Body so sick gotta get next to ya  
I've been waitin' all night long to know you're name  
  
I've been thinking bout the way  
That I'm gonna take it down  
Ain't no way that you would bein need  
'Cause you'd be all I'm thinking bout  
Ain't no way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Know your name  
To know your name  
I don't wanna hurt ya  
I just wanna know ya  
Read me your script later baby I'll call ya  
  
Tell me what I gotta do
