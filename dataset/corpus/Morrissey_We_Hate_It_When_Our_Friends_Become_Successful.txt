We hate it when our friends become successful  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
Oh, look at those clothes  
Now look at that face, it's so old  
And such a video !  
Well, it's really laughable  
Ha, ha, ha  
  
[Chorus:]  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse  
And if we can destroy them  
You bet your life we will  
Destroy them  
If we can hurt them  
Well, we may as well  
It's really laughable  
Ha, ha, ha  
  
You see, it should've been me  
It could've been me  
Everybody knows  
Everybody says so  
They say :  
  
"Ah, you have loads of songs  
So many songs  
More songs than they'd stand  
  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
Oh, look at those clothes  
Now look at that face, it's so old  
And such a video !  
Well, it's really laughable  
Ha, ha, ha  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just listen  
La, la-la, la-la
