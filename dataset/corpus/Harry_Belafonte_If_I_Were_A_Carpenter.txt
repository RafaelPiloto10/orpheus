If I were a carpenter  
And you are a lady  
Would you marry me anyway?  
Would you have my baby?  
  
If a tinker were my trade  
Would you still find me?  
Carrying the pots I made  
Following behind me  
  
Save my love through loneliness  
Save my love for sorrow  
I've given you my onliness  
Come and give me your tomorrow  
  
If I worked my hands in wood  
Would you still love me?  
Answer me babe, "Yes, I would  
I'll put you above me"  
  
If I were a miller  
At a mill wheel grinding  
Would you miss your color box  
And your soft shoe shining?  
  
Save my love through loneliness  
I'll save my love for sorrow  
I've given you my onliness  
Come and give me your tomorrow  
  
If I were a carpenter  
And you are a lady  
Would you marry me anyway?  
Would you have my baby?  
  
I'm a carpenter, just a carpenter  
I'm a carpenter, just a carpenter  
I'm a carpenter, just a carpenter
