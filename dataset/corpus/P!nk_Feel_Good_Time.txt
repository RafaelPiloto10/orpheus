Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
  
We go where we like, we got over time  
We get paid to rattle our chains  
We go in the back, paint our money black  
Spend it on the enemy  
  
  
Sleepin' in the church, ridin' in the dirt  
Put a banner over my grave  
Make a body work, make a beggar hurt  
Sell me somethin' big and untamed  
  
  
Now our time  
Real good time  
Now our time (Now our time)  
Real good time  
Now our time (Said now our time)  
Real good time (It's a really good time)  
(Baby, you're mine)  
  
  
We know how to pray, party every day  
Make a desolation of play  
Ridin' in a rut till the powers cut  
We don't even have a good name  
  
  
Sleepin' in the church, ridin' in the dirt  
Put a banner over my grave  
Make a body work, make a beggar hurt  
Sell me somethin' big and untamed  
  
  
Now our time (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)  
Real good time (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)  
Now our time (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)  
A real good time  
Now our time (Now our time)  
A real good time (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
(Baby, you're mine)  
  
  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
  
Now our time (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)  
Real good time (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)  
Now our time (Said now our time)  
Real good time (It's a really good time)  
Now our time (Now our time)  
Real good time (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)  
  
  
Feel good, real good  
It's the same old sayin'  
Feel good, feel good  
Don't got no brains  
  
  
Feel good, real good  
It's the same old sayin'  
Feel good, real good  
Don't have no brains (I don't got no brains)  
Baby, you're mine
