Can you make it easier for me to understand,  
How you're holding my heart, in your trembling hands...  
Eyes that rise to meet me half way up among the stars,  
You may be from Venus but I'm definitely not from Mars  
  
[Chorus]  
You're An Ocean, You're An Ocean  
Settle Down, Settle Down,  
What's the commotion,  
I'm an island, but you're an ocean,  
It's a stormy sea of love and emotion,  
You've got me suspended motionless in time  
  
Make the warm winds circle round my head just like you do,  
If I could do it, I'd be doing it to you,  
I believe I'd buy whatever you would sell to me,  
Nothing in my life ever came with a guarantee,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I believe I'd buy whatever you would sell to me,  
Nothing in my life ever came with a guarantee,  
  
You're An Ocean, You're An Ocean  
Settle Down, Settle Down,  
What's the commotion,  
I'm an island, but you're an ocean,  
It's a stormy sea of love and emotion,  
You've got me suspended motionless in time
