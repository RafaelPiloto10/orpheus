There's a rich girl  
You know you've gone too far  
And you know it don't matter anyway  
You can rely on your old man's money  
You can rely on your old man's money  
It's a bitch girl  
And you've gone too far  
And you know it don't matter anyway  
Money money  
Won't get you too far, get you too far  
  
Don't you know, don't you know  
That it's wrong to take what is given you  
So far gone, on your own  
And you can get along, but you gotta be strong  
You can never be strong

You know you've gone too far  
And you know it don't matter anyway  
Money money  
Won't get you too far, get you too far  
  
High and dry, out of the rain  
It's so easy  
To hurt others when you can't feel pain  
So far gone, on your own  
And you can get along, but you gotta be strong  
You can never be strong  
  
Don't you know, don't you know  
That it's wrong to take what is given you  
So far gone, on your own  
And you can get along, but you gotta be strong  
You can never be strong
