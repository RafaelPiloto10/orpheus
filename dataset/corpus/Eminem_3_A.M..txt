Woah  
There is no escaping (yo)(yo)  
There's no place to hide(yo)(yo)  
You scream, someone save me(yo)(yo)  
But they don't pave no mind( yo) (yo)  
(Good night)  
Good bye  
  
Your walkin' down a horror corridor  
It's almost four in the mornin'  
And your in a nightmare  
It's horrible  
Right there's the coroner  
Waitin' for you  
To turn the corner  
So he can corner ya  
Your a goner  
He's on a ya  
Out the corner of his cornea  
He just saw you run  
All you want is to rest  
Cause you can't run anymore  
Your done  
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience  
While everybody  
Is watchin' in the party applauding it  
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again  
Contemplating my next plot again  
Swallowin' a colata pin  
While I'm noddin'  
In and out on the ottoman and  
If the Ramada Inn  
Holdin' onto the pill bottle then  
Stick my finger and swirl it round the bottom  
And make sure I got all of it  
Wake up naked at Mcdonald's  
With  
Blood all over me  
Dead bodies  
Behind the counter  
Shit  
Guess I must of just blacked out again  
Not again  
  
[Chorus]  
It's three am in the mornin'  
Put my key in the door  
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and  
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em  
Killed em  
I said  
It's three am in the mornin'  
Put my key in the door  
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and  
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em  
Killed em  
  
Sitting nude in my living room  
It's almost noon  
I wonder what's on the tube  
Maybe they'll show some boobs  
Surfing every channel  
Until I find Hannah Montana  
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin'  
Blood all over the wall panel and dismantlin'  
Every candle on top of the fire place  
Mantalin'  
Grab my flannel and my bandana' then  
Kiss the naked manequin' man again  
You can see him standin' in my  
Front window  
If you look in  
I'm just a hooligan  
Who's use to usin' hallucinogens  
Causin' illusions again  
Brain contusions again  
Cutting and bruising the skin  
Raise the scissors and pins  
Jesus when does it end  
Phases that I go through  
Dazed and not so confused  
Days that I don't know who  
Gave these molecules too  
Me  
What am I gone do  
Hey the prodigal son  
The diabolical one  
Very methodical  
When I slaughter dem  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She puts the lotion in the bucket  
He puts the lotion on the skin  
Or else it gets the hose again  
She puts the lotion in the bucket  
He puts the lotion on the skin  
Or else it gets the hose again  
  
I duck and I slash slice and gash  
Last night was a blast  
I can't quite remember when I  
Had that much fun  
Off a half pint fifth of Jack  
My last Vic and a half  
A flashlight  
Up Kim Kardashians ass  
  
I remember the first time  
I dismembered the family member  
December I think it was  
I was having drinks with my cousin  
And I wrapped him  
In Christmas lights  
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub  
Cut him up into pieces  
Then just when I went to drink his  
Blood  
I thought I outta drink his bath water  
That outta be fun  
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun  
The sight of blood excites me  
That might be an artery son  
Your blood coverin' screams  
Just don't seem to bother me none  
It's three am  
And here I come  
So you should probably run  
A secret passage way around here  
Man there's got to be one  
Oh no there's probably none  
He can scream all that he wants  
Top of his lungs  
It ain't no stoppin' me from choppin' him up(up)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
yo (yo)  
A yo (a yo)  
yo (yo)  
A yo (a yo)  
yo (yo)  
A yo (a yo)  
yo (yo)  
A yo ( a yo)
