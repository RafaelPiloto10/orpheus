I think you know  
That it's not my way  
And I can't hold back  
What I've got to say  
Wanna tell you what I'm going through  
As I see it in your eyes  
You're feeling the same way too  
  
CHORUS:  
Seems like we've been waiting so long  
And lately it's been coming on  
Much too strong  
The way that I want you  
The way that I need you  
I'll keep you here just  
As long as I can keep you  
We can have everything  
If you love me tonight  
It's gonna be alright tonight  
We've gotta break away  
We've gotta break away  
  
  
I can't hide what I  
Been feeling all along  
'Cause deep inside you know  
We can't be wrong  
I've decided now the rest  
Is up to you  
Don't keep me waiting  
Tell me what to do  
  
  
CHORUS:  
  
  
Don't keep me waiting  
Knowing you'll say that you want to  
Tell me you want me  
As much as you know  
That I want you  
We can have everything  
  
  
Oh yeah  
We can have it all  
If you love me tonight  
It's gonna be alright tonight  
We've gotta break away  
We've gotta break away  
Tonight, tonight  
It's gonna be alright tonight
