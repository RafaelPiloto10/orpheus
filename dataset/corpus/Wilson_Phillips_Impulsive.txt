The secret of love, I thought I understood  
the way it's supposed to be.  
I never imagined you could blow my theory apart.  
But now you're running away with my heart  
  
I don't wanna think about it,  
don't wanna think clear, don't analyze what I'm doing here.  
Wanna be impulsive, reckless, and lose myself in your kiss.  
  
Arrows through hearts drawn on a misty window.  
You're taking me home in the rain.  
My heart is beating. Don't say no.  
My head keeps saying take it slow.  
  
I don't wanna think about it, don't wanna think clear,  
don't analyze what I'm doing here.  
Wanna be impulsive, reckless, and lose myself in your kiss.  
  
You're giving me a feeling it's a sudden rush.  
Acting on the moment, it's spontaneous.  
Wo wo oh.  
This is not like me to follow my heart so easily.  
I am reckless, impulsive.  
I never imagined you could blow my theory apart.  
But you're running away with my heart, my heart.  
  
I don't wanna think about it,  
don't wanna think clear, don't analyze what I'm doing here.  
Wanna be impulsive, reckless and lose myself in your kiss.  
You're givin' feeling.  
It's a sudden rush.  
Acting on the moment, it's spontaneous.  
Wanna be impulsive, reckless, and lose my self in your kiss.  
  
Impulsive, I wanna be impulsive.  
I'm gonna be impulsive, reckless and lose myself,
