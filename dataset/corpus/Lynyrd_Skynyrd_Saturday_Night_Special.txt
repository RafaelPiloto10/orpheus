Two feet they come a creepin'  
Like a black cat do  
And two bodies are layin' naked  
A creeper think he got nothin' to lose  
So he creeps into this house, yeah  
And unlocks the door  
And as a man's reaching for his trousers  
Shoots him full of thirty-eight holes  
  
Mr. Saturday night special  
Got a barrel that's blue and cold  
Ain't good for nothin'  
But put a man six feet in a hole  
  
Big Jim's been drinkin' whiskey  
And playin' poker on a losin' night  
And pretty soon ol' Jim starts a thinkin'  
Somebody been cheatin' and lyin'  
So Big Jim commence to fightin'  
I wouldn't tell you no lie  
Big Jim done pulled his pistol  
Shot his friend right between the eyes  
  
Mr. Saturday night special  
Got a barrel that's blue and cold  
Ain't good for nothin'  
But put a man six feet in a hole  
  
Oh, it's the Saturday night special, for twenty dollars you can buy yourself
one too  
  
Hand guns are made for killin'  
They ain't no good for nothin' else  
And if you like to drink your whiskey  
You might even shoot yourself  
So why don't we dump 'em people  
To the bottom of the sea  
Before some ol' fool come around here  
Wanna shoot either you or me  
  
Mr. Saturday night special  
You got a barrel that's blue and cold  
You ain't good for nothin'  
But put a man six feet in a hole  
  
Mr. the Saturday night special  
And I'd like to tell you what you could do with it  
And that's the end of the song
