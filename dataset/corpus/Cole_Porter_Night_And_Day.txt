Night and day, you are the one  
Only you beneath the moon, under the sun  
Whether near to me or far  
It's no matter darlin', where you are  
  
I think of you night and day  
Night and day, why's it so  
That this longing for you, follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic's boom  
  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you night and day  
Night and day, under the hide of me  
There's an ooh, such a hungry yearning, burning inside of me  
  
And this torment won't be through  
Till you let me spend my life making love to you  
Day and Night  
Night and Day
