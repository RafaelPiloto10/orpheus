Oh you sad one  
Playing the Angel  
Isn't so easy where you're from  
  
Oh you wild one  
Devil's companion  
You won't stay satisfied for long  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want you to change anything you do  
I don't want you to be someone else for me  
  
Oh you dark one  
Eternal outsider  
Caught in the spider's web you've spun  
  
Oh you blind one  
Gentle and kind one  
Seeing the world as a loaded gun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stay as you are the Darkest Star  
Shining for me  
Majestically  
  
[Chorus]
