Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm  
You splash me with beauty and pull me down  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance truns to a stare  
Obsession rules me - I'm yours from the start  
I know you see me - Our eyes interlock  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
One minute here and one minute there  
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry  
One minute here and one minute there  
And then you wave good-bye...  
Sifting to the bottom, every day for two  
All energy funnels, all becomes you  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
One minute here and one minute there  
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry  
One minute here and one minute there  
And then you wave good-bye...
