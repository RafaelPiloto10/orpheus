You gotta find a way  
Yeah, I can't wait another day  
Ain't nothin' gonna change  
If we stay around here  
I gotta do what it takes  
Because it's all in our hands  
We all make mistakes  
Yeah, but it's never to late to start again (yeah yeah)  
Take another breath  
And say another prayer  
  
Then fly away from here  
To anywhere  
Yeah, I don't care  
If we just fly away from here  
Our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
Won't let time pass us by  
We'll just fly  
  
If this life  
Gets any harder now  
It ain't no nevermind  
Ya got me by your side  
And anytime you want (fly fly fly)  
Yeah we catch a train  
And find a better place  
Yeah, 'cause we won't let nothin'  
Or no one keep gettin' us down  
Maybe you and I  
Could pack our bags and hit the sky  
  
Then fly away from  
To anywhere  
Yeah, I don't care  
If we just fly away from here  
And our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
I won't let time pass us by  
We'll just fly  
  
Do you see a bluer sky now  
You could have a better ride now  
Open your eyes  
  
Because no one here can ever stop us  
They can try but we won't let them  
No way-ay-ay-ay-yeah-ah  
  
Maybe you and I  
Could pack our bags and say goodbye  
  
Then fly away from here  
To anywhere  
No honey I don't care  
If we just fly away from here  
And our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
Fly away from here (ya ya ya)  
Yeah anywhere  
Now honey, I don't I don't I don't fly (yeah)  
  
We just fly (fly away)
