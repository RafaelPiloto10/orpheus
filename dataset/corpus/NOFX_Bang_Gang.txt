We don't care,  
Cause we're in a gang  
Parties that we go end up in a bang  
Look at us funny and we'll shoot you dead  
While we're there we'll fill 'em with lead  
We follow the gangs, we are the worst  
We'll be the last one,  
But we weren't the first  
We've been in a gang for a year and a half  
There goes our future,  
But we live in the past  
Let's go out, shoot some people tonight  
We use guns, cause we don't wanna lose the fight  
When we fight, it's 20 on 1 it's funny that way,  
It's much more fun everyone knows that we're so bad  
Our knives are long and our day is short  
Our nights our long, and our days are sad  
But we don't care cause we're in a gang
