Underneath the foreign stars  
In a foreign place where they don't love you  
I do care,  
In the pale moonlight  
Your eyes are wide  
And the band plays...  
Everybody wants you  
  
And he takes your hand tenderly  
And he whispers  
Sweet surrender, nothing  
How he feels about girls like you  
Your flip flop smiles,  
And your big blue eyes  
On vacation  
  
[Chorus]  
Dance with me into the ocean  
Roll with me into the sea  
Don't tell me the world is in trouble  
  
Do you want to dance with me?  
  
Go, changes hands as the big waves  
Crash and dream don't die  
But I do  
Where were you when I needed you  
Right now  
The telephone just rings,  
I'm gonna find you...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you want to dance with me, oh  
Do you want to dance with me?  
  
Underneath the foreign sun  
With a foreign man who is gone and almost forgotten  
Take everything you see  
And remember us and wonder,  
If you will be forgiven...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't tell me the world is in trouble  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you want to dance with me  
Do you want to dance with me, oh  
Do you want to dance with me?
