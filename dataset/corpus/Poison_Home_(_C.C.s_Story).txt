[Chorus]  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
  
You know I never ever thought I would say just how much I love L.A.  
Until we got aboard a plane and toured around the world  
  
We went to London, Paris, France and Spain, all it fuckin' did was rain  
Bobby went insane and Bret left with a geisha girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rikki has so many bags, customs almost beat his ass  
They threw me out of first class 'cause I said we were the bomb  
  
The tour bus that we had won't go  
Got stuck in seven feet of snow  
The road crew couldn't get no blow  
And the sound man broke his arm  
  
[Chorus: x2]
