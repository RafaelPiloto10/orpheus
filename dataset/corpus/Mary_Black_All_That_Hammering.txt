I used to think joy, was the break between sorrow,  
Like peace was the break between wars,  
I'm still partly new now, but mostly older,  
And I can not say I'm so sure.  
Chorus  
I never trusted happiness, as far as I could throw it,  
Always preparing for the worst, 'cause I would know it,  
All of that hammering in the dark, like a new noah working on his ark,  
On his ark.  
I may look back at today and feel foolish,  
My old view was right all along,  
I will rush in, where no angels are walking,  
And fight for the right to be wrong.  
Chorus  
'cause I never trusted happiness, as far as I could throw it,  
Always preparing for the worst, 'cause I would know it,  
Of that hammering in the dark, like a new noah working on his ark,  
On his ark.  
Between my potential and the deep blue sea,  
There's a rock and a diamond either side of me,  
Between our potential and the break of day,  
There is nothing at all in our way,  
Nothing in our way.
