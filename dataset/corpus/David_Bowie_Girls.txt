Girls, they come and they go  
They kiss, come and they go  
Like breeze brushing my cheek  
Like pain, like the tears on my face  
  
Girls, they come and they go  
Like spirits, they vanish at dawn  
My heart suspended in time  
Like you vanish like tears in the rain  
  
Girls, they take their loves away  
Like spirits living so far away  
  
Girls, pretending to break down and cry  
Girls, whispering wind  
What are they giving away  
  
We used to be so happy  
Remember, remember so happy  
I never knew how lonely  
How lonely, how lonely I could feel  
  
Girls, they come and they go  
They kiss, they come and they go  
Like spirits brushing my cheek  
Like pain, like the tears on my face  
  
Girls, they take their loves away  
Like spirits, living so far away  
  
Girls, pretending to break down and cry  
Girls, whispering wind  
What are they giving away  
  
We used to be so happy  
Remember, remember so happy  
I never knew how lonely  
How lonely, how lonely I could feel  
  
Girls
