Walkin' down the streets  
You look into a dump  
You look into a dump and you say  
Why, why, why, why, why, why  
Running down the highway  
As fast as you can  
You throw a tin can and you say  
Why, why, why, why, why, why  
Tell me why tell me why  
Tell me why do you destroy  
And you try and you try  
To destroy  
I'm knocking on your door  
My knees are on the floor  
I get you on the phone and you say no  
Why why why why why why  
Tell me why...  
Walkin' down the streets  
You look into a dump  
You look into a dump and you say  
Why, why,why, why, why, why  
Medieval warrior riding on his horse  
Slices your head and you say why  
Why why why why why why  
Medieval warrior riding on his horse  
Promised you heaven  
But put you through hell  
Why why why why why why  
Tell me why...
