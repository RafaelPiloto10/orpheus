When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And makin' love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
  
Livin' alone  
I think of all the friends I've known  
But when I dial the telephone  
Nobody's home  
  
All by myself  
Don't want to be, all by myself anymore  
All by myself  
Don't want to live, all by myself anymore  
  
Hard to be sure  
Some times I feel so insecure  
And love so distant and obscure  
Remains the cure
