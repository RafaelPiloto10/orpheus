Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl  
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina music would play and Feleena would
whirl  
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena wicked and evil while casting a
spell  
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love but in vain I could
tell  
  
One night a wild young cowboy came in wild as the west Texas wind  
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing with wicked Feleena the girl that I
loved  
So in danger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden  
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore  
  
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat  
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  
Just for a moment I stood there in silence shocked by the foul deed I had done  
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there  
  
I had but one chance and that was to run  
Out to the backdoor of Rosa's I ran out where the horses were tied  
I caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away I did
ride  
Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso  
  
Out to the badlands of New Mexico  
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless everything's gone in life nothing
is left  
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden  
My love is stronger than my fear of death  
  
I saddled up and away I did go riding alone in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow a bullet would find me  
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart  
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's Cantina
below  
  
My love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to Feleena I go  
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more  
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me  
I have to make it to Rosa's backdoor  
  
Something is dreadfuly wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side  
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary unable to ride  
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen  
Though I am weary I can's stop to rest  
  
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my
chest  
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me kissing my cheeks as she kneels by my
side  
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for one little kiss then Feleena
goodbye
