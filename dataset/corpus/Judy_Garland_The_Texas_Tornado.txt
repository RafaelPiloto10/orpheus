We're going east, our work has ceased  
We're all set for Yale to say the least  
We're out to win, so lets begin now  
We're from the west, we'll never rest  
Till we show our world our team's the best  
We'll sweep the land, we'll show 'em and how  
The Texas tornado is coming your way so everybody step aside  
The Texas tornado is funny that way, so everybody better hide  
This devastatin' gale is headed straight for Yale  
Won't it be great to sail into town?  
We'll devour the foe, we'll knock 'em for a goal  
And then we'll score a touchdown  
There's no one in Texas who really suspects us  
Coming home without that game  
The whole state of Texas sincerely expects us  
Getting in the hall of fame  
Yale's pigskin sack is the crackerjack  
But we'll bring it home without fail  
The Texas tornado is coming your way  
So everybody step aside, better hide, Yale!
