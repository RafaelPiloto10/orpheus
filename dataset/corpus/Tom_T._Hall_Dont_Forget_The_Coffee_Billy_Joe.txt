It snowed the night before and it had frozen on the ground  
We didn't have a car and we lived seven miles from town  
And I can hear my daddy's voice, so many years ago  
Saying  
"Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Mama needs her medicine, she's got that real bad cough  
We'll get our check on Monday, tell ol' Sam we'll pay him off  
You can catch a ride when you get to the black-top road  
Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe"  
Me and Quentin went back on the hill and we cut some wood  
Burnin' in that ol' warm mornin' stove it sure smelled good  
Daddy couldn't get work then and I was just a child  
And God was on vacation for awhile  
"Well, if you see Fred you tell him I'll come help him kill them hogs  
And ask him if he'd still be interested in my dogs  
Don't hang around that pool room all day, we might get more snow  
And don't forget the coffee Billy Joe"  
Well, they wonder why there ain't no rabbits left this day and time  
To tell the truth I guess we ate 'em all in '49  
Was that yesterday or was it over 20 years ago  
"Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe"  
"Mama needs her medicine, she's got that real bad cough  
We'll get our check on Monday tell ol' Sam we'll pay him off  
You can catch a ride when you get to the black-top road  
Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Now pay attention, son  
Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe"
