Well I've been sittin' here, thinkin' about you  
'Bout what it is that you, you want from me  
You know it seems that I still don't know you well  
Know many faces I have seen  
  
Still I try, to make you happy  
Still I try, to make you sing  
Now if you're wonderin', what I think of it all  
Just read the back of this postcard  
  
The air here, breathing's great  
Lord, we've cooked ourselves  
Now were cookin' up an ass kickin' time (didn't we?)  
  
This town is nuts, my kind of place  
I don't want to leave  
I don't never, never, never, never want to leave.  
I never, never, never, never want to leave  
Never, never  
  
I see you in a  
Thousand costumes  
Strike many a silent pose  
I heard you tell a thousand stories  
Everyone in a different voice  
  
Still I try, to make you happy  
Still I try, to make you sing  
Now if you're wonderin', what I think of it all  
Just read the back of this postcard  
  
The air here, breathing's great  
Lord, we've cooked ourselves  
Now were cookin' up an ass kickin' time (didn't we?)  
  
This town is nuts, my kind of place  
I don't want to leave  
I don't never, never, never, never want to leave.  
I never, never, never, never want to leave  
Never, never  
  
I'm taking my car - I never want to leave  
I'm taking my car..
