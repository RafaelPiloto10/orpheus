Let us pause in life's pleasures and count it's many tears  
While we all sup sorrow with the poor  
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's the song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more.  
  
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay  
There are frail forms fainting at the door  
Though their voices now are silent, their pleading look still say  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's a song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more.  
  
There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away  
With a warm heart, whose better days are o'er  
Though her voice should be merry, It's sighing all the day  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's a song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's a side that has wafted across the trouble way  
It's a whale that is heard upon the shore  
It's a dirt that is merriment around the lonely grain  
Oh hard times, come again no more  
  
It's a song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more  
Oh hard times, come again no more!
