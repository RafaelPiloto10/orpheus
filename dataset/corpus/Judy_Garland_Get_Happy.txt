[Chorus]  
Forget your troubles  
Come on get happy  
You better chase all you cares away  
Shout hallelujah  
Come on get happy  
Get ready for the judgment day  
  
The sun is shining  
Come on get happy  
The lord is waiting to take your hand  
Shout hallelujah  
Come on get happy  
We're going to the promised land  
  
We're heading across the river  
Wash your sins away in the tide  
It's all so peaceful on the other side  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The sun is shining  
Come on get happy  
The lord is waiting to take your hand  
Shout hallelujah  
Come on get happy  
We're going to the promised land  
  
We're heading across the river  
Wash your sins away in the tide  
It's quiet and peaceful on the other side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on get happy  
Chase your cares away  
Shout hallelujah  
Come on get happy  
Get ready for the judgment day  
  
The sun is shining  
Come on get happy  
The lord is waiting to take your hand  
Hallelujah  
Come on get happy  
We're going to the promised land  
  
We're heading across the river  
Wash your sins away in the tide  
It's all so peaceful on the other side  
  
Shout hallelujah  
Come on get happy  
You better chase all your cares away  
Shout hallelujah  
Come on get happy  
Get ready  
  
Get ready-acap
