Free like we want to be  
Some time you want to get off  
Leave the work and take off  
But the boss man say you gonna lose you pay  
No chain on your feet now  
9 to 5 got you beat now  
You working hard to save  
Inflation like a tidal wave  
  
Are we free like we want to be  
Tell me are we free like we want to be  
Are we free like we want to be  
Tell me are we free like we want to be  
  
Racist get defeat  
Black Man vote and take you seat  
Now them think we gonna quiet  
Maybe we start a riot  
Whan happen to the diamond they stole  
The innocent blood run cold  
Do we still have to live in poverty  
Now they say we're free to be poor  
But are we free like we want to be  
Black Man are we free like we want to be  
  
Tell me are we free like want to be  
Are you free are you free  
Kept in emotion  
Will cause an explosion  
Let your love go  
Let me know  
Some people expect  
That's not what them get  
Become no slave  
Of them evil and wicked ways  
  
Are we free like we want to be  
Are we free like we want to be  
Are you free like you want to be  
Are we free like we want to be  
  
Can't walk the streets late at night  
Without fear of parasite  
Everyone has a inborn right  
A inborn right to live  
Who gave us the reason to fight  
By promoting negative vibes  
Who taught us of drugs and crime  
Now they say we're free to homicide  
Committing geoncide  
We freely homicide committing genocide  
  
Man we free like we want to be  
Black Man we free like we want to be  
Tell me we free like we want to be  
Are you free like you want to be  
We want to be free  
Free like we want to be
