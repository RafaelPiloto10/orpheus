A is for all I want  
B is for battling  
C is for can't you stay longer  
'Cause I want you so maddeningly  
E is for no escape  
'Cause I don't wanna leave you  
F is for falling too fast  
With no parachute, oh  
  
And who's gonna save me, now, oh...  
  
Chorus:  
You've taken me under  
You've stolen my thunder  
And I think I'm all out of fire  
Want you to win  
All that I ever was  
Is burning in this lust  
Your love is a weapon  
And it's turning me to dust  
D is for dangerous (2x)  
  
G for get out of here  
It's really too much  
H is for how do I leave  
When I'm addicted to your love  
I is for insane  
It smells like danger  
J is for jump off the ship  
Or the storm will take you  
  
And who's gonna save me, now, oh...  
  
Chorus:  
You've taken me under  
You've stolen my thunder  
And I think I'm all out of fire  
Want you to win  
All that I ever was  
Is burning in this lust  
Your love is a weapon  
And it's turning me to dust  
D is for dangerous (4x)  
  
K is for killing me  
L is for I can't leave  
Oh, 'cause I'll never make it  
If I'm not living on the edge  
And for the rest  
Let's just forget  
'Cause I never want out of this...  
  
Repeat Chorus
