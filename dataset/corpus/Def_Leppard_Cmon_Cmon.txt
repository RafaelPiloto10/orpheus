Everybody, everyone c'mon c'mon  
C'mon c'mon  
  
Baby, baby won't you give me a good time?  
Squeeze me, please me, make it feel like the last time  
Hold me close and I'll make every dream come true  
Just let the man in me meet the woman in you  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose  
Get back the spark and light the fuse  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Everybody, everywhere  
  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Give a little, take a little  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Give it all ya' gotta give  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Let me hear it everyone, c'mon, c'mon  
C'mon, c'mon  
  
Baby, baby take the ride of a lifetime  
Thrill me, kill me, won't you send me a lifeline?  
Ready, steady go wherever you want to  
I'll bet the 7 wonders ain't got nothin' on you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
C'mon, c'mon  
C'mon, c'mon  
C'mon, c'mon  
C'mon, c'mon  
  
[Chorus]
