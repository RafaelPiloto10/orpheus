Daughter, daughter, don't do that, don't do that  
But daddy, I said don't do that, alright  
  
Little cat, all alone, somewhere in the midwest  
Where'd you go, who'll you be,  
Maybe you'll turn out to be the best  
Who knows, who knows, come on, yeah yeah  
Cat cat cat cat  
  
Every day, new day, every way, wrong way  
Who'd have seen, who'd have thought  
Nothing but, your tomorrow  
Where and when  
It doesn't matter  
As long as we do it again  
Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat

Gonna take you with me, make you feel all right

Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat

Take it easy, everything will be just fine  
You don't seem to be afraid
