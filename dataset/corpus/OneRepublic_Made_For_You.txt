One and two and three and four and  
One and two and three and four and  
One and two and three and four and  
One and two and three and four  
  
I was writing  
Thinking with my long hand  
Flippin' the paper  
Everything was sinking  
In start to wonder  
How you gonna handle me?  
When I'm under  
Swimming in the dark sea  
  
Everybody wants you to make  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants to take  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants you to make  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants to take it, t-t-t-take it  
  
Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love?  
Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love?  
Like it was made for you!  
Like it was made for you  
Like it was made for you  
It was made for you  
  
Tell me something  
Something that can move me  
Don't tell me lies  
I swear your gonna lose me  
Big like an ocean  
Jealous of the fish it feeds  
Your devotion  
Swimming inside of me  
  
Everybody wants you to make  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants to take  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants you to make  
It's all yours  
Everybody wants to t-t-t-take it  
[Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love?  
Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love?  
  
Like it was made for you!  
Like it was made for you  
Like it was made for you  
It was made for you  
  
Can you feel  
Can you feel?  
Can you feel?  
  
All the right friends in all the right places  
All the right moves and all the right faces  
All the right friends in all the right places  
All the right moves and all the right faces  
[Can you feel all the love]  
All the right friends in all the right places  
[Can you feel all the love]  
All the right moves and all the right faces  
[Can you feel all the love]  
All the right friends in all the right places  
[Can you feel all the love]  
All the right moves and all the right faces
