I believe in you and me  
I believe that we will be  
In love eternally  
As far as I can see  
You will always be  
The one for me  
Oh yes you will  
  
I believe in dreams again  
I believe that love will never end  
And like the river finds the sea  
I was lost now I'm free  
I believe in you and me  
  
I will never leave your side  
I will never hurt your pride  
When all the chips are down  
I will always be around  
Just to be right there where you are my love  
Oh I love you boy  
  
I will never leave you out  
I will always let you in  
To places no one's ever been  
Deep inside can't you see  
I believe in you and me  
  
Maybe I'm a fool  
To feel the way I do  
But I would play the fool forever  
Just to be with you forever  
  
I believe in miracles  
Love's a miracle  
And baby you're a dream come true  
I was lost now I'm free  
I believe in you and me  
I was lost now I'm free girl  
I believe in you and me
