God bless America again you see all the troubles that she's in  
Wash her pretty face dry her eyes and then God bless America again  
  
God I sure to wish you bless America again  
You know like you did way back when it all began  
You blessed her then but we just sorta kinda took it for granted  
And never did ask again  
So just hold her hand God that's all  
And if she should stumble please don't let her fall  
God bless America again...  
  
You know I don't understand every thing I'm readin' here  
About what's wrong with America  
But when you don't have a lotta book learnin'  
I guess there's a lotta things you don't understand  
But let me say this God she's like a mother to me  
And all I am or ever hoped to be I owe to you and to her  
Wash her pretty face dry her eyes and then God bless America again
