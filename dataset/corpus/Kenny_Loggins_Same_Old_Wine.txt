Well we give them the election  
They keep filling our heads full of lies  
Can we trust in new directons  
When their promises are in disquise  
Well someday the truth will catch up  
I just hope it don't catch us all by surprise  
  
They preach this thing, religion  
But we show no faith at all  
Follow suit on Sunday  
But on Monday, forget it all  
If the times should find us needing him  
Then my friends, Lord have mercy on our soul  
  
It's the same old wine  
In a brand new bottle  
It's the same old wine  
In a brand new bottle  
  
Teach our children virture  
Then we send'em off to war  
Then we ask ourselves the question  
What and the hell are we fighting for  
If you should find a reason  
Well don't be afraid to open the door  
Well don't be afraid  
  
Same old wine  
From a brand new bottle  
Same old wine  
From a brand new bottle  
The same old wine  
From a brand new bottle
