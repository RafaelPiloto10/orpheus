Ooooooooh  
When I met you baby  
You put a circle of love around me  
Ooooooooh  
When I met you baby  
You put a circle of love around me  
And I give you my heart  
I was in love right from the start  
(Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii)  
Got my first kiss in the back seat of a car  
I was hot, I was really rarin' to go  
Got my first kiss in the back seat of a car  
At the drive-in, the drive-in movie show  
And I gave her my heart  
I was in love right from the start  
(Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii)  
Ooooooooh  
When I met you baby  
You put a circle of love around me  
Ooooooooh  
When I met you baby  
You put a circle of love around me  
And I give you my heart  
I was in love right from the start  
(Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii)
