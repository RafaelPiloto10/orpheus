Uh, uh, uh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ha, ha  
I beep my horn and they come to the car  
Damn right, they come to a stall  
That's right, it come with the car  
Now tell your boss, you can't come in tomorrow  
My dro come by the jar  
They bring me drinks, why come by the bar?  
Nah, nigga I ain't come here to spar  
These hallow tips will come where you are  
I stomp through smooth with the soldiers  
Two steppin', movin' my shoulders  
Now the money's rollin' in  
We got bottles lined up like bowlin' pins  
Mami, you standin' with a slouch  
Starin' at me while I'm standin on the couch  
Come and get in the blue flames  
Have a sip of this blue shit and let's rock  
Now you know I don't usually do this  
But you lookin' good tonight  
And you know I don't usually do this  
But you gon' smoke tonight  
And you know I don't usually do this  
But you gon' drink tonight  
And you know I don't usually do this  
But you gon' fuck tonight  
Now who's hot? Who's not?  
I can take the few shots you've got  
I can burn a few knots you've got  
I can blow the few spots you've got  
But I chill, I will  
Get it to poppin' whenever I feel  
I still shut it down  
And I white and yellow stud it down  
Watch them pretty girls strut it 'round  
Take the birdies and putt it down  
Like Tiger Woods did it but I'm hood with it  
You've never seen a thug look as good with it  
And I promise that, fuck with me  
You better move where Osama's at  
You see I'm in here with the white ones on  
Tryin' to get fucked up 'for the lights come on, let's go  
Now you know I don't usually do this  
But you lookin' good tonight  
And you know I don't usually do this  
But you gon' smoke tonight  
And you know I don't usually do this  
But you gon' drink tonight  
And you know I don't usually do this  
But you gon' fuck tonight
