I've got no time for fairy stories  
I'm not a little girl  
So you can leave me all alone  
And turn off the lights as well  
If you were frightened  
Then listen:  
But I don't think you'd like it  
Such a nice kid  
  
Nobody's lookin' now  
I throw my toys around  
  
Somebody's bein' very bad  
I wonder who it can be  
Somebody's goin' to get in trouble  
I know it isn't me  
  
I'm just a little angel  
But you don't know what I've done  
When your back's turned  
Nobody's lookin' now  
I throw my toys around  
  
Pick up those building blocks  
Chop off the baby's locks  
Swing dolly by the hair  
Put down that teddy bear  
Slam dunk that happy clown  
I throw my toys around  
  
I've got no time for bedtime stories  
I'm not a little child  
Everything makes me furious  
And everything makes me wild  
  
If you were frightened  
Then whistle:  
And they'll come runnin' to you  
As you boo-hoo  
  
Nobody's looking now  
I throw my toys around  
I throw my toys around  
[repeat and fade]
