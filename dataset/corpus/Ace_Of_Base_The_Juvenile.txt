The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold  
The juvenile has the key to the end  
The juvenile in the end, that is why we are here  
The world will take us to the end  
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend  
  
Why don't we do it, like we used to do it all so long ago?  
They kept together till the bitter end (all the young)  
Today we don't care, even 'bout the youth above the old  
They cannot rise their voice yet  
But later they will do  
  
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold  
The juvenile has the key to the end (always believe in)  
The juvenile in the end, that is why we are here  
The world will take us to the end  
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend  
  
No education, we don't need no education telling us  
The right to choose, if we have no choice (no, no, no)  
It's so explosive, any day will burst into a fire  
All come down and guide us  
Before it is too late  
  
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold  
The juvenile has the key to the end (always believe in)  
The juvenile in the end, that is why we are here  
The world will take us to the end  
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend  
Whoa who  
  
Always and always and always believe in  
Always believe in  
  
The juvenile in a time where the night is so cold  
The juvenile has the key to the end (always believe in)  
The juvenile in the end, that is why we are here  
The world will take us to the end  
Tomorrow's foe is now a friend
