When I see you on the street, I lose my concentration.  
Just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation.  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought
to know.  
Well I've been thinkin' about you day and night  
And I don't know if it'll work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might, if we try.  
  
Faces come and faces go in circular rotation.  
But something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation.  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know.  
Well you've got me standin' deaf and blind  
Cause I see love as just a state of mind  
And who knows what it is that we might find, if we try.  
  
You're walking a different direction from most people I've met.  
You're givin' me signs of affection I don't usually get.  
I don't want you to pledge your future the future's not yours to give.  
Just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you live.  
  
'Cause when I see you on the street, I lose my concentration.  
And just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation.  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know.  
Well I've been thinking about you day and night  
And I don't know if it will work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might, if we try.  
Somehow I think that it just might if we try.  
Yes somehow I think that it just might if we try.
