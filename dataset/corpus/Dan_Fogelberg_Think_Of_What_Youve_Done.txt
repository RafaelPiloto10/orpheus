(Chorus)  
Is it true that I've lost you?  
Am I not the only one?  
After all this pain and sorrow,  
Darlin', think of what you've done.  
  
Heart to heart, dear, how I need you  
Like the flowers need the dew.  
Lovin' you has been my life, love  
Lord, I can't believe we're through.  
  
(Chorus)  
Well, I've go back to Colorado,  
Where the mountains meet the sky.  
It was here I learned to love you  
And I'll stay here till I die.  
  
(Chorus) Twice
