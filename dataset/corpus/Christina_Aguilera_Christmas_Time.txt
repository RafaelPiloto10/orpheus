Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la  
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la  
  
When I was young every Christmas Eve  
I could not sleep  
Trying to catch that old St. Nick  
Leaving presents under my tree  
And every year I'd fall asleep laying in my bed  
Dreaming of a million sugarplums  
Dancing in my head  
  
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time  
The spirit of giving is in our lives  
Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the ones you love  
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because  
  
There'll be family and Christmas cheer (oh ooh)  
Peace and goodwill to all men (ooh)  
Everybody is home for Christmas  
Everybody is home (everybody is home)  
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe  
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (let it snow)  
Everybody is home for Christmas (oooh)  
Everybody is home for Christmastime  
  
Friends come together as we decorate the tree  
This is the time of year to live in harmony  
Angels watch over as we put the kids to sleep  
And when they awake their smiling faces  
Make it all complete, oh  
  
This is the holiday you're with the family  
We put aside our differences and let it be  
Oh, oh how much fun it is to give and to receive  
This time of year, love is all we need, ohh  
  
There'll be family (family) and Christmas cheer (oh)  
Peace and goodwill to all men  
Everybody is home for Christmas  
Everybody is home (everybody is home)  
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe  
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (oh yeah)  
Everybody is home for Christmas  
Everybody is home it's Christmastime  
  
It's Christmas time  
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la  
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la  
  
Open your heart now  
This is the time for us to give  
The world needs love now  
So live and let live, families all here  
The spirit is good cheer, the sound of carolers  
Ringing sweet in my ear, everything is all fine  
You know why, it's Christmastime, what  
  
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time  
The spirit of giving is in our lives  
Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the ones you love  
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because  
  
There'll be family (family) and Christmas cheer (oh)  
Peace and goodwill to all men  
Everybody is home for Christmas (ohh)  
Everybody is home (everybody is home)  
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe (mistletoe)  
I want a white Christmas so let it snow  
Everybody is home for Christmas  
Everybody is home it's Christmastime  
It's Christmastime  
It's Christmastime  
It's Christmastime, oh yeah  
  
Everybody is home for Christmas (ohh)  
Everybody is home (everybody is home)  
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe (let it snow)  
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (let it snow)  
Everybody is home for Christmas  
Everybody is home it's Christmastime  
  
You need family, gifts under the tree  
Everybody is home for Christmas (home for Christmas)  
Everybody is home  
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe  
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (ohh ooh oh)  
Everybody is home for Christmas  
Everybody is home it's Christmastime
