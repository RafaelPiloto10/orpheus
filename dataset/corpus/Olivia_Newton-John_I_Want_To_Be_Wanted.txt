Alone, so alone, that I could cry  
I want to be wanted  
Alone, watching lovers passing by  
I want to be wanted  
  
When I'm kissed, I want his lips to really kiss me  
When we're apart, I want his heart to really miss me  
I want to know he loves me so  
His eyes are misty  
That's the way I want to be loved  
  
Alone, just my lonely heart knows how  
I want to be wanted  
Right now, not tomorrow, but right now  
I want to be wanted  
  
I want someone to share my laughter and my tears with  
Someone I know I'd love to spend a million years with  
When is this someone somewhere meant for me  
  
I want to want someone to share my laughter and my tears with  
Someone I know I'd love to spend a million years with  
When is this someone somewhere meant for me  
Oh, meant for me, ooh, meant for me
