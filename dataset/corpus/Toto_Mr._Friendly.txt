Get out I won't even listen  
I can't hear a single word you say  
Enough of your intimidation  
Don't tell me 'bout the price I pay  
Take off don't want your kind of trouble  
Don't want to see you hangin' 'round my place  
It's late and here's the situation  
I never want to see your face  
  
You just drag me down  
And I've got the scars to show  
I think you oughta know  
  
[Chorus]  
You got the best of me  
Mister Friendly  
You got the best of me  
  
Don't ask can't promise any favors  
Don't want to owe you in anything again  
Bad luck it's your occupation  
Can't you see you are your own worst friend  
I'm gone the masquerade is over  
I'm cashin' in the silver tray  
So long I can't buy this evil game you play  
  
You just drag me down  
And I've got the scars to show  
I think you oughta know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's standing in your way  
You smile like it's okay  
Knowing you'll show him somehow  
You're running out of time  
Too late to change your mind  
No one can save you now  
  
[Chorus]
