City life just leaves me weak  
All this madness on the street  
Need to get away today  
Live my life a different way  
  
Is it only a fantasy  
To dream about a perfect me?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I want to live like beautiful people  
Give like beautiful people  
With like beautiful people around  
  
Buy the latest magazine  
And aspire to the dream  
Perfect home and perfect kids  
Not a life lived on the skids  
  
Is it only fantasy  
Or could it be reality?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Now I can see myself  
Without a care in the world  
It's a sun shining  
Money spending  
Green and healthy new world  
  
Is it only fantasy  
Or could it be reality?  
  
[Chorus: x2]
