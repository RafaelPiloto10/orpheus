Jah Live - Bob Marley  
Jah live! children yeah!  
Jah-Jah live! children yeah  
Jah live! children yeah!

The truth is an offense but not a sin!  
Is he who laugh last, children!  
Is he who win  
Is a foolish dog bark at a flying bird!  
One sheep must learn, children!  
To respect the sheperd!  
  
Jah live! children yeah!

Fools sayin' in their heart  
Rasta your God is dead  
But I and I know Jah! Jah!  
Dreaded it shall be dreaded and dread  
  
Jah live! children yeah!  
Jah-Jah live! children yeah!  
Jah live! children yeah  
Jah-Jah live! children yeah  
  
Let Jah a-rise!  
Now that the enemies are scattered  
Let Jah a-rise!  
The enemies, the enemies are scattered  
  
Jah live! children yeah!  
Jah-Jah live! children yeah  
Jah live! children yeah  
Jah-Jah live!
