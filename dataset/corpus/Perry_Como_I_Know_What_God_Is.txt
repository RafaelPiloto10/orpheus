I have heard the wild bird's sing  
So I know what "freedom" is  
I have looked into the eyes of a child  
So I know what "faith" is  
I have seen a rainbow  
So I know what "beauty" is  
I have planted a tree  
So I know what "hope" is  
I have held a helping hand  
So I know what "kindness" is  
I have seen a blossom burst into bloom  
So I know what "glory" is  
I have lost a friend  
So I know what "sorrow" is  
I have knelt down in prayer  
So I know what "peace" is  
I have seen a mother at her crib  
So I'm sure of the meaning of "love"  
I have seen and I have felt these things  
And now I know what "God" is!
