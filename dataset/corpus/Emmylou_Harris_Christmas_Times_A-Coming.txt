Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
And I know I'm goin' home  
Snowflakes a fallin'  
My old home's a callin'  
Tall pines a hummin'  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Can't you hear them bells ringin'  
Bringin' joy to all, hear them singin'  
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'  
Back to my country home  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
And I know I'm goin' home  
Holly's in the window  
Home's where the wind blows  
Can't walk for runnin'  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Can't you hear them bells ringin'  
Bringin' joy to all, hear them singin'  
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'  
Back to my country home  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
And I know I'm goin' home  
White candles burnin'  
My old heart's a-yearnin'  
For the folks at home when  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Can't you hear them bells ringin'  
Bringin' joy to all, hear them singin'  
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'  
Back to my country home  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
And I know I'm goin' home
