I knew you before about five years ago  
Then you seemed to be like a person  
Who didn't act like the people I knew  
Yes something was special about you  
A bit insecure but still kind of cute  
At the same time easy to talk to  
And now I see you again  
And you're looking so good  
  
Voulez-vous danser avec moi  
Voulez-vous danser avec moi ce soir  
  
I look in the mirror and what do I see  
You're the same kind of person you're like me  
And I can't run away I'm so attracted by you  
  
Voulez-vous danser avec moi  
Voulez-vous danser avec moi ce soir  
  
No more hesitation  
You're what I've been searching for  
So stay close to me  
I want to give you a better life  
  
L'amour eternel  
L'amour eternel  
Voulez-vous danser
