Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles  
She likes to wander and that's why I'm under  
The spell of her jingle jangle  
  
We used to cry on each others shoulder  
Now that I'm older, she wanders ahead  
Now that she's found love, I still hear the sound of  
Silvery bangles, remain in my head  
  
Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles  
She used to wander and that's why I'm under  
The spell of her jingle jangle
