It's four am and you're just getting in.  
Your first night out- I won't ask where you've been.  
You're so ashamed and your eyes can't meet mine.  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.  
  
Chorus:  
What makes us do the things we do heaven only knows.  
We think we've got a secret, but it always shows.  
I taught you how to cheat, you're doing fine.  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.  
  
But I still love you and so I pretend  
And hope I never see that look again.  
But if I do I know the fault is mine.  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.  
  
Repeat chorus:  
  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.
