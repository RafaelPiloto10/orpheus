In a matter of a moment  
Lost till the end of time  
It's the evening of another day  
And the end of mine  
  
Now the starlight which has found me  
Lost for a million years  
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes  
'Till it disappears  
  
Could it be that somebody else is  
Looking into my mind  
  
Some other place  
Somewhere  
Some other time  
  
Some other place  
Somewhere  
Some other time  
  
Like a mirror held before me  
Large as the sky is wide  
And the image is reflected  
Back to the other side  
  
Could it be that somebody else is  
Looking into my mind  
  
Some other place  
Somewhere  
Some other time  
  
Some other place  
Somewhere  
Some other time
