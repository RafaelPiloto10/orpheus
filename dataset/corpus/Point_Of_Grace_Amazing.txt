Consider your needs of the past  
When somebody helped but you never asked  
Now think of the joy you received  
When you reached out to someone else in need  
'Cause some days we laugh  
Some days we cry  
Some days we hold it deep inside  
Though each day is a gift from on high  
But what I find amazing  
The love we give, the love we gain  
Amazing  
There's so much more that's in Jesus name  
Amazing  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
That it's more blessed to give than receive  
Learning from different mistakes  
Learning to give instead of just take  
But when we all start to blend  
We'll be like colors surrounding the sun as it sets  
'Cause some days we laugh  
Some days we cry  
Some days we hold it deep inside  
Though each day is a gift from on high  
But what I find amazing  
The love we give, the love we gain  
Amazing  
There's so much more that's in Jesus name  
Amazing  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
That it's more blessed to give than receive  
'Cause some days we laugh  
Some days we cry  
Some days we hold it deep inside  
Though each day is a gift from on high  
But what I find amazing  
The love we give, the love we gain  
Amazing  
There's so much more that's in Jesus name  
Amazing  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
That it's more blessed to give than receive  
Amazing, amazing  
Amazing  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
That it's more blessed to give than receive  
Consider your needs of the past  
When somebody helped but you never asked
