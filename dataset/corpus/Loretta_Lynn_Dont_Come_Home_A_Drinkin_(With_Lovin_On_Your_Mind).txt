Well you thought I'd be waitin' up when you came home last night  
You'd been out with all the boys and you ended up half tight  
But liquor and love they just don't mix leave the bottle or me behind  
And don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind  
  
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind  
Just stay out there on the town and see what you can find  
Cause if you want that kind of love well you don't need none of mine  
So don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind  
[ steel - guitar ]  
You never take me anywhere because you're always gone  
And many a night I've laid awake and cried here all alone  
Then you come in a kissin' on me it happens every time  
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind  
  
No don't come home a drinkin'...  
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
