Did You rise the sun for me?  
Or paint a million stars that I might  
Know your majesty?  
Is Your voice upon the wind?  
Is everything I've known marked?  
With my maker's fingerprints?  
  
Breathe on me  
Let me see Your face  
Ever I will seek You  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause all You are, is all I want, always  
Draw me close in Your arms  
Oh God, I want to be with You  
  
Can I feel You in the rain?  
Abandon all I am to have You  
Capture me again  
Let the earth resound with praise  
Can You hear as all creation lives  
To glorify one name?
