A step in the right direction, a stitch in time saves nine  
To me you are perfection, and the love you saved was mine.  
When I think of all the girls that I've ever kissed  
And the ones that I'd wished I could know,  
It's a real short list with just one name, you're one in a row.  
  
You're a class by yourself  
You're the state of the art  
You're alone on the shelf  
You're the top of the chart  
You're the singular case  
You're the queen of the place  
You're the star of the show  
You're one in a row  
  
There's one chance in a million, there's one sun up in the sky.  
I'm glad you were willin', and here's the reason why.  
When I think of all the girls that I've ever kissed  
And the ones that I'd wished I could know,  
It's a real short list with just one name, you're one in a row.  
  
You're the unrivaled champ  
You're the boss of the camp  
You're the mavin of charm  
You're a shot in the arm  
You're alone in the bunch  
You're a dark horse hunch  
You're a heavy-weight blow  
You're one in a row
