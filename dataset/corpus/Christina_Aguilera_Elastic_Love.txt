A rubber band is what I call your love for me  
'Cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline  
But all this back and forth is freaky, it's confusing me  
Like a pencil trying to write and you're erasing me  
  
If I was a ruler I'd set you straight  
But your love is like a sharpener, it really grates  
'Cause once I'm trying to bounce, you pull me back  
And when I try to come to you, you give me slack  
  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
A rubber band was an analogy  
You can even say it's a metaphor  
The tension between you and me  
I ain't gonna feel it if you let it go  
  
I can take a little bit and make it more  
A little bit of hate can make it war  
But a lot of love ain't enough  
And so, I don't really know how we find the cure  
  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
  
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together  
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together  
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together  
  
If we were gaffer tape maybe we could spend the summer  
You could say your piece, you could post it on a paper  
When your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler  
  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love
