Mindless drifter on the road  
Carry such an easy load  
It's how you look,  
And how you feel  
You must have  
A heart of steel.  
  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
  
I can see you on a hill  
Comatose but walking still  
Curves beneath  
Your flowing gown  
Only I could  
Bring you down.  
  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
  
Dogs that lick  
And dogs that bite  
Hounds that howl  
Through the night  
Broken leashes  
Are all over the floor  
Keys left hanging  
In a swinging door.  
  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
  
Keep fuckin' up!
