Don't turn your head  
Back to the wall  
Don't close your eyes  
And wait for your fall  
  
If you believe that you know in this time  
You've got anything to win  
If you believe that you know  
Then I say, "You'll lose all again"  
  
In this time there's nothing to get for you  
You cannot really do what you want  
You're a child, a prisoner in your mind  
You are a victim of this hopeless time  
  
You better believe all you do has a sense  
It's not for nothing  
You better believe all the troubles you have  
Will play you someday  
  
Why don't you help yourself and do the best  
Put all the bombs back up their builders' ass  
Why don't you stand up to say who you are  
To show the people that paradise is not far  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, can't you see we got the right  
To look into the future without no need to hide  
No, we won't accept what you do  
We stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse  
Oh, can't you see we got the right  
To say we are here to see the light  
No, we don't want to lose all again  
Stand up, you people, to save the world  
As good as you can  
  
We are credulous idiots  
And won't understand what they plan  
We march with the times  
It's what they expect and we do  
  
Why don't you open your eyes  
To undercover all of these lies  
I think you won't accept this  
Go oppose with your fist  
Fight for your rights  
  
[Chorus]
