I got a girl in sault ste. marie  
Takes a bus every weekend just to come across the miles to me  
Leaves her room in the shadow of the bridge  
To spend two days life blind in my dirty bed  
Doesn't asks questions, never talks down  
About the things I do when she isn't around  
  
Yeah I just about live in the bars around town  
I lose myself in the voice of the crowd  
Each and every day I need static  
I don't wanna go home alone  
  
I know a girl just outside of lacrosse  
She meets me in milwaukee when the weather gets humid and hot  
She leaves her husband and retarded baby girl  
Just to walk for a while unencumbered in an easier world  
No questions, never asks why  
I walk the floor in the middle of the night and stare  
Out the window of an ugly motel  
At the neon signs outside  
Think about the hell I sell  
To make my static  
I don't wanna go home, I don't wanna go home  
I don't wanna go home alone...

About the life I lead when she isn't around  
Yeah, I just about live in the bars around town  
Lose myself in the voice of the crowd  
Walk around stupid and blind and proud  
Each and every day I need static  
I don't wanna go home alone...  
I don't wanna go home
