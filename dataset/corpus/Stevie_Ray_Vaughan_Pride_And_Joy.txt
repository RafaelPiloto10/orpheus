Well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind  
My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine  
She's my sweet little thang she's my pride and joy  
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy  
  
Yeah I love my baby heart and soul  
Love like ours won't never grow old  
She's my sweet little thang she's my pride and joy  
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy  
  
Yeah I love my lady she's long and lean  
You mess with her you'll see a man get mean  
She's my sweet little thang she's my pride and joy  
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy  
  
Well I love my baby like the finest wine  
Stick with her until the end of time  
She's my sweet little thang she's my pride and joy  
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy  
  
Yeah I love my baby heart and soul  
Love like ours won't never grow old  
She's my sweet little thang she's my pride and joy  
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy
