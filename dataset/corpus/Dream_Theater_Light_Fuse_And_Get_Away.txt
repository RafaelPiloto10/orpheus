Would you like to sit and talk to me  
About the way things change so  
Suddenly  
When your senses come and the feeling  
Goes?  
Can you remember feeling much  
Too close?  
  
Stop your hands from shaking.  
Look at me.  
Are your senses racing endlessly  
Tracing  
Past impressions? So were mine.  
Have you ever been used  
Or will this be the first time?  
  
It's come so clear to me  
Light fuse and get away  
No gain, no pain  
It's a fatal game  
And the true lose everything  
  
I can see  
What trust and loyalty have done  
For me  
Falling miles from the mark  
With a thirst for revenge  
And a dangerous heart  
  
I've tried to wash from memory  
Feelings of betrayal and the incidents  
That plague me since I lost my sense  
Of innocence  
  
A history of changes now I'm loving  
Now I'm losing keeps me constantly  
In fear of hearing "I can't see where  
This is going"  
  
You lie alone with the memory  
Feeling the ceiling and walls closing  
In on  
Your Conscience - my ally  
The guilt - your affliction  
From preying on praise as you fed  
An attention addiction  
  
Someone told me  
Light fuse and get away  
No gain, no pain  
And when it's lust to dust you can  
Crawl from the wreckage  
  
I can see  
What trust and loyalty have done  
For me  
Lying bleeding in the dark  
With a thirst for revenge  
And a dangerous heart  
  
It's come so clear to me  
Light fuse and get away  
No gain, no pain  
It's a fatal game  
And the true lose everything  
  
I can see  
What trust and loyalty have done  
For me  
Falling miles from the mark  
With a thirst for revenge  
And a dangerous heart
