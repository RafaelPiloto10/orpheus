I'm awake in the afternoon, I fell asleep in the living room  
It's one of those moments when everything is so clear  
before the truth goes back into hidding  
I wanna decide cause it's worth deciding  
to work on finding something more than fear  
It takes so much out of me to pretend  
tell me now tell me how  
Make amens  
  
Maybe, I need to see the daylight  
live beyond the half life  
don't you see I'm breaking down  
O, lately.... Something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
is there really no escape, no escape from time  
of any kind  
  
I keep trying to understand  
this thing and that thing my felo man  
I guess i'll let you know when I figure it out  
I don't mind a few mysteries they can stay that away  
It's fine by me but you are another mystery I am missing  
It takes too much out of me to pretend  
  
Maybe I need to see the day light  
live beyond the half life  
don't you see I'm breaking down  
O, lately... Something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
Is there really no escape, no escape from time  
or any kind  
  
C'mon lets fall in love  
well c'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets.... Fall in love.... Again  
  
Cause lately, something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
without you I get breaking down  
O, wake me  
I wanna see the day light  
save me from this half life  
let you and I escape  
escape from time  
  
C'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets fall in love....... Again
