Here's a little story I gotta tell  
'Bout this boy I know so well  
Back in the day was cool and all  
He fell in love, I fell in love  
I thought he was the one for me  
Other boys I could not see  
And look what happened to our love  
I'm like how could it be  
  
It shoulda been me and you  
It coulda been you and me  
But boy you broke my heart  
And now I'm standing there  
It shoulda been me and you  
It coulda been you and me  
  
Now all I got are these photographs  
All I've got  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Are these photographs  
All I've got  
All I've got  
  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you  
  
Now baby its killing me  
I'm saying its killing me  
The fact that you ain't around  
Baby, I'm falling down  
I need me a remedy  
Been looking for remedies  
I need you to be around  
Baby I'm hurting now  
I know you're a better man (when I was your girl)  
This land is a better land (when you're in my world)  
  
Today will be better, babe  
If it were like yesterday, so happy and lovely  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
All I've got  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Are these photographs  
All I've got  
All I've got  
  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you  
  
All I've got are these photographs  
I remember when I used to make you laugh  
I don't wanna be stuck in the past  
But you're all that I have that I had  
And I don't wanna lose what we've felt this far  
This is me and you, you're my superstar  
I'll give anything baby, here's my heart  
My heart, my heart  
  
My heart don't stop  
My heart be beating over  
My loving never stops  
Even though that it's over  
Girl I been reminiscing  
With that way that Casanova  
Way back when we was kissing on your grand momma's sofa  
Girl I got us lovey dubby on my photo album  
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein  
You had your Guess jeans on  
Looking sexy on home?  
Girl why couldn't I be the one?  
  
Why, why, why  
Why couldn't I be the one?  
(Why, why, why)  
Why couldn't you be the one?  
(Why, why, why)  
Why couldn't you be the one?  
(Why, why, why)  
  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Its nothing without you  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Its nothing without you  
All I've got  
Its nothing without  
All I've got  
Its nothing without  
All I've got  
All I've got are these photographs
