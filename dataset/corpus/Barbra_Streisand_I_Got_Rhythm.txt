I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man  
[Speaking]  
You play real good!  
How old are you? Eight?  
...I was eight once...  
For a whole year!  
Then I went on to the big time...  
Nine...Ten...  
[Singing]  
I got daisies in green pastures  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more  
All man trouble, I don't mind him  
You won't find him  
Round and round and round my door  
I got starlight  
I got sweet dream  
I got my man  
Who can ask for anything more  
I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man
