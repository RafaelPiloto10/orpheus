Carry On  
Words and music by Lawrence Chewning  
Carry on, carry on, carry on  
To the students on the campus  
Who are speaking out for Jesus  
As the winds of opposition  
Swirl around you day by day...  
Even if you're mocked and hated  
Don't you be intimidated  
There's a great reward that's waiting  
If you only carry on  
chorus:  
Carry on, carry on  
It won't be long before  
We're gathered 'round God's throne  
Carry on, carry on  
To the lonely missionary  
To the pastor growing weary  
To the parents of the wayward child  
For whom you've prayed so long...  
This is not the time to let up  
It's the time to lift your head up  
When you sow in tears  
You'll reap in joy  
Don't stop, carry on  
chorus  
And if you're facing great temptation  
And you need some consolation  
'Cause the devil's doing all he can  
Just to make you trip and fall...  
Well, the devil will accuse you  
He'll even try to bruise you  
But resist him, and he'll flee from you  
Get up, and carry on  
chorus (repeat)  
Carry on
