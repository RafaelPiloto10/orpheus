Ooooh  
Run away, the past will bite again  
Ooooh  
No matter where you dwell  
You  
Here again, a captive of the howl  
You  
Welcome back to hell  
  
Faithful, as the full moon is rising  
Beauty and the Beast are colliding  
  
Sharpened edge touch liquid flame  
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign  
Arching back, shape-shift derange  
Father, how I watched you change  
  
Am I savage?  
Scratching at the door  
Am I savage?  
I don't recognize you anymore  
  
Ooooh  
Tooth is fang, twisting under skin  
Ooooh  
Foul tongue, black breath  
Change  
Snap inside, the Beast about complete  
Change  
Soon infects the rest  
  
Faithful, as the full moon is rising  
Beauty and the Beast are colliding  
  
Sharpened edge touch liquid flame  
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign  
Arching back, shape-shift derange  
Father, how I watched you change  
  
Am I savage?  
Howling at the door  
Am I savage?  
I don't recognize you anymore  
Anymore  
  
Ooooh  
Inheritance, the past has bit again  
Ooooh  
The next heir of anarchy  
Feel  
Stretching skin so far beyond belief  
I feel  
The ever changing, you, in me  
  
Am I savage?  
Scratching at the door  
Am I savage?  
Howling evermore  
Am I savage?  
I don't recognize me anymore  
Anymore  
  
Anymore, ha ha ha  
Am I savage?
