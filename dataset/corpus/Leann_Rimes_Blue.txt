Blue  
Oh, so lonesome for you  
Why can't you be blue over me  
  
Blue  
Oh, so lonesome for you  
Tears fill my eyes till I can't see  
  
Three o'clock in the morning  
Here am I  
Sittin' here so lonely  
So lonesome I could cry  
  
Blue  
Oh, so lonesome for you  
Why can't you be blue over me  
  
Now that it's over  
I realized  
Those weak words you whispered were nothin' but lies  
  
Blue oh, so lonesome for you  
Why can't you be blue over me  
Why can't you be blue over me
