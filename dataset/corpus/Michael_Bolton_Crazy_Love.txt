I can hear her heart beat from a thousand miles,  
And the heavens's open every time she smile  
And when I come to her,that's where I belong  
Yet, I'm running to her like a river's song.  
  
She give me love, love, love, love crazy love,  
She give me love, love, love, love crazy love.  
  
And I need her in the day time  
I need her, I need her  
And I need her in the night  
I need her, I need her  
I want to throw my arms around her  
Kiss and hold her,kiss and hold her tight.  
And when I'm returning from so far away,  
She give me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day,  
And it makes me righteous and it makes me feel whole,  
And it makes me mellow down in my soul.  
  
She give me love,love,love,love crazy love,  
She give me love,love,love,love crazy love.  
  
She take away my trouble,take away my grief,  
Take away my heartache,in the night like a thief.
