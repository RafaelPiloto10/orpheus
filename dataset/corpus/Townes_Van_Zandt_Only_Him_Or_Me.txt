Don't go saying I'm leaving you  
Thinking I never got close enough to stay  
Time runs in, and then runs out  
Starts again and it's always been that way  
You're gonna drown tomorrow  
If you cry to many tears for yesterday  
Tomorrow's half of all you've got  
So treat him good, 'cause when I'm gone, he'll stay  
  
I won't be forgetting you  
You won't be forgetting me, I know  
If memory comes a summer cloud  
Rains her sweetness down to me below  
I see you like you look right now  
Maybe wonder why I had to go  
But heaven is the way she is  
Rain falls and rivers flow  
  
So here's to feelin' good  
Here's to feelin' bad  
Here's to bein' thankful  
Sorry for the pleasures that we had  
And autumn days and window panes  
God, forgive us if you feel deceived  
The clock don't know you like I do  
And it's only him or me you got to believe
