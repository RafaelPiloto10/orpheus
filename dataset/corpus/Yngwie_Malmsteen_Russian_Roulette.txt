Well, beggars can't be choosers.  
But winners can be losers.  
Now you're all dressed up.  
With nowhere to go.  
Just let the good times roll.  
As the night unfolds.  
You're like a loaded gun.  
You're on the run.  
You are all alone.  
And there's no more bets.  
You're in the danger zone.  
This is Russian roulette.  
Eye for an eye.  
Life on the street.  
I've got some humble pie.  
For you to eat.  
Try it again.  
It's no sweat.  
Try it my friend.  
It's Russian roulette.  
It's Russian roulette.  
I can see you laughing now.  
But you'll cry much later.  
Cause I hold the power of your fate.  
The bullet is in the chamber.  
But now you are feeling strange.  
You can't be very wise.  
Cause this is suicide.  
You are all alone.  
And there's no more bets.  
You're in the danger zone.  
This is Russian roulette.  
Eye for an eye.  
Life on the street.  
I've got some humble pie.  
For you to eat.  
Try it again.  
It's no sweat.  
Try it my friend.  
It's Russian roulette.  
It's Russian roulette.  
[guitar solo]  
You are all alone.  
And there's no more bets.  
You're in the danger zone.  
This is Russian roulette.  
Eye for an eye.  
Life on the street.  
I've got some humble pie.  
For you to eat.  
Try it again.  
It's no sweat.  
Try it my friend.  
It's Russian roulette.  
It's Russian roulette
