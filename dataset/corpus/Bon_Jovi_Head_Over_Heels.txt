I've been hell raised on leather  
High heel, studded, black, cool boots  
Had anything any man could have wanted  
All I ever wanted was you  
  
And baby I've done whatever I wanted  
I stole the lights and I've had command  
Of the world, a wrath of angels  
They're bought and sold on a shake of a hand  
  
And I, I'm head over heels for you  
And I'm here to say that it's true  
I'm head over heels for you  
  
I know you've seen all those romantic movies  
How the hero comes to take you away  
But then you wake up and you're all alone now  
But that's all gonna change today  
  
Remember being all alone  
Remember crying on a rainy day  
It don't have to be that bad now  
It don't have to be that way  
  
And I know what it's like baby to fall in love  
Because I've fallen in love with you  
It's true, yeah it's true  
  
And I'm head over heels for you  
And I'm here to say that it's true  
I'm head over heels for you, yeah  
  
And I know what it's like baby to fall in love  
Because I've fallen in love with you  
It's true, yeah it's true  
  
And I'm head over heels for you  
And I'm here to say that it's true  
I'm head over heels for you  
  
And I'm head over heels for you  
And I'm here to say that it's true  
I'm head over heels  
I'm head over heels  
I'm head over heels for you
