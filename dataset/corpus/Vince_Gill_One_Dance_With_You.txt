Oh baby when you came walkin' in  
I went crazy wonderin' where you been  
I think maybe I just fell in love again  
  
She ain't no Peggy Sue, sweet Mary Lou  
She ain't no Maybeline, pretty miss Norma Jean  
But I'd give up everything  
For just one dance with you  
  
Oh baby I sure like the way you move  
I go crazy when you shake that thing the way you do  
You think maybe I could have a dance with you  
  
She ain't no Peggy Sue, sweet Mary Lou  
She ain't no Maybeline, pretty miss Norma Jean  
But I'd give up everything  
For just one dance with you  
  
She ain't no Peggy Sue, sweet Mary Lou  
She ain't no Maybeline, pretty miss Norma Jean  
But I'd give up everything  
For just one dance with you
