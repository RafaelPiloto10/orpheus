[Verse 1]  
Sometimes I've had too much to drink  
Get all stoned and play some Hank  
I guess that's just the way I am  
And I love the man from Galilee  
Because he died for you and me  
I met them both in Dixieland  
  
[Hook]  
Cuz I've got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam, to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right there by my side  
  
[Verse 2]  
When the water all turned into wine  
I lost my mind for a time  
I felt them both holding my hand  
Looking through these bloodshot eyes  
Praise The Lord I saw the light  
And two sets of footprints in the sand  
  
[Hook]  
Cuz I've got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam, to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right there by my side  
  
I was cashing in, I was casting stones  
I was lost in sin I was on my own  
But now I don't feel alone  
Cuz I've got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam, to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right here by my side  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right here until the day I die  
  
Jesus and Bocephus
