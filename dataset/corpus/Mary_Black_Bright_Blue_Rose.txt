I skimmed across black water  
Without once submerging  
Onto the banks of an urban morning  
That hungers the first light  
Much, much more than mountains ever do  
  
And she, like a ghost beside me  
Goes down with the ease of a dolphin  
And emerges unlearned, unshamed, unharmed  
For she is the perfect creature, natural in every feature  
And I am the geek with the alchemists' stone  
  
For all of you who must discover  
For all who seek to understand  
For having left the path of others  
You'll find a very special hand  
  
And it is a holy thing  
And it is a precious time  
And it is the only way  
Forget-me-nots among the snow  
It's always been, and so it goes  
To ponder his death and his life eternally  
  
For all of you who must discover  
For all who seek to understand  
For having left the path of others  
You'll find a very special hand  
  
And it is a holy thing  
And it is a precious time  
And it is the only way  
Forget-me-nots among the snow  
It's always been, and so it goes  
To ponder his death and his life eternally  
  
One bright blue rose outlives all those  
Two thousand years, and still it goes  
To ponder his death and his life eternally
