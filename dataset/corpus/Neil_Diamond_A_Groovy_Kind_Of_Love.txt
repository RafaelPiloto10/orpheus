When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do is take a look at you,  
Then I'm not so blue.  
When you're close to me I can feel you heart beat  
I can hear you breathing in my ear.  
  
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love.  
We got a groovy kind of love.  
  
Any time you want to you can turn me on to anything you want to.  
Any time at all.  
When I taste your lips  
Oh, I start to shiver can't control the quivering inside.  
  
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love.  
We got a groovy kind of love.  
  
When I'm in your arms nothing seems to matter  
If the world would shatter I don't care.  
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love.  
We got a groovy kind of love.  
We got a groovy kind of love.  
We got a groovy kind of love
