Yesterday was a good day,  
It's after midnight and I've got you on my mind.  
Come with me never go away,  
Every day we will fly, yeah.  
  
[Chorus:]  
That's the same way you love me. (That's the same way she loves you).  
Ooo, just the same way you do. (Just the same way you do).  
Just the same way you love me. (Just the same way she...)  
Loves.  
  
Take a chance now the timing's right.  
You're free to leave the key to my life.  
Stay with me.  
Won't you stay the night,  
In the mornin' feelin' fine, yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, no, you should be holdin' on to him girl.  
Oh, yeah just like, just like you want to do.  
Oh, no, just love and squeeze him girl.  
Oh, yeah just love and squeeze him yeah.  
  
[Chorus]
