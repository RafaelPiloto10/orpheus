We can change the world...  
The difference is in the way...  
The difference is in the way we are as people  
The difference is the sum of what we are  
So look at the things that join us together  
And take away the things that pull us apart  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
The light that draws us through the tunnel of perception  
Is brighter than the light  
That makes us shield our eyes  
Just believe in the idea and it's purity  
No need to question it's source,  
No need for lies  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...  
We can change...  
Changes...  
The magnetism  
That you feel inside  
Draws you closer  
To the heart of the matter  
And the wisdom  
That you see outside  
Is only a mattter  
Of learning  
And forgetting  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...
