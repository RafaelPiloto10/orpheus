Now I'm sheddin' my skin  
Ya gotta listen to me  
I'll tell ya what I see, never belive what you read  
This shit is spreadin' like a disease  
Never feel withdrawn, time to move on, get your groove on  
Say goodbye, everything must die, solidify  
And fly to a new level  
A place where love is unconditional, physical  
And non-denomanitional  
  
Like a snake, she'd my skin, leave my past where I've been...  
Can you feel what I feel?  
To hold on must be killed, don't cry over what's been spilled  
Yeah, yeah,  
Can you feel what I feel?  
  
See the kid rock pumpin' up a' down your block with no cares  
Long hair, swingin' middle fingers in the air  
People stare and point, I hit the joint and laugh  
Kiss my ass!  
The past is more than 10 years I've grown from a complete unknown  
Into the high zone, million dollar home and a diamond ring  
Never thought I'd a mount to a damn thing  
I'm the man, singin' like curtis may  
Mack on homies like ruby day  
It's been a long time comin', but you know what's happened  
Straight pimpin' and sittin' five times platinum..
