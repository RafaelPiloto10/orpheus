Bring on that pecan pie  
Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy  
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl  
Don't be stingy, I'm a growing girl  
  
I offer big love with no apology  
How can I deny the world the most of me  
I am not afraid to throw my weight around  
Pound by pound by pound  
  
Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful  
Face the fact, the simply irrefutable  
No one wants a meal that only offers the least  
When girl, we're serving up the whole damn feast  
  
Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese  
Then take a look inside my book of recipes  
Now, don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light  
We need a man who brings a man-size appetite  
  
I'll use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice  
I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice  
We'll keep it in a oven 'til it's good and hot  
Keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot  
  
Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful  
There is nothing 'bout us that's unsuitable  
Why sit in the bleachers, timid and afraid  
When Edna, you look like the whole parade  
  
They say that white has might and thin is in  
Well, that's just bull  
'Cause ladies, big is back and as for black  
It's beautiful  
  
All shapes and sizes, follow me  
Who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Prove it baby, prove
