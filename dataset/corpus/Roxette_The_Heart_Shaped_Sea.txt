Babe it's time to tell me that it's over, tell me that it's over, it's plain
to see. And this time we won't be starting over, no crying on your shoulder
into the heart shaped sea. Oh you've been a-running from our door and you've
been enchanted by the gracious voice of love.  
  
Babe it's time to look me in the eyes, time to say goodbye, it's clear to me.
And this time I won't let you down, you can turn around, I'll set you free. Oh
you've been a-sailing from our shore and you've been enchanted by someone from
afar.  
  
Babe it's time to gather all the harvest, to pray before the winter and sail
the heart shaped sea. Oh you've been a-running from my love and you've been
enchanted by the powers up above.
