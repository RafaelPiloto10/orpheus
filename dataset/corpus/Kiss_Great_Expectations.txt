You're sittin' in your seat  
And then you stand and clutch your breast  
Our music drives you wild along with the rest  
  
You watch me singing this song  
You see what my mouth can do  
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to  
  
And you watch me playin' guitar  
And you feel what my fingers can do  
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to  
  
Well, listen  
You've got great expectations  
You've got great expectations  
  
You're dying to be seen  
And you wave and call my name  
But in the day it seems that I'm a million miles away  
  
You watch me beatin' my drum  
And you know what my hands can do  
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to  
  
Well, listen  
You've got great expectations  
You've got great expectations  
You've got great expectations  
  
Then you feels these eyes from the stage  
And you see me staring at you  
And you hear between the lines, my voice is calling to you  
  
Well, listen  
You've got great expectations  
You've got great expectations  
  
You've got great expectations, do you want to play the role  
You've got great expectations, you'd even sell me your soul  
  
You've got great expectations  
You've got great expectations  
  
You've got great expectations, do you want to play the role  
You've got great expectations, you'd even sell me your soul  
  
You've got great expectations, as long as you can play the role  
You've got great expectations
