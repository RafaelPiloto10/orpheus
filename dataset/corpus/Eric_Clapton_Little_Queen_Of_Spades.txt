She is a little Queen of Spades  
And her men will not let her be  
Says, she's the little Queen of Spades  
And her men will not let her be  
Ev'ry time she makes a spread  
Hoo, fair brown, cold chills run all over me  
I'm gonna get me a gamblin' woman  
If it's the last thing that I do  
Gonna get me a gamblin' woman  
If it's the last thing that I do  
Man don't need a woman  
Hoo, fair brown, that he got to give all of his money to  
Everybody said, you got a mojo  
'Coz baby you've been using that stuff  
Everybody said, she got a mojo  
Baby, you've been using that stuff  
She got a way of trimmin' down  
Hoo, fair brown, and I mean it's most too tough  
Little girl, since I am the King  
Baby, and you is a Queen  
Little girl, since I am the King  
Baby, and you is a Queen  
Let's us put our heads together  
Hoo, fair brown, then we make our money green
