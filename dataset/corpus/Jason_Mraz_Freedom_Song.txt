I picture something, it's beautiful  
It's full of life, and it is all blue  
I see the sunset on the beach, yeah  
It makes me feel calm  
When I'm calm, I feel good  
  
And when I feel good, I sing  
And the joy it brings makes me feel good  
And when I feel good, I sing  
Of the joy it brings  
  
I see birds fly across the sky  
Everyone's heart flies together  
Food is frying and people smiling  
Like there is no other way to feel good  
  
And when I feel good, I sing  
And the joy it brings makes me feel good  
And when I feel good, I sing  
Of the joy it brings  
  
I say come on along  
I know you really wanna feel our song  
We've got some life to bring  
We've got some joy in this thing  
  
Come on along  
I know you really wanna feel our song  
We've got some life to bring  
We've got some joy in this thing  
  
I say come on along  
I know you really wanna feel our song  
We've got some life to bring  
We've got some joy in this thing  
  
Come on along  
I know you really wanna feel our song  
We've got some life to bring  
We've got some joy in this thing  
  
Can you feel  
Can you feel  
Can you feel  
The joy that it brings  
If you can feel the joy then you should let yourself sing  
Hey  
I love to share my things  
  
'Cause it brings me freedom  
Got to get you some of that freedom  
It's a smile you can feel in your heart beat  
  
Singing freedom  
You deserve your freedom  
It's in the feeling that beauty  
  
Freedom  
Well it's all for you  
All for you  
All for you  
All for you  
  
Freedom  
Got to get you some of that  
Got to get you some of that  
Got to get you some of that  
Freedom
