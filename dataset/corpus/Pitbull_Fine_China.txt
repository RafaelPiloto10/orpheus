Baby, does he do it for you  
When he's finished, does he step back, and adore you  
I just gotta know, cause your time is money  
And I wont let him waste it, ooh no no  
Baby, just go with it  
Cause you're with me, I can't explain it, it's just different  
  
We can take it slow or act like you're my girl let's skip the basics, oh  
Woah  
  
He's so replaceable  
You're worth it, chase ya, put it on  
  
It's alright, I'm not dangerous  
Whem you're mine, I'll be generous  
You're irreplaceable  
A collectible, just like fine china  
  
Baby, you're my favorite  
It's like all the girls around me don't have faces  
And I stay in ghost  
Like this gentle game, I done now playing  
  
He's so replaceable  
You're worth it, chase ya, put it on  
  
It's alright, I'm not dangerous  
Whem you're mine, I'll be generous  
You're irreplaceable  
A collectible, just like fine china  
  
It's alright, I'm not dangerous  
Whem you're mine, I'll be generous  
You're irreplaceable  
A collectible, just like fine china  
  
Give me a weapon, your love  
Aint no a man of time, in this world  
Save me a lot of time, and just love me  
Deal it baby, deal it in your soul  
Are you ready?  
I know your heart being played, and you you belong with me  
  
It's alright, I'm not dangerous  
Whem you're mine, I'll be generous  
You're irreplaceable  
A collectible, just like fine china
