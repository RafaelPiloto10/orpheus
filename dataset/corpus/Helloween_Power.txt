Can you imagine someone being true  
Turn 'round and put himself in front of you  
Sometimes it's fun  
But then you never know  
How far a thing like this might go  
  
All my life I've  
Waited for a chance  
To get right out of here  
And when I had it in my hands  
I could not let it go  
  
We've got the power  
We are divine  
We have the guts to follow the sign  
Extracting tensions from sources unknown  
We are the ones to cover the throne  
  
Try if you can to come where we have gone  
You may achieve what can't be simply done  
Look back and there you are where we have been  
And still there's so much in between  
  
All those years I've travelled 'round this world  
Now I am standing here  
To make you sing these tunes  
And know they'll never let you go  
  
We've got the power  
We are divine  
We have the guts to follow the sign  
Extracting tensions from sources unknown  
We are the ones to cover the throne  
  
We've got the power  
We are divine  
We have the guts to follow the sign  
Extracting tensions from sources unknown  
We are the ones to cover the throne  
  
We've got the power, we are divine...
