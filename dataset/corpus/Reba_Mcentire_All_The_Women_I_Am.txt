Mhmmm, Mhmmm, Owwww, Yeahhhhhh!  
  
Well I can summon up my courage. Take on the whole world. Turn around and
break down just like a little girl. And I come out swingin' when my back's
against the wall.  
  
And my Mama always told me better walk before you crawl. I need a man who can
love all the women I am.  
  
I'm a mother of lost causes. A sister of the road. I give my heart to a song,
but I never sell my soul. I'm good at keeping it together when the edges start
to fray.  
  
When I'm sewing up the loose ends of everyday. I need a man who can love all
the women I am.  
  
Sometimes I'm hard to handle. Burn hotter than a candle, but I melt in the
right hands. Boy you love without condition. It ain't always easy livin' with
all the women I am.  
  
I'm a daughter of the red dirt, Okie dust still in my bones. But I can light
up New York City with my red hair and rhinestones. I'll still be my Mama's
baby when my babies fly away. My moods change like the weather, but my faith
it stays the same.  
  
I need a man who can stand all the women I am. I need a man who can love all
the women I am.  
  
Sometimes I'm hard to handle. Burn hotter than a candle, but I melt in the
right hands. Boy you love without condition. It ain't always easy livin' with
all the women I am.  
  
Hey I'm a realist. I'm a dreamer. I'm a silver linin' seeker. I'm a devil or
an angel who come running when you need her.  
  
Cause I need a man who can love all the women I am. Ohh I want a man who can
love all the women I am. Hey you're a man who can love all the women I am.
You're the man I needed all along. You can handle me baby. All the women I am.
Yeah you're the man. All the women I am.
