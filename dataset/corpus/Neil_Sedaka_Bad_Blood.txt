It coulda been me but it was you  
Who went and bit off a little bit more than he could chew  
You said that you had it made, but you been had  
The woman no good, no how, thinkin' maybe the blood is bad  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
The woman was born to lie  
Makes promises she can't keep  
With the wink on an eye  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
Brother, you've been deceived  
It's bound to change you mind  
About all you believe  
  
From where I stand, it looks mighty strange  
How you let a woman like that treat you like small change  
I don't understand what you're lookin' to find  
The only thing bad blood do is mess up a good man's mind  
  
Hear me talkin' now  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
The bitch is in her smile  
The lie is on her lips  
Such an evil child  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
Is takin' you for a ride  
The only thing good about bad blood  
Is lettin' it slide  
  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Bad blood, talkin' 'bout bad blood  
  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Bad blood  
Here we go  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
The bitch is in her smile  
The lie is on her lips  
Such an evil child  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
Is takin' you for a ride  
The only thing good about bad blood  
Is lettin' it slide  
  
The only thing good about bad blood  
Is lettin' it slide
