Midnight, I see the snow that's falling  
Midnight, still hanging on this wall  
  
I'm thinking back in time  
To when there was still a life  
Free of misery  
Oh, but it was never to be  
  
Midnight, see the snow that's falling  
Midnight, and still you're haunting me  
  
I'm thinking back in time  
To the cellar in the darkest night  
All the misery  
All, the blood I had to see  
  
Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight  
They're ready for the show  
Now the blood must flow  
They're waiting above  
Oh No!  
  
"Let the show begin"
