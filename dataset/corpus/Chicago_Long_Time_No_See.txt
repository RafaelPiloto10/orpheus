What you been doin, ain't you got no one  
Where you been keepin' yourself my friend  
Have you been hidin' underground riding  
Foolin' yourself in your special way  
Where's your old lady  
She was a nice girl  
Maybe it's best that she went away  
You have been losin' nothing can change you  
Hapiness spits in your face always  
Where are you going, what will you see there  
You never learn nothin' by runnin' away  
What you been doin, ain't you got no one  
Where you been keepin' yourself my friend  
Loneliness growin', emptiness showin'  
Finding your peace two or three times a day  
Three times a day
