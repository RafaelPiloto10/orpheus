Before the dawn, I hear you whisper  
In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"  
Outside the birds begin to call  
As if to summon up my leaving  
  
It's been a lifetime since I found someone  
Since I found someone who would stay  
I've waited too long, and now you're leaving  
Oh please don't take it all away

In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"
