So far I've not really stayed in touch  
Well you knew as much it's no surprise that today  
I'll get up around two from a lack of anything to do  
  
And I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument  
  
And you have not really stayed in touch  
Well I knew as much it's no surprise that today  
I'll get up around two with nothing to do  
Except get a touch of flu  
  
And I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument  
And in any case I'd rather wear it  
It's like a badhead in the morning  
  
And I know  
  
And I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument  
And in any case I'd rather wear it  
It's like a badhead in the morning  
  
So I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument  
And in any case I'd rather wear it  
Your like a badhead in the morning  
  
And I know
