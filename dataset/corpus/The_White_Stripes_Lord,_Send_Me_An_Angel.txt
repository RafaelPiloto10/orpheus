Send me an angel down  
Can't spare no angel  
Will spare you a teasin' brown  
Well that new way of loving  
Swear to god it must be best  
For these Detroit women won't let mr. jack white rest  
There's a crowd on the corner  
Wonder what could it be  
One thing but the womens is trying to get to me  
I went down to the station  
Suitcase in my hand  
All the women run cryin'  
Mr. Jack, won't you be my man?  
Well there was three women  
Yellow, brown and black  
Take the mayor of Detroit to pick which one I like  
One of 'em Amtrak yellow  
One of 'em Detroit brown  
But that southwest dark skin sure to turn my damper down  
Why, ticket agent ticket agent  
Where did my baby go  
Tell me what she looks like  
I'll tell you what road she's on  
Well she's a long tall mama  
A mile and a half from the ground  
She's a tailor-man mama  
And she ain't no hand me down  
Well I used to say  
Married women  
Sweetest women never born  
You better change that thing  
You better leave married women alone  
Take my advice let married women  
Boy let 'em be  
Cause their husband will grab ya  
Beat your ragged ass to cedar street  
I got two women  
You can't tell 'em apart  
I got one in my bosom  
And the other is in my heart  
Well that one in my bosom  
She live in Tennessee  
Well that one in my heart  
She don't give a darn for me  
I'm gonna tell you pretty mama  
Exactly who I am  
When I walk in that front door  
And hear that back door slam
