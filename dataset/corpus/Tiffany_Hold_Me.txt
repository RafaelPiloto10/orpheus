[Rick:]  
There is a time for everything in this world  
And i think the moment's come for me to say  
That i do love you  
  
[Tiffany:]  
Love  
No we didn't have a storybook love  
Still i dreamed that somehow we could change our minds  
You'll see, you'll see what i'm saying now  
  
[Both:]  
And what i'm saying now is you should  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold me  
Darling, won't you hold me?  
Give me one little chance to show you  
Baby, if you'd only touch me  
Then you'd know all the love i feel for you  
  
[Rick:]  
Oh, and if  
  
[Both:]  
If you would stop and take a look in your heart  
  
[Tiffany:]  
Then you'd find that secret place you hide  
  
[Rick:]  
(find that secret place)  
  
[Both:]  
Inside  
  
[Tiffany:]  
Is waiting for my love  
  
[Both:]  
Yeah, waiting for my love so won't you  
  
[Chorus x3]  
Hold me  
Darling, won't you hold me?  
Give me one little chance to show you  
Baby, if you'd only touch me  
Then you'd know all the love i feel for you
