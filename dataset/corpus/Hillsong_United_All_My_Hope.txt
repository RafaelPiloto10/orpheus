Light in my darkness  
Peace for my soul  
You are my rescue  
You've never let go  
[x2]  
  
All my hope is in You  
All my strength is in You  
With every breath  
My soul will rest in You  
  
Here in my weakness  
Always the same  
Your love is my shelter  
Your life is my way  
  
All my hope is in You  
All my strength is in You  
With every breath  
My soul will rest in You  
[x2]  
  
Constant Savior  
Friend forever  
Lord You have my heart  
Sure foundation  
Never failing  
Lord You have my heart  
[x2]  
  
All my hope is in You  
All my strength is in You  
With every breath  
My soul will rest in You  
  
All the earth beneath You  
All my life before You  
With every breath  
My soul will rest in You  
  
With every breath  
My soul will rest in You
