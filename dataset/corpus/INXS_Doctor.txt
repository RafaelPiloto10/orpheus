We're all running fast tonight  
Rocket shoes on our feet  
There's a planet where it's right  
I'm sure we'll get there by next week  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
  
You say don't worry while in flight  
The darkness is like a fog  
I won't get scared  
I won't get tired  
I've been in space so damn long  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
  
The Earth is just a big blue dot  
I see the cars and planes  
There's a planet where it's right  
I'm sure we'll get there by next week  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
Especially in the daylight
