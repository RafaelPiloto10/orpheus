Monday morning runs to Sunday night  
Screaming slow me down before the new year dies  
It won't take much to kill a lovin' smile  
And every mother with a baby cryin in her arms singin  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
  
Coming from the city, coming from the wild  
I see a breathless army breaking like a cloud  
They're gonna smother love, they're gonna shoot your hopes  
Before the meek inherit they'll learn to hate themselves  
  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
  
Tell me someone now, what's the price  
I wanna buy some time and maybe live my life  
I wanna have a wife, I wanna have some kids  
I wanna look in their eyes and know they'll stand a chance  
  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes
