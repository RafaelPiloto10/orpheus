[Chorus:]  
Don't you try and stop us now  
I just refuse  
Don't you try to stop us now  
'Cause I just won't let you  
  
Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me  
Breaking me down with an endless monotony  
Sometimes I feel like there's nothing that's stopping me  
All things are possible, I am unstoppable  
  
So they convince you no one can break through  
I'm here to tell you you're worth more than they tell you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sometimes I feel like my life's a catastrophe  
Can't understand why it seems like it has to be  
Sometimes I feel like it's all opened up for me  
Nothing's impossible, I am unconquerable  
  
No one can make you do what they want to  
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So they convince you no one can break through  
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
