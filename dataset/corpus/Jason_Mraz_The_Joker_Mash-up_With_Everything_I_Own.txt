Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call me the gangster love  
And some people call me Maurice  
Cause I speak of the competence of love.  
Well, people talkin about me, baby  
They say I'm doing wrong, I'm doing wrong.  
Don't you worry, don't you worry, don't you worry dirty mama,  
Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here headin' home.  
  
I'm a picker, I'm a grinner, I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner  
I play my music in the sun  
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker, I'm a midnight toker.  
I get my lovin' on the run.  
  
You sheltered me from harm  
Kept me warm, kept me warm  
You gave my love to me  
Set me free, set me free  
The finest years I ever knew  
Were all the years I had with you  
  
People talking about me baby  
They say I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing you all wrong  
Don't you worry, don't you worry mama  
Right here, right here, right home  
  
Is there someone you know  
You're lovin them so  
But taken them all for granted  
You may lose them one day  
Someone takes them away  
And they don't hear the words you long to say  
  
I'm a picker, I'm a grinner, I'm a lover, a sinner  
I play my music in the sun, I play my music in the sun  
I'm a joker, a smoker, and I'm a midnight toker.  
She don't wanna hurt no one  
  
Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call the gangster love  
And some people call me Maurice  
Cause I speak the competence of love  
I speak the competence  
Cause I speak of love (once again)
