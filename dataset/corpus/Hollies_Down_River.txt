Good to see you again, Rosie  
I know I've changed a lot since then  
You're lookin' fine, babe  
Three years that ain't long, Rosie  
I still remember our song  
When you were mine, babe  
Times change, times change I know  
But it sure moves slow  
Down river when you're locked away  
Hey why didn't you write, Rosie  
I stayed awake most every night  
Countin' my time babe  
Oh no I ain't mad Rosie  
I know you had to mind your dad  
But just a line babe  
Oh sure I remember then  
We went off to school  
Ain't that right  
Well he ain't no fool  
He's a good man Rosie  
Hold him tight as you can  
Don't ask me why babe  
Yeah nice seein' you again Rosie  
Me I got things to do  
Well good-bye babe  
chorus  
chorus  
Rosie down river  
Down river when you're locked away  
Rosie I'm losing  
Down river
