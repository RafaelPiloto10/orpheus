I had a good life  
Before you came  
I had my friends and my freedom  
I had my name  
Still there was sorrow and emptiness  
'Til you made me glad  
Oh, in this love, I found strength I never knew I had  
  
[Chorus]  
And this love  
Is like nothing I have ever known  
Take my hand, love  
I'm taking you home  
I'm taking you home  
  
There were days, lonely days  
When the world wouldn't throw me a crumb  
But I kept on believing  
That this day would come  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where we can be with the ones who really care  
Home, where we can grow together  
Keep you in my heart forever  
  
And this love  
Is like nothing I have ever known  
Oh no, no baby  
Take my hand, love  
I'm taking you home  
Taking you home  
  
And this love  
Is like nothing I have ever known  
Oh no, baby  
Take my hand,  
I'm taking you home  
Yes I am  
I'm taking you home  
Taking you home, baby  
Taking you home
