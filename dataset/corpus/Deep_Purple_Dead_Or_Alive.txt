Don't turn off the light  
You might draw the Queen of Spades  
Don't shut the door  
You don't need to be alone  
I won't bring you no food  
There might be some poison in your meat  
I've got to know  
  
Are you dead or alive  
Don't shut the door  
Are you dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
Pick your window you're leaving  
  
Don't look in the mirror  
With a dollar up your face  
You've got money to burn  
You're cheap at half the price  
Oh don't powder your nose  
Don't blow your brains just for the the crack  
I've got to know  
  
Are you dead or alive  
Just for the crack  
Are you dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
Pick your window you're leaving  
  
You're running so fast  
But you know you're standing still  
I'm afraid of your shadow  
And the knife in it's hand  
You're dancing with death  
To the tune of the dealer  
And he don't care  
Don't give a toss  
Don't want to know  
  
If you're dead or alive  
Don't want to know  
If you're dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
Pick your window you're leaving
