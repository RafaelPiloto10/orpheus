Internal War  
Killing our own  
Burn the ones that have sinned against  
Claim their lives in your death romance  
Arm the young with your hunting toys  
By your own actions you are all to blame  
Power in the wrong hands our scaffold is destroyed  
Children killing children because our government has ignored  
I sling my arrows to shatter your walls  
No more creating victims from ignorance  
Left to second both sides  
Each one cries and lies  
No More War  
You've killed again  
My life for what  
Bound hands  
Yes you've all killed again  
Stand by as dying children wait for life  
The line has been crossed again  
How long will it take  
The line has been crossed again  
How long will it take to protect life
