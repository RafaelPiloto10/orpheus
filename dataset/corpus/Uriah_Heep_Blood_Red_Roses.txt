Heaven's above  
What on earth has this come to  
What have I done  
What can I do now to show you  
There's still a chance  
If you're ready to make up  
It's not too late  
'Cause I'm not ready to break up  
I try to call  
But you don't hear at all  
  
I'm sending roses  
I'm sending blood red roses  
This burning in my heart  
Is tearing me apart  
I'm sending roses  
I'm sending blood red roses  
  
You've got to understand  
That's my heart in your hand  
  
Don't walk away  
We can get this heart mended  
Or am I the fool  
And has this love just ended  
I tried to call  
But you don't hear at all  
  
I gotta keep on trying  
To stop this love from dying  
  
You've got to understand  
That my heart is in your hand  
  
Roses  
I'm sending blood red roses  
This burning in my heart  
Is tearing me apart  
I'm sending roses  
I'm sending blood red roses  
  
Roses  
I'm sending blood red roses  
This burning in my heart  
Tears me apart  
Roses - blood red roses  
You've got to understand  
That's my heart in your hand  
Roses  
I'm sending blood red roses  
'Cause this burning in my heart  
Tears me apart
