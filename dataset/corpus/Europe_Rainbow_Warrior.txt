Lock the door, thin the light  
Here's the tale for you tonight  
Let me take you away  
Well, take my hand and follow me  
Mother Mary's child to be  
Well, I got something to say  
Rainbow warrior  
Shine on  
Rainbow warrior  
Sign your will across the sky  
Follow me 'til the day you die  
One for all and all for one  
Walking through the gates of dawn  
We've been waiting so long  
Children sent from near and far  
Come and see their newborn star  
See it shining so strong
