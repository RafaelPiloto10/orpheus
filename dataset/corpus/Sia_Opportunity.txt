(Verse)  
Under the glow of the very bright liiights  
I turn my face towards the warm night sky  
And I am not afraid of a thousand eyes  
When they're above five hundred smiles  
  
(PRE-chorus)  
Oh. I used to think  
What wouldn't I giiive  
For A moment like thiis  
This moment is giift  
(Chorus)  
  
Oh, now look at me and this opportunity  
It's standing right in front of me  
But one thing I know it's only part luck and  
Sooo I'm putting on my best shooow  
Under the spot light  
I'm Starting my liife  
Big dreams becoming real tonight  
So look at me and this opportunity  
You're witnessing my moment you see  
My big opportunity  
(Verse 1)  
  
Now I'm right here and it's tiiiimme  
'Cause this is real, this is real and it's all mine  
I'm not afraiiid to flyyy  
When it's above five hundred smiles  
(PRE-CHORUS)  
  
Oh I used to think  
What I wouldn't give  
For a moment like this  
This moment, this gift

Is standing right in front of me  
But one thing I know it's only part luck and so

Big dreams becoming real tonight
