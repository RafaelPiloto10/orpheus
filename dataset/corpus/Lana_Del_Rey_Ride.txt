I've been out on that open road  
You can be my full time, daddy white and gold  
Singing blues has been getting old  
You can be my full time, baby  
Hot or cold  
  
Don't break me down  
I've been travelin' too long  
I've been trying too hard  
With one pretty song  
  
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast  
I am alone in the night  
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I  
I've got a war in my mind  
So, I just ride  
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride  
  
Dying young and I'm playing hard  
That's the way my father made his life an art  
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark  
That's the way the road doves do it, ride 'til dark.  
  
Don't leave me now  
Don't say good bye  
Don't turn around  
Leave me high and dry  
  
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast  
I am alone in the night  
Been tryin' hard not to get in trouble, but I  
I've got a war in my mind  
I just ride  
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride  
  
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy  
I'm tired of driving 'till I see stars in my eyes  
I look up to hear myself saying, baby  
Too much I strive, I just ride  
  
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast  
I am alone in the night  
Been tryin' hard not to get in trouble, but I  
I've got a war in my mind  
I just ride  
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride
