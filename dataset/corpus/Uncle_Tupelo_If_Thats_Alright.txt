Every day is dreamlike  
It seems like, in every way  
And that's why  
When I look back on my life  
It's like a slideshow out of focus  
  
And as the carousel goes 'round  
The slides are upside-down  
There's nothing to make out or even notice  
  
When will it all become concrete wouldn't that be sweet  
To know where you stand  
But until then, it's a slideshow  
That you're yawning through  
Or even sleeping  
  
And as the carousel goes 'round  
The slides are still upside-down  
There's nothing to make out or even notice  
  
And if that's alright, then it's alright  
If that's alright, then it's alright  
And if that's alright  
Then I want to hear you say it  
And if that's alright  
Then I gotta hear you say it now
