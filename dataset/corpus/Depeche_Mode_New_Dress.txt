Sex jibe husband murders wife  
Bomb blast victim fights for life  
Girl Thirteen attacked with knife  
  
Princess Di is wearing a new dress  
  
Jet airliner shot from sky  
Famine horror, millions die  
Earthquake terror figures rise  
  
Princes Di is wearing a new dress  
  
You can't change the world  
But you can change the facts  
And when you change the facts  
You change points of view  
If you change points of view  
You may change a vote  
And when you change a vote  
You may change the world  
  
In black townships fires blaze  
Prospects better premier says  
Within sight are golden days  
  
Princess Di is wearing a New Dress  
  
You can't change the world  
But you can change the facts  
And when you change the facts  
You change points of view  
If you change points of view  
You may change a vote  
And when you change a vote  
You may change the world  
  
Princess Di is wearing a New Dress
