I got an airplane ticket  
And my shirt is stickin' out of my jeans  
You got me painted in the corner  
Where I'm livin' way beyond my means  
Outside my window  
A bird once flew  
Now I don't even care  
What kind of gum I chew  
And oh baby  
I just want to be with you  
  
Well I don't want to wash the dishes  
But I'm wishin' I could wash my hair  
You been on my mind so long  
You must livin' up there  
Well it's up to the circus  
And down to the zoo  
The monkey's lookin' at me  
Like I'm lookin' at you  
And oh baby  
I just want to be with you  
  
I don't want to go to london  
To visit the queen  
She don't like my english  
If you know what I mean  
Don't want to walk around  
Like I got nothin' to do  
Uh uh baby want to be with you  
Uh uh baby want to be with you  
  
Well I was cleaning out my wallet  
While I'm sittin' on my livin' room rug  
I was lookin' at the numbers of the women  
That I thought I dug  
There was one that begged  
One that teased  
One god blessed me  
Every time I sneezed  
But oh baby  
I just want to be with you  
  
I want to be with you  
When there ain't no love  
When the banks all close  
With the stars above  
Lonely won't be lonesome  
When we get through  
And uh uh baby want to be with you  
Uh uh baby want to be with you
