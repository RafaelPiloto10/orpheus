Hide your heart from sight,  
Lock your dreams at night,  
It could happen to you!  
Don't count stars or you might stumble,  
Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble  
  
Keep an eye on spring,  
Run when church bells ring,  
It could happen to you!  
All I did was wonder how your arms would be,  
And it happened to me  
  
It could happen to you  
All I did was wonder how your arms would be,  
And it happened to me
