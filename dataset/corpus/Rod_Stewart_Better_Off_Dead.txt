Call the girls and dress up fine  
Tonight I felt like suicide  
Roll them dice and pour the wine  
Shuffle them cards and deal them fine  
Got nobody to kiss tonight  
Nothing to lose but my appetite  
want to be silly and sing and shout  
Gotta get legless and fall about  
Turn the music up nice and loud  
Cheer me up don't bring me down  
Gonna lose my job next week  
Getting replaced by a silicone chip  
I might have been a hero  
But I chose to stay in bed  
I might have been prime minister  
but right now honey I'm better off dead  
I might have been a hero  
But I chose to stay in bed  
I might have been prime minister  
but right now honey I'm better off dead  
Don't like the scenery don't like the set  
Tear it all down and start again  
Man keeps talking on the radio  
Telling me what I don't want to know  
Radiation wars and layatril  
If tax don't get ya then cancer will  
I might have been a hero  
But I chose to stay in bed  
I might have been prime minister  
but right now honey I'm better off dead  
I might have been a hero  
But I chose to stay in bed  
I might have been prime minister  
but right now honey I'm better off dead  
Better off dead, better off dead  
Better off dead, better off dead
