The farce was ended  
The curtain drawn  
And I at least pretended  
That love was dead and gone  
  
But now from nowhere  
You come to me as before  
To take my heart  
And break my heart once more  
  
Get out of town  
Before it's too late my love  
Get out of town  
Be good to me please  
  
Why wish me harm  
Why not retire to a farm  
And be contented to charm  
The birds off the trees  
  
Just disappear  
I care for you much too much  
And when you're near  
Close to me dear  
  
We touch too much  
The thrill when we meet  
Is so bittersweet that  
Darling it's getting me down  
  
On your mark, get set,  
Get out of town.  
Just disappear  
I care for you much too much  
  
And when you're near  
Close to me dear  
We touch too much  
The thrill when we meet  
  
Is so bittersweet that  
Darling it's getting me down  
On your mark, get set,  
Get out of town.  
  
On your mark, get set,  
Get out of town.  
Get out of town.  
Get out of town.  
Get out of town.
