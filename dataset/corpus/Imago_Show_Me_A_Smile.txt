Show me a smile and then kiss me  
Tell me you love me again  
Come to my room and then lie in my bed  
I love you, you know  
Although sometimes it just doesn't show  
  
Love me forever  
Love me all night through  
Love me for a lifetime  
I live my life for only you  
  
Giving is my way of loving  
It's the only way that I know  
I've got nothing much  
I've got nothing to show  
I love you, you know  
Although sometimes it doesn't seem so  
  
Love me forever  
Love me all night through  
Love me for a lifetime  
I live my life for only you
