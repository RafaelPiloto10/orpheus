It was the night before,  
When all through the world,  
No words, no dreams  
Then one day,  
A writer by a fire  
Imagined all of Gaia  
Took a journey into a child-man's heart  
  
A painter on the shore  
Imagined all the world  
Within a snowflake on his palm  
Unframed by poetry,  
A canvas of awe  
Planet Earth falling back into the stars  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land,  
The innocence, the dreams of every man,  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,  
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky,  
Every chimney, every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real,  
Every memory that you hold dear  
  
I am the journey,  
I am the destination,  
I am the home  
The tale that reads you  
A way to taste the night  
The elusive high  
Follow the madness  
Alice, you know once did  
  
Imaginarium, a dream emporium!  
Caress the tales  
And they will read you real  
A storyteller's game,  
Lips that intoxicate  
The core of all life is a  
Limitless chest of tales  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land  
The innocence, the dreams of every man,  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,  
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky,  
Every chimney, every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real,  
Every memory that you hold dear  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land  
The innocence, the dreams from every man,  
Searching heavens for another earth  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land  
The innocence, the dreams of every man,  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,  
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky,  
Every chimney, every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real,  
Every memory that you hold dear  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land  
The innocence, the dreams of every man,  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,  
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky,  
Every chimney, every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real,  
Every memory that you hold dear
