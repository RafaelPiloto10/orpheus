The sand, feel the waves between your toes  
Can you feel the way the old wind blows  
From one to another  
Here to discover  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Honeysuckle vines outside the door  
Dandelion wine and so much more  
We can discover  
Into each other  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Night fall, fireflies light up the lawn  
Pink skies mirrored on the sea at dawn  
From one to another  
Here to discover  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Indian summer
