It's the wrong time  
And the wrong place  
Though your face  
Is charming  
It's the wrong face  
It's not her face  
But such  
A charming face  
That it's  
All right with me  
  
It's the wrong song  
In the wrong style  
Though your smile  
Is lovely  
It's the wrong smile  
It's not her smile  
But such  
A lovely smile  
That it's  
All right with me  
  
You can't know  
How happy  
I am that we met  
I'm strangely  
Attracted to you  
There's someone  
I'm trying  
So hard to forget  
Don't you want  
To forget someone  
Too?  
  
It's the wrong game  
With the wrong chips  
Though your lips  
Are tempting  
They're the wrong lips  
They're not her lips  
But they're  
Such tempting lips  
That if some night  
You are free  
Then it's all right  
Yes  
It's  
All right with me
