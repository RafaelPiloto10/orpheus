I had a dream and I saw you standin' and you were shinin' just like an angel  
I'd like to thank you for standing by me when things were darker you held the
candle  
Do you remember when we took a dream and then turned it into today together  
Dreamin' seems to carry me back to where I want to be  
  
Wrapped up in your arms and feeling better  
Rivers will run mountains will rise I love you more than the stars in the
skies  
I'll never treat you wrong won't make you cry  
Just sing you sweet love songs won't tell you lies  
Wouldn't you like to go ridin' with me into tomorrow oh sweet fantasy  
  
Rivers will run mountains will rise I love you more than the stars in the
skies  
Cherish what you sweet remember running through the sands of time  
Cherish it with all that's in you  
  
Rivers will run mountains will rise I love you more than the stars in the
skies  
Rivers will run eagles will fly I love you more than the stars in the skies  
Yes I love girl yes I love girl yes I love girl
