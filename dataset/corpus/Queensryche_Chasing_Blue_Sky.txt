Shakin' time, she needs  
Taking rides to somewhere  
Let's lose our minds, no hurry  
I'm the wakeful night, with dreams or something  
  
Chasing blue sky,  
We're chasing blue sky  
  
Taking time from all this worry  
Mesmerized by the waves of your smile  
I wish that I could say something  
But you're the rose colored glass I see through  
I'll see you through  
  
Chasing blue sky,  
We're chasing blue sky  
Chasing blue sky,  
We're chasing blue sky  
  
Chasing blue sky,  
We're chasing blue sky  
Chasing blue sky,  
We're chasing blue sky
