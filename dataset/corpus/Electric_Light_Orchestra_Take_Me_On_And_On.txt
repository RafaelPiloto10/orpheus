The stars that shine so brightly  
They call to me  
I dream of how it might be  
Somewhere far away  
  
Take me on and on  
Until the world has gone  
Take me on and on  
  
The chains that hold you  
Those chains will soon be gone  
Sail upon the ocean  
Sail back to me  
  
Take me on and on  
Until the world has gone  
Take me on and on  
  
Take me on, on and on  
I see it all below  
I know which way to go  
I see the afterglow  
  
Take me on and on  
Until the world has gone  
Take me on and on
