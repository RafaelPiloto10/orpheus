[Intro]  
Eva, eva, eva (uh)  
Oh, eva, eva, eva  
(Fifth Harmony, baby)  
Oh, eva, eva, eva  
(Let's go)  
Oh, everlasting love  
(Another one)  
  
[Verse 1: Lauren]  
Always looking over my shoulder  
Cause I don't ever wanna miss you  
I been thinking about you daily  
Can't wait to see your face  
And I don't even know you  
But I know that I can't wait to kiss you  
Somehow I know when we finally lock eyes  
That you'll feel the same way  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Camila]  
You're gonna be all I needed  
You make me feel like a dream  
Whoever you are  
Baby, you are  
The one I'm waiting for  
  
[Chorus: Dinah]  
You're my ever- everlasting love  
My ever- everlasting love  
And I'm never ever giving up  
'Til you're laying next to me  
I'm lookin' for that ever- everlasting love  
Forever ever kind of touch  
And I'll never ever get enough  
Baby, we were meant to be  
  
[Verse 2: Ally]  
Ain't no use in wasting my time  
On just anybody, baby  
I want exceptional, original  
Someone I can't deny  
I'm in love with you already  
I know it sounds crazy  
But I hope you save all you got for me  
Cause, baby, you're all mine  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everlasting love  
Everlasting love  
Everlasting love  
My everlasting love  
  
[Bridge: Normani]  
I don't even know your name  
But I can't get you off my brain  
Darling, I can hardly wait  
'Til I can get to know you  
You'll be beautifully insane  
Infinitely all for me  
Promise you'll be glad you came  
I can't wait to show you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everlasting love  
Everlasting love  
Everlasting love  
My everlasting love
