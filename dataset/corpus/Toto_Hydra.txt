There was a man  
He walked around  
Searching for the girl who had just caught his eye  
"I was a fool!" he cried  
His mind had wandered  
He blinked and the sky moved e'er so slightly  
He searched the city and she was nowhere to be found  
Meanwhile she was floating downward, downward  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you want your freedom  
Do you want my love  
Do you want your freedom  
From the one you're thinking of  
  
There lies a lady  
Naked and yet not knowing  
A spell, it gains her heart forever  
Preyed upon by the wolves in Time Square  
Fell into an abyss of dead air  
Innocence caged in sanctuary  
There sat the Dragon Lord  
Playing solitary  
Defying the rules the holy boys leap Hell's Kitchen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly a voice was heard  
Ina a flash the brave young man appeared  
The Dragon will cut him with his tail  
Chased him to the stairway  
Caught him halfway to the top  
Sent him whirling down  
Fireball, summer solstice  
Dragon Lord descended down on him  
She turned to look but saw only darkness, silence  
  
[Chorus]
