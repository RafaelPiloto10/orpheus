I'm nothing but a lonely all american boy  
Looking out for something to do  
And you were nothing but a lonely all american girl  
But you were something like a dream come true  
I am a varsity tackle and the head of the block  
When I played the guitar I made the canyon rock  
  
But every saturday night I felt the fever grow  
All revved up with no place to go  
All revved up with no place to go  
All revved up with no place to go  
All revved up with no place to go  
All revved up with no place to go
