You ask me how much I need you  
Must I explain  
I need you oh my darling  
Like roses need rain  
  
You ask how long I'll love you  
I'll tell you true  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
I'll still be loving you  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold me close  
Never let me go  
Hold me close  
Melt my heart like April snow  
  
I'll love you 'til the bluebells  
Forget to bloom  
I'll love you 'til the clover  
Has lost its perfume  
  
And I'll love you 'til the poets  
Run out of rhyme  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
And that's a long, long time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll love you 'til the bluebells  
Forget to bloom  
I'll love you 'til the clover  
Has lost its perfume  
  
And I'll love you 'til the poets  
Run out of rhyme  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
And that's a long, long time  
  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
And that's a long, long time  
A long, long time
