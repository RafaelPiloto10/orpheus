I've got the dynamo of volition  
With po-pole position  
Automatic transmission with lo-ow emissions  
I'm a brand new addition to the old edition  
With the love unconditional  
  
I'm a drama abolitionist  
Damn no opposition to my proposition  
Half of a man, half magician  
Half a politician holding the mic  
Like ammunition  
And my vision is as simple as light  
  
Ain't no reason we should be in a fight  
No demolition  
Get to vote, get to say what you like  
Procreation  
Compositions already written by themselves  
Saying heck is for the people not believin' in gosh  
  
[Chorus]  
Good Job  
Get 'em up way high  
Gimme gimme that high five  
Good time  
Get 'em way down low  
Gimme gimme that low dough  
Good God  
Bring 'em back again  
Gimme gimme that high ten  
  
You're the best definition of good intentions  
  
I do not answer the call if  
I do not know who is calling  
I guess the whole point of it all is  
That we never know really  
  
I'm tryin' to keep with the Joneses  
While waiting for guns and the roses  
To finish what we all suppose is  
That shit's so silly  
  
Oh, fist like pumpin' and wrist lock  
Twisting up a rizla  
Kid Icarus on the transistor  
Nintendo been givin' me the blister  
I bend over take it in the kisser  
  
Best friends are hittin' on my sister.  
Try to tell them that they still wish-a  
Cause she already got herself a mister  
And besides that's gross to want to dis her  
Didn't I say, didn't I say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a representation of good versus evil  
  
I do not keep up with statistics  
I do not sleep without a mistress  
I do not eat unless it's fixed with  
Some kind of sweet like a licorice  
My home is deep inside the mystics  
I'm known to keep diggin' on existence  
I'm holdin' in the heat like a fish-stick  
And my phone it beeps because I missed it  
  
I do not answer the phone if  
I do not know who is calling  
I guess the whole point of it all is  
Fuck's sake, can I get a witness  
  
I'm only a boy in a story  
Just a hallucinatory  
Trippin' on nothing there is  
Living in the wilderness  
  
With a tiger spot on my back  
Living life of a cat  
I just wanna relax here  
And sing another rap tune  
Driving off on your blind man's bike  
You can say just what you like  
Or nothing can stop you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're the best definition of good versus evil  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a representation of good intention  
You're the best definition of good intention  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
You're the best around  
And nothings ever gonna take you down  
  
You're the best around
