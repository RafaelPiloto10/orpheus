The towers of London, these crumbling rocks  
Reality estates that the hero's got  
And every hour's marked by the chime of a clock  
  
And whatcha gonna do when the darkness surrounds?  
You can piss in the lifts which have broken down  
You can watch from the debris, the last bedroom light  
We're invisible here just past midnight  
  
And the wives hate their husbands and their husbands don't care  
Their children daub slogans to prove they lived there  
A giant pipe organ up in the air  
  
You can't live in a home which should not have been built by the bourgeoise
clerks who bear no guilt  
When the wind hits this building, this building it tilts  
One day it will surely fall to the ground  
  
Fear is just another commodity here  
They sell us peeping holes to peek when we hear  
A bang on the door resoundingly clear  
  
Who would really want to move in here?  
The children play faraway, the corridors are bare  
This room is a cage, it's like captivity  
How can anyone exist in such misery?  
It has been said, "Not only here"  
  
Allianza dollars are spent to raise the towering buildings for the weary bones
of the workers to go back in the morning  
It has been said, "Not only here"  
  
Allianza dollars are spent to raise the towering buildings for the weary bones
of the workers to be strong in the morning  
So, go pack your things  
Watching the building  
It has been said  
  
'Til they stop building  
  
Allianza dollars are spent to raise the towering buildings for the weary bones
of the workers to be strong in the morning
