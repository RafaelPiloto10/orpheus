Jaimme's got a girl  
Don't think things are gonna be the same.  
He ain't coming out and drinking tonight.  
Think he's gonna change his name.  
We can't work it out.  
He ain't punching walls anymore.  
I'm ain't gonna wake up now  
Find you on my floor.  
A game's a game, you don't want it being the same  
But you sure ain't like you were yesterday  
But go on and try it  
And if it's true, it just ain't my place to say  
But you sure ain't like you were yesterday.  
Go on and try it.  
Phone sure sounds dead  
My pocket sure feel tight  
The things I promised not to do with you today  
I sure need to tonight.  
But it's all working out  
Just like they said it would be.  
You ain't gonna fall on my floor  
From now on it's just we three.
