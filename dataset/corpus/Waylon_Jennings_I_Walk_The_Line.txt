I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  
I keep my eyes wide open all the time  
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind  
Because you're mine I walk the line  
I find it very, very easy to be true  
I find myself by myself when each day is through  
I'll admit that I'm a fool for you  
Because you're mine I walk the line  
I'll admit that I'm a fool for you  
Because you're mine, let me, I walk in the line  
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
