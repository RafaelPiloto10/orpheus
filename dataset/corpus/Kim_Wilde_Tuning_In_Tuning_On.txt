Cruising 'round there's a sound with a place to go  
Tuning in tuning on like a radio  
Fell the sound in your head and you set the seal  
I believe it's a force of the life you feel - Tuning on  
  
Do you know what the sounds that you hear will find  
Reach to space to the stars and another time  
I believe that they search like a seed to grow  
In the end it's the same anyway you go  
  
I really can't explain  
I really can't explain  
  
Crashing out for the last and the final time  
Could a sound and a soul travel on combined  
From the womb to the end is it everywhere  
Feel the beat of my heart and you know it's there  
  
I really can't explain

I really believe that sound reaches infinity, do you know what I mean. I think
it goes on and on forever, and if that's true and it was linked to the
spiritual side of your lives, well, then sounds could be alive. Can you
imagine the possibilities for the future ? Linking the soul and the sound and
then being able to make a giant spiritual musical machine, actually a part of
us and not just something you hear - it's fantastic - it's just fantastic  
  
I really can't explain
