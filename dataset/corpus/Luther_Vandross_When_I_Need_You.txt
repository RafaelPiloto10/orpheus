No one knows the side of you that I know  
No one gets to see, to feel you  
To hear you when they call  
I'm the only one you answer  
Because I know what to do  
I know what to do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
When I need love  
I hold out my hand and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
  
Miles and miles of empty space in between us  
A telephone can't take the place of your smile  
But I won't be traveling forever  
It's cold out, but hold out  
And do like I do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
  
It's not easy when the road is your driver  
But honey that's the heavy load that we bear  
But I won't be traveling a lifetime  
It's cold out, but hold out  
And do like I do  
When I need you  
  
But I won't be traveling a lifetime  
It's cold out, oh honey, hold out  
And do like I do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you baby  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
  
When I need love  
I hold out my hand and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
Honey, when I need you  
  
I'm in a cloud and I'm holding my hand out to you  
Holding my hand out to you  
Holding my hand out for you
