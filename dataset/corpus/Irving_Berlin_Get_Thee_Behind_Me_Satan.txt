Get thee behind me, satan  
I want to resist  
But the moon is low and I can't say "no"  
Get thee behind me  
  
Get thee behind me, satan  
I mustn't be kissed  
But the moon is low and I may let go  
Get thee behind me  
  
Someone I'm mad about  
Is waiting in the night for me  
Someone that I mustn't see  
Satan, get thee behind me  
  
He promised to wait  
But I won't appear and he may come here  
Satan, he's at my gate  
Get thee behind me  
Stay where you are  
It's too late
