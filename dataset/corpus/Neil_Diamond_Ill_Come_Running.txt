Matter of fact, you're on the right track  
My future looks black and blue...  
Didn't take long to see I was wrong  
That I still got it strong for you  
I'll come running, yeah  
If you want me to  
I'll come running, yeah  
'Cause I'm done in, yeah, without you  
I'd give my last shirt  
To take back the words  
That brought all that hurt upon her  
Both made mistakes  
Had some bad breaks  
But we've got what it takes to go on  
I'll come running, yeah  
If you want me to  
I'll come running, yeah  
'Cause I'm done in, yeah, without you  
I'll come running, yeah  
If you want me to  
I'll come running, yeah  
'Cause I'm done in, yeah, without you
