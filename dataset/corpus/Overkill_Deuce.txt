Get up and get your grandma outta here  
Pick up, Old Jim is workin' hard this year  
Baby, do the things I says to do, do it  
Baby, if you're feeling good  
Baby, if you're feeling nice  
You know your man is workin' hard  
He's worth a deuce  
[Incomprehensible], don't put your man behind the years  
Baby, stop cryin' all your tears  
Baby, do the things I says to do, do it  
Baby, if you're feeling good  
And baby, if you're feeling nice  
You know your man is workin' hard  
He's worth a deuce  
Baby, if you're feeling good  
And baby, if you're feeling nice  
You know your man is workin' hard, oh
