He put flowers on the hills your cup he gladly fills  
How can you turn around and say God is dead  
But when your stories have all been told there's one thing I'd like to know  
If God is dead who's this living for my soul  
He gives us shelter from life's stormy weather gives us love to keep us
together  
When life gets like a ship on a raging sea  
And when the stage of life grows cold somebody helps us to play our role  
If God is dead who's this living for my soul  
If my soul had windows I'd leave them open so the world could see  
The ugly scars upon those hands that cleft for you and me  
There's the bridge you can cross if you will the toll was paid on Golgota's
hill  
If God is dead who's this living for my soul if God is dead who's this living
for my soul
