I speak from some sort of protection of learning  
Even tho' I make it up as I go on  
A special trait is that I've tried  
To reach all feelings  
So I speak a new language of love  
  
Some say that it is written in the circle  
Others that it is written in the sun  
But I protect myself by seeing this experience  
As a metaphor for moving on  
  
Sometimes I check myself  
To start to believe in  
The horoscopes you read everyday  
They're telling me somethings  
I really ought to know  
But then again I like to  
Then again I learn to  
Then again I'm running away  
  
Vision is coming so fast I can't stop myself  
Vision forgets who is real  
On the city streets, people get lost  
Just waiting for history  
Pushing the real world away  
  
Taking a chance only once in your life  
Only weakness can stop you from hearing  
New languages  
Translate each word  
As they bring you creation  
Your voice is the perfect key  
  
Is there something that  
I'm supposed to see  
  
Is there something that I'm  
Supposed to feel  
I'm with you  
And I can't help but want to know  
  
(Talk to me)  
Is there something that I'm supposed to teach  
(Speak to me)  
Is there something that I'm supposed to find  
As I reach to the healing in each spoken word  
  
For some strange reason time just cannot wait a minute  
I'm chasing every second before I let go  
Yesterday my history  
Dreams are still a mystery  
This living is a gift I should know  
  
Lay it down and let me live the new language  
Let me learn at every twist every turn  
Lay it down and let me love the further future  
Let me know I'm running  
Let me know I'm learning  
Let me know I'm moving on  
  
Vision is racing so fast I can't stop myself  
Chasing the reason  
For all kinds of wondering  
People embracing these feelings of limbo  
Just waiting for some kind of truth  
  
Taking a chance as it comes only once  
Only strength can do justice  
With words of new languages  
Translate creation  
To bring you salvation  
Your voice is the perfect key  
  
(Talk to me)  
Is there something that
