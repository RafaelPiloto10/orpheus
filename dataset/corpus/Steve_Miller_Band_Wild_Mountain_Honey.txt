Ooh, mama  
Well look what's been done  
You can only see the stars  
After a setting sun  
  
You run for the money  
You don't even know about wild mountain honey  
  
Come on mama  
Heal this lonesome man  
Grow the tree of wholeness  
In this desert land  
  
Come on children  
Now learn how to run  
By heaven, the stars, the moon and the sun  
  
Come on papa  
Your end is the means  
Don't trade your love and goodness  
For the golden machine  
  
You run for the money  
You don't even know about wild mountain honey
