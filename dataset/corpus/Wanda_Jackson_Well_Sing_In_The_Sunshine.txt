We'll sing in the sunshine we'll laugh every day  
We'll sing in the sunshine then I'll be on my way  
I will never love you the cost of love's too dear  
But though I'll never love you I'll stay with you one year  
And we can sing in the sunshine...  
I'll sing to you each morning I'll kiss you every night  
But darling don't cling to me I'll soon be out of sight  
But we can sing in the sunshine...  
My daddy he once told me hey don't you love you any man  
Just take what they may give you and give but what you can  
And you can sing in the sunshine you'll laugh every day  
You'll sing in the sunshine then be on your way  
Now when our year has ended and I have gone away  
You'll often speak about me and this is what you'll say  
Oh we sang in the sunshine you know we laughed every day  
We sang in the sunshine then she went on her way
