Baby, baby  
When we first met, I never felt something so strong  
You were like my lover and my best friend  
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it  
And all of a sudden you went and left  
I didn't know how to follow  
It's like a shock that spun me around  
And now my heart's dead  
I feel so empty and hollow  
  
And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you  
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?  
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back  
And you're the one to blame  
And now I feel like  
  
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking  
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking  
I should've never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now I'm using like I bleed  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like I checked into rehab  
And, baby, you're my disease  
It's like I checked into rehab  
And, baby, you're my disease  
I gotta check into rehab  
Cause, baby, you're my disease  
I gotta check into rehab  
Cause, baby, you're my disease  
  
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?  
You'd do anything for the one you love  
Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there  
It's like you were my favorite drug  
The only problem is that you was using me  
In a different way than I was using you  
But now that I know it's not meant to be  
It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you  
  
And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you  
You don't even recognize the way you hurt me, do you?  
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back  
And you're the one to blame  
Cause now I feel like  
  
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking  
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking  
I should've never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now I'm using like I bleed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Uh, uh, now, ladies, gimme that)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh  
(Uh, now gimme that)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh  
(My ladies, gimme that)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh  
(Uh, now gimme that)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking  
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking  
I should've never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now I'm using like I bleed  
  
[Chorus]
