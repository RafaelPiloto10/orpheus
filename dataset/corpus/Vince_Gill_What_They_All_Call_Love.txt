It ain't about you, it ain't about me  
It's about this love we found that has to be  
I never questioned that look in your eyes  
And you never doubted how I felt inside  
  
[Chorus]  
We found passion and grace in each others face  
And our heart's will now beat as one  
For we both know a place where our souls have embraced  
I think it's what they all call love  
  
This gift you've given humbles me  
True companions we'll always be  
For so long we've waited to feel what we feel  
We've finally tasted something that's real  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I think it's what they all call love
