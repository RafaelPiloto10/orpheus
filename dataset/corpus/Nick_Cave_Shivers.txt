I've been contemplating suicide,  
But it really doesn't suit my style.  
So I think I'll just act bored instead,  
And contain the blood I would've shed.  
  
She makes me feel so ill at ease,  
My heart is really on its knees.  
But I keep a poker face so well,  
That even mother couldn't tell.  
But my baby's so vain,  
She is almost a mirror.  
And the sound of her name,  
Sends a nervous shiver down my spine,  
Down my spine.  
  
I keep her photograph against my heart,  
For in my life she plays the starring part.  
Our love could hold off cigarettes,  
There's no room for cheap regrets.  
  
She makes me feel so ill at ease,  
My heart is really on its knees.  
But I keep a poker face so well,  
That even mother couldn't tell.  
But my baby's so vain,  
She is almost a mirror.  
And the sound of her name,  
Sends a nervous shiver down my spine,  
Down my spine.  
Down my spine,  
Down my spine,  
Down my spine.
