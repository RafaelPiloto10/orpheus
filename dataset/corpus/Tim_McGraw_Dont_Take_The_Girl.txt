Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'  
When he was eight years old  
  
Little girl came through the front gate  
Holdin' a fishin' pole  
His dad looked down and smiled  
He said, "We can't leave her behind"  
"Son, I know you don't want her to go  
But someday you'll change your mind"  
And Johnny said  
"Take Jimmy Johnson  
Take Tommy Thompson  
Take my best friend, Bo  
Take anybody that you want as  
Long as she don't go  
Take any boy in the world  
Daddy please, don't take the girl"  
  
Same old boy, same sweet girl  
Ten years down the road  
He held her tight and kissed her lips in  
Front of the picture show  
Stranger came and pulled a gun  
Grabbed her by the arm said  
"If you do what I tell you to  
There won't be any harm"  
And Johnny said "Take my money  
Take my wallet  
Take my credit cards  
Here's the watch that my Grandpa gave me  
Here's the key to my car  
Mister give it a whirl  
But please don't take the girl"  
  
Same old boy  
Same sweet girl  
Five years down the road  
There's gonna be a little one and she  
Says it's time to go  
Doctor says the baby's fine  
But you'll have to leave  
'Cause his momma's fading fast and  
Johnny hit his knees and there he prayed  
"Take the very breath you gave me  
Take the heart from my chest  
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me  
Make this my last request  
Take me out of this world  
God, please don't take the girl"  
  
Johnny's daddy  
Was taking him fishin'  
When he was eight years old
