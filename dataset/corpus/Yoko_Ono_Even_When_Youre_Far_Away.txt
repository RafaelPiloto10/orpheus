I wonder why  
I could never hate you  
Even when you look away,  
I always love you in my soul.  
It's just the way we happen to be,  
It's just the way it happens to be.  
We don't know how to love, love without fear.  
  
I tell you why  
I could never hate you  
Even when you're far away,  
I know you love me in your soul.  
It's just the way we happen to be,  
It's just the way it happens to be.  
We don't know how to love, love without fear.  
  
Part of me will always be with you,  
Part of you is growing in me.  
It's just the way we happen to be,  
It's just the way it happens to be.  
We don't know how to love, love without fear.  
  
We don't know how,  
How to tell each other,  
There's nothing we can do.  
I saw your soul and you saw mine.  
It's just the way we happen to be,  
It's just the way it happens to be.  
We always know inside our soul that love is there.
