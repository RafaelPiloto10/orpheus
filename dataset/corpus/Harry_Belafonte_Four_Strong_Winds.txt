Four strong winds that blow lonely  
Seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
But our good times are all gone  
And I'm bound for moving on  
I look for you if I'm ever back this way  
  
Think Ill go out to Alberta  
Weathers good there in the fall  
Got some friends I can go to working for  
Still I wish you change your mind  
If I asked you one more time  
But we've been through that a hundred times or more  
  
If I get there before the snow flies  
And if things are going good  
You could meet me if I send you down the fare  
But by then it would be winter  
ain't too much for you to do  
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
