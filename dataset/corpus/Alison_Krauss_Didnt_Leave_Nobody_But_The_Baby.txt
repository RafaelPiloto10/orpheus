Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Your mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay  
Didn't leave nobody but the baby  
  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Everybody's gone in the cotton and the corn  
Didn't leave nobody but the baby  
  
You're sweet little babe  
You're sweet little babe  
Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop  
Gonna' bring a bottle to the baby  
  
Don't you weep pretty babe  
Don't you weep pretty babe  
She's long gone with her red shoes on  
Gonna' need another lovin' baby  
  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
You and me and the Devil makes three  
Don't need no other lovin' baby  
  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones  
And be my ever-lovin' baby
