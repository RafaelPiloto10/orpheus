Solo-Mustaine  
Mean and infectious  
The evil Prophets rise  
Dance of the Macabre  
As witches Streak the sky  
Decadent worship of  
Black Magic sorcery  
In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon  
Trapped without a plea  
Solo-Mustaine  
  
See thing in agony  
Necrosis is the fate  
Pins sticking through the skin  
The venom now sedates  
Locked in a pillory  
Nowhere to be found  
Screaming for your life  
But no one hears a sound  
Help me  
Prepare the patients scalp  
To peel away  
Metal caps his ears  
He'll hear not what we say  
Solid steel visor  
Riveted cross his eyes  
Iron staples close his jaws  
  
So no one hears his cries  
The skull beneath the skin  
Now your drawn and quartered  
Your bones will make the x  
Symbol stands for poison  
And it's chained to your head  
And as we fold your arms  
To make the holy cross  
We cross the crucifix  
Religion has been lost  
The skull beneath the skin  
Solo-Mustaine
