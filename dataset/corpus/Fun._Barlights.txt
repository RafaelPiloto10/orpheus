Never in all of my life  
Have I seen eyes as empty as these streets of my city  
On a Saturday night,  
All the green of your eyes says "Go, leave it all behind."  
  
But I don't need to be reminded a change is gonna come.  
I can feel it on the tip of your tongue.  
  
And I feel alive.  
  
We met up once we'd settled the sun  
Between the heat and the work week  
The fear is we could use some sleep  
But sleep to the superfluous man means better use for beds  
And I'll bet I'm coming home alone tonight.  
  
I don't need to be reminded that this is how it was.  
I moved on, I passed a billboard down my block  
That asks if I've had enough, and aloud I say "I've had too much,"  
When the truth is, I'm just getting started.  
  
Now all the barlights are blinking in time  
To Mexican music, it's taunting the pavement  
And I feel alive.  
  
One of us sings, and one of us drinks,  
And one of us has nothing at all.  
So he calls us all sheep  
I'm the Little Bo Peep of the bunch.  
(I take their tales and I'm ready to go)  
The he swears he's gotta take this call  
Man, I get scared he's gonna leave us too soon.  
  
We were the get rich quick kids,  
We never got it right  
So we settled for the center of town  
Where all the rich white kids is out looking for a fight  
Got the blond one staring me down.  
And I really wanna take a swing  
I can't help but remember James Dean  
See we are part of the few who agree  
That hey, he lived life fast  
But he died.  
He died.  
He died.  
  
Me, I'm gonna live forever.  
  
Now all the barlights are blinking in time  
To Mexican music, it's taunting the pavement  
And for the first time  
In a long time  
I feel alive
