(Lea)  
I've been thinking  
It seems we're going nowhere  
You don't share my feelings  
It doesn't seem fair  
I guess there's nothing  
Much more I can do  
I know I've got to try  
And make it without you  
I don't love you anymore  
Can't you see, it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door  
There's nothing left to say  
I've gotta go my way  
Try and understand  
(Ariel)  
We've had bad times  
But that's no reason to go  
I can't live without you  
I need you, don't you know  
That I still love you  
Don't, don't do this to me  
You know I won't make it alone  
Can't you see  
(L) I don't love you anymore  
(A) Don't do this to me  
(L) Can't you see it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door  
(A) That's no reason to go  
(L) There's nothing left to say  
(A) I can't live without you  
(L) I 've gotta go my way  
(A) Oh no...  
(L) I don't love you anymore  
(A) Don't do this to me  
(L) Can't you see it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door  
(A) That's no reason to go  
(L) There's nothing left to say  
(A) I can't live without you  
(L) I 've gotta go my way  
Try and understand  
(A) Okay  
If there's no other way  
Then, go
