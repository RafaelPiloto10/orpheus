Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some people call me the gangster of love, yeah  
Some people walking round calling me Maurice  
'Cause I speak of the pompitous of love  
  
People talk about me, baby (People talk about me, bad to)  
They say I'm doin' you wrong, (doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong)  
Well, don't let that worry you baby (oh baby)  
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home  
(Everybody Singing Along)  
  
'Cause I'm a picker  
I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover  
And I'm a sinner  
I play the music in the sun  
  
I'm a joker  
I'm a smoker  
I'm a midnight toker  
I give my lovin' on the run  
  
You're the cutest thing  
That I ever did see  
I really love your peaches  
I want to shake your tree  
Lovey-dovey, dovey-lovey, dovey all the time

Cause I'm a picker  
I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover  
And I'm a sinner  
I play the music in the sun  
  
I'm a joker  
I'm a smoker  
I'm a midnight toker  
I sure don't want to hurt no one  
  
Come on and follow me  
You know I really want you for your company  
Even though I'm attached to you physically  
My computer mechanism wants you mentally  
(Shoo be doo be doo shoo be)  
You know I really want you for your company
