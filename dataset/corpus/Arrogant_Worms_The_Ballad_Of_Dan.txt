I'm out on the range, surveying the land  
Thinking of the job that's to be done  
My life is hard but I don't mind  
Men like me, that's how the west was won  
I stand the pain and the suffering  
For on the trail I am the king  
On doors I knock and on bells I ring  
Always sure that I will get the sale  
  
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!  
  
The door swings wide and I sense my prey  
Ready to fall victim to my pitch  
I tell him all about the plan  
With all of its inherent benefits  
If you lose an arm it's a thousand bucks  
Lose both of them and get twice as much  
And if you should die, well then, bless your luck  
You'll just be raking in the cash  
  
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!  
  
The sucker signs, the deed is done  
It's time for me to get back on the road  
A lonely man out on the land  
Where the wind can blow so cold  
I ride into the setting sun  
With the knowledge of a job well done  
But I can't rest until everyone  
Has become properly insured  
  
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!  
  
Yes, I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
For on the dotted line I make them sign
