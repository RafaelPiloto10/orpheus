Time may take us apart, but I will still love you, I promise.  
And when the stars, stars are falling  
I'll keep calling  
I promise that you'll be my one, my only everything  
  
I'll never be untrue  
And I promise that for all your love I will do anything  
I will give you the stars, I will buy you the moon  
Even through the longest of our nights  
  
And even through the darkest days  
Our love will find a way  
  
[Chorus]  
And when the stars are falling  
I'll keep calling  
I will still love you  
And when your dreams are fading  
I'll be waiting  
I will still love you  
  
You were my summer breeze, my winter sun, my  
Springtime soul (springtime soul), my autumn touch of gold Yeah  
And you were my sky, my rain, the earth in which my love goes strong  
The smile of my heart and the breath of my soul  
  
Even if we find ourselves apart  
We will hold our hopes and dreams  
Forever in our hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me how you feel  
I finally know how love feels  
Tell me if its real  
And my heart tells me its real  
So real, So real  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Time may take us apart, that's true  
But I will always be there for you  
You're in my heart, you'll be in my dreams  
No matter how many miles we've seen  
  
I promise you that I won't forget  
The day we kissed or the day we met  
The sky may fall and the stars may tilt  
But I will still, I will still Love you  
  
[Chorus]
