Explorers and soldiers  
  
Searching and fighting  
To learn, to realize  
  
Straight through our soul  
With invisible thread  
The pieces undone  
Are whole now instead  
  
The fight we're in  
Has already been won  
  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come  
  
Your story was made of  
Beauty and soul  
We're closer to heaven  
Than we'll ever know  
  
Woven in time  
  
To breathe and create  
A sacred thing  
  
The fight we're in  
Has already been won  
  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come
