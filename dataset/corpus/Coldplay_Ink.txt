Got a tattoo that says "2gether thru life"  
Carved in your name with my pocket knife  
And you wonder when you wake up, will it be alright  
Feels like there's something broken inside  
  
All I know, all I know  
Is that I'm lost whenever you go  
All I know is that I love you so  
So much that it hurts  
  
Got a tattoo and the pains alright  
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
All I know, all I know  
Is that I'm lost in your fire below  
  
All I know  
Is that I love you so  
So much that it hurts  
  
See the road begin to climb  
See your stars begin to shine  
I see your colors and I'm dying of thirst  
  
All I know is that I love you so  
So much that it hurts  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  
So much that it hurts
