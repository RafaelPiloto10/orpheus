Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen  
Tonight we'll put all other things aside  
Get in this time and show me some affection  
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night  
  
I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you  
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough  
And if you move real slow I let it go  
  
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it  
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it  
And I know I know I know I know I know I want you  
  
We shouldn't even think about tomorrow  
Sweet memories will last for long long time  
We'll have a good time, Baby, don't do worry  
And if we're still playin' around boy that's just fine  
  
Let's get excited, we just can't hide it  
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it  
I know I know I know I know I know I want you, I want you  
  
I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you  
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough  
And if you move real slow I let it go  
  
I'm so excited, I just can't hide it  
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it  
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it  
I know I know I know I know I know I want you
