Taken away  
The fact that I care about you  
Just your way  
So sweet  
Everything seems right around you  
Did you know that you  
have this kind of way about you  
When you touch  
I want to know if I can be your girl  
  
[Chorus]  
The one who puts her arms around you  
The one who lays her head besides you  
The one who listens when you need it  
When no one sees, I can see it  
The one who knows when something's wrong  
The one who knows your favorite song  
The one who all your family loves  
The one you place the one above  
  
I'm happy to say  
In a lot of ways you changed me  
Makes me smile  
When you said you were glad  
The day you found me  
I'm wishin' a way  
Any harm that may ever find you  
Heaven knows  
I really feel I'll always be your girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your girl, your girl  
Your girl, your girl  
  
I just want to be  
The one that's true to you  
I just want to be  
The one that's makes you smile  
I just want to be  
The one that holds you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The one that's true to you  
Down for ya  
The one that makes you smile  
And laughs with ya  
The one that holds you down  
I'm there for ya  
The one, the one  
The one, the one  
  
The one that's true to you  
Down for ya  
The one that makes you smile  
And laughs with ya  
The one that holds you down  
I'm there for ya  
The one, the one  
The one, the one  
  
The one that's true to you  
The one that makes you smile  
The one that holds you down  
  
The one, the one  
The one, the one  
  
The one that's true to you  
The one that makes you smile  
The one that holds you down  
  
The one, the one  
The one, the one  
  
I can be anything you need
