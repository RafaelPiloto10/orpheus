The new kid he's got money  
The money I deserve  
I should be rolling in it  
I've been a working stiff  
As for the justice  
No one knows where it went  
  
I'm gonna toil away  
Until my judgment day  
I will be rewarded for the good things I did  
Believe me every year  
There is another one here  
Don't you see I used to be the new kid?  
I am sorry to say, you'll get carried away  
Oh you will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
I'll tell you again  
Don't get too settled in  
You will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
  
the new kid he's got my girl  
The girl I used to have  
He's got the looks  
You know, got them from his dad  
I should be kissin' that girl  
We should be so in love  
There is no justice  
There's just dark stars above  
  
I'm gonna toil away  
Until my judgment day  
I will be rewarded for the good things I did  
Believe me every year, there is another one here  
Don't you see I used to be the new kid?  
Believe me every year  
There is another one here  
Don't you see I used to be the new kid?  
I am sorry to say  
You'll get carried away  
Oh you will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
I'll tell you again  
Don't get too settled in  
Oh you will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
By the new kid  
By the new kid  
By the new kid  
By the new kid
