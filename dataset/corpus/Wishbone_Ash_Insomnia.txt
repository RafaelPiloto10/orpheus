You done someone wrong  
Your karma has come  
To settle the score with you  
You're sneaking, you're crawling  
Into the ground  
Eyes open wide and blue  
  
Insomnia  
Closer, but no closer  
Insomnia  
Closer, but no closer  
  
The night you were laid  
You had it made  
When everyone fell into place  
Higher and higher  
Too fast to miss a beat  
Body and bones as well  
  
Insomnia  
Burning like a hell  
Insomnia  
  
Oh, burning, yes, burning like a hell  
Where does it come from  
Where does it go  
Throwing over your sleep?  
Walking and talking  
Dancing 'till dawn  
  
Insomnia  
Waiting to get you  
Insomnia  
Waiting to get you.  
  
Waiting to, waiting to get you, inso...  
Waiting to, waiting to get you, inso...  
Don't let it, don't let it, inso...  
Don't let it, don't let it  
Don't let it get you
