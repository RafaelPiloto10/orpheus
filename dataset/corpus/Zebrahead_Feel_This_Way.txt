I'm up and I'm alright  
Push on with all my might  
Got to find a way to get away today  
  
Because I am the man  
What?  
I am the man  
What?  
Who's the man  
Try to front like you want to try and understand  
But you don't know man  
Through the times that we shared  
I know that you care  
And I know you  
  
And I'll go where you want to go cause I feel this way  
And I care what you got to say cause I feel this way  
So I stepped up and I said I just don't understand  
He said just come and check it out man  
  
I'm up and I feel fine  
I won't drop till I get mine  
I got to find a way to get away today  
  
Because I am the man  
What?  
I am the man  
What?  
Who's the man?  
Try to front like you want to try to understand  
But you don't know man  
Through the times that we shared  
You know that I care  
Cause I know you  
  
Here we go  
Hip hop nation, vibe affiliation  
All that I need is mind emancipation  
Got to find a way to get away  
Got to find something to make me want to stay  
Cause all that I see is jaded  
Now I can't even see straight cause I'm faded  
Stressed cause of strain and you know that I'm leaving today  
And I care what you say, but I feel this way
