A lovestruck Romeo sings a street suss serenade  
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made  
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade  
Says something like you and me babe how about it?  
  
Juliet says hey it's Romeo you nearly gave me a heart attack  
He's underneath the window she's singing hey now my boyfriend's back  
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that  
Anyway what you gonna do about it?  
  
Juliet the dice were loaded from the start  
And I bet and you exploded in my heart  
And I forget I forget the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?  
  
Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame  
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same  
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real  
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  
  
Well you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold  
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold  
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin, yeah  
Now you just say oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die  
There's a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?  
  
I can't do the talk like they talk on TV  
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be  
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you  
I can't do anything except be in love with you  
  
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be  
All I do is keep the beat and bad company  
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme  
Juliet I'd do the stars with you any time  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die  
There's a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?
