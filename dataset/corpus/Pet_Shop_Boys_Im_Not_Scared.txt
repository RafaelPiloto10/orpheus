Your life's a mystery, mine is an open book  
If I could read your mind, I think I'd take a look  
I don't care  
Baby, I'm not scared  
  
What have you got to fight? What do you need to prove?  
You're always telling lies, and that's the only truth  
I don't care  
Baby, I'm not scared  
  
Tonight the streets are full of actors  
I don't know why  
Oh, take these dogs away from me  
Before they, they bite  
  
What have you got to say of shadows in your past?  
I thought that, if you paid, you'd keep them off our backs  
But I don't care  
Baby, I'm not scared  
  
What have you got to hide? Who will it compromise?  
Where do we have to be, so I can laugh and you'll be free?  
I'd go anywhere  
Baby, I don't care  
I'm not scared  
I don't care  
Baby, I'm not scared  
  
Tonight the streets are full of actors  
I don't know why  
Oh, take these dogs away from me  
Before they, they bite  
Tonight I fought and made my mind up  
I know it's right  
I know these dogs still snap around us  
But I can, I can fight  
  
If I was you, if I was you  
I wouldn't treat me the way you do  
If I was you, if I was you  
I wouldn't treat me the way you do - you  
If I was you, if I was you  
I wouldn't treat me the way you do  
If I was you, if I was you  
I wouldn't treat me the way you do - you  
  
I'm not scared  
Baby, I don't care  
I'd go anywhere  
Baby, I'm not scared  
I'm not scared  
Oh, I'm not scared
