I saw you looking in the mirror  
I saw you fighting with your conscious  
I think you need a little time away  
And I may give you mine  
  
And you could find me in the moon glow  
You find me underneath your pillow  
And we can find a little hideaway  
Where we can go  
  
I'm in the corner with a friend of mine  
I stood with my defenses down  
So many things that bring you close to me  
That we be led astray, the wonder of desire  
To love the things we cannot touch  
  
Maybe we turn and say goodnight and walk away  
And then the story can go on without a single tear  
You take a chance on it and change the history  
And for a time, we fall in love with someone  
  
So who am I to say the words that say  
We have found each other?  
Can we imagine any hideaway is right?  
And our adventure down in paradise  
Borne upon the wind and we are one with the night  
  
Maybe we shuffle off to Rio  
A little Rio de Janeiro  
And then I get a little chance to say  
I'm falling into you  
  
(One)  
And you and I can change the world if we just try  
(Hideaway)  
This lonely heart of mine has found a mission for your light  
(In your world)  
To make the sense of it and solve the mystery  
(In my arms)  
It's just the love you forever leave with someone  
  
(One)  
So who am I to say the words  
That say we've found each other?  
(Sunny day)  
Can we imagine any hideaway is right?  
(In your world)  
And our adventure down in paradise  
(In my arms)  
Born upon the wind and we are one with the night  
  
And our adventure down in paradise  
Borne upon the wind  
And we are one with the night
