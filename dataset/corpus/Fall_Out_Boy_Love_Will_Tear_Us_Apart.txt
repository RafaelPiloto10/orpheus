When routine bites hard  
And ambitions are low  
And resentment rides high  
But emotions won't grow  
And we're changing our ways  
Taking different roads  
Love, love will tear us apart  
Again, again, again, again  
  
Why is this bedroom so cold  
Turned away on your side?  
Is my timing that flawed  
Our respect run so dry?  
Yet there's still this appeal  
That we've kept through  
Our lives  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Love, love will tear us apart again  
  
You cry out in your sleep  
All my failings exposed  
There's a taste in my mouth  
As desperation takes hold  
Just that something so good  
Just can't function more  
  
[Repeat: x7]  
Love, love will tear us apart again
