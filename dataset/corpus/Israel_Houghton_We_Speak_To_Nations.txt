Hear the sound  
The sound of the nations calling  
Hear the sound  
The sound of the fatherless crying  
Who will go for us  
Who will shout to the corners  
Of the earth  
That Christ is King  
  
CHORUS  
We speak to nations  
Be open  
We speak to nations  
Fall on your knees  
We speak to nations  
The kingdom is coming near to you  
Oh we speak to strongholds  
Be broken  
Power of darkness  
You have to flee  
We speak to nations  
The kingdom is coming near to you  
We speak to you  
Be free be free  
  
Hear the sound  
The sound of the nations worshipping  
Hear the sound  
Of sons and daughters singing  
We will go for you  
We will shout to the corners of the earth  
That Christ is King
