You were just a twinkle in your teenage mother's eyes  
I was squeezing brylcreem on my hair  
No one taught us how to be politically correct  
And no one told our winkles what to wear  
I've been there, I've done it  
I've seen it all  
That was my contribution oh, oh  
So much for the revolution  
When someone said, "Let's go to bed" nobody was scared  
We were up to no good all the time  
(We were up to no good all the time)  
Judging by those freckles and the shades upon your nose  
It's possible you could be one of mine  
(Possible you could be one of mine)  
Yeah  
I've been there, I've done it  
I've seen it all  
That was my revolution  
On the road again, back at number ten  
Underneath the lights a thousand and one nights  
A revolution for fun  
Oh, you better lock up your mum  
I've been there, I've done it  
Well, I've seen them come and go  
That's for you to guess  
And that's for me to know, oh baby  
And that's for you to guess and that's for me to know  
Ah, so much for revolution, ah so much for revolution  
And that was my revolution, oh revolution  
That was my revolution
