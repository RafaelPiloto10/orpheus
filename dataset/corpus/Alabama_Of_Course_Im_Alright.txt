Why do you ask of course I'm alright  
I guess I wasn't thinking I'd run into you tonight  
Do I seem surprised, I guess you caught me off guard  
Yes I'm really doing fine, no it hasn't been that hard  
  
How 'bout you, getting on with your life  
There's so much to tell you, that I won't even try  
My, its good to see you, how long has it been  
I must admit I think about you every now and then  
  
Like when I open my eyes, when I lay down at night  
Every moment ever since the day you said goodbye  
But you'll never know 'cause I keep it inside  
How am I doing without you, of course I'm alright  
  
Well to tell you the truth, I guess I have felt better  
God just look at you, wow  
You make it look so easy, I can see it on yout face  
Everything we used to be is gone without a trace  
  
If you want to know, right now I'm sinking fast  
Girl you always could see right behind this mask  
But I won't give it away, gonna keep it inside  
How am I doing without you, of course I'm alright  
  
If you don't want to know the truth, of course I'm alright
