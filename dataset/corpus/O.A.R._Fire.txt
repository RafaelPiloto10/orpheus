Going on forever was never the plan,  
I'm just passing minutes staring down to my hands  
Man I gotta sing it, steal my heart, it can rest  
And something started burning in the back of my chest.  
  
All I ever asked for was a shot at the life,  
And when you gave it to me, must have started a fire.  
Burning for you..  
  
Fire  
Come on in and light up my heart  
Come on in and burn through my soul  
Come on turn the heat up  
Pick your feet up  
And let it burn.  
  
I know you got my back, oh I won't let you down  
Something 'bout these alleyways just turns me around.  
Could've been a night in a fight with the dark,  
Or maybe I'm a broken-heart in Battery Park.  
  
And all I ever asked for was a shot in the dark,  
And when you showed it to me, must've lit up a spark  
Burning for you..  
  
Fire  
Come on in and light up my heart  
Come on in and burn through my soul  
Come on turn the heat up  
Pick your feet up  
Sayin' ohhhh-ooh-oh  
  
Fire is burning in every one of us,  
Every one of us all.  
I wish I knew,  
How it was all so real.  
It was just too soon.  
  
Oh I got, somethings got to give  
I feel it inside, burning me out, the fire is real.  
Oh, you know, something's got to give.  
So bring down your walls,  
Down with 'em all,  
Let 'em fall.  
  
After we all started to crawl,  
The fire was real.  
After we all started to crawl,  
The fire was real.  
Looking away won't save the day,  
The fire is real.  
Inside us all, thousand feet tall,  
The fire is real.  
  
Fiiiiiire.  
  
Fire  
Come on in and light up my heart  
Come on in and burn through my soul  
Come on turn the heat up  
Pick your feet up  
Sayin' ohhhh-ooh-oh  
Fire is burning in every one of us.  
Sayin' ohhhh-ooh-oh  
Fire is burning in every one of us, every one of us
