You said we girls but all the while, you look at my  
Man with a funny smile. Now I don't look it might be me,  
But ain't no need to bump so tightly.  
  
That night we all hanging at the club. You tell mr. d.j.  
Wanna rub a dub. When I don't look you a chance to ask my  
Man to come and dance.  
  
What me and he have got is solid as a rock, so take your shot.  
Don't even waste your time.  
Cause a love like ours is hard to find.  
(Oh oh oh oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
(OH) Cause he's got me singing that la la la  
(Oh) our love is strong yes it's keeping me fortified.  
(Oh) Oh yes he keep it rocking like la la la  
(Sing) (Oh oh oh oh) Ladies get it right, better get it right  
(Oh) He's got me singing that la la la  
(Oh) So fall back, don't be hit and you can't deny.  
(Oh) Oh, yes, he keep it rocking like la la la  
(Sing) (oh oh oh oh) Ladies get it right, better get it right  
  
I hope you take this as a lesson learned. This ain't that  
Kind of party so just let it burn. The next time you see me  
Act like you know. I don't play those games or tell no palor jokes  
  
What me and he have got is solid as a rock, so take your shot.  
Don't even waste your time.  
Cause a love like ours is hard to find.  
(Oh oh oh oh)
