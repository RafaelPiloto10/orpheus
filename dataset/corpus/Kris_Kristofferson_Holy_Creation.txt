So many questions  
So many answers  
So many reasons  
Most of them wrong  
  
Facing the future  
With the faith of my father  
I let a stranger  
Into my home  
  
And right there before me  
I saw it happen  
There's no denying  
Nothing's the same  
  
The truth is a highway  
Leading to freedom  
All is forgiven  
Love is to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
And I've seen him hold her  
With his head on her shoulder  
Singing her love songs  
Soft as her smile  
Tender affection  
Under the rainbow  
Holy Creation  
Mother and child  
  
I know the story  
I read the papers  
I see the anger  
I feel it too  
  
But when I see the wonder  
In the smiles of my children  
It reminds me of dreams  
Worth coming true  
  
[Chorus]
