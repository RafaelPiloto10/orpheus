Never mind he whispered in my ear  
Could have been anyone's mistake  
Let's just press rewind from here  
Call it quits for time's sake  
  
Ring me twice then I'll know you need me  
Call me back right away  
Somebody told me you've been thieving  
You're losing sight of the light  
  
Wanna know wanna know why you're breaking even  
Wanna know wanna know why you're breaking down  
  
From now on you'll sleep with one eye open  
Keep your credit up hardly leave the house  
They'll find you anywhere you're hiding  
I see you won't get out  
  
Wanna know wanna know why you're breaking even  
Wanna know wanna know why you're breaking down  
  
Back home  
You're found out  
Back home  
You're found  
  
Now you're back home  
You're found out  
Back home  
You're found
