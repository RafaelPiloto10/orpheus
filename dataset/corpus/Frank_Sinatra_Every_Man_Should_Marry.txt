Every man should marry, every girl should wed,  
You will find no truer words ever have been said.  
Every man is sentimental, he's just a dreamer at heart,  
He needs someone soft and gentle to give his dream a start.  
I don't know how to tell you, don't know what to say,  
Something has come over me, since you came my way.  
  
Yes, I'm plain old-fashioned, old-fashioned as can be,  
Every man should marry, won't you marry me?  
Don't know how to tell you, I don't know what to say,  
Something has come over me, since you came my way.  
Guess I'm plain old-fashioned, old-fashioned as can be,  
Every man should marry, won't you marry me?
