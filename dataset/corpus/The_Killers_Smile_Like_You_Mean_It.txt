Save some face, you know you've only got one  
Change your ways while you're young  
Boy, one day you'll be a man  
Oh girl, he'll help you understand  
  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
  
Looking back at sunsets on the East side  
We lost track of the time  
Dreams aren't what they used to be  
Some things sat by so carelessly  
  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
  
And someone is calling my name  
From the back of the restaurant  
And someone is playing a game  
In the house that I grew up in  
And someone will drive her around  
Down the same streets that I did  
On the same streets that I did  
  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
  
Oh no, oh no no no  
Oh no, oh no no no
