I don't buy what I make, don't give but I take it from  
You.  
Well the most that I want is all you've got and that's  
True.  
I can help you along with a smile and a song, oh yeah.  
But you're out on your own and you ain't gonna get  
Nowhere.  
  
Chorus  
Are you man enough, are you man enough,  
Are you man enough for me?  
Are you man enough, are you man enough  
Are you man enough for me?  
  
Sweet smell of success sure got you into a mess,  
But the smoke in your eyes don't tell you no lies.  
Now it's plain to see that were gonna stay number one,  
It ain't just for money, no, you know that we do it for  
Fun.  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus to fade
