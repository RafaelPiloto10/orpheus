You and I don't need an introduction  
Neither one of us has that much to lose  
'Cause you're just a sister to satisfaction  
And I'm just a brother to the blues  
  
Now, I don't have to tell you nights are lonely  
There's a hunger in our eyes that tells the news  
And you're just a sister to satisfaction  
And I'm just a brother to the blues  
  
It's hard to tell exactly which direction  
We might go at any given time  
It's just a constant search for affection  
And we need all the comfort we can find  
  
I know you can feel this attraction  
From a night of love that both of us could use  
'Cause you're just a sister to satisfaction  
And I'm just a brother to the blues  
  
Yes, you're just a sister to satisfaction  
And I'm just a brother to the blues...
