[Chorus:]  
Know, don't you want to know, don't you want to know,  
Know, who's that man?  
[Repeat]  
[Verse One (Kandi):]  
He's got a different little style than other men today,  
He does his thing with a swing.  
And everything you see him do is in a different way,  
You never ever seen before.  
[Bridge (LaTocha):]  
He's not your ordinary slick uptown type of brother,  
Don't think twice 'cause you'll never find another.  
Because the man behind the mask,  
You've never ever seen him before.  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Verse Two:]  
[All]  
He's got the flava to do his his thang,  
He's got something everybody wish they had,  
[Kandi]  
And something tells me you don't want to make him mad,  
No you don't, no you don't, no you don't.  
[Repeat Bridge and Chorus]  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Repeat Verse One, Bridge and Chorus]  
[Repeat Chorus to fade]
