Here I stand.  
Looking in your eyes, I'm an open book.  
Shatter heart is all I have to give,  
And that's what you took.  
Feels so good, that I can't say goodbye.  
Watching time, fly by.  
Will it stop if I close my eyes?  
  
If I could, make a moment last forever.  
This would be the one I choose.  
You and me here together.  
Feels so right, feels so true.  
Every star, let to you, shine so bright.  
No one's gonna sleep tonight.  
No, no one's gonna sleep tonight.  
  
From the start,  
I knew that we'd be here dancing in the dark.  
Feel the spark,  
You can sign your name right across my heart.  
It's so good,  
I just want you to stay.  
Tell me why, we feel,  
It's never gonna go away.  
  
If I could, make a moment last forever.  
This would be the one I choose.  
You and me here together.  
Feels so right, feels so true.  
Every star, let to you, shine so bright.  
No one's gonna sleep tonight.  
No, no one's gonna sleep tonight.  
  
All my life I've waited.  
Afraid to surrender.  
Always gone whatever.  
Now I'm wondering  
  
If I could, make a moment last forever.  
This would be the one I choose.  
You and me here together.  
Feels so right, feels so true.  
Every star, let to you, shine so bright.  
No one's gonna sleep tonight.  
No, no one's gonna sleep tonight.  
  
Tonight (Can you hear me)  
Tonight (Can you hear me)  
No one's gonna sleep tonight  
(Can you hear me)  
No one's gonna sleep tonight
