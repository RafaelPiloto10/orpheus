Rows and flows of angel hair  
And ice cream castles in the air  
And feather canyons everywhere  
I've looked at clouds that way  
  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain and they snow on everyone  
So so many things I would've done  
But clouds got in my way  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and junes and ferris wheels  
The dizzy dancing way that you feel  
As every fairy tale comes real  
I've looked at love that way  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know love  
Really don't know love at all  
  
But now it's just another show  
and you leave em laughing when you go  
and if you can don't let them know  
Don't give yourself away  
  
Angel dust gets in your eyes, your hair  
On acid stars you're getting there  
My body's assembled into  
A little itty-bitty gift to you  
When you die, I've looked at life that way  
  
But now it's just another show  
You leave em laughing when you go  
So so don't let them inside, don't let them know  
Don't give yourself ohh away  
  
But now my friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads man, they say I've changed, well  
Well, something's lost, rearranged  
From living every, every, every, I've  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's just illusions I recall  
  
I really don't know, I really don't know  
I really don't know, I really don't know  
I really don't, I really don't clouds at all  
Why are we here.... Terrified, terrified, wow
