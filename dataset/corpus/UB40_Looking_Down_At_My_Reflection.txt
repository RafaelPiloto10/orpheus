Looking down at my reflection  
In the puddle at my feet  
Things don't seem so real down there  
Or maybe I don't see  
  
I see no starvation  
I don't see any pain  
I see myself not helping  
Just a loner in the rain  
  
Looking down at my reflection  
In the puddle in the ground  
Things are getting clearer now  
I can see a thunder cloud  
  
I see gross injustice  
I see evil men  
I see myself repeating  
The same old words again  
  
Looking down at my reflection  
In the puddle lying there  
Now I decide to change my mind  
And show the world I care  
  
I care about my fellow man  
Being taken for a ride  
I care that things start changing  
But there's no one on my side
