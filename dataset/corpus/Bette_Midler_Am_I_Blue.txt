I'm just a woman, a lonely woman,  
waiting on the weary shore.  
I'm just a woman who's only human,  
one you should feel sorry for.  
Well, I woke up this morning a long about dawn.  
Without a warning I found that he was gone.  
Why did he do it? How could he do it?  
He'd never done it before.  
Am I blue. Am I blue.  
Ain't these tears in these eyes tellin' you?  
Oh, am I blue? Well, I bet you would be, too,  
if each plan with your man done fell through.  
There was a time I was his only one.  
but now I'm the sad and lonely one.  
Was I gay 'til today?  
But now that man is gone,  
he's gone and we are through.  
Am I blue.  
There was a time I was his only one.  
But now, a, now, now, now, I'm the sad and lonely one.  
Oh god, I'm lonely.  
But I remember, oh, I remember when I was gay.  
That was up until today,  
'cause now that man is gone, he's gone and we are through.  
Am I, am I, well, would you believe it if I told you I'm blue?
