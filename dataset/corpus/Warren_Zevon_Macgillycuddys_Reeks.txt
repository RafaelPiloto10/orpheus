She stood beside my narrow bed  
To check my E.K.G.  
She shook her pretty little head  
At what's become of me  
  
I thought I glimpsed a path that led  
Through rhododendron days  
And fuchsia nights to the boat-shed  
In which we two once lay  
  
But she gazed only at my chart  
The valleys and the peaks  
Brought back the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
But she gazed only at my chart  
The valleys and the peaks  
Brought back the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
I saw her on Killarney's shore  
One morning in July  
When I still thought I was a thorn  
Trying to find a side  
  
I met her in the little launch  
That runs to Innisfallen  
Hunched together, haunch to haunch  
Trying to keep my balance  
  
But she upset my applecart  
She kissed me on the cheek  
And I was struck by Cupid's dart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
I was struck by Cupid's dart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
She was a systems analyst  
For a dot com company  
She said, "You think because we've kissed  
I'll be yours eternally  
  
I'll sign another pre-nup  
And we'll merge our P.L.C.s  
that's why most girls go belly-up  
In this economy  
  
But when it comes to a jump start  
Your forecast's pretty bleak  
The NASDAQ goes by dips and starts  
Like Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
The NASDAQ goes by dips and starts  
Like Macgillycuddy's Reeks"  
  
She looked only at my chart  
The valleys and the peaks  
Brought back the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
Macgillycuddy's Reeks  
That was the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddy's Reeks
