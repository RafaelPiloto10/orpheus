Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let is snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear we're still goodbye-ing  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let snow, let it snow  
  
Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
Oh the lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Oh, let it snow  
  
All the way home I'll be warm  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear I'm still goodbye-ing  
As long you love me so  
  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let is snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
