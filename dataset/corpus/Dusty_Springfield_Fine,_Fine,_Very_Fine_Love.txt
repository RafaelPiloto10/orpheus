I never knew how good love could be  
All I'd ever known was make believe  
So many times Ive played the fool  
Baby, til I met you  
Now everything has fallen in place  
You can tell by the smile on my face  
For every lonely tear that Ive cried  
I'm that much satisfied  
  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
You know it when you find one  
Shining like a diamond  
  
Its so fine, fine, very fine love  
How did I ever live without your love?  
Its the only thing I'm certain of  
No matter what I'm going through  
I know I can count on you  
  
You are more precious to me every day  
Life is better now in every way  
You don't have to lay the world at my feet  
You have made my world complete  
  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love, oh, oh  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
You know it when you find one  
Shining like a diamond  
Its so fine, so fine, very fine love  
  
Ive got no apprehensions  
You've got the best intentions  
We've got a, we've got a, we've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
A very fine  
A very fine love  
Very fine love, ah, ha, ooh, hoo  
So fine, hey, so fine  
So good, so good love
