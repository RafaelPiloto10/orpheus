If I could ever say it right  
And reach your hostage heart despite  
The doubts you harbor then you might  
Come to believe in me  
  
The life I lead is not the kind  
That gives a woman peace of mind  
I only hope someday you'll find  
That you can believe in me  
  
Those other loves that came before  
Mean nothing to me anymore  
But you can never be quite sure  
And will not believe in me  
  
Too many hearts have been broken  
Failing to trust what they feel  
But trust isn't something that's spoken  
And love's never wrong when it's real  
  
If I could only do one thing  
Then I would try to write and sing  
A song that ends your questioning  
And makes you believe in me  
  
And makes you believe in me  
Oh, you can believe in me
