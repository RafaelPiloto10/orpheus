Danger eyes like mine scan the room  
No one over the line gets out alive.  
Pieces of insincerity  
Are like the stuff upon which we feed.  
Do I feed you?  
  
It goes on and on, this insanity,  
The game of us and them we play.  
On and on admit that we like it this way.  
  
I'm upside down, inside out for you.  
No matter what goes down, I'll still be there for you.  
  
They say that like attracts like, we're one and the same.  
To say you're one of my kind is to say,  
We don't take the blame.  
The box that all others find they need,  
To make themselves more than they seem,  
Only makes them scream.  
  
It goes on and on, this insanity,  
The game of us and them we play.  
On and on admit that we like it this way.  
  
I'm upside down, inside out for you.  
No matter what goes down, I'll still be there for you.  
  
We've seen the sun setting in their eyes.  
It could be worse, it could be us.  
Not another life time without you  
  
I'm upside down, inside out for you.  
No matter what goes down, I'll still be there for you.  
  
I'm upside down, inside out, upside down, inside out.
