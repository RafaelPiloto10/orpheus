Just when I thought that it never could happen to me  
He touched me and feelings that never have stirred in me  
Ever like this  
Are in his kiss  
  
[Chorus]  
Heart where are you taking me  
What will you make of me  
Is this the real thing  
And heart could he be paradise  
Cause in his eyes  
Do I see love looking at me  
  
Maybe I'm crazy  
For believing it's different this time  
Oh am I ready to feel what I've dreamed about  
Love that I've lived without finding  
Is finding me  
  
[Chorus]
