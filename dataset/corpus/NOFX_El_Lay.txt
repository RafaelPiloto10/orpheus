Get out of my way,  
Can't you see I'm from LA?  
Yeah, I met Slash, I've got a rose tattoo  
I bet I know way more people than you  
  
I just love this town,  
My girlfriend weighs 84 pounds  
Met her at the Cat house where I get in for free  
She pays the rent while I watch T.V.  
  
When we go out tonight,  
Gotta get my hair just right  
Tight black pants a blue suede shoes  
I'll get my picture in Rock City News  
  
Gotta get those flyers out  
Might meet a talent scout  
And he will talk contracts with me  
My fame and fortune and MTV
