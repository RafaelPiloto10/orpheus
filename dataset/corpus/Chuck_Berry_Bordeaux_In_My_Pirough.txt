So long, Jean, got a little show, thanks for the Bordeaux  
I got to go, push my pirough way down the bayou  
They got a band up on the stand and a beautiful light show  
Au revoir, Jean, dig the show from up on the plateau  
In my pirough, with my Bordeaux, out on the bayou  
Creeping along, singing a song, see'est, see'est bon, bon  
Playing the music on my acoustic Spanish guitaro  
Having a duet with my coquette out on the bayou  
It's growing night, we've got no lights out on the bayou  
Beautiful trip, think we'll sip some of my Bordeaux  
Two more miles going wild to play my acoustic  
See them stand to clap their hands to hear my music  
One more mile, we rested awhile and sipped on some Bordeaux  
While we's grooving, a fog was moving in on the bayou  
On my knee, just couldn't see the front of my pirough  
We didn't mind, we just reclined and sipped some more Bordeaux  
Ay-ay, Jean, I missed the show up on the plateau  
Si vous plait, push my pirough back up the bayou  
No see the band, no see the stand, no see the light show  
Ahh, Jean, we had a show out on the bayou
