Out on the edge  
I've been drifting in darkness lately  
Carrying a heart so confused  
Standing on the ledge  
You still hold me when life gets crazy  
Where should I be without You and Your  
Chorus  
Irresistible love  
That is saving me  
I've been running I know  
Irresistible love is amazing me  
You touch my soul  
Only You can make me whole  
Can't turn away  
From love that is all around me  
Melting the hardest hearts  
So overwhelmed with a mercy  
That sought and found me  
I should've known from the start  
It's Your  
Chorus  
Bridge  
I'm captivated by the way You  
Reach for me so faithfully  
It's Your  
Chorus
