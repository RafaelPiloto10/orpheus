There's a time when the heart can no longer give in  
You try to stand up and fight  
You've known pain for so long and you know what's gone wrong  
But you can't make it right  
Another broken heart is all you're feeling  
How can you go on  
But the memories of the times there was love in your eyes  
Keep leading me on  
(Chorus)  
If it were you  
Would you hold on and hope that it might  
Bring back the dreams we once knew  
Or just give up forever that part of your life  
Tell me what would you do  
If it were you  
You can never take back all you've given in love  
No matter how hard you try  
Once it's over and done you just have to let go  
Though a part of you died  
Another waste of time is all that's left now  
But life must go on  
All the nights that we spent, never thought they would end  
Why can't they go on  
(Chorus)  
If it were you  
Would you hold on and hope that it might  
Bring back the love we once knew  
Or just give up forever that part of your life  
Tell me what would you do  
If it were you  
If it were you  
Tell me what would you do  
If it were you  
Over and over I go back through time  
Didn't we promise our love till we die  
Asking you deep down inside  
Did we really try  
Another broken heart is all that's left  
But life must go on  
All the nights that we spent, never thought they would end  
Why can't they go on  
(Chorus)
