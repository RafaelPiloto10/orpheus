To your brother, to your sister, to your misses, to your mister.  
To your friends, to your foes, give the love around and back around it goes.  
It all comes from the top and it spreads right round  
Treat a man wrong he's gonna pass it on down  
To the next in line, who's probably his wife bringing up his kids  
Now watchin' mamma cry  
And they pick it up, cause they learn everything  
Life has a funny way of going in a ring,  
End up growing up in trouble with the law  
Standing in the cuffs that the father once wore  
Now it seems that every brand new generation  
Have all been growing up with cracks in the foundation  
Their trying to fill the holes of a whole damn nation  
That's lost its trust (that's lost its trust)  
We gotta change before the train leaves the station  
And realize the revolution ain't a revelation it takes blood,sweat, tears,
innovation  
It starts with us, it starts with us.  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, it starts by giving love to your brother,  
Giving love to your sister,  
Giving love to your misses,  
Love to your mister  
Giving love to your friends,  
Love to your foes,  
Give the love around and back around it goes  
Give the love around and back around it goes  
Round it goes, round it goes,  
Round it goes goes goes  
  
Give the love around and back around it goes  
Oh we're all just folks working in a wheel  
Spinning all around life's cruel battlefield  
Draw circles in the sand on a rainy day,  
Watch it wash away  
I bet it shows up on a sunny beach a thousand miles away  
Flutter from a butterfly forms a storm  
Over half a million people die  
Oh we don't care because we're all desensitized  
We don't realize we're putting all this shit before our children's eyes  
Now every brand new generation  
Have all been growing up with cracks in their foundation  
We're tryna fill a holes of a whole damn nation  
That's lost it's trust (that lost it's trust)  
We gotta change before the train leaves the station  
And realize the revolution ain't a revelation  
It takes blood, sweat, tears, innovation  
It starts with us, it starts with us.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give the love around and back around it goes (around it goes)  
Give the love around and back around it goes (around it goes)  
Love to your friends (around it goes)  
To your foes (around it goes)  
Give the love around, back around it goes  
See the thing about Karma is she loves a bit of drama, yeah  
Loves to hunt you down and pay ya back for the things you did  
Before you turn a positive to a negative  
Better pray before you know exactly who the fuck you're dealing with  
This is not a dress rehearsal, let me tell you kid  
Whatever you put out there is coming back again  
Years may burn (ohh)  
Tables gonna turn  
Karma's coming back around  
Either way you're gonna learn  
To give love to your neighbor, love to yourself  
It don't matter bout your status  
Man your health is your wealth  
We can all point a finger but there's four pointing back at yourself  
I'll be the bigger man now  
Give a little help  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give the love around back around it goes  
Around it goes (x2)  
Give the love around back around it goes  
Around it goes (x4)  
Give the love around back around it goes
