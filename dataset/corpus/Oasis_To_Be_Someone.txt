To be someone must be a wonderful thing  
A famous footballer a rock singer  
Or a big film star, yes I think that I would like  
I would like that  
To be rich and have a lot of fans  
And lots of girls to prove that I'm a man  
To be number one - and loved by everyone  
  
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends  
They really dig me, man, and I dig them  
And the money that I spend, it is like my fame, and it's quickly gone  
  
No more swimming in my guitar shaped pool  
No more reporters at my beck and call  
No more cocaine, now it's only ground chalk  
And I can't afford a taxi so I have to walk  
  
Didn't I have a nice time  
Wasn't it sucha nice time  
Didn't I have a nice time  
  
I realize I should have stuck to my guns  
You stood me out just like a bastard son  
And I lost myself, but I know that it was wrong  
And it cost me a lot  
  
No more drinking cause now the club shuts down  
And I'm out here on my arse with the rest of you clowns  
I get really scared without my bodyguard  
And I'm sitting all alone in my expensive yard  
  
Didn't I have a nice time  
Wasn't it such a nice time  
Didn't I have a nice time  
Wasn't it such a nice time  
I remember it was a nice time  
To be someone must be a wonderful thing
