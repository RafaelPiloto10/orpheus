Is like I'm in love with a stranger  
It's nothing familiar about your touch  
And I need a way to make sense of this person I met  
As a flame that burns through my heart.  
Oh I, oh I, I never felt such heat in my life  
The passion in...  
  
Chorus:  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
  
I love your energy is perfect chemistry,  
Our heart... cause that's what you do to me!  
Let's talk more plain, let's move, embrace  
Let your heart get away, oh yeah!  
Let's talk more plain, let's move, embrace  
Let your heart get away, oh yeah!  
Let your heart just shine and guide away!  
  
Chorus:  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
  
Fire, fire!  
Aha! fire!  
  
Chorus:  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
  
Our love on fire!  
Uh, our love on fire!  
Our love on fire!  
Our love on fire!  
Oh, oh, yeah!  
Uh, baby!
