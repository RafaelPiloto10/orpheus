You talk about me as if I'm not there  
You don't even whisper 'cause you just don't care  
I stand there and listen to my life go by  
And at times I wonder why I even try  
  
Well I try because I like to finish what I start  
And I have faith it can get better tomorrow  
But it won't if you keep treating me  
Like I'm invisible  
  
Say that you won't treat me  
The way you're treating me  
Say that you won't  
I see you but you just keep looking right through me  
Like someone you don't even see  
Like I'm invisible  
  
You brag to your friends how much I must want ya  
You said I was someone you could do with or without  
You're so confident that I'd never leave you  
No wonder you're surprised that I am walking out  
  
Well, I have to leave no matter how sad it might be  
Because this hurt's become my reality  
And I won't let you keep on treating me  
Like I'm invisible  
  
Say that you won't treat me  
The way you're treating me  
Say that you won't  
I see you but you just keep looking right through me  
Like someone you don't even see  
Like I'm invisible  
  
Well I finally got the nerve to move on  
'cause a fly kind of guy like me  
Surely deserves more, much more  
My new love can see what's inside of me  
And she told me to thank you  
For the good love that you blew, and oh  
  
I wish you could see the way she looks at me  
She don't keep me insecure or treat me lovelessly  
She don't hide me from her friends when we have company  
And she never ever makes me feel  
Like I'm invisible  
  
And after we lay here, she wants me to stay here  
I'm not just for making love then expected to leave  
I'm not only someone used for helping her ends meet  
And she'd never ever walk on by me  
Like I'm invisible  
  
Like I'm invisible
