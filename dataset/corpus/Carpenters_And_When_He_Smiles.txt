(from "live at bbc, 1971")  
  
And when he smiles he makes the sun shine  
He wouldn't think to make it rain  
Happiness runs in the family  
And he's a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest  
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  
  
And when he smiles he makes me sigh  
He doesn't have a point of view  
Happiness runs in the family  
And he's a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest  
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  
  
And when he smiles he makes the sun shine  
And warms the day with morning dew  
Happiness runs in the family  
And he's a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest  
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew
