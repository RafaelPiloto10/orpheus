I'm not afraid to show you who I am  
And I am not ashamed of my life  
Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road  
I've always felt you deep in my bones  
  
With every step I rise and fall  
With everything to gain I end up losing it all  
When the darkness gets in  
I scream out and your light sets me free  
  
I'm not afraid of the past no more  
I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good  
I used to dance to the devil's beat  
If I could bust into hell I would  
  
I'm not afraid to shed all my skin  
I'm not afraid of the faults you see  
I'm tearing down these walls right now  
They're comin' down 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
I'm not afraid when they kick me down  
I'm not afraid when I start to bleed  
I'm not afraid if I live or die  
I'm not afraid 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
And I wish that I could give you something in return  
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned  
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned  
  
And in the end you'll finally see  
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can  
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need  
  
I'm not afraid of the the truth no more  
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid  
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins  
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did  
  
I'm not afraid of the things you know  
I'm just a book for the world to read  
My final words on the final page  
Will be amends 'cause I believe  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
Your heart is kind, mine's painted black  
The way me forgive me and just take me back  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
Your love is blind, blind as a bat  
The way that you're leading me home like that  
Your love is blind, blind as bat  
  
Your heart is kind, mine's painted black  
The way me forgive me and just take me back  
Your love is blind, blind as bat...
