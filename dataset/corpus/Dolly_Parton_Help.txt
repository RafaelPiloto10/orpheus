Help, I need somebody  
Help, not just anybody  
Help, I need somebody  
Please, please help me  
When I was younger, so much younger than today  
I never needed anybody's help in anyway  
But now those days are gone and I'm not so self assured  
No I finally changed my mind and I opened up the door  
  
Help me, if you can I'm feelin' down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Won't you help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please, please help me  
  
And now my life has changed in so many ways  
My independence seemed to vanish in the haze  
But every now and then I feel so insecure  
I know that I need your light, I never done before  
  
Help me, if you can I'm feelin' down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Won't you help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please, please help me  
  
Help me, help me, ooh
