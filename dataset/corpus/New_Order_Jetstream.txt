(It's only one more day)  
  
Can you wait  
My plane will be arriving shortly  
Right there at the gate  
I pray that you'll be waiting right there for me  
  
This time could be what  
We've both been searching for  
Our whole lives waking up  
I'm coming back for more  
  
(Leave your baggage behind, you won't need it tonight, enjoy your flight)  
  
J-E-T (J-E-T)  
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)  
You are my jetstream lover  
You're how I want to be (Just how I want to be baby)

You are so good for me (You are so good for me)  
You are my jetstream lover  
You're how I want to be (Just how I want to be baby)  
  
We're so high  
I'm watching all the clouds drift by below me  
We should try  
It's been so long since I made you cry  
  
Long Live Love  
I just can't get enough of you  
I need that engine's push  
It's gonna take me home to you
