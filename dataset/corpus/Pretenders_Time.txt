You're always welcome  
To stop on by  
I'll be there baby  
To get you high  
You're thinking maybe  
This one's for real  
You don't know  
How good you fell  
  
[Chorus:]  
Gimme some time  
Real good time  
Gimme some time  
Time  
Gimme some time  
Real good time  
Gimme some time  
Time  
  
Come on in  
We can be free  
No one will be here  
No one will see  
It's nobody's business  
What we do  
You want me  
Baby I want you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Life is too tough  
To work all day  
What does it cost  
To earn your pay  
If the man is breaking your will  
He won't reward you  
But I will  
  
[Chorus x3]
