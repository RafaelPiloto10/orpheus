I want somebody to share, share the rest of my life,  
Share my innermost thoughts, know my intimate details.  
Someone who'll stand by my side, and give me support.  
And in return, she'll get my support.  
She will listen to me, when I want to speak,  
About the world we live in, and life in general.  
Though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted,  
She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted  
To my way of thinking, in fact she'll often disagree,  
But at the end of it all, she will understand me.  
want somebody who cares for me  
Passionately,  
With every thought and with every breath.  
Somebody who will help me see things in a different light  
All of the things I detest I will almost like.  
I don't won't to be tied to anyone's strings.  
I'm carefully try to steer clear of those things.  
But when I'm asleep I want somebody  
Who will put their arms around and kiss me tenderly.  
Though things like this make me sick.  
In a case like this, I'll get away with it.  
And in a case like this, I'll get away with it.  
Tenderly.
