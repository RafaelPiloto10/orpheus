No, woman, no cry,  
No, woman, no cry,  
No, woman, no cry,  
No, woman, no cry.  
  
Cause, cause, cause, I remember when we used to sit  
In the government yard in Trenchtown,  
Oba - obaserving the 'ypocrites  
As they would mingle with the good people we meet.  
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost  
Along the way.  
In this great future, you can't forget your past,  
So dry your tears, I seh.  
  
No, woman, no cry,  
No, woman, no cry.  
'Ere, little darlin', don't she'd no tears,  
No, woman, no cry.  
  
Said, said, said, I remember when-a we used to sit  
In the government yard in Trenchtown.  
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,  
As it was logwood burnin' through the nights.  
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge,  
Of which I'll share with you,  
My feet is my only carriage,  
So I've got to push on through.  
But while I'm gone, I mean,  
  
Everything's gonna be all right!  
Everything's gonna be all right!  
Everything's gonna be all right!  
Everything's gonna be all right!  
I said, everything's gonna be all right-a!  
Everything's gonna be all right!  
Everything's gonna be all right, now!  
Everything's gonna be all right!  
  
So, woman, no cry,  
No, no, woman, woman, no cry.  
Woman, little sister, don't she'd no tears,  
No, woman, no cry.

No, woman, no cry.  
Eh! (Little darlin', don't she'd no tears!  
No, woman, no cry.  
Little sister, don't she'd no tears!  
No, woman, no cry.)
