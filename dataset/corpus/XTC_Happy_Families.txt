Have you got Miss Fortune, she's the daughter of rich parents,  
All she does is cry. One four-letter word is all she wants  
But you can't buy love so there's no supply.  
  
Will you take young Master Charge, the boy who's living well  
Beyond his father's means. (Happy families.) See his mother  
Kill herself with work to keep her dandy in the latest jeans.  
(Happy families.)  
  
Happy families is a kid's game. Happy families is your main  
Aim. It starts out with a dealing in the middle of the night,  
And ends up with a full house if you play your cards out  
Right. Mum says Dad is cheating, you should see the grown-ups  
Fight for happy families, the game that's sure to please.  
  
Have you got young Master Race the bigot son who, like his dad,  
Is fooled with fear. (Happy families.) Not so much a sun,  
More of a stormtrooper, to burn the books when Dad's not here.  
(Happy families.)  
  
Happy families is a kid's game. Happy families is your main  
Aim. You start out with your first cub and you think that  
Life's a song. You'll end up with a wolfpack if you lay your  
Cards out wrong. Dad says Mom is cheating, you can see the  
Children long for happy families, the game that's sure to please.  
  
Have you got Miss Carriage, she's the girl who wants a baby  
That she cannot find. (Happy families.) Strange, the ones  
Who want to win the race are usually the ones who fall behind.
