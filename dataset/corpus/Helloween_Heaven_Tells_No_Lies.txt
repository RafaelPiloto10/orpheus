I could go a step ahead and try  
Harder than before but I deny  
Always when I try a step  
Something's gonna hold me back  
  
Back to where I started  
I just bump my head instead  
Better leave me here all on my own  
Better leave me or become my clone  
  
Everyone who grabbed my hand  
Fell into the same wasteland  
Don't try to convince me  
With your optimistic smile  
  
I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight  
To terminate my rotten side  
Just need one shot into the center of my hate  
To light the darkness and run free from that old spell  
  
I don't know if hell or paradise  
Belong together or if heaven tells no lies  
You role the dice, you know the price  
Is higher than you can afford  
  
Beware of what you might see  
Can you trust your blinded eyes?  
I don't know if heaven tells no lies  
  
Black is white and colors turn to gray  
What was close is drifting far away  
Just now right's already wrong  
What turns weak was never strong  
Can I kill the demon without blowing out my mind?  
  
I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight  
To terminate my rotten side  
Just need one shot into the center of my hate  
To light the darkness and run free from that old spell  
  
I don't know if hell or paradise  
Belong together or if heaven tells no lies  
You role the dice, you know the price  
Is higher than you can afford  
  
Beware of what you might see  
Can you trust your blinded eyes?  
I don't know if heaven tells no lies  
  
I will return, you have to burn  
Abide my vision, you no longer keep me bound  
I will be back, I will attack  
In my religion I will make you hell hound drown
