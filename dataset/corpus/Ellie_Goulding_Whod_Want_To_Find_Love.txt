[Who, who'd want to find love,  
It's not as if we know what to look for  
Looking out but not sure.  
Who, who'd want to find love,  
Maybe 'cause it's not come around yet  
Still I really don't care.  
Who, who'd want to find love,  
Don't worry 'cause your drink isn't drunk  
So better let the rest go]  
She's a lover with a chemical heart,  
Only ever talks about the obvious part.  
The place was empty not it's body heat heart  
Only hear a few words telling me what it felt like  
In the morning she's as good as unaffected.  
But her face moves less than it out to  
And everyone's just gone quiet.  
Only in it for the postcard picture,  
Only in it for the smoke of the gun.  
[Chorus]  
I'm not worried if the look doesn't last  
And there's something in the kiss  
I don't need to see past  
There's a speech bubble on the top of my head  
That everyone sees no matter what I just said I  
Think about it... too much...  
Talk about it... too much...  
Cry about it.. too much...  
Too much we're spinning in circles  
Only in it for the postcard picture  
Only in it for the smoke of the gun.  
[Chorus]  
So better let the rest go.
