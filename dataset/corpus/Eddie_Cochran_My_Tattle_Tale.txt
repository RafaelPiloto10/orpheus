My tattle tale is a cute little girl  
My tattle tale she puts your heart in a whirl  
My tattle tale is a-shakin' me true  
I say, I'm gonna tell my mammy on you  
My tattle tale has a goodnight kiss  
My tattle tale has a heart you will miss  
My tattle tale she makes a-me blue  
When she says, I'm gonna tell my mammy on you  
Sweet baby can we date to the show  
Oh honey I feel so low  
C'mon darlin' break the first piece  
What do I tell my history teacher  
My tattle tale now I think you should know  
My tattle tale is not so slow  
My tattle tale can get you too  
When she says, I'm gonna tell my mammy on you  
Oh yes I am...
