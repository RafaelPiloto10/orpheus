Scold me, that's all you've got to say  
Coldly, hurt me and turn away  
You say, "I'm not sorry yet" I'm resigned to what is next  
I head for the shadow  
Hold me taking it back through tears  
You've told me, slowly confessed your fears  
But I've got myself to protect. It's too soon for me to forget  
I'll wait in the shadows  
In the shadows  
Though I am alone  
They help me, see that I'm the only one in your heart  
So until I truly believe that your words convey what you mean  
I'll wait in the shadows (2x)  
I don't mind the shadows.
