[Verse 1]  
There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat  
You pray more than you breathe  
And you just wanna fall to pieces  
And nights, those 2 AM calls  
Where dreams become walls  
And you just need a break  
Break on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes, girl  
Break on me  
Put your head on my chest  
Let me help you forget  
When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me  
  
[Verse 2]  
There'll be times when someone you know  
Becomes someone you knew  
But you'd do anything to change it  
And words you wanna take back  
But you know you can't  
When the page just won't turn  
And it still hurts  
Break on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes, girl  
Break on me  
Put your head on my chest  
Let me help you forget  
When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh, when you need somebody  
When you need somebody right now  
You're where I'll be  
Break on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes, girl  
Break on me  
Put your head on my chest  
Let me help you forget  
When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me  
Break on me  
Break on me, baby
