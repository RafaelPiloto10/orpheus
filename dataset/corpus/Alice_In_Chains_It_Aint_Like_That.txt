There I was, laid out on a table  
Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor  
In my life, I'd not soften  
Things that cut, and burn so often  
But I sit, think of somethin'  
Scared to face, the dyin' nothin'  
  
[Chorus: ]  
See the cycle I've waited for  
It ain't like that anymore  
  
Where I go, is when I feel I'm able  
How I fight, is why I'm feelin' sore  
In my mind, not forgotten  
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten  
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin'  
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin'  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Here I sit writing on the paper  
Trying to think of words you can't ignore  
In my eyes, what I'm lacking  
Score at face, a ten for slacking  
Sign the deal, set in motion  
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X
