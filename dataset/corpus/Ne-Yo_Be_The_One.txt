Ey I'm not the one to start no trouble  
I'm not the one to throw no salt  
But you're standing out here crying  
I watched as that dude drove off  
Assuming that that's your man  
Assuming that you're just fault  
I don't know the whole story  
But assuming it wasn't your fault  
  
Baby since he just won't do it right  
Ey, let me be the one  
Let me show you what real love is like  
And do the things he should have done  
Baby since he just won't do it right  
Let me be the one  
Let me show you what real love is like  
And do the things he should have done  
Let me be the one, ey  
  
Now I know that you don't know me  
But hear what I'm talking bout  
'Cause when I look at you what I see  
Is worth tryna work it out  
Now I don't know him so I can't say that he's a bad dude  
But is he really trying? I think not  
And all I'm saying is if he won't make the effort  
Let me give it a shot  
  
Baby since he just won't do it right  
Ey, let me be the one  
Let me show you what real love is like  
And do the things he should have done  
Baby since he just won't do it right  
Ey, let me be the one  
Let me show what real love is like  
And do the things he should have done ohoo  
  
Ooh, let me be what you want  
Let me be what he's not  
Let me show you real love  
'Cause real love is all I got  
Ohh, come on here off the rain  
Come let me do it right  
Come let me change your heart  
And change your life, ohh  
  
Girl let me be the one, be the one  
Girl let me be the one, be the one  
Girl let me be the one, be the one  
Girl let me be the one, be the one  
  
Ohh, baby since he just won't do it right  
Let me be the one  
Let me show you what real love is like  
And do the things he should have done  
Baby since he just won't do it right  
Let me be the one  
Let me show you what real love is like  
And do the things he should have done  
Hah, let me be the one
