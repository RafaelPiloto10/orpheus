St. Louis song  
Something is wrong  
I kill that man  
From your own shoulders down  
And here comes an empty  
People look at each other like me  
  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
'Cause there's nothing  
Here to be  
  
St. Louis song  
Where has the good thing gone  
Dreaming himself to hell  
Stuck in his good cell  
He's still trying to suffer  
Left handed stop  
  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
  
I'm not trying to suffer  
Left handed stop  
  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here  
I don't wanna be  
I don't want to be he-here
