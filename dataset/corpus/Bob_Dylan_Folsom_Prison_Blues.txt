I hear that train a-rolling, it's a-rolling round the bend  
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
I'm stucked in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
And I hear that whistle blowing all down to San Antone  
  
When I was just a baby my momma told me: son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that train a-pulling I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in their fancy dining cars  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But the people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me  
  
If they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine  
You bet I moved it on a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
