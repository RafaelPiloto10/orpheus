Little darlin', don't you cry,  
You know I'll try to be there with you by and by  
When everything is going wrong now don't you cry.  
I'm wishin'.  
  
Little darlin', far away,  
I see the world go rollin' by my window pane,  
But I can only wish that I was there again.  
I'm wishin'.  
  
I wish that everything was cold,  
I wish you were here to hold, I'm wishin'.  
  
Little darlin', the night is long,  
I thought I'd be back now I must have got it wrong  
You and California call me in this song.  
I'm wishin'.  
  
I wish that everything was cold,  
I wish you were here to hold,I'm wishin'.  
  
Little darlin' I see you,you're cryin' in the sun  
I gotta be with you,  
I'm gonna be with there soon I'll make it all come true.  
I'm wishin'.  
  
I wish that everything was cold,  
I wish you were here to hold,I'm wishin'.
