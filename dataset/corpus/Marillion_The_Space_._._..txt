On top of the world like a flag on a mountain  
Feeling so high you can feel so alone  
Unable to breathe at the height that you flew  
Staring on clouds with no view of below  
  
On top of a girl like a dream in a hotel  
Falling towards something out of control  
Unable to miss like the man in the tram  
Crashing your car in Amsterdam  
  
He did it without knowing, didn't feel a thing  
He just wrecked it and kept going  
  
The space around the stars  
Is something that you know  
A billion miles of darkness  
Left your feeling low  
The space around the stars  
Is something that you know  
  
Everything about you  
So perfectly restrained  
But everything inside you  
Bites you  
  
Everybody in the whole of the world  
Feels the same inside  
Everybody in the whole of the world  
  
Everyone is only everyone else  
Everybody's got to know  
Everybody lives and loves and laughs and cries  
And eats and sleeps and grows and dies  
Everybody in the whole of the world  
Is the same this time  
Is the same inside  
In the whole of the world
