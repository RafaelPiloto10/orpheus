He was born in a depressed nation  
Started tough and worked his way right off the street  
Thumbed his nose at a graduation  
Wheeled and dealed, his education was complete  
  
He's got all his hair, but his life is a wreck  
Always been a brat, he don't get no respect  
He's got the time, he's got the money  
You better get out of his way  
You better watch out for him, sonny  
  
Back to school  
He's gonna take that plunge  
Gonna jump back in there  
Back to school  
He's gonna shape his mind  
Gonna shed old skin there  
Back to school  
  
Spent some time in appreciation of finer arts  
And the human body mysteries  
Scoring high in procreation  
Got an 'A' in the study of female anatomy  
  
He thinks about his teacher in his literary class  
He's staring at her legs  
But he's dreaming 'bout her face  
He's got the time  
He's got the money  
You better get out of his way  
You better watch out for him, sonny  
  
Back to school  
He's gonna take that plunge  
Gonna jump back in there  
Back to school  
He's gonna shape his mind  
Gonna shed old skin there  
Back to school
