It makes me giggle  
It makes me giggle  
Just having my baby around me  
It makes me giggle  
Sometimes I wiggle  
'Cause I'm so glad she found me  
Sometimes I wake up feeling crabby  
She gives me love as sweet as candy  
  
It makes me giggle  
It makes me giggle  
Every time I see my little boy child  
It makes me giggle  
Sometimes I wiggle  
Sometimes I even jump for joy, child  
He knows just how to make me happy  
He gives me love and calls me Daddy  
  
If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall  
It just blows me away to be part of it all  
  
It makes me giggle  
It makes me giggle  
Just singing these love songs for you  
It makes me giggle  
Sometimes I wiggle  
There ain't nothing that I'd rather do  
I'd like to give one to the whole human race  
  
If I ever felt better I can't seem to recall  
It just blows me away to be part of it all
