You think you're cool and got it all  
You think you run the scene  
I don't believe how you'd conceive  
That your good enough for me  
You think you've got it all sewn up  
But I'll cut you right down to size  
The way I figure you don't exist  
So you'd better realize  
  
Don't you touch  
Don't get near  
Don't take me for a fool  
Make no mistake  
No give and take  
I'm too good for you  
  
So keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off me  
Hands off  
Keep your hands off me  
  
I'm number one when I turn it on  
Do you think you can relate  
You'd be amazed, left in a daze  
To see me operate  
  
Don't you touch  
Don't get near  
Don't take me for a fool  
Make no mistake  
No give and take  
I'm too good for you  
  
So keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
  
You live in a fantasy  
I don't even care.  
If you're lookin' for sympathy  
It ain't there  
  
Hands off  
Keep your dirty hands off me.  
  
So keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Hands off
