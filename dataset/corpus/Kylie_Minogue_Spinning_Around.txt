(Spinning around, spinning around)  
(Oh)  
I'm spinning around  
Move outta my way  
I know you're feeling me  
'cause you like it like this  
I'm breaking it down  
I'm not the same  
I know you're feeling me  
'cause you like it like this  
  
Traded in some sorrow  
For some joy that I borrowed  
From back in the day  
Threw away my old clothes  
Got myself a better wardrobe  
I got something to say  
I'm through with the past  
Ain't no point in looking back  
The future will be  
And did I forget to mention  
That I found a new direction  
And it leads back to me, yeah  
  
I'm spinning around  
Move outta my way  
I know you're feeling me  
'cause you like it like this  
I'm breaking it down  
I'm not the same  
I know you're feeling me  
'cause you like it like this  
  
The mistakes I've made  
Have given me the strength  
To really believe  
That no matter how I take it  
There's no way I'm gonna fake it  
'cause it's gotta be real  
I've got nothing left to hide  
No reason left to fight  
'cause the truth's given me  
A new freedom inside  
Getting rid of my desire  
Do you like what you see  
  
I'm spinning around  
Move outta my way  
I know you're feeling me  
'cause you like it like this  
I'm breaking it down  
I'm not the same  
I know you're feeling me  
'cause you like it like this  
Baby, baby, baby, ooh  
(Ooh) You know you like it like this  
Oh, baby, baby, baby  
You know you like it like this  
Oh, baby, baby, baby  
  
I'm spinning around  
Move outta my way  
I know you're feeling me  
'cause you like it like this  
I'm breaking it down  
I'm not the same  
I know you're feeling me  
'cause you like it like this  
Feeling me 'cause you like it like this  
Oh, I'm not the same  
I know you like it like this, oh, ooh, yeah  
Like it like this  
Like it like this  
(I'm not the same)  
Like it like this  
I'm not the same (I'm not the same)  
Oh
