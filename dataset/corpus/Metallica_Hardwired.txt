In the name of desperation  
In the name of wretched pain  
In the name of all creation  
Gone insane  
  
We're so fucked  
Shit out of luck  
Hardwired to self destruct  
Go!  
  
On the way to paranoia  
On the crooked borderline  
On the way to great destroyer  
Do you decide?  
  
We're so fucked  
Shit out of luck  
Hardwired to self destruct  
  
Once upon a planet burning  
Once upon a flame  
Once upon a fear returning  
All in vain  
  
Do you feel my hope receding?  
Do you comprehend?  
Do you feel it terminating in the end?  
  
We're so fucked  
Shit out of luck  
Hardwired to self destruct  
Hardwired to self destruct  
Self-destruct  
Self-destruct  
Self-destruct
