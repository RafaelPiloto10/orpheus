When I look at you I think many strange things  
And it's hard to express all of my feelings  
I belong to a girl you hang around with  
But I must admit I've got eyes for you.  
  
I had to call and tell you just how I felt  
You should know by now that  
When you're near my heart melts  
I belong to a girl you hang around with  
But I must admit I've got eyes for you.  
  
Eyes for you, eyes for you  
Yes I must admit I've got eyes for you.  
  
In my sleep I call your name  
No one to blame I can't explain  
And every time I see you it's the same thing  
And I try to escape from looking your way.  
I belong to a girl you hang around with  
But I must admit I've got eyes for you.  
  
Must admit I've got eyes for you, mm  
I must admit I've got eyes for you
