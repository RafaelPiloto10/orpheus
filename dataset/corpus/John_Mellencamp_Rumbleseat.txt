All the leaves are green  
All my friends are gone  
I'm livin' in my hometown  
I can barely get along  
I feel sorry for myself  
That's an easy thing to do  
I feel sorry for the world  
I feel sorry for you  
Yes I am a pitiful sight  
I can't even get one thing right  
  
I know just what it's like  
To be ridin' in the rumbleseat  
Yes I know just what it's like  
To be a big time rider in the rumbleseat  
  
Well I could have a nervous breakdown  
But I don't believe in shrinks  
I should be drunker than a monkey  
But I don't like to drink  
Call up some girls  
But I'm afraid of the phone  
I'm always talkin' to myself  
I guess I'm never alone  
Am I the only one that feels this way  
I'd buy myself some stylish clothes  
But I sure hate to pay  
  
I know just what it's like  
To be ridin' in the rumbleseat  
Yes I know just what it's like  
To be a big time rider in the rumbleseat  
  
The sun is coming up  
Just goin' to bed  
I combed my hair with my pillow  
Still got some dreams left  
Tomorrow is a new day  
Gonna make these dreams come true  
I'm gonna believe in myself  
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna stop puttin' myself down  
I'm gonna turn my life around  
  
I'll be ridin' high  
With my feet kicked up in the rumbleseat  
Yeah we'll go for a drive  
And we'll be singin' shotgun from that rumbleseat  
Yes I'll blow you a kiss  
And we'll be ridin' big time in my rumbleseat
