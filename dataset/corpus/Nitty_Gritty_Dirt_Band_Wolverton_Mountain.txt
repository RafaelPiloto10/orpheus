They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain  
If you're looking for a wife  
'Cause Clifton Clowers has a pretty young daughter  
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife.  
  
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey  
And Wolverton mountain protects her there  
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers  
If a stranger should wander there.  
  
All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain  
I want his daughter for my wife  
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain  
Though Clifton Clowers, he may take my life.  
  
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey  
And Wolverton mountain protects her there  
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers  
If a stranger should wander there.  
  
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain  
It's too lonesome down here below  
It's just not right to hide his daughter  
From the one who loves her so  
  
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey  
And Wolverton mountain protects her there  
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers  
If a stranger should wander there  
  
But I don't care about Clifton Clowers  
I'm gonna climb up on his mountain  
I'm gonna take the girl I love  
I don't care about Clifton Clowers  
  
I'm a gonna climb up on that mountain  
And I'll get the one I Iove  
I don't care about Clifton Clowers,  
I'm gonna find the one I love,  
  
I don't care about Clifton Clowers  
I'm gonna find the one I love
