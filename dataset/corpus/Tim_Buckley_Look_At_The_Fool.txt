Each and every day, every little way,  
I've been a lovin' you,  
I can't live without lovin' at night  
Makes it hard to say it's wrong  
When I know it's right  
Even though the years won't be kind  
I love you more than I care about myself,  
I love ya, hate ya for what you're doin' to my health,  
I love ya, hate ya for all the love ya make me feel,  
I love ya darlin' 'cause ya know I can't leave  
But when you're gone,  
I'm little boy lost in the storm with the wolves,  
Flames all around I talk to myself and pray to the rain  
That this lonely curse won't drive me insane,  
I run into the sea,  
But the sea only sighs  
  
Look at the fool that love brings me
