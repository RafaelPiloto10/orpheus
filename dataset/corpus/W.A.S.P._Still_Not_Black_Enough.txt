Paint a shadow on my heart  
In shades of ebony  
Paint the sun out of the sky  
That rains over me  
  
Black sun, rain on me  
I need one, black sun  
Rain on me, rain on me  
  
Tie me to my blackness there  
Where I'm ever free  
Taken to the dark edges of  
My wicked memories  
  
Paint my soul in indigo, and ebony for me  
No colour seen in my eyes, none in my eyes  
I'm naked in my misery  
Emotions stripped to bone  
I see inside the heart of me  
It's still not black enough for me  
  
No colour in the heart of me  
No colour run in my veins  
I hold the black to my breast  
It bleeds over me  
I can't go on till I get off  
For me it's still not black enough  
With darkness gone, my fear is seen  
My fear is real, my fear is me
