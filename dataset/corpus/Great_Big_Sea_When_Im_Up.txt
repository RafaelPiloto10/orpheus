I am the fountain of affection  
I'm the instrument of joy  
And to keep the good times rolling  
I'm the boy, I'm the boy,  
You know the world could be our oyster,  
If you just put your trust in me,  
'Cause we'll keep the good times rollin'  
Wait and see, wait and see... Oh wait and see!  
  
There's exaltations, a sweet disintegrations  
There's a few discolourations, then it comes along  
You know up is what he chooses, the kisses and the bruises  
There ain't nothing he refuses, then it comes along  
It comes along, and I am lifted, I am lifted, I am lifted!  
  
Chorus:  
When I'm up I can't get down  
Can't get down, can't get level  
When I'm up I can't get down  
Get my feet back on the ground  
When I'm up I can't get down  
Can't get down, can't get level  
When I'm up I can't get down  
Get my feet back on the ground  
  
He just needs, something to bind him  
Something to wind him up  
It won't take long to find him  
When it comes on strong.  
  
Black skies are grinning, street lights are spinning  
The night is just beginning, and then it comes on strong  
It comes on strong, and I am lifted, I am lifted, I am lifted!  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh it comes on strong, and I am lifted.  
It comes on strong, and I am lifted.  
I am lifted, I am lifted!  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, I can't get down  
Oh no, no, no, no, no, I can't get down  
Oh-oh-oh I can't get down
