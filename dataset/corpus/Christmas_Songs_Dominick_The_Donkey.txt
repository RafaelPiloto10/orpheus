Hey! Chingedy ching,  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
It's Dominick the donkey.  
Chingedy ching,  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
The Italian Christmas donkey.  
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)  
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)  
Santa's got a little friend,  
His name is Dominick.  
The cutest little donkey,  
You never see him kick.  
When Santa visits his paisans,  
With Dominick he'll be.  
Because the reindeer cannot,  
Climb the hills of Italy.

(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
The Italian Christmas donkey.  
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)  
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)  
  
Jingle bells around his feet,  
And presents on the sled.  
Hey! Look at the mayor's derby,  
On top of Dominick's head.  
A pair of shoes for Louie,  
And a dress for Josephine.  
The labels on the inside says,  
They're made in Brooklyn.

Children sing, and clap their hands,  
And Dominick starts to dance.  
They talk Italian to him,  
And he even understands.  
  
Cumpare sing,  
Cumpare su,  
And dance 'sta tarantella.  
When Santa Nicola comes to town,  
And brings lu ciucciariello
