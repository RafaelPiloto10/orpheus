Since I was very young I realized  
I never wanted to be human size  
So I avoid the crowds and traffic jams  
They just remind me of how small I am  
Because of this longing in my heart  
I'm going to start the growing up  
I'm going to grow now and never stop  
Think like a mountain, grow to the top  
  
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall  
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall  
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will grow, grow, grow  
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall  
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall  
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will grow, grow, grow  
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
  
With concentration  
My size increased  
And now I'm fourteen stories high  
At least!!  
Empire state human  
Just a bored kid  
I'll go to Egypt to be  
A pyramid  
  
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall  
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall  
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will grow, grow, grow  
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall  
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall  
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will grow, grow, grow  
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
  
Brick by brick  
Stone by stone  
Growing till he's fully grown  
Brick by brick  
Stone by stone  
Growing till he's fully grown  
  
Fetch more water  
Fetch more sand  
Biggest person in the land  
Fetch more water  
Fetch more sand  
Biggest person in the land
