(Z-Ro talking)  
Uh, seem like they got my life on the big screen  
Z-Ro versus the world, feel me round one  
[Z-Ro]  
Is it reality or just a fable  
The most powerful lyricists in the world was on a low budget label  
Even if I don't clear me in I just want to be living well  
Not saying that heaven is promised to me but I don't want to believe in hell  
Feeling on coming also cause problems worry me  
If it ain't the stress somebody's always trying to bury me  
So thinking I'm undercovers and the dope they try to deal me  
Jealousy and envy make my niggas want to kill me  
Everybody want to pick up a gun and bust thinking artillery fin to be  
drilling me nigga  
But I' sick of this pistol play bumping ain't no more killng me nigga  
Cause I'm a soldier, trying to keep his mind at ease  
And if I squeeze then we all bleed  
[Chorus - 2x]  
Feel a nigga worldwide, not just in Texas  
I think I'm bout to lose my mind, aggravated and restless  
I don't want to die  
[Z-Ro]  
Look at how they made me, traditon systems raised me  
The drama that they give me never ceases to amaze me  
They tell me that my mind's gone, coming up is what my mind's on  
I guess there's nothing left to do but get my grind on  
Thinking about my family but knowing they neglect me  
I'm not gonna give up, I'm gonna make my family respect me  
I'm talking to my father now, daddy I'm a grown up  
Depending on you is false-a-fied because you haven't shown up  
Caught up in these streets I'm taking penitentiary chances  
I done forgived and I done forget plus I'm not giving you anymore chances  
Quick to run out of the house for nothing now your son is feeling anger  
Remember the times you couldn't come around because your life has been in
danger  
I'm a leader to follow is not my destiny  
But I guess it was written for me to fall victim to jealousy  
It's killing me to stay alive, but there ain't no use in me crying  
No matter what I guess it's what is right, on southside  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Whoever would of thought that I would be this fam-ous  
Put in work until it hurt but keep pretending it's pain it's  
Affiliated with killers when we fight us to the death  
Picture your partner cocked and aim and headed straight for your chest  
It's hard to focus cause my homies keep on killing eachother  
Everybody stressing cause ain't nobody feeling eachother  
I often conversate with god but who's to say if he's listening  
Even though I died as a sinner but resurrected as a christian  
At 11 years old I was told that most friends turn to foes  
From velicos to calicoes it helps when our battle folds  
If it ain't true, if it ain't crew, it's a mexican deed  
I'ma catch an attitude instntly bitch you plexing with me  
And ain't no begging for mercy because you shot my nigga  
And I swear to god everywhere you go it's gone be hot my nigga  
And maybe god can forgive you but see the streets seeing different  
They want you dead you might not make it to prison, bitch  
[Chorus - 4x]  
(Z-Ro talking)  
Ha ha, new millennium music, shouts out  
Dirty D, Anonymous, Heavy Rotation  
My nigga Pop Belly I love you boy
