She is the girl of his dreams  
He wants her, he thinks 'forget it'  
He's got a pain in his heart he feels like crying  
So lonesome for love he feels like dying  
  
But don't stop the dream  
He can fix it, I know he can  
He's the world's world's greatest  
At the work that he does  
When he moves on down the line  
  
She is the girl of his dreams  
He wants her, he thinks 'forget it'  
He'd love to look inside her heart  
And see if she agrees  
  
But don't stop the dream  
He can fix it, I know he can  
He's good, he's great  
At the work that he does  
And there's magic in the air  
  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Let it in your heart  
  
Good times, bad times don't know what to do  
Half the time and all the time  
Don't know if it's true  
Someday, somewhere know if it's true  
She'll look inside her heart and decide  
It's really you, whoa  
  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Everything'll work out if you let it  
Let it in your heart  
  
Everything works if you let it  
If you let it in your heart  
Yeah everything works if you let it  
If you let it in your heart
