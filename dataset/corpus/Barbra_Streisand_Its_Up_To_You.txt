You can say what you got to say  
Wherever you go, baby, I will find a way  
I'm ready to go anywhere you choose  
It's up to you  
  
You decide if I live or die  
Wherever you go, baby, so will I  
I'm ready to accept your point of view  
It's up to you  
  
And there's something about that way you smile  
Every touch leaves me helpless  
Every moment drives me wild  
I never saw the cause that made you lie  
I never said goodbye inside  
  
You can go where you got to go  
Wherever you lead, baby, I will follow  
I'm ready to be all you want me to  
It's up to you  
  
And I walk in the dark and the candle burns  
Out of place, your face is missing  
Come the day, you return my love on hold  
This moment stops in time  
The reason and the rhyme inside  
  
You can go where you got to go  
Where you lead, baby, I will follow  
I'm ready to be all you want me to  
It's up to you  
  
It's up to you  
You, baby  
It's up to you  
Oh, it's up to you  
Oh, it's up to you
