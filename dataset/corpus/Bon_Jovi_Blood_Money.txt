Hey Patty Garrett that's what I used to call you  
They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you  
They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver  
They paid you some money to sell them my blood  
  
But you say this ain't about me, this ain't about you  
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through  
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed  
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
I wonder what would have happened  
If you were the killer  
And I was the hero  
Would things be the same  
Or would I have traded  
Your life for my own life  
Would I have paid  
Your debts in your place  
  
But this ain't about me, this ain't about you  
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through  
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed  
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
Blood money  
That's what I call it  
'Cause money for blood ain't no fair exchange  
Blood money  
Bought and then sold you  
But your conscience is all you can take to your grave
