Let me give praise to your sparkling eyes  
And your coloured hair.  
Let me spend ages on poetic phrases  
To show I care.  
Let me go grazing on dappled green pastures  
Where you're the mare.  
Let me rephrase that  
I think there's a better line there,  
Spinning around in the air.  
  
Let me donate something to a kid's charity  
Of your choice.  
For you I would willingly be a worse traitor  
Than William Joyce.  
If I could sing I would sing you a song  
In Sam Cooke's voice.  
Let me rephrase that  
I think there's a better line there,  
Spinning around in the air.  
  
Are you happy now?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Are you really happy now?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Tell me where it hurts.  
It hurts there and there and there.  
Adverbs and nouns  
Juicy and round  
Spinning around in the air.  
  
Are you happy now?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Are you really happy now?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Tell me where it hurts.  
It hurts there and there and there.  
Adverbs and nouns  
Juicy and round  
Spinning around in the air.  
  
Madam Onassis took Ari's old glasses  
And put them on.  
She said "I see ships" and she started to quip  
About old Boston.  
I climbed over her just to climb upon you,  
What did I do wrong?  
Let me rephrase that  
I think there's a better line there,  
Spinning around in the air.
