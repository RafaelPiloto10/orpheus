I feel just like your love tonight  
So who's to say I'm wrong  
I've got to say I feel just right  
It's never been so strong  
  
There seems so many points to make  
But I feel this is a big mistake  
We're so old and this is new  
And I've really got to tell you  
I always said that we should remain free  
But that was up to you and not to me  
I started strong but I've met someone  
You know how long it's been  
  
That's how the whole thing started  
That's how the whole thing started  
  
Baby baby it's wrong  
But I've been in and out of love so long  
Here we stand not more than friends  
I broke your heart again  
I've gone and met someone  
  
That's how the whole thing started  
That's how the whole thing started  
That's how the whole thing started  
That's how the whole thing started
