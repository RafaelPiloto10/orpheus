Your smiles they don't come easy  
Like they used to come before  
The awkwardness and boredom  
Is scattered out across the floor  
I can feel your love waxin' and wanin'  
And a quick look in your eyes needs no explainin'  
  
I'm out on my own  
Livin' alone  
  
I'm an old reluctant gypsy  
I don't like campin' anymore  
And the dreams and disappointments  
Scatter out across the floor  
I'm nervous on this train I feel it derailin'  
And I can read the letters that nobody's mailin'  
I'm out on my own  
Livin' alone yeah  
  
Somethin' deep inside of me  
Must have died some time ago  
I haven't called no place my home  
Since nineteen-ninety-four  
I'm out on my own  
  
Thirty-somethin' single  
And tired of runnin' everywhere  
And I can wear a welcome out  
When I ain't even there  
I'm nervous on this train I feel it derailin'  
And I can read the letters that nobody's mailin'  
I'm out on my own  
Livin' alone I'm livin' alone  
And I got nowhere to go  
Look at me I'm out on my own  
I'm out on my own  
But it's gonna be all right now  
It's gonna be all right  
It's gonna be all right  
Oh yes I know it and I know and I know it's gonna be all right
