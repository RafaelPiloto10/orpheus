Well I couldn't sleep last night  
Just walked the floor  
Don't know how I'll stand this anymore  
Lonely all the time since I lost you  
  
Received your invitation to the blues  
I don't know why you cause me such pain  
I just hope I just never go through this much again  
Thanks for sending something I can't use  
Received your invitation to the blues  
  
You took the laughter from this world of mine  
And thanks to you the sun will never shine  
I walk the floor so much I wore out my shoes  
I received your invitation to the blues  
I don't know why you cause me such pain  
I just hope I just never go through this much again  
Well lonely me I don't know what to do  
Received your invitation to the blues  
I don't know why you cause me such pain  
I just hope I never go though this much again  
  
Thanks for sending something I can't use  
Received your invitation to the blues
