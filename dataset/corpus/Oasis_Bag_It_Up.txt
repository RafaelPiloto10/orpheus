Gold and silver and sunshine is rising up  
Pour yourself another cup of Lady Grey  
Take my hand in the meantime, when you've had enough  
You'll find me on the end of a runway, babe  
  
Tell the world that you love them in a melody  
Send my old piano and a telegram  
Gotta get me a doctor with a remedy  
I'm gonna take a walk with the Monkey Man!  
  
Someone tell me I'm dreaming  
The freaks are rising up through the floor  
Everything I believe in  
Is telling me that I want more, more, more  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay your love on the fire when you come on in  
I got my hee-bee-jee-bees in a hidden bag  
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up, high  
  
Someone tell me I'm dreaming  
The freaks are rising up through the floor  
Everything I believe in  
Is telling me that I want more, more, more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shine a light on your fire when you come on in  
I got my hee-bee-jee-bees in a hidden bag  
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up, high
