I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love  
Even more than I usually do  
And although I know it's a long road back  
I promise you  
  
That I'll be home for Christmas, you can count on me  
We'll have snow and mistletoe and presents 'neath the tree  
Christmas Eve will find me where the love-light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams  
  
Christmas Eve will find me where the love-light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams  
If only in my dreams
