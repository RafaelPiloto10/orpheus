Child in the manger, Infant of Mary  
Outcast and stranger, Lord of all  
Child who inherits  
All our transgressions  
All our demerits on Him fall  
  
Once the most holy  
Child of salvation  
Genlty and lowly, lived below  
Now as our glorios Mighty Redeemer  
See Him victorios  
O'er each foe  
  
Prophets foretold Him  
Infant of wonder  
Angels behold Him On His throne  
Worthy our Savior  
Of all our praises  
Happy forever  
Are His own
