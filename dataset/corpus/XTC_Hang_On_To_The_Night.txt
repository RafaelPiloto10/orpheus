When We're laying in bed  
And We're laying in love  
You and the blackness  
Fit me like a velvet glove  
That's why I go crazy  
When you flick on your lamp  
I'm dreaming  
  
Hang on to the night  
Hang on to the night  
Hang on to the night  
I don't want to see  
That dawn light  
Burn your window  
  
When we're feeling drunk  
In a city park  
Put away that torch  
I'm changed in the dark
