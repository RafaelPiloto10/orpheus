I believe I can see the future  
'Cause I repeat the same routine  
I think I used to have a purpose  
But then again, that might have been a dream  
  
I think I used to have a voice  
Now I never make a sound  
I just do what I've been told  
I really don't want them to come around, oh no  
  
Every day is exactly the same  
Every day is exactly the same  
There is no love here and there is no pain  
Every day is exactly the same  
  
I can feel their eyes are watching  
In case I lose myself again  
Sometimes I think I'm happy here  
(Sometimes)  
Sometimes, yet I still pretend  
  
I can't remember how this got started  
Oh, but I can tell you exactly how it will end  
  
Every day is exactly the same  
Every day is exactly the same  
There is no love here and there is no pain  
Every day is exactly the same  
  
I'll write it on a little piece of paper  
I'm hoping, someday, you might find  
Well I'll hide it behind something  
They won't look behind  
  
I am still inside her  
A little bit comes bleeding through  
I wish this could've been any other way  
But I just don't know, I don't know what else I can do  
  
Every day is exactly the same  
Every day is exactly the same  
There is no love here and there is no pain  
Every day is exactly the same  
  
Every day is exactly the same  
Every day is exactly the same  
There is no love here and there is no pain  
Every day is exactly the same  
(Every day is the same!)
