There he goes, he drives me crazy  
When he says...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
That's his job, it's so amazing  
All he says is...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
I never miss a moment when he's on the tube  
His being there has made my life worth living  
The chills run down my spine  
Each time he says that line  
  
"Here's Johnny!" He says, and laughs in his special way  
"...Johnny!" he says, you know I love him  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and "second fiddle" is his game  
Ed McMahon's his name...all right  
  
Dressed so fine, he's such a cool dude  
Hear him say...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
Watch him selling beer and dog food  
Hear him say...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
I got a letter from him just the other day  
He said, "You may already be a winner!"  
A trooper to the end  
A Clydesdale's best friend  
  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and laughs in his special way  
"...Johnny!" he says, you know I love him  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and that's the way he gets his pay  
What a living  
  
Oh...(Here's Johnny! Here's Johnny!) Wo-o-o, no  
(Here's Johnny! Here's Johnny!) No no no no no no, I don't believe it  
(Here's Johnny!) he says, and everytime it's just the same  
Ed McMahon's his name  
  
A very special guy...all right  
He's on every night  
Can't change the channel  
When he's sitting on the panel  
(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
There he goes, he gives me goose bumps  
When he says...(Hey-O-Hey-Hey-O!)  
  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and laughs in his special way  
"...Johnny!" he says, you know I love him  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, that seems to be his claim to fame  
Ed McMahon's his name
