Lord I must be dreamin'  
What else could this be  
Everybody's screamin'  
Runnin' for the sea  
  
Holy lands are sinkin'  
Birds take to the sky  
The prophets all are stinkin' drunk  
I know the reason why  
  
Eyes are full of desire  
Mind is so ill at ease  
Everything is on fire  
Shit piled up to the knees  
  
Out of rhyme or reason  
Everyone's to blame  
Children of the season  
Don't be lame  
  
Sorry  
You're so sorry  
Don't be sorry  
  
Man has known  
And now he's blown it  
Upside down  
And hell's the only sound  
We did an awful job  
And now they say  
It's nobody's fault  
  
Old San Andreas  
Seven years ago  
Shove it up their Richters  
Red lines stop and go  
  
Noblemen of courage  
Listen with their ears  
Spoke but how discouragin'  
When no one really hears  
  
One of these days you'll be sorry  
Too many houses on the stilt  
Three million years or just a story  
Four on the floor up to the hilt  
  
Out of rhyme or reason  
Everyone's to blame  
Children of the season  
Don't be lame  
  
Sorry  
You're so sorry  
Don't be sorry  
  
Man has known  
And now he's blown it  
Upside down  
And hell's the only sound  
We did an awful job  
And now we're just a little too late  
  
Eyes are full of desire  
Mind is so ill at ease  
Everything is on fire  
Shit piled up in debris  
  
California showtime  
Five o'clock's the news  
Said everybody's concubine  
Was prone to take a snooze  
  
Sorry  
You're so sorry  
Don't be sorry  
  
Man has known  
And now he's blown it  
Upside down  
And hell's the only sound  
We did an awful job  
And now we're just a little too late
