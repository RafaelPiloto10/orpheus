I had a good friend, sometime ago  
We had a good thing  
And we let it show  
Oh I was a fool  
I let him go  
Oh oh oh, how I miss him so  
  
I had a woman  
Who's love was strong  
She gave me her freedom  
And I let her run  
Oh, I was a fool I let her go  
Oh oh oh, how I miss her so  
  
I knew a fine man  
So strong with strife  
He ran for election  
And he lost his life  
Oh, I was a fool  
I let him go  
Oh oh oh, how I miss him so  
Oh oh oh oh oh, how I miss him so  
Ah ah ah ah ah, how I miss him so
