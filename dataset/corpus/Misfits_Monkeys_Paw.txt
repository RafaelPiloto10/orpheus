No stone cries tears for the dead  
Christmas presents in cold white linen  
No stones cries tears for the dead  
Too late for pity, too late for revenge  
  
Coins in a fountain, coins in a well  
You dream of heaven, you live in hell  
  
Tonight, I cast this spell  
With this monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
Tonight, I cast this spell  
With this monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
No stone tries to bring back the dead  
Too late for stories, too late for forgiveness  
No stone tries to bring back the dead  
All these tales are best forgotten  
  
Coins in a fountain, coins in a well  
You dream of heaven, you live in hell  
  
Tonight, I cast this spell  
With this monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
Tonight, I cast this spell  
With this monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
Monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you  
  
Monkey's paw  
Three wishes, for you
