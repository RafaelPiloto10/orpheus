[Verse 1]  
I don't want your God and your higher power  
I want power to get higher  
And I'm not a liar, and I'm not a liar  
When you look up, what do you see?  
I don't need a motherfucker looking down on me  
Motherfucker looking down on me  
At least I know wherever I go  
I've got the devil beneath my feet  
At least I know wherever I go  
I've got the devil beneath my feet  
Beneath my feet  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't bring your black heart to bed  
When I wake up you best be God  
Or you better be dead  
  
Don't bring your black hearth to bed  
When I wake up you best be God  
Or you better be dead  
  
[Verse 2]  
This what happens when you put an apple on your head  
You can laugh all day but you can't laugh the darkness away  
Can't laugh the darkness away  
Too many pills and not enough kills  
I need the Bug House, or the Big House  
They'll never take me alive, never take me alive  
Never fucking take me alive  
It's better to be blamed for robbing Peter  
Than guilty for paying Paul  
It's better to be blamed for robbing Peter  
Than guilty for paying Paul  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't bring your black heart to bed  
When I wake up you best be God  
Or you better be dead
