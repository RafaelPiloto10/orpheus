(chorus)  
Love is all is alright  
But you left it a little to late  
Love is all is alright  
But you've got to find a little more hate.  
  
Take the man in the white cloak  
A pointed mask to hide his face  
Murders in the name of religion  
If you're not the right colour or race.  
Take the man in the black cloak  
He's holding justice in his hands,  
Lets the man in the white cloak go,  
Calls it the law of the land.  
  
(chorus)  
Love is all is alright.......etc  
  
Take the man in the brown shirt  
A burning hatred in his eyes  
Fired by ignorant reaction,  
Fanned by political lies  
Take the man in the blue cap  
His back's against the wall  
Links arms with the man in the brown shirt  
He's trying to break his own fall.  
  
(chorus)  
Love is all is alright.....etc
