Goodbye, sadness, goodbye, goodbye,  
I don't need you anymore.  
I wet my pillow evry night,  
But now I saw the light.  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, sadness,  
I don't need you anymore.  
Goodbye, goodbye, sadness,  
I can't take it anymore.  
  
Goodbye, sadness, goodbye, goodbye,  
I don't need you anymore.  
I lived in fear evry day,  
But now I'm going my way.  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, sadness,  
I don't need you anymore.  
Goodbye, goodbye, sadness,  
I can't take it anymore.  
  
Hello, happiness, wherever you are,  
I hope you hear my song.  
Never want to cry again  
Or hold my breath in fear again.  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, sadness,  
I don't need you anymore.  
Goodbye, goodbye, sadness,  
I can't take it anymore.
