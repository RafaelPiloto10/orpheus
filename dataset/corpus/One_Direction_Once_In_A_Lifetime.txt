Once in a lifetime  
It's just right  
We make no mistakes  
Not even the landslide or riptide  
Could take it all the way  
  
[Zayn]  
Somehow, I feel like nothings has changed  
Right now, my heart is beating the same  
Out loud, someone's calling my name  
  
It sounds like you  
  
When I close my eyes  
All the stars align  
And you are by my side  
You are by my side  
  
Once in a lifetime  
It's just right  
That we are always safe  
  
Not even the bad guys in The Dark Knight  
Could take it all the way  
  
Somehow, I feel like nothings has changed  
Right now, my heart is beating the same  
Out loud, someone's calling my name  
  
It sounds like you  
  
When I close my eyes  
All the stars align  
And you are by my side  
You are by my side  
You are by my side  
  
Once in a lifetime you were mine
