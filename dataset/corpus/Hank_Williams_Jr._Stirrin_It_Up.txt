All the talk shows, you know, geniouses and experts  
Looking to lay some blame  
Some on the left and some on the right  
Playing that controversy game  
I'm not in a real cheery mood so I think I'll call them up  
And them em, why don't you play some blues  
And both sides shut up  
  
But do we just love trouble  
Ain't the world got enough  
Without y'all stirrin it up  
  
I am from the old school  
Cowboy hat, sure enough  
Too damn old to change horses now  
Cause I would probably fall off  
I'm a little whiskey bent and slowed my roll  
And if you ain't real sure about me  
Why don't you take it up with Gretchen and Tim  
Rockin Shawn Hannity  
  
But you just love trouble  
Ain't the world got enough  
Without y'all stirrin it up  
  
Back off  
  
So some celeb has teed y'all off  
Well, I get teed off too  
Why didn't you know that you're supposed  
To except our point of view  
I have learned at the school of hard knocks  
Things change quite a bit  
Folks get all jacked up  
I don't really give a... Darn  
  
I got a little child and a fishing pole  
A can of worms and a boat  
I'm goin down to the river now  
And let all my problems float  
Yeah, I've mellowed a lot  
And I don't jump into things like I used to  
Hey, what'd you say  
Why, you son of a gun  
Now see what you made me do  
  
I don't want no trouble  
Ain't the world got enough  
Without y'all stirrin it up  
  
Stirrin it up  
  
Let the pot simmer (stirrin it up)  
Let the dust settle (stirrin it up)  
Let's try and get along  
And it'll be more better  
(Stirrin it, stirrin it, stirrin it up)  
(Stirrin it up) sick em, Rush  
(Stirrin it up) jump in there, Bill  
Stir it up, Shawn  
(Stirrin it up)  
(Stirrin it up)
