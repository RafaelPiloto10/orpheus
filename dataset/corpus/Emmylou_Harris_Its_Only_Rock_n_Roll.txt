Well, it's only rock and roll keep you running from yourself  
When the only way to slow down is to fall  
And it's only rock and roll that caused you to leave home  
When the only way to get back is to crawl  
  
But the record people love you they can get you on the bill  
Change your name to money dress up fit to kill  
People all around you everywhere you go  
Don't worry if they love you son it's only rock and roll  
  
Yes and it's only rock and roll keep you jumping all the time  
When you really ought to sit this one out  
And it's only rock and roll keep on messin' with your mind when  
You don't know what they're talkin' about  
  
All around the world everywhere you go  
People got to have it 'cause it's only rock and roll  
  
It's only rock and roll yes it's only rock and roll  
People all around you everywhere you go  
Don't worry if they love you, 'cause it's only rock and roll  
  
Well it's only rock and roll when your money's in the mail  
And your love's on the back of the bus  
And it's only rock and roll when your records start to sell  
And you don't know why they're making such a fuss  
  
Telephone receiver ringin' off the wall  
Can I get witness each and every call  
Second that emotion chased into your soul  
Don't worry lest you linger, son it's only rock and roll  
  
It's only rock and roll yes it's only rock and roll  
People all around you everywhere you go  
Don't worry if they love you, 'cause it's only rock and roll  
  
It's only rock and roll. yeah it's only rock and roll  
All around the world everywhere you go  
People got to have it son it's only rock and roll
