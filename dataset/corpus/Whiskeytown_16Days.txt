16 Days  
Got sixteen days  
One for every time I've gone awayOne for every time I should have stayedShould
have wore my wedding ring  
Got sixteen days  
Fifteen of those are nightsCan't sleep when the bed sheet fightsIt's way back
to your side  
Well the ghost has got me running  
Well the ghost has got me running  
Away from you, away from you, awayWell the ghost has got me running  
Well the ghost has got me running  
Away from you, away from you, away  
Got sixteen days  
Got a bottle and a rosaryGod I wish that you were close to meI guess I owe you
an apology  
Got sixteen days  
Fifteen of those are nights  
Can't sleep when the bed sheet fightsIts way back to your side  
Well the ghost has got me running  
Well the ghost has got me runningAway from you, away from you, awayWell the
ghost has got me running  
Well the ghost has got me runningAway from you, away from you, away  
Old tin cups, little paper dolls  
All wrapped up in ribbons bows and hearts  
Old tin cups and little paper dolls  
All wrapped up in the ribbons of your heart  
I got sixteen days  
Sixteen days  
I got sixteen days  
It's like a fool I am
