My mouth was a crib, and it was growing lies  
I didn't know what love was on that day  
My heart's a tiny bloodclot, I picked at it  
It never heals, it never goes away  
  
Burned all the good things in the eden eye  
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die(2x)  
  
This was never my world, you took the angel away  
I killed myself to make everybody pay(2x)  
  
I would have told her that she was the only thing  
that I could love in this dying world  
But the simple word of love itself  
already died and went away  
  
This was never my world, you took the angel away  
I killed myself to make everybody pay(2x)  
  
Burned all the good things in the eden eye  
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die(2x)  
  
This was never my world, you took the angel away  
I killed myself to make everybody pay(4x)  
  
Her heart's a bloodstained egg  
We didn't handle with care  
It's broken and bleeding  
and we can never repair(2x)  
  
and we can never repair
