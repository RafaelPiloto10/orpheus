Am I to believe  
That a God would give His Son?  
Am I to believe  
That the world was bought with love?  
Am I to believe  
That a stranger died for me?  
Am I to believe  
That a Saviour set me free?  
Cause I have felt the cold rain  
Run down my face  
I've seen the sun rise up  
As the night turns to day  
I've heard the laughter  
As the children play  
But above all  
I just live to say that  
Chorus:  
Yeah, oh yeah  
I believe in the God of love  
Yeah, oh yeah  
I believe in the risen son  
Am I to believe  
That the sick shall overcome?  
Am I to believe  
That my freedom has been won?  
I believe in You
