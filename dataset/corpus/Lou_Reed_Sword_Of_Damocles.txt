I see the sword of Damocles is right above your head  
They're trying a new treatment to get you out of bed  
But radiation kills both bad and good  
It can not differentiate  
So to cure you they must kill you  
The sword of Damocles hangs above your head  
  
Now I have seen lots of peoples die  
From car crashes or drugs  
Last night on 33rd street, I saw a kid get hit by a bus  
Bus this drawn out torture over which part of you lives  
Is very hard to take  
To cure you, they must kill you  
The sword of Damocles above your head  
  
That mix of morphine and Dexedrine  
We use it on the street  
It kills the pain and keeps you up  
Your very soul to keep  
But this guessing game has its own rules  
The good don't always win  
And might makes right  
The sword of Damocles  
Is hanging above your head  
  
It seems everything's done that must be done  
From over here, though things don't seem fair  
But there are things that we can't know  
Maybe there's something over there  
Some other world that we don't know about  
I know you hate that mystic shit  
It's just another way of seeing  
The sword of Damocles above your head
