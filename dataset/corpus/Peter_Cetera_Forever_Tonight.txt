Feel your breath on my shoulder  
And I know we couldn't get any closer  
I don't wanna act tough, I just wanna fall in love  
As we move into the night I get crazy  
Thinking how it's gonna be with you baby  
I don't wanna play rough I've been loving you enough  
Oh, baby  
(chorus) I wanna take forever tonight  
Wanna stay in this moment forever  
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got  
I wanna take forever tonight  
Fill you up, fill you up with love  
When we close the door all I need is in your eyes  
I wanna take forever tonight  
Touch my lips, I'm on fire  
You're the only one I'll ever desire  
Turn the lights down low, make the world go slow  
When I'm holding you tonight it's so easy  
Nothing moves me like you do when you tease me  
And to rush would be a crime  
I just wanna spend some time with you baby  
Chorus  
And when I'm here beside you  
I wanna see what drives you out of your mind  
I never wanna leave I only wanna be with you  
'cause I love how you feel your love is so real  
I wanna take forever tonight  
Wanna stay in this moment forever  
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got  
I wanna take forever tonight  
Wanna stay in this moment forever  
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got  
'cause I can't live without you
