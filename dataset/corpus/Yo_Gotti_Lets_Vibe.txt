And that's rea  
Ooh yeah yay, Yo Gotti, Pleasure P  
Let's do it, yeah  
  
Shawty ride or die here if I'm sober or high  
She know just what to do to help a gangsta' get by  
Shawty know I like head, she ain't trippin' at all  
She go down on a nigga' and she a-swallow it all  
Me and her done it all, catch us both at the mall  
She can get what she wanna and it ain't trickin' at all  
Shawty fuck with her nigga' her nigga' fuck with her back  
She put her life on the line 'cause she a-ride with this sack  
Wen I went back to the hood hustlin', movin' them birds  
She was takin' up nursing, studying gettin' what's hers  
I ain't chase her or sweat her try my best to protect her  
When you fuck with a gangsta' baby, you bet I'mma bless ya  
And that's real  
  
If you wanna come ride then (let's ride)  
If you wanna come smoke then (let's smoke)  
If you wanna come drink then (let's drink)  
If you wanna come vibe then (let's vibe)  
Come vibe bay  
I been thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you  
I been thinkin' bout kissin' you  
And touchin' and holdin' you (that's all I wanna do baby)  
  
When we out on the road grinding doin' my shows  
She be callin' my phone like don't be fuckin' them 'hoes  
She at home with my child I be flirtin' in the crowd  
I need help I can't control myself these 'hoes be wild  
Sometimes I think to myself, another nigga' in my bed  
So I stop thinking all that shit'll fuck yo' head.  
I take federal chances I work so hard for the bread.  
Wonder if she a-keep it real if I eva' go to the fed  
She gon' write me and visit me like I think that she should  
Or she gon' disrespect me fuck another nigga' out the hood  
I ain't chase her or sweat her try my best to protect her  
I don't know about love I just know, just know money and pleasure  
Believe that  
  
If you wanna come ride then (let's ride)  
If you wanna come smoke then (let's smoke)  
If you wanna come drink then (let's drink)  
If you wanna come vibe then (let's vibe)  
Come vibe bay  
I been thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you  
I been thinkin' bout kissin' you  
And touchin' and holdin' you (that's all I wanna do baby)  
  
Look here shawty  
You know I only know  
How to be one way  
And that's always real  
  
When yo' momma was trippin' talkin' 'bout kickin' you out  
You had nowhere to go I let you move in my house  
You can jump in my Benz, go stunt out on ya' friends  
I took you all around the world and I a-do it again  
You respected my grind 'cause you knew I had that work  
And I respected ya' mind because you still went to work  
See it wasn't 'bout the money, shawty kept it 100  
She stayed into it with her family because they knew I was hustlin'  
  
If you wanna come ride then (let's ride)  
If you wanna come smoke then (let's smoke)  
If you wanna come drink then (let's drink)  
If you wanna come vibe then (let's vibe)  
Come vibe bay  
I been thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you  
I been thinkin' bout kissin' you  
And touchin' and holdin' you (that's all I wanna do baby))  
  
Let vibe baby.  
I'm talkin' the guhs, college guhs

Tryin'a vibe with ya, kick back get high with ya'
