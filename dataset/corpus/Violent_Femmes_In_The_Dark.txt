He's in the dark, night is his friend  
He's on a mission that can never end  
He has a hart that was broke long ago  
He has more women than you'll ever know  
Hi daddy, hi daddy, hi daddy ho  
Hey daddy, hi daddy, no one will know  
No one will know  
He has a laughter and he has the fame  
Gets what he's after and wins the last game  
Knows how to kiss and he knows how to fly  
His life at risk but he never will die,  
Hey daddy ho, daddy, hey daddy, hi  
Hey daddy ho, daddy, never will die  
Never will die  
What does he get out of playing his game?  
Life of regret and a mother's shame  
When he is done and his task it is through  
His race is won and is completed too  
Then to unwind with a close friend or two  
Ask not for me but he'll give it to you  
Hey daddy ho, daddy, hi daddy, who?  
Hey daddy ho, he will give it to you  
Give it to you  
He's in the dark and the night is his friend  
He's on a mission that can never end
