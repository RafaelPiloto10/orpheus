I know you see that don't touch sun all over me  
My pain is wet and you'll get hurt all over you  
I'm another man's woman to you I'm just bad news  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
You turn me on but I can't turn me off I guess the switch is burried in my
mind  
The flame of love is burning just begging to be used  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
You cannot do the damage that I'll do and the first thing I'll destroy it will
be you  
Too many other hearts and vows that I can't stand to lose  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
[ dobro ]  
You cannot do the damage...  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse
