If you play with fire you'll get burned  
It's such a shame  
Even when you try you'll never learn  
To tame the flames  
  
Like the demon's eye  
Watching over me  
Relentlessly  
  
You have got no wings but you have always tried to fly  
Your soul is burning up like a fire in the sky  
Some say I've been had, and that's too bad  
I know they're wrong  
Some say I've gone mad, and that's too sad  
I'm much too strong  
  
Like the demon's eye  
Watching over me  
Relentlessly  
  
You have got no wings but you have always tried to fly  
Your soul is burning up like a fire in the sky  
You're not living what you're preaching and you're not a priest  
You're not living, you are leeching, living like a beast  
  
I feel fine although you give me hell  
I don't mind  
I'm your golden mine you know so well  
Let me shine  
  
Like the demon's eye  
Watching over me  
Relentlessly  
  
You have got no wings but you have always tried to fly  
Your soul is burning up like a fire in the sky  
You're not living what your preaching and you're not a priest  
You're not living, you are leeching, living like a beast
