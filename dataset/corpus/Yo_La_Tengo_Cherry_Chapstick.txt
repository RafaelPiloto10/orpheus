Someone else's date  
In someone else's door  
There's a girl with cherry Chapstick on and nothing more.  
It's such a lurid pose  
And she seems this close  
But not to me  
  
Clear as day  
Crawling home at night  
Wondering why the girls don't look at me when I walk by.  
And the way they make me feel is way too real to believe  
  
Wondering what it could be like if I could be that smooth  
I could think about all that I missed out  
It's hard to do  
  
Someone else's date  
In someone else's door  
There's a girl with cherry Chapstick on and nothing more  
It's such a lurid pose  
And she seems this close  
But not to me  
  
Running around in circles all day long
