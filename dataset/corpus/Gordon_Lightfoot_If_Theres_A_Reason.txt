If you should need me deep in the night  
My arms around you in shades of twilight  
If there's a reason for livin' without me  
Just let me know and I'll move on  
  
Down to the station with the big wheels burnin'  
Gonna get my ticket to play out that role which I've been given  
  
Home is where the heart is  
But at times a good home must be broken  
The wine has grown bitter  
From the harsh words we have spoken  
  
If there's a chance for someone else  
To make you feel life is worth livin'  
Give it a try oh lady  
Just let me know and I'll move on  
  
Home is where the heart is  
But at times a good home must be broken  
The wine has grown bitter  
From the harsh words we have spoken  
  
If you should need me deep in the night  
At shades of twilight  
If there's a reason for livin' without me  
Just let me know and I'll go on livin'
