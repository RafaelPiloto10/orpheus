When the rain came I thought you'd leave  
'Cause I knew how much you loved the sun  
But you chose to stay, stay and keep me warm  
through the darkest nights I've ever known  
If the mandolin wind couldn't change a thing  
then I know I love ya  
  
Oh the snow fell without a break  
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know  
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years  
I couldn't believe you kept a smile  
Now I can rest assured knowing that we've seen the worst  
And I know I love ya  
  
Oh I never was good with romantic words  
So the next few lines come really hard  
Don't have much but what I've got is yours  
Except of course my steel guitar  
Ha, 'cause I know you don't play  
But I'll teach you one day  
Because I love ya  
  
I recall the night we knelt and prayed  
Noticing your face was thin and pale  
I found it hard to hide my tears  
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down  
No mandolin wind couldn't change a thing  
Couldn't change a thing no, no  
  
The coldest winter in almost fourteen years  
Could never, never change your mind  
  
And I love ya  
Yes indeed and I love ya  
And I love ya  
Lord I love ya
