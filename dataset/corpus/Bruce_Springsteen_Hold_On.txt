Verse 1:  
I worked hard, baby, night and day  
The things i had somebody took away  
They took away everything i earned  
But there's one lesson that'a i have learned  
  
Chorus:  
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (4x)  
  
Verse 2:  
I been pushed and i been knocked down  
But i picked myself right back up off the ground  
And baby there's one thing that i have found  
Fighting's the only way's to stand your ground  
  
Chorus:  
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (4x)  
  
Bridge:  
I've been used, i've been abused  
I've had, baby, my regrets  
I've been lost, i paid the cost  
But there's one thing i ain't gonna forget  
  
Verse 3:  
I've heard some hard lines, i've seen some cryin' times  
Bad luck and trouble they been friends of mine  
Got to stand straight and stare right at your face (fate?)  
And play it hard before it's too late  
  
Chorus:  
You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (8x)
