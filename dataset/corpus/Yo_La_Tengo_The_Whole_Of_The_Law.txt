Well, I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean  
If I knew that you were waiting for me  
I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean  
I'd plumb the depths of every sea for you  
I'd escape from my chains, and I'll reach out for you  
  
Maybe I'm in love with you  
Maybe, maybe I'm in love with you  
I had to contact you, found out I was in love with you  
I had to contact,  
  
That's it, that's the law, that's the whole of the law  
The whole of the law.
