So deep, that it didn't even bleed and catch me  
Off guard, red handed  
Now I'm far from lonely  
I sleep, I still see you lying next to me  
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me I  
  
I need something else  
Would someone please just give me  
Hit me and knock me out  
And let me go back to sleep  
I can't laugh  
All I want inside I still am empty  
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me I  
  
I'll be just fine  
Pretending I'm not  
I'm far from lonely  
And it's all that I've got  
  
I'll be just fine  
Pretending I'm not  
I'm far from lonely  
And it's all that I've got  
  
I guess, I remember every glance you shot me  
Un-harmed, I'm losing weight and some body heat  
Eyes closed so hard  
I stopped your heart from beating  
So deep that I didn't even scream fuck me, I  
  
I'll be just fine  
Pretending I'm not  
I'm far from lonely  
And it's all that I've got  
  
I'll be just fine  
Pretending I'm not  
I'm far from lonely  
And it's all that I've got  
  
And it's all that I've got  
Yeah, it's all that I've got  
It's all that I've got  
It's all that I've got!  
  
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me  
So deep that I didn't even scream fuck me  
  
I'll be just fine  
Pretending I'm not  
I'm far from lonely  
And it's all that I've got  
  
I'll be just fine  
Pretending I'm not  
I'm far from lonely  
And it's all that I've got  
  
And it's all that I've got  
Yeah, it's all that I've got
