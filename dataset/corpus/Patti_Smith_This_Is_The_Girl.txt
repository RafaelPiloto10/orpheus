This is the girl  
For whom all tears fall  
This is the girl  
Who was having a ball  
Just a dark smear masking the eyes  
Spirited away, hurrying inside  
  
This is the girl  
That crossed the bind  
This is the song about smothering vine  
Twisted as laurels to crown her head  
Raised as a reef upon her bed  
  
This is the girl  
This the blind that turned in wine  
This is the wine of the house, it is said  
This is the girl who yearned to be heard  
So much for cradling a smouldering bird  
  
This is the girl  
This is the girl  
  
This is the girl  
For whom all tears fall  
This is thegdirl  
Who was having a ball  
This is the girl  
For whom all tears have shed  
This is the wine of the house, it is said  
  
This the blind that turned in wine  
This is the wine of the house, it is said  
This is the girl who yearned to be heard  
So much for cradling a smouldering bird  
  
This is the girl  
This is the girl  
This is the girl
