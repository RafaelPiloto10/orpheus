Keeping up appearances  
Keeping up with the Jones'  
Fooling my selfish heart  
Going through the motions  
  
But I'm fooling myself  
I'm fooling myself  
Cause you say you love me  
And then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say your sorry's  
And then you do it again  
You do it again  
  
Everybody thinks you're well  
Everybody thinks I'm ill  
Watching me fall apart  
Falling under your spell  
  
But you're fooling yourself  
Your fooling yourself  
Cause you say you love me  
And then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say your sorry's  
And then you do it again  
You do it again and again and again and again and again  
  
But you're fooling yourself  
You're fooling yourself  
Cause you say you love me  
And then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say your sorry's  
Then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say you love me  
And then you do it again  
  
You do it again  
You say your sorry's  
And then you do it again  
You do it again and again and again and again and again
