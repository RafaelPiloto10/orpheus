Well even the longest night won't last forever  
But too many hopes and dreams won't see the light  
And all of the plans I make won't come together  
  
Something in the air  
Maybe for the only time in my life  
Something in the air  
Turning me around and guiding me right  
  
And it's a prime time, maybe the stars were right  
I had a premonition, it's gonna be my turn tonight  
Gonna be my turn tonight  
  
Well even the brightest star won't shine forever  
But all of the hands I play are working out right  
And every move I make feels like a winner  
  
Something in the air  
Maybe for the only time in my life  
Something in the air  
Turning me around and guiding me right  
  
And it's a prime time, maybe the stars were right  
I had a premonition, it's gonna be my turn tonight  
Gonna be my turn tonight  
Gonna be my turn tonight
