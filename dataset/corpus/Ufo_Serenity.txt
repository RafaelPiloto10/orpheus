Baby  
We're not looking for eternity  
So smile now  
While you're looking for this serenity  
He dozes out here in doorways  
Caught between wars  
Tells us something is coming  
Won't reveal more  
She shuffles up close beside him  
And kisses his ear  
I guess all our time is running,  
Running on fear  
And it goes around,  
Round, around again  
Like a magic circle  
Till it comes to the end  
Baby  
We're not looking for eternity  
So smile now  
While you're looking for serenity  
Out from the marble palaces  
Kings and queens Will rejoice  
Their importance of being  
Their importance of choice  
And as they swung Mussolini  
Like a chime in the breeze  
The pope blessed his children  
In a sea of sleaze  
And it comes around,  
Round, around again  
Like a magic circle  
Till it comes to the end  
Baby  
We're not looking for eternity  
So smile now  
While you're looking for serenity  
Solo  
And It still flowers  
In springtime  
Dogs howl at the moon  
Now the funeral is leaving  
To the general's own tune  
All the rich and the famous  
Don't know who I am  
The jokers and the jugglers  
Even the prince of Siam  
And it goes around,  
Round and round again  
Like a magic circle  
Till it comes to the end  
Baby  
We're not looking for eternity  
Yeah, yeah  
So smile now  
While you're looking for serenity  
Oh yeah  
Baby  
A little faith or charity  
So smile now  
While you're looking for serenity  
Oh Baby  
We're not looking for eternity  
Hey,hey yeah  
So smile now  
While you're looking for eternity  
Hey,hey yeah yeah  
Baby  
A little faith or charity
