Run for cover, my sense of fear is running thin  
Undercover, just like a candle in the wind  
  
Tell everybody, tell everybody  
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming  
  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Now we're just gonna ride it out  
  
Every morning, I'm staring shadows in the eye  
Oh good morning, will you just wait until I die?  
  
Tell everybody, tell everybody  
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming  
  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Now we're just gonna ride it out  
  
Tell everybody, tell everybody  
Tell everybody, we are fallen  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Now we're just gonna ride it out  
  
I just want to take it in  
Even when your fire runs out  
Will you start it up again?  
We are fallen
