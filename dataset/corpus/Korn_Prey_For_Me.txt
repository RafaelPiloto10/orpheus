How come what's wrong with you  
Darling faces are some we found  
Let's do what devils do  
Hiding in shadows, no-ones around  
Why can't I torture you  
Giving pain you take it away  
The little things you do  
Simply I love your evil ways  
Your ways, your ways, your ways  
  
Prey for me,  
I think I owe you an apology  
Somehow you bring the violence out in me  
I'm just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me  
  
This time it follows you  
Nothings left, your dead on the ground  
How can I covet you  
Give you hell and you can't be found  
My soul infested you  
Blackened thoughts they run through your head  
The little things you do  
Simply I wish you were dead  
Were dead, were dead, were dead  
  
Prey for me  
I think I owe you an apology  
Somehow you bring the violence out in me  
I'm just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me  
  
(Prey for me) I think I owe you an apology,  
(Prey for me) somehow you bring the violence out in me,  
(Prey for me) I'm just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me  
  
Goodbye, so long  
Wish I could stay but everything is all wrong  
Goodbye, so long  
Wish I could stay but everything is all wrong  
Everything is all wrong  
Too! wrong! wrong! too! wrong!  
  
Prey for me  
I think I owe you an apology  
Somehow you bring the violence out in me  
I'm just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me  
  
(Prey for me) I think I owe you an apology,  
(Prey for me) somehow you bring the violence out in me  
(Prey for me) I'm just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
