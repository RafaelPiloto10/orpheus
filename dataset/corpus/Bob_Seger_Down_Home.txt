Chicago Green she was the ice cube queen of blue  
  
She got a tip from Aunt Mary, said.(?somebody?) was  
In love with you  
  
  
She was so nieve,, famous for her childlike mind,  
  
I don't believe she ever opened her bedroom venetian blinds  
  
  
Already Eddie was unsteady on the levee  
Down Home  
  
  
Down Home  
  
Little Willy was Chicago's boyfriend, a local screw  
  
  
He done kicking trippy hippies in the head with his  
  
  
Hobnail shoes  
Already Eddie, pitching for pennies, rockin' for bennies,  
  
Wound up in the local hole, without a radio,  
  
And he wrote Aunt Mary said "Momma, it's getting hairy,Down Home."  
  
  
  
Well it was late in the morning when Chicago bailed  
Eddie on out  
  
  
Which tripped out Willie, oh man you should've heard  
  
Him shout..  
  
  
Their way home.  
  
Yeah they wandered off somewhere, they couldn't find  
  
Any road home  
You know I'd really like to take her but you know I  
  
Couldn't make her  
Down Home.  
  
  
Down Home, get it in now  
  
Down Home, in the morning
