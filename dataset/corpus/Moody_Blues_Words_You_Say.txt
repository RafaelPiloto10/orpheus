Words you say to me  
I listen in sympathy  
But I don't know what it is  
That makes me ignore you  
I hear you every night  
I listen but the words don't seem right  
My mind seems somewhere else  
What else can I tell you?  
I don't know what to do  
I'm losing you  
Something I can't control  
You are in my heart and soul  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
Words you say to me  
I'm living in fantasy  
If I don't know what it is  
I simply ignore you  
I hear you every night  
I listen but the time is never right  
My life is so confused  
What more can I tell you?  
Don't turn and walk away  
Don't leave this way  
Something I can't control  
You are in my heart and soul  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now
