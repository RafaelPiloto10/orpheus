You better wrap yourself around me  
It's a miracle that you've found me  
I can't fool myself any longer  
We're both willing, young and able  
Let's put our cards on the table  
This feelin's gettin' stronger  
I see the sunlit tears in your eyes again  
Now I realize  
Maybe it's the right time  
Oh, maybe you're the right one  
Ooh, and now I understand  
You could've slipped through my hands  
Well, I just can't wait anymore  
There's a chance we can make it  
We just gotta take it  
  
Endless are the nights  
I stay with you  
Endless are the dreams  
You made come true  
Forever in my arms  
You're the reason tonight our love is endless  
  
We better get ourselves together  
Before we hit bad weather  
And we can't go any further  
Won't you give me some affection  
Point me in the right direction  
This storm is blowin' harder  
Here comes that voice deep inside again  
And it says to me  
That maybe it's the right thing  
Oh, maybe you're the right one  
Ooh, and now I understand  
You could've slipped through my hands  
Well, I just can't wait anymore  
There's a chance we can make it  
We just gotta take it  
  
Endless are the nights  
I stay with you  
Endless are the dreams  
You made come true  
Forever in my arms  
You're the reason tonight our love is endless
