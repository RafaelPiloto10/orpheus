I never been on a railroad, as many times as they pass me by  
I never crashed in the desert or seen a rodeo  
I don't know much about the world wars or Vietnam  
I've yet to read about Uncle Tom  
Never climbed a real rock or seen Colorado  
Am I the son I think I am  
Am I the friend I think I am  
Am I the man I think I wanna be hey  
I never had a day where money didn't get in my way  
I never listened to much Elvis  
I can't remember a warm December  
Am I the son I think I am  
Am I the friend I think I am  
Am I the man I think I wanna be hey  
'Cause I'm here for my sanity sanity  
I am here for you  
I'm here for your fantasy sanity, I am here  
I am  
Am I the son I think I am  
Am I the friend I think I am  
Am I the man I think I wanna be  
'Cause I'm here for my sanity sanity I am here for you  
Whether or not I'm walkin' in  
Whether or not I'm walkin' out  
I'm always here for you
