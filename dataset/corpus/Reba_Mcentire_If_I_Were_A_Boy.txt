If I were a boy even just for a day  
I'd roll out of bed in the morning and throw on what I wanted and go  
  
Drink beer with the guys and chase after girls  
I'd kick it with who I wanted and I'd never get confronted for it,  
'Cause they stick up for me  
  
If I were a boy, I think I could under stand  
How it feels to love a girl, I swear I'd be a better man  
  
And I'd listen to her,'cause I know how it hurts  
When you lose the one you wanted, 'cause he's takin' you for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
If I were a boy, I would turn off my phone  
Tell everyone it's broken, so they'd think that I was sleepin' alone  
  
I'd put myself first and make the rules as I go  
'Cause I know that she'll be faithful, waitin' for me to come home,  
To come home  
  
And if I were a boy, I think I could understand  
How it feels to love a girl, I swear I'd be a better man  
  
And I'd listen to her, 'cause I know how it hurts  
When you lose the one you wanted, 'cause he's takin' you for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
It's a little too late for you to come back  
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd for give you like that  
If you thought I would wait for you, you thought wrong  
  
But you're just a boy, you don't understand, you don't understand  
Oh, how it (feels to love a girl someday, you wish you were a better man  
Oh, you don't listen to her, and you don't care how it hurts  
Until you lose the one you wanted, 'cause you're takin' her for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
But you're just a boy
