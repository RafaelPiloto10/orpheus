Maybe he'll know  
I'm not so sure  
Maybe he'll know  
Maybe he'll be my cure  
Ah, ah, ah.  
  
Maybe he'll know  
I'm not so sure  
Maybe he'll know  
Maybe he'll be - oh  
  
Something calls to me  
I know, I know  
I hear an echo start to pound like a drum, I'm  
Chanting a song, anchor me-  
But don't take too long...no, no, no, no  
  
I got an anxious feeling  
Got this ache engraved in me like stone-  
Don't take too long  
Say you'll never leave me say you'll never go.
