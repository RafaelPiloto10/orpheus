So you figure that you've got him all figured out  
He's a sweet talkin' stud  
Who can melt a girl's heart with his pout  
He's the kind of lover that the ladies dream about  
  
He's got plenty of cash  
He's got plenty of friends  
He drives women wild  
Then he drives off in a Mercedes-Benz  
He's got a long wick with a flame at both ends  
He's hot  
  
But don't let him go  
Just give him a chance to grow  
Take it easy, take it slow  
And don't let him go  
  
He makes you so angry  
He makes you so sore  
The weight may be worth it  
But how can you wait anymore  
When you're wonderin what you're waitin' for  
Baby I don't know  
  
But don't let him go  
He just needs a chance to grow  
Take it easy, take it slow  
And don't let him go  
Don't let him go
