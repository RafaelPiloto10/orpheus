Jive talkin'  
You're telling me lies, yeah  
Jive talkin'  
You wear a disguise  
Jive talkin'  
So misunderstood, yeah  
Jive talkin'  
You're really no good  
  
Nobody gets too much heaven no more  
It's much harder to come by  
I'm waiting in line  
Nobody gets too much love anymore  
It's as high as a mountain  
And harder to climb  
  
How deep is your love  
How deep is your love  
I really need to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down  
And they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me  
Do, do, do, do  
How deep is your love  
Do, do  
How deep is your  
Do, do, do, do  
How deep is your love  
Do, do, do, do  
How deep is your love  
  
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk  
I'm a woman's man  
No time to talk  
Music's loud and feeling's warm  
I've been doing it right since I was born  
But that's all right  
That's ok  
We can look the other way  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times' effect on man  
  
Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother  
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'  
People stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive  
  
Yeah  
I'm staying alive
