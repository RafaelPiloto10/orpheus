There was a mountain and there were three trees  
There was a good man and there were two thieves  
A man called Barabas was doomed for the tree  
But Jesus took the middle one and Barabas went free  
I love that man in the middle because I know he first loved me  
Praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary  
The middle man made it possible that I could go free  
A hill called Golgotha the place of a skull  
No yellow flowers, no trees in bloom the scenery was so dull  
Three crosses stood black and bold against a darkened sky  
And not from pain but a broken heart that middle man died  
I love that man in the middle because I know he first loved me  
Praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary  
The middle man made it possible that I could go free  
I love that man in the middle because I know he first loved me  
Praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary  
The middle man made it possible that I could go free  
Praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary  
The middle man made it possible that I could go free.
