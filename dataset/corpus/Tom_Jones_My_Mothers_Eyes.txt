One bright and guiding light  
That taught me wrong from right  
I found in my mother's eyes  
  
Those baby tales she told  
Of pathways paved with gold  
I found in my mother's eyes  
  
Just like a wandering sparrow, a lonely soul  
I'd walk the straight and narrow till I reach my goal  
  
God's gift sent from above  
One true unselfish love  
I found in my mother's eyes  
I found in my mother's eyes  
  
Just like a wandering sparrow, a lonely soul  
I'd walk the straight and narrow till I reach my goal  
  
God's gift sent from above  
One true unselfish love  
I found in my mother's eyes  
I found in my mother's eye
