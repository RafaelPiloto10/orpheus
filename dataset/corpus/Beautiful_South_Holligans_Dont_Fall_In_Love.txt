Vagabonds don't fall in love  
They just wheel and they deal  
So if I turn a funny colour when you kiss me  
I can't help the way that I feel  
  
Hooligans don't fall in love  
They just break up others lives  
So when I come to you on bended knee  
Don't forget my twenty other wives  
  
So why?  
Turn to a life of violence and crime?  
So why?  
Why do you cheat and why do you lie?  
  
Because there's always someone with a bigger car  
There's always someone with a bigger cigar  
If you've been far  
There's someone who's been further than your far  
When you make your cart, you get to the start  
There's always someone in a faster cart  
There's always someone in a faster cart  
There's always someone in a faster cart  
  
Gangsters don't fall in love  
They just roam from town to town  
So when we kiss and we hold and we whisper  
Please don't ever write it down  
  
Hooligans don't fall in love  
They just lie and they drink  
So if you say I won't say 'i will'  
Then I won't I think!  
  
So why?  
Turn to a life of violence and crime?  
So why?  
Why do you cheat and why do you lie?  
  
Because there's always someone with a bigger car  
There's always someone with a bigger cigar  
If you've been far  
There's always someone whos been further than your far  
At last you're straight and you make a new start  
There's always someone with a better heart  
There's always someone with a better heart  
There's always someone with a better heart  
  
But all in all we're not so bad  
We never take from our own kind  
Bad's quite good when it's all you've ever had  
And no bloody good sounds quite refined
