One time weekly rate twelve by twelve room  
Strapped down to the bed now pump up the Valium  
My mind is wide asleep my conscience deep awake  
The promises I keep are not the ones I make  
I count the caustic causes I lost count of regrets  
A surplus of good intentions don't provide me with content  
All I want is just a little content  
  
One time monthly rate still no breathing room  
Pressures building up so pump up the Valium  
I choose the beaten path I've been to where it leads  
Why I keep comin' back a mystery to me  
I found what I've been seeking but it's too late for me to care  
My aspirations leaking form a hole I can't repair  
Maybe I just don't want it repaired
