Leisure  
  
They taught me how to work,  
But they can't teach me how to shirk correctly.  
  
As you see,  
Science once again robs us of our jobs.  
They've put a micro-chip in my place,  
I hide behind screen of aggression nowadays,  
It's just a way of saving some face.  
So now I'm permanently drunk,  
Like the rest of the race with,  
Leisure.  
  
If you think I'm clowning,  
I assure you that I'm drowning here in,  
Leisure  
  
They taught me how to work,  
But they can't teach me how to shirk correctly.  
  
I spend all day,  
And all my allowance on T.V. games.  
Amusement heaven at the flick of a switch.  
Instead of a lathe I busy my fingers nowadays,  
By scoring goals with the gentlest twitch.  
I've forgotten how to use my legs to invade the pitch.  
Leisure  
  
If you think I'm clowning,  
I assure you that I'm drowning here in,  
Leisure  
  
They taught me how to work,  
But they can't teach me how to shirk correctly.  
  
They had retired me 'fore I left school,  
(just saw no point in the standing in line)  
So I spend lots of time lounging at home,  
(why not come in 'cause the carpet is fine)  
What a waste of breath it is,  
Searching for the jobs that don't exist.  
So now I'm permanently drunk,  
Like the rest of the race with,  
Leisure.  
  
If you think I'm clowning,  
I assure you that I'm drowning here in,  
Leisure  
  
They taught me how to work,  
But they can't teach me how to shirk correctly.  
  
Lazybones, looking through The Sun  
How'd you ever expect to find your day's work ...?
