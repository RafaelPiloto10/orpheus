You talk too much,  
Never saying what's on your mind,  
It's written on your face,  
An' in the words you hide behind  
I know what you want,  
I can see what you're looking for,  
I know what you want from me,  
An' I'm gonna give you more  
  
I'm gonna slide it in  
Right to the top,  
Slide it in,  
I ain't never gonna stop  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in,  
Slide it, in baby  
  
Sometimes you seem  
Just like a stranger to me,  
But, all the games you play  
Make it so easy to see  
You're looking for love,  
Tho' you try to deny,  
The things you put me through  
Tell me what I've got to do to you  
  
I'm gonna slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
Slide it in,  
I ain't never gonna stop  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in  
  
You talk too much,  
Always treating me so unkind,  
I know what I've got to do,  
To get me some peace of mind  
  
I'm gonna slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
Slide it in,  
I ain't never gonna stop  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in,  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top  
Slide it in,  
I ain't never gonna stop  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in, slide it,  
Slide it in, slide it in,  
Right to the top, baby.
