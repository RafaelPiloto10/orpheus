I registered to vote today  
Felt like a fool  
Had to do it anyway  
Down at the high school  
Thing about the second line  
You know, felt like a fool?  
People say it all the time  
Even when it's true  
So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
Who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
Cause it sure don't feel like love  
  
A tear drop consists of electrolytes and salt  
The chemistry of crying is not concerned with blame or fault  
So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
Who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
'Cause it sure don't feel like love  
How does it feel?  
Feels like a threat  
A voice in your head that you'd rather forget  
No joke, no joke  
You get sick from that unspoken  
Sure don't feel like love  
No joke, no joke  
Some chicken and a corn muffin well that feels more like love  
  
Yay! Boo!  
Yay! Boo!  
  
Wrong again, wrong again  
Maybe I'm wrong again  
Wrong again  
Maybe I'm wrong again  
Wrong again  
I could be wrong again  
I remember once in August 1993  
I was wrong, and I could be wrong again  
I remember one of my best friends turned enemy  
So, I was wrong, and I could be wrong again  
I remember once in a load-out, down in Birmingham  
Yeah, but that didn't feel like love  
Sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like love  
Sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like love  
It sure. Don't feel  
Like love
