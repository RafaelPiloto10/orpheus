Green lights on Broadway  
All the magic seems to say  
Come and ride with me baby you know  
It's got to be the greatest show on Broadway  
Out here on the streets they say  
You can see your life in one day  
I long I long I long I long I long to hear every single street singer  
Oh what a mood that feeling brings  
You can capture life in a jar  
Chances are that you'll find out on Broadway  
Who you really are  
  
Sitting in a lonely room  
Staring through the evening gloom  
She'll never make the grade on Broadway  
She'll never spend exciting nights  
Surrounded by a maze of lights  
And stars that line the streets on Broadway  
  
Broadway  
When the neon lights are shining bright  
She knows she's going to make it someday  
Broadway  
You can hear the music of the night  
She knows that she will  
Broadway  
When the neon lights are shining bright  
Oh I know she's going to make it some day  
Broadway  
You can hear the music of the night  
I know that she will  
I said  
Broadway  
Oh how I love you how I love you  
Broadway  
How I love you how I love you  
Broadway  
It's your show I know I know  
But chances are you'll find out on Broadway  
Who you really are
