We're gonna take it step by step  
Little by little, that's all  
And a though it may be a long time  
If you and I'm strong, that's all  
  
Winter froze us like a blue Monday  
So you and I we battened our defenses overnight  
Come the spring and I'll be on the road then  
I just hope that you'll have got a hold on feeling all right  
  
You and I should sail out on the water  
And you and I should do just what we ought to  
Some time soon  
Come the autumn we'll be getting home by  
The light is thin that I'll be holding you by  
Not too soon  
  
Winter chills us like a bloody Sunday  
But you and I have loosened our defenses overnight  
Come the spring and I'll be don't know where then  
But I know that you'll have had a load of feeling all right
