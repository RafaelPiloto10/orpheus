Did you ever see a whale with a polka dot tail  
Did you ever seen a man with eight fingers on his hand  
Did you have to dry your eye when you saw that puppy fly  
Oh no, tell me it ain't so  
  
Have you ever tried to shrink like a ice cube in the sink  
Have you ever tried to see what lies hidden in the tree  
Have you ever made a flan and squished it in your hand  
Oh no, tell me it ain't so

Have you ever tried to shrink like a ice cube in the sink  
Have you ever tried to see what lies hidden in the tree  
Have you ever made a flan and squished it in your hand  
Oh no, tell me it ain't so  
  
Have you ever seen a whale with a polka dot tail  
Did you ever seen a man with eight fingers on his hand  
Did you have to dry your eye when you saw that puppy fly  
Oh no, tell me it ain't so  
  
Help me
