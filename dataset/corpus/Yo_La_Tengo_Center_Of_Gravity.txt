In crowded bars, at subway cars  
Whenever you are next to me,  
Center of gravity,  
Can't feel both feet on the ground  
Walking home after dark, past the softball park  
It's clear to me, according to a rule I learned one day in school  
Basic geometry: two halves of a circle, you and me  
It's a familial song we've known so long  
Your clever cuts into me  
As long as you're next to me  
I can't feel both feet on the ground
