And it was morning  
And I found myself mourning,  
For a childhood that I thought had disappeared  
I looked out the window  
And I saw a magpie in the rainbow, the rain had gone  
I'm not alone, I turned to the mirror  
I saw you, the child, that once loved  
  
The child before they broke his heart  
Our heart, the heart that I believed was lost  
  
Hey you, surprised? More than surprised  
To find the answers to the questions  
Were always in your own eyes  
  
Do you realise that you give it on back to her?  
But that would only be retraced in all the problems that you ever knew  
So untrue  
For she's got to carry on with her life  
And you've got to carry on with yours  
  
So I see it's me, I can do anything  
And I'm still the child  
'Cos the only thing misplaced was direction  
And I found direction  
There is no childhood's end  
You are my childhood friend, lead me on  
  
Hey you, you've survived. Now you've arrived  
To be reborn in the shadow of the magpie  
  
Now you realise, that you've got to get out of here  
You've found the leading light of destiny, burning in the ashes of your memory  
You want to change the world  
You'd resigned yourself to die a broken rebel  
But that was looking backward  
Now you've found the light  
  
You, the child that once loved  
The child before they broke his heart  
Our heart, the heart that I believed was lost  
  
So it's me I see, I can do anything.  
I'm still the child  
'Cos the only thing misplaced was direction  
And I found direction  
There is no childhood's end  
I am your childhood friend, lead me on
