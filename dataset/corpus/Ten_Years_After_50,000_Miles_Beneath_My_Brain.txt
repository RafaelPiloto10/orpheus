I want to know you  
I want to show you  
I want to grow you  
Inside of me  
I want to see you  
I want to free you  
I want to be you  
Inside of me  
Love me 50,000 miles beneath my brain  
Love me 50,000 times and then again  
  
Can you love me with a thousand eyes?  
Can you see right through my bones?  
Can you kiss me with a thousand lips?  
Can you melt a solid stone?  
Can you hear me from a thousand miles  
When you're screaming at the stars?  
Can you pull me up to Jupiter  
When I'm all hung up on Mars?  
Burn my eyes with your flame  
Let your world spin free  
Let it go, baby  
I'll do the same  
All depends on me  
Let it go  
It's all the same  
What with jewels that you can't see  
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, babe  
Bring it on home to me...
