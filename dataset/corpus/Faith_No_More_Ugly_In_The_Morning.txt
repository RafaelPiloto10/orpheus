You did one thing wrong  
You woke up  
It looked better before  
More, more  
  
And the stomach turns  
Say nothing without wasting a word  
I know exactly what you meant  
  
I know how piggy feels  
He starves without missing a meal  
Look in the mirror  
  
Don't look at me  
I'm ugly in the morning  
  
When the headache is gone,  
The sun is not.  
Forgot to turn the alarm  
On, on  
  
Doesn't matter how much you think  
Or the number of hairs in the sink  
I did it to myself again  
  
I know how piggy feels  
He starves without missing a meal  
It's getting clearer
