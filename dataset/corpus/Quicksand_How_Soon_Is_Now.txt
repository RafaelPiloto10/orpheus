I am the son,  
And, the heir.  
Of a shyness that was criminally vulgar.  
Son, and heir.  
Of nothing in particular.  
Oh, shut your mouth.  
How can you say,  
I go about things the wrong way?  
I'm human and I need to be loved,  
Like everyone,  
Like everyone does.  
I am the son,  
And, the heir.  
Of a shyness that was criminally vulgar.  
Son, and heir.  
Of nothing in particular.  
Of nothing in particular at all.  
And you say it's gonna happen now.  
When exactly do you mean?  
I've already waited to long,  
And all my hope is gone.  
There's a club if you'd like to go.  
You might meet someone,  
Who really loves you.  
So you go on your own,  
And leave on your own,  
And you go home,  
And you cry and you wanna die
