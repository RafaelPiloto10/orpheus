I drink you up,  
For every drop of you is sacred.  
Every drop I drink you up.  
  
You fill my cup,  
The way you laugh.  
Eyes of a child,  
Lean on me, you fill me up,  
You make me love,  
So unconditionally,  
Generous to me, you give me love  
And break my heart.  
Slip, you fall, I pick you up and dust you off,  
You break my heart.  
  
Rain, rain, rain down on me,  
Again and again,  
Rain down on me.  
  
Take all you want,  
And only hope can i, you wont deny,  
Your love for me, my love.  
  
No, don't cry, if it's too high,  
I lift you up, well make it, make it.  
When I was oh so tired,  
You come along to wake me,  
Time and time again and again,  
With a smile you save me child oh, oh, oh...  
  
Rain, rain, rain down on me,  
Again and again,  
Rain down on me.  
  
Look, we play our cards,  
And I question by the grace of what,  
We play our cards at all.  
Come fill me up, oh, fill me love when Im empty.  
When Im all dried up  
  
No, don't cry, if it's too high,  
Ill lift you up, well make it, make it.  
Oh, I was so so tired,  
You come along to wake me, wake me.  
Time and time, again and again,  
With a smile you save me child.  
Oh, oh, oh...  
  
Rain, rain, rain down on me,  
Again and again,  
Rain down on me.  
  
Rain, rain down on me...
