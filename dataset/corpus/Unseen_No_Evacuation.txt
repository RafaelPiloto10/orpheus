Chaos chaos hear that sound  
  
When the time comes what are you gonna do?  
When the sirens blow, 10 seconds of chaos  
Is it your regret? does it matter anyway?  
When the poisons come from all around  
  
No evacuations  
  
For a split second we're all the same  
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain  
No classes, money, or politics  
Just flesh and blood and eyes of fire  
All those years of fucking pain  
All those years of suffering  
Are wasted away  
  
When the bomb is dropped  
And the button is pushed  
There is no second chance  
Your nations on fire  
You're going down
