For every just man mocked and killed  
For every drop of black contagion spilled  
This is my house  
This is my evil  
For every battle lost and won  
The spangled banners flapping in the sun  
This is my blood  
This is my people  
The black drums leaking in their graves  
The tin cans rocking on the arctic waves  
For every child the streets will claim  
The curse that rushes through her tiny veins  
For every rose that wilts away  
I die a little more each day  
Just a little more each day  
For every field of wasted grain  
The rockets standing 'neath the western plains  
This is my greed  
This is my glory  
For every fist raised to the sky  
The crimes of hate our young sons glorify  
For every mouth that yearns for bread  
The heart of stone proclaiming  
God is dead  
For every soul that lost its way  
I die a little more each day  
Just a little more each day  
A little more each day  
For all the blessings I disown  
The cruelities I condone  
For every beast of land and sky and sea  
That suffers for my vanity  
For every sin under the sun  
For all the tears from here to kingdom come  
For every beast of land and sky and sea  
That suffers for my vanity  
For every sin under the sun  
For all the tears from here to kingdom come  
For every child the streets will claim  
The curse that rushes through her tiny veins  
For every rose that wilts away  
I die a little more each day  
Just a little more each day  
A little more each day  
Each day
