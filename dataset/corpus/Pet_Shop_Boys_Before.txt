The telephone's not answered  
So many times you'll call  
For many different reasons  
So many tears will fall  
Before you find your love  
Before it comes knocking at your door  
Before you know for sure  
This is what you were waiting for  
So many tears will haunt you  
Deny them or regret  
Some man will make you want to  
And you will not forget  
Before you find your love  
Before it comes knocking at your door  
Before you know for sure  
This is what you were waiting for  
There's a story of a man  
Who loved too much  
He ended up inside a prison cell  
You've got to want to give to get it  
Or you could land up  
In the same suspicious hell  
It's happened before, it's happened before  
Coincidence and patience  
Will mend this fatal flaw  
Though it may seem a long wait  
Others have been here  
Before you find your love  
Before it comes knocking at your door  
Before you know for sure  
This is what you were waiting for  
One day when the phone starts ringing  
You'll answer to the words  
You're longing for  
No tears no trade no prison cell  
Whatever you need  
He will return more  
It's happened before, it's happened before
