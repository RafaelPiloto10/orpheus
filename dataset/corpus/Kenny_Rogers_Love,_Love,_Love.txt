Didn't I make all your dreams come true  
Didn't they work the way you wanted it too  
Didn't I do what I promised to you  
I understand it's just love, love  
So don't give upon love, love, love  
Don't give upon love.  
  
Losing you is so hard for me  
'Cause loving you came so easily  
But we see things so differently  
I understand it's just love.  
  
I'll do what I can to carry on  
'Cause I've loved you before  
I can not love you more  
It's just love, love, love...
