Ohhh oohhhhh

Are you ready  
For Pink and Cuban Link?  
Are you ready?  
Ohh oooh.  
  
Chorus:  
[Pink]  
Its Pink and Cuban Link.  
This is the club with a latin swing.  
So if ya wit' it baby  
Blaze up a blunt  
Drink till your drunk.  
Ain't no rules  
Where we're from.  
Do your thing.  
Play how you want  
Its Pink and Cuban Link  
Cause he be shinin' like a diamond ring.  
Now we be bringin it straight from the Bronx  
Drinkin dom prignon  
Till six in the mornin'  
There's a party goin on!  
  
[Cuban Link]  
Yeah, yo  
Mommas be lickin their lips  
Lookin as if they wanna give me a kiss  
Shakin' their hips  
I'm so good that they be givin me tips  
Is it perhaps  
That they think I'm really handsome and shit  
Or just the fact that I'm latin  
And I'm packin the dick  
No matter what it is I'm wit' it  
Don't be actin' shy or timid  
If you want it I'm-a give it  
No gimicks and sky's the limit  
Baby, don't stop  
Get it, get it  
Pump that pussy  
Lemme hit it  
If you wit' it  
Admit it  
I don't talk it I live it  
Give it a minute  
And I'm already half way there  
There's isn't still not a player  
With your ass in the air  
Takin your underwear's off  
Cause I just don't care  
Dead in the middle of the dance floor  
Naked, oh yeah  
Take it and get it  
Cause the rhythm got you shakin' your rear  
You got a glare  
Like you haven't been  
Fucked in a year  
Touchin' your hair  
While I whisper  
Sweet nothins in your ear  
Love champagne  
But I'd just rather  
Guzzle a beer  
Come over hear, honey  
Cause you ain't got nothin to fear  
Get somethin clear  
I'm a player  
But you can trust me dear  
So look it here  
If there's a party  
Mami, meet me at the pier  
We can stay in Manhattan  
And have a passionate affair  
Yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Cuban Link]  
New York City
