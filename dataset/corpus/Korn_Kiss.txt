Some deny and search for things it never come around  
Do I feel like a fool?  
The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared  
And I owe this all to you  
  
I'm feeling like I'm sinking  
And nothing's there to catch me, keep me breathing  
  
[Chorus]  
What do I have to do?  
Why can't this hurt be through?  
I'm going head onto  
Something I know I will fail  
Why can't this kiss be true?  
Why won't you please let me through  
I don't understand why you always push me away  
  
Last thing I will like to do before it go away  
Is cry there next to you  
Cry and talk about the good all days and where they've gone  
And now how much I hate you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I feel the blood drip off my body as it goes right there  
  
I'm not, now  
What am I now?  
What am I now?  
What am I now?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't understand why you always push me away  
  
Why you always push me away? [x8]
