"Gonna do something you might know,  
But don't worry it gets better at the chorus")  
  
I guess now it's time for me to throw up  
I feel it's time  
Got a picture of you beside me  
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup,  
Wash it off  
Got a fist of pure emotion  
Got a head of shattered dreams  
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind me now  
  
[Chorus]  
whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it  
I just want you back for good  
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it  
You'll be right and understood  
  
Unaware but underlined I figured out the story  
It wasn't good  
And in the corner of a mind I celebrated glory  
But it wasn't to be  
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free  
Can't you find a little room inside for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we'll be together, this time is forever  
So complete in our love  
We will never be uncovered again  
  
Mosh!  
  
[Chorus]
