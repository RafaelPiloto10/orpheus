They always said that hindsight's twenty-twenty  
And when it comes to mistakes in love girl I've got plenty  
But the one that sticks out the most in my mind  
Is the night I left you standing on the front porch drying  
Living for the day I could make it all up to you  
  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
Till you're back in my arms I'll be old lonesome till then  
And honey I won't eat and I won't even sleep  
I'll be walking these toes off of both of my feet  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
  
Well I'm getting to know this old town like never before  
Walking every street knocking on every door  
Girl wherever you are I want you back  
I love you baby and I'm sure about that  
What ever it takes there's nothing that I won't do  
  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
Till you're back in my arms I'll be old lonesome till then  
And honey I won't eat and I won't even sleep  
I'll be walking these toes off of both of my feet  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
  
I must have been a fool I confess  
To ever let you go but I ain't gonna rest  
  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
Till you're back in my arms I'll be old lonesome till then  
And honey I won't eat and I won't even sleep  
I'll be walking these toes off of both of my feet  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again
