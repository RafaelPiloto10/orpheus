Colin Zeal knows the value of mass appeal  
He's a pedestrian walker, he's a civil talker  
He's an affable man with a plausible plan  
Keeps his eye on the news, keeps his future in hand  
  
(And then he..)  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
  
While sitting in traffic, Colin thinks in automatic  
He's an immaculate dresser, he's your common aggressor  
He's a modern retard with a love of bombast  
Keeps his eye on the news, doesn't dwells on the past  
  
(And then he..)  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
  
(And then he..)  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
Looks at his watch, he's on time yet again  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
He's pleased with himself, he's pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
He's pleased with himself, he's so pleased with himself  
He's so pleased with himself, ah ha  
  
(He's a modern retard, he's terminal lard  
He's an affable man, with a carrotene tan  
Because Colin Zeal's ill  
Colin Zeal's ill  
Colin Zeal's ill)  
  
Cause Colin Zeal knows
