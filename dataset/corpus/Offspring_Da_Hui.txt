I won't fuck with da Hui  
I won't fuck with da Hui  
I won't fuck with da Hui  
Because da Hui will fuck with me  
  
I won't take off on da Hui  
I won't take off on da Hui  
I won't take off on da Hui  
Because da Hui will fuck with me  
  
A haole with heart, that's all I'll ever be  
'Cause I'm not a part of the North Shore society  
Stuck on the shoulder, that's where you'll find me  
Digging for scraps with the kooks in line!  
  
I won't park next to da Hui I won't park next to da Hui I won't park next to
da Hui Because I don't really feel comfortable  
  
A haole with heart, that's all I'll ever be  
'Cause I'm not a part of the North Shore royalty  
Stuck on the shoulder, I'm not complaining  
Digging for scraps I'm a kook in line!  
  
A haole with heart, that's all I'll ever be  
'Cause I'm not a part of the North Shore society  
Stuck on the shoulder, that's where you'll find me  
Digging for scraps with the kooks in line!  
  
Don't fuck with da Hui  
Don't fuck with da Hui  
Don't fuck with da Hui  
Because da Hui will fuck with you!
