Why should I care, why should I care?  
  
Girls of fifteen  
Sexually knowing  
The ushers are sniffing  
Eau-de-coloning  
The seats are seductive  
Celibate sitting  
Pretty girls digging  
Prettier women.  
  
Magically bored  
On a quiet street corner  
Free frustration  
In our minds and our toes  
Quiet storm water  
M-m-my generation  
  
Uppers and downers  
Either way blood flows.  
  
Inside outside, leave me alone.  
Inside outside, nowhere is home.  
Inside outside, where have I been?  
Out of my brain on the five fifteen.  
  
On a raft in the quarry  
Slowly sinking.  
On the back of a lorry  
Holy hitching.  
Dreadfully sorry  
Apple scrumping.  
Born in the war  
Birthday punching.  
  
He man drag  
In the glittering ballroom  
Gravely outrageous  
In my high heel shoes.  
Tightly undone  
They know what they're showing  
Sadly ecstatic  
That their heroes are news.  
  
Why should I care?
