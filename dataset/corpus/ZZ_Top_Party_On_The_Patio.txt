I found an empty house in my neighborhood,  
I knew that wer shouldn't but I thought we could.  
Knew it wouldn't be hard to slide into the backyard,  
Called all my friends and slipped a hundred to the guard.  
We turned on the radio and had a party on the patio.  
  
Betty's in the sauna and she's getting kind of hot,  
Mary's in the icebox wishin' she was not.  
Connie's in the whirlpool, Jimmy's tryin' to be cool,  
Libby's in the bushes 'cause she's nobody's fool.  
We turned the lights down low and had a party on the patio.  
  
Heard the cops are coming so we tried to jump the fence,  
Mary didn't make it and we haven't seen her since.  
Connie had another drink, Jimmy simply couldn't think,  
Billy G. was passed out underneath the sink.  
But everybody's gonna show for another party on the patio.
