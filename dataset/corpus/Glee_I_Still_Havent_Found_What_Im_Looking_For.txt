Sam:  
I have climbed highest mountains  
I have run through the fields  
Only to be with you  
Only to be with you  
  
Blaine with Sam:  
I have run  
I have crawled  
I have scaled these city walls  
  
Blaine:  
These city walls  
Only to be with you  
  
Blaine with Sam and New Directions:  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
  
Artie:  
I have kissed honey lips  
Felt the healing in her fingertips  
Burning like a fire  
This burning inside her  
  
Tina (with Artie):  
(I have spoke with the tongue of angels)  
I have held (Artie: I have held!) (the hand of a devil)  
(It was warm in the night)  
I was cold as a stone (Artie: Cold as a stone!)  
  
Blaine with New Directions (And Tina):  
But (Tina: But I still) I still (haven't found what I'm looking for) (Tina:
What I'm looking for!)  
But (Tina: But I still) I still (haven't found what I'm looking for) (Tina:
What I'm looking for...)  
  
Blaine with Tina (Artie):  
I believe (I believe) in the kingdom come (Ooh)  
Then all the colors will bleed into one (Bleed into one)  
Bleed into one (Ooo, yeah)  
  
Blaine:  
But yes I'm still running (Tina: Yes I'm still running) (Artie: Yes I'm still
running!)  
  
Sam:  
You broke the bonds  
And you loosed the chains  
Carried the cross  
Of my shame  
Oh my shame (Artie: Ooh)  
You know I believe it (Artie: Believe it...)  
  
Sam with New Directions (Artie):  
But I still haven't found (Still haven't found!) what I'm looking for (Yeah-
yeah!)  
But I still haven't found (No-no!) what I'm looking for (Oh no!)  
  
New Directions (Blaine):  
But I still (Still haven't found!) haven't found what I'm looking for (What
I'm looking for!)  
(Artie: What I'm looking for!)  
  
New Directions:  
But I still (Tina and Blaine: But I still haven't found) (Tina: Ooh!) what I'm
looking for  
(Sam: Looking for) (Sam and Tina: Looking for!)  
  
Artie, Blaine, Sam and Tina with New Directions:  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for!
