Once, did you want to belong  
To somewhere and someone  
And would it be never ending  
All, all that I thought I knew  
Has all come down to you  
And on your heart I'm depending  
  
Please, won't you come with me  
I want you to see  
  
Now, it's not hard to say  
Will you run away  
Or will you find what you wanted  
All, all that my senses take  
Each moment I'm awake  
You were all that I wanted  
  
Please, won't you come with me  
I want you to be  
  
Sanctuary, my sanctuary  
A silhouette that's made of flesh and bone  
A shade of love behind this wall of stone  
Sanctuary, my sanctuary  
Where anything but love is overthrown  
It's just a place where we can be alone  
  
Can you say, I heard you say  
That I'm the one who loves you  
This is where I long to stay  
I want to hold you now  
To remember how it feels  
When there's nothing in between  
So beautiful, so beautiful  
  
Sanctuary, my sanctuary  
A silhouette that's made of flesh and bone  
A shade of love behind this wall of stone  
Sanctuary, my sanctuary  
Where anything but love is overthrown  
It's just a place where we can be alone  
  
Sanctuary, our sanctuary...  
It's just a place, it's just a place...  
  
Sanctuary, our sanctuary... [ Fade ]
