Well I met a California girl in Memphis  
And she tried to take me upstairs for a ride  
And she had to hold me right across her shoulder  
And I just can't seem to get her off of my mind  
These honky tonk women gonna give me give give me the honky tonk blues  
She's a honky tonk woman give me give give me the honky tonk blues  
  
Well I later did the same in New York City  
And I had to pull out of some kind of a fight  
And the lady she covered me with roses  
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind  
Honky tonk women  
And she had to hold me  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Honky tonk women  
She's a honky tonk woman
