She jumped in my truck in her bare feet  
Slid on over to the middle seat  
Baby crack a window,  
Crank that AC, high as it can go  
Sign at the bank says it's seventy one  
But it feels like we're seating on the sun  
That little cotton dress ain't helping none  
'Bout to run me off the road  
  
And I, I can barely breathe  
Then she puts her hand, over on my knee  
And I don't know what to do  
Doin' everything, tryin' to keep my cool  
  
But it's hot, hot, hot in here  
Ooh, so hot, hot, hot in here  
Yeah, I can't take her anywhere  
It's so hot, hot, hot in here  
  
So I took a turn heading for the creek  
That suntanned skin was a sight to see  
Soon as she got in I could see the steam  
Rising up off the water  
  
And I, I can barely breathe  
When she wraps her arms all around me  
And I don't know what to do  
Doin' everything, tryin' to keep my cool  
  
But it's hot, hot, hot in here  
Oh, so hot, hot, hot in here  
Yeah, I can't take her anywhere  
It's so hot, hot, hot in here  
  
When we dried off by the bank, it was getting dark  
We threw a blanket on the ground, underneath the stars  
Shoulda' been a little cooler in the moon light  
When she laid her lips on mine  
Oh she laid her lips on mine  
Oh yeah  
  
And I, I can barely breathe  
Anytime when she's anywhere close to me  
And I don't know what to do  
Doin' everything, tryin' to keep my cool  
  
But it's hot, hot, hot in here  
Oh, so hot, hot, hot in here  
Yeah, I can't take her anywhere  
So hot, hot, hot in here  
So hot, hot, hot in here, yeah (I can't take her anywhere)  
It's so hot, hot, hot in here  
  
So hot in here  
Anytime she's close to me  
Yeah it's so hot, hot, hot in here
