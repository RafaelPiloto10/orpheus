(Ooh ho)  
This is for the little child with no father  
For that man that doesn't have a place to stay (Oh oh)  
And for that little boy living with AIDS  
(Now tell your story, tell your story)  
You can lean on me  
  
There's a man (Oh, yeah)  
Standing on the corner  
He has no home, he has no food  
And his blue skies are gone (Yes, it is)  
Can't you hear him crying out  
  
And there's a girl  
Searching for a father and a friend  
Praying that the storm someday will end  
But instead of walkin' away  
Open up your heart and say  
  
I am here  
You don't have to worry, I can see (I can see your tears) your tears  
I'll be there in a hurry when you call (Yes, I will)  
Friends are there to catch you when you fall (Here's my shoulder)  
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me (Hallelujah)  
  
Oh ooh ooh ooh' (Listen)  
Oh, there's a child who is sick and begging to be free  
But there is no cure for his disease  
He looks up to his mother as (As she holds) (Holds) (His hand) (His hand)  
Prayin' that someday the sun will shine again  
And the pain (And the pain), pain will end (Will end), come on  
  
I am here (I am here)  
You don't have to worry (You won't have to worry), I can see (I see)  
Your tears (Your tears, yeah)  
I'll be there in a hurry when you call (I'll be there in a hurry when  
You fall)  
Friends are there to catch you when you fall  
(I'm your friend and I'll catch you when, when, when you fall, yeah,  
Yeah, yeah)  
Here's my shoulder (Here's my shoulder), you can lean on me (You can  
Lean, lean on me, yeah)  
  
Tell me how can I, how can I love Jesus  
When I never seen His face  
Yet I see you dying  
And I turn and walk away  
  
So hold my hand, let me take you to a friend of mine  
He's waiting just to ease your troubled mind (Yeah, yeah, He loves you  
More than you'll ever know)  
Instead of walkin' away, open up  
Open up your heart and say  
  
(Come on)  
I am here (I am here)  
You don't have to worry, I can see your tears  
I'll be there in a hurry when you call  
Friends'll be there to catch you when, catch you when you fall, ooh  
Thank you Jesus, yeah  
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me  
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)  
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me (You can lean on me, lean on me,  
Yeah, yeah)  
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me (You're my friend, but you're  
Also my brother)  
Here's my shoulder, you could lean on me  
Hallelujah
