Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'  
Waitin' for some lover to call  
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately  
Almost rang the phone off the wall  
  
Lookin' for some hot stuff baby this evenin'

Gotta have some hot stuff  
Gotta have some love tonight

Lookin' for a lover who needs another  
Don't want another night on my own  
Want to share my love with a warm blooded lover  
Want to bring a wild man back home  
  
I've gotta have some hot love baby this evening  
I need some hot stuff baby tonight  
I want some hot stuff baby this evening  
Gotta have some lovin'  
Gotta to have love tonight  
  
I need hot stuff, hot love  
Looking for hot love  
  
Hot hot hot hot stuff  
Hot hot hot  
Hot hot hot hot stuff  
Hot hot hot
