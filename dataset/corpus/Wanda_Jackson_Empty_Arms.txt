(These empty arms I'll have no more)  
Empty arms that long for you and they wait dear just for you  
And these arms will stay this way till you return to them someday  
  
Each lonely night I go to bed I hold the pillow where you used to lay your
head  
Empty arms but not for long cause my baby is coming home  
And when he walks through that door these empty arms I'll have no more  
(These empty arms) I'll have no more (I'll have no more)
