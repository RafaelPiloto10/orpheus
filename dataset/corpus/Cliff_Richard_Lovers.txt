Once they were lovers but now they're not friends  
She's found another and he says it's the end  
To think they once tore down a wall for a door  
But now they don't speak anymore  
So he walks the streets, the few nights he can stand  
Drinking her memory away when he can  
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore  
  
But now they don't cry anymore  
How does it all come to happen  
That's not what loving is for  
And if i thought it was,i would leave here in the morning  
I'd sooner sleep on the floor  
  
Oh when will we learn really what loving is  
It's not what you get in return but what you give  
To think they once tore down a wall for a door  
But now they don't speak anymore
