You talk a lot  
You laugh a lot  
Yes you talk a lot  
You never stop  
No you never stop  
But you never talk about  
The way you feel  
The way we make each other feel  
You celebrate  
And cut a cake  
Yes you couldn't wait  
No you couldn't wait  
But you never thought about the way I'd feel  
The way you made somebody feel  
Do you believe in all you hear  
Your husband's sick  
Your sister's queer  
Your mouth is full of shaky teeth  
From dreams that make you disbelieve  
That all I've ever said and done was  
Wish you well and have some fun  
Have some fun
