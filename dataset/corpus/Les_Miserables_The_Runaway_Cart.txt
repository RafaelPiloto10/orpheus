[The crowd parts to reveal that the cart has crashed, trapping M.
Fauchelevant.]  
  
Voices  
Look at that!  
Look at that!  
It's Monsieur Fauchelevant!  
Don't approach! Don't go near!  
At the risk of your life!  
He is caught by the wheel!  
Oh, the pitiful man.  
Stay away, turn away,  
There is nothing to do..  
There is nothing to do..  
  
Valjean  
Is there anyone here  
Who will rescue the man?  
Who will help me to shoulder  
The weight of the cart?  
  
Voices  
Don't go near him, Mr. Mayor  
The load is heavy as hell  
The old man's a goner for sure  
It'll kill you as well.  
  
[Valjean attempts to lift the cart. They manage to pull Fauchelevant clear.]  
  
Fauchelevant  
M'sieur le Mayor, I have no words  
You come from God, you are a saint.  
  
[Javert takes Valjean aside.]  
  
Javert  
Can this be true?  
I don't believe what I see!  
A man your age  
To be as strong as you are...  
A memory stirs..  
You make me think of a man  
From years ago  
A man who broke his parole  
He disappeared  
Forgive me, Sir,  
I would not dare!  
  
Valjean  
Say what you must, don't leave it there.  
  
Javert  
I have only known one other  
Who can do what you have done  
He's a convict from the chain gang  
He's been ten years on the run  
But he couldn't run forever  
We have found his hideaway  
And he's just been re-arrested  
And he comes to court today.  
Of course he now denies it  
You'd expect that of a con  
But he couldn't run forever,  
No, not even Jean Valjean!  
  
Valjean  
You say this man denies it all  
And gives no sign of understanding or repentance?  
You say this man is going to trial  
And that's he's sure to be returned  
To serve his sentence?  
Come to that, can you be sure,  
That I am not your man?  
  
Javert  
I have known the thief for ages  
Tracked him down through thick and thin  
And to make the matter certain  
There's the brand upon his skin  
He will bend, he will break  
This time there is no mistake.  
  
[Javert leaves, Valjean is alone.]
