I hear those voices on the radio  
I switched it off because she told me so  
She's an investigator, she's like an elevator  
Nobody told me we'd be all alone, you know  
  
Somewhere my friend had left me in that twilight zone, you know  
She said, I've seen your deepest secrets now  
They're just as lightning in the look of your eyes  
I said, I want you baby, I said, I want some more  
  
I said, I never ever felt it like that moment before  
She's an assassin, she's melting steel in my heart  
And I beg for more  
She said, I want your body, she said, I want your soul  
  
She said, a fallen angel takes it and she'll never let go  
She's an invader, she's from another world  
And I beg for more and more  
She's raising feelings cutting like a knife  
  
She's pouring fire into my liquid life  
There's no escaping from her mysteries  
She gives me kisses of the strangest kind, she says  
I know you'll like it, so come over here, she says  
  
And let that rhythm filter through your body, dear  
And then she  
She always did it and she always will  
She'll stay that hunter till the end of time  
  
I said, I want you baby, I said, I want some more  
I said, I never ever felt it like that moment before  
She's an assassin, she's melting steel in my heart  
And I beg for more  
  
She said, I want your body, she said, I want your soul  
She said, a fallen angel takes it and she'll never let go  
She's an invader, she's from another world  
And I beg for more and more
