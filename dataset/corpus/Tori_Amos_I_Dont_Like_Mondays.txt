Aww... aww... aww... aww...  
The silicon chip inside her head gets switched to overload.  
And nobody's gonna go to school today,  
She's going to make them stay at home.  
And daddy doesn't understand her, he always said she was good as gold.  
And he can see no reason, 'cause there are no reasons,  
What reason do you need to be sho-wn...  
  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
I want to sho... ot the whole day down, down, down,  
Shoot it all down, hi-yea, hey-yam.  
  
And the playing stopped in the playground now,  
She wants to play with her toys a while.  
And school's out early and soon we'll be learning,  
The lesson today is how to die.  
And then the bullhorn cackles and the captain tackles,  
With the problems and the "how's" and "why's."  
And he can see no reason, 'cause there are no reasons,  
What reason do you need to die, die, oh-oho  
  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Mondays.  
Ooh-mmm, I don't like Mondays, no.  
I want to to sho... ot the whole day n-down,  
Whole day, whole day, the whole day down.
