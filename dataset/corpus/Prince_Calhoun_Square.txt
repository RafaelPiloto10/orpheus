I don't like this much to drink  
I was there  
I know right now it's hard to think  
I don't care  
But it's time for you and me to wonder  
Why we're here  
Maybe we should roll to the rock and rumble  
Calhoun Square (Let's roll)  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Meet me there  
If you dare  
Calhoun Square!  
  
It don't matter clothes you're wearin'  
Or your hair  
If you're freaky, they don't care and  
They don't stare (Ain't nobody lookin' at you)  
All that matters if you're happy  
And if you're there (Are you there?)  
Don't you want to roll to the rock and rumble  
Calhoun Square? (Don't you want to? Come on now)  
  
Hey!  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Walk through veils of many colors  
If you dare (Do you dare?)  
Jasmine, peach and love for others  
In the air (It's all in the air)  
Don't be shocked to see your mother  
In the chair (Sit down, baby)  
Everybody roll to the rock and rumble  
Calhoun Square (Oh Lord)  
  
Hey, come on!  
Oh Lord...oh Lord  
Here me now  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Calhoun Square, Calhoun Square  
  
Meet me there  
If you dare  
Calhoun Square!
