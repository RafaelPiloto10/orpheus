I don't drink coffee I take tea, my dear.  
I like my toast done on one side.  
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk,  
I'm an Englishman in New York.  
  
You see me walking down Fifth Avenue,  
A walking cane here at my side.  
I take it everywhere I walk,  
I'm an Englishman in New York.  
  
Whoa. I'm an alien.  
I'm a legal alien.  
I'm an Englishman in New York.  
Whoa. I'm an alien.  
I'm a legal alien.  
I'm an Englishman in New York.  
  
If "manners maketh man" as someone said,  
He's the hero of the day.  
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and mile.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
  
Whoa. I'm an alien.  
I'm a legal alien.  
I'm an Englishman in New York.  
Whoa. I'm an alien.  
I'm a legal alien.  
I'm an Englishman in New York.  
  
Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety,  
But you could end up as the only one.  
Gentleness, sobriety are so rare in this society.  
At night a candle's brighter than the sun.  
  
Takes more than combat gear to make a man.  
Takes more than a license for a gun.  
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can.  
A gentleman will walk but never run.  
  
If "manners maketh man" as someone said,  
He's the hero of the day.  
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.  
Be yourself no matter what they say.
