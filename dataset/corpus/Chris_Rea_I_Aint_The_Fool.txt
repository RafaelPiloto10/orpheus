I may look like a stranger with nothing to say  
Silent in the corner while you're talking away  
Your theories are endless, your lips never sleep  
No time for reflection, there's no tongue in your cheek  
  
Oh no, I ain't fool here  
Oh no, I ain't fool here  
  
The muscles in your mouth must be stronger than steel  
You can talk till forever but ain't got no feel  
Your scull must be empty, your brain cells run dry  
Calling everybody  
Learning nothing till the day that you die  
  
Oh no, I ain't fool here  
Oh no, I ain't fool here
