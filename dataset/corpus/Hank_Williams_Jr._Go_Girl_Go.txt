Well the mustang pulled in a no parkin' zone  
Out stepped a chic with legs to the bone  
Alabama figure and a Tennessee smile  
Louisiana walk that'll drive a man wild  
  
Now go girl go... go girl go  
It's quite a show, go girl go  
  
When she goes to the party and she starts to dance  
All the other girls they ain't gotta chance  
  
Now go girl go... go girl go  
It's quite a show, go girl go  
  
Well the way she wiggles when she starts to walk  
All the men want to do is talk  
  
Now go girl go... go girl go  
It's a hell of a show... go girl go  
  
When she eased into my Cadillac  
I gave her the look and she gave it right back  
  
And now go girl go... go girl go  
It's quite a show... go girl go  
  
Alabama figure and a Tennessee smile  
Louisiana walk that'll drive a man wild  
  
Now go girl go... go girl go  
It's quite a show... go girl go
