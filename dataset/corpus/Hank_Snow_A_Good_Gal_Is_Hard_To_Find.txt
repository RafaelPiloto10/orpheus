A good gal is hard to find  
You always get the other kind  
And when you think you've got the best in the land  
You look around and see her flirtin' with some other man  
And then you rave and then you crave  
To see her lyin' in her grave  
So guys be wise, take my good advice  
Hug her every mornin', kiss her every night  
Give her lots of lovin', man, and treat her right  
'Cause a good girl, nowadays, is hard to find
