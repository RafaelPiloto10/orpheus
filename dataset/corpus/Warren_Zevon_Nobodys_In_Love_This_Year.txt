We keep walking away for no reason at all  
And no one says a word  
We were always so busy protecting ourselves  
We never would have heard  
And the rate of attrition for lovers like us  
Is steadily on the rise  
Nobody's in love this year  
Not even you and I  
  
Due to lack of commitment on both of our parts  
We're going our separate ways  
This show of indifference is breaking our hearts  
It's making us crazy, yeah  
You sit back and wait for your love to accrue  
You'll be waiting a long, long time  
Nobody's in love this year  
Not even you and I  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be Mr. Vulnerable  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to be Mr. Vulnerable  
I don't want to be the one who gets left behind  
  
We keep walking away for no reason at all  
For the sake of being free  
No one's invested enough of themselves  
To yield to maturity  
And the rate of attrition for lovers like us  
Is steadily on the rise  
Nobody's in love this year  
Nobody wants to try  
Nobody's in love this year  
Not even you and I  
  
[Chorus]
