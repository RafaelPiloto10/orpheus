It's gone way beyond just lovin'  
And for a long time now  
It's been more than just a thrill  
Oh, honey, I-I-I-I, I believe in you, oh  
Oh, my, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
Oh, my, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
  
Oh, well my friends say  
Say that you're good-looking  
But I swear I can't tell them what you look like anymore  
'Cause honey, I-I-I-I-I, I believe in you, oh, oh  
  
Well I feel it, I feel it  
Oh, baby  
I feel it in my heart  
  
Well you did it, you did it  
My heart is full  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
I've waited a long time  
To have me this feelin'  
A Sunday type of feeling  
All peaceful and out of sight  
Oh, honey,I-I-I-I-I, I believe in you  
Oh, baby  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
  
I-I-I-I-I, I believe in you  
Yes I do  
Yes I do  
Believe in you  
I-I-I-I-I, I believe in you  
Yes I do  
Yes I do  
Oh, honey, I-I-I-I-I
