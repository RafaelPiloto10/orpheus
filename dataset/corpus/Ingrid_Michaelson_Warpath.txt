Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so mad  
You got me running 'round town  
Like a woman on a warpath  
  
You put your spell on me  
Got me rooted in the ground like an old oak tree  
It's so good, can't you see?  
That you've go the magic to set me free  
  
Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so mad  
You got me running 'round town  
Like a woman on a warpath  
  
You got some magic touch  
You got the hands to make 'em all buckle and blush  
Blood runs fast, yeah you make it rush  
I'm gonna live forever and it hurts so much  
  
Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so mad  
You got me running 'round town  
Like a woman on a warpath  
  
There was a time when you were howlin' over me  
But then the darkness fell  
And now you sail the sea  
  
Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so mad  
You got me running 'round town  
Like a woman on a warpath  
  
Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby, you drive me so crazy  
Baby you drive me so mad  
You got me running 'round town  
Like a woman on a warpath  
Baby you drive me so mad  
You got me running 'round town  
Like a woman on a warpath
