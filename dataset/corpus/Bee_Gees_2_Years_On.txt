One year, two years, time goes by.  
People laugh and people cry.  
Every morning the clock strikes eight.  
I go to work.  
I close the gate.  
And on my way, I sing a song.  
About my wife, where I belong.  
  
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather  
If it's rain they anticipate  
Baby make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see.  
Two years on two years on  
But only you can see me.  
Only you can see me.  
  
For what I've got  
Sir Lancelot was just a dream and I am not  
For I am he with something more  
It's you and I reality.  
  
If the cloud get together and talk about the weather  
If it's rain they anticipate  
Baby, make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see  
Two years on two years on  
But only you can see me  
Only you can see me  
  
Two years on two years on
