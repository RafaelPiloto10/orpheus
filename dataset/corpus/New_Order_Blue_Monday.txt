How does it feel to treat me like you do?  
When you've laid your hands upon me and told me who you are.  
I thought I was mistaken, I thought I heard your words.  
Tell me how do I feel. Tell me now, how do I feel.  
Those who came before me lived through their vocations  
from the past until completion, they'll turn away no more.  
And still I find it so hard to say what I need to say.  
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me just how I should feel today.  
I see a ship in the harbor. I can and shall obey.  
But if it wasn't for your misfortune, I'd be a heavenly person today.  
And I thought I was mistaken, and I thought I heard you speak  
Tell me, how do I feel. Tell me now, how should I feel.  
Now I stand here waiting...  
I thought I told you to leave me when I walked down to the beach.  
Tell me how does it feel, when your heart grows cold, grows cold, cold.
