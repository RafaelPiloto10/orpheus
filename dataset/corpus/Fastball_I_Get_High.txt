Too bad I don't get my own way  
Want champagne, all they got is cabernet  
And I'm wastin' all my time  
I feel good but there's a tear in my eye  
Rain fallin' from a cloudless sky  
  
I get high, forget about it all  
Red lights flashin' behind my cracked up rearview mirror  
Thunder crashin' down and screamin' in my ear  
I guess I drew a bad card somewhere down the line  
  
And I never win my money all back  
I'm only here for a limited time  
Probably see me hangin' around by the railroad tracks  
I get high  
  
We used to have a house down by the shore  
Every night we'd take a walk to the liquor store  
And we'd get wasted all the time  
I hit the city when I lost ya girl  
Not so pretty it's a different world  
  
I get high, forget about it all  
Red lights flashin' behind my cracked up rearview mirror  
Thunder crashin' down and screamin' in my ear  
I guess I drew a bad card somewhere down the line  
  
And I never win my money all back  
I'm only here for a limited time  
And then I got a bag to pack  
  
I'm goin' down  
I'm goin' down  
I'm goin' down  
I'm goin' down  
  
Too bad I don't get my own way  
Maybe you and me can try to get together some day  
Because I'm wastin' all my time  
I feel good but there's a tear in my eye  
Rain fallin' from a cloudless sky  
  
I get high, forget about it all  
I get high, forget about it all  
I get high, forget about it all
