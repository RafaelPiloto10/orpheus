You better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why, why?  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making a list  
And checking it twice  
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Little tin horns, little toy drums  
Rudy-toot-toot and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
And curly head dolls that cuddle and coo  
Elephants, boats and kiddy cars too  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
The kids and girls in boy land  
Will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a toy land town  
All around the Christmas tree  
  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
And he knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
You mean the big fat man  
With the long white beard  
He's coming to town
