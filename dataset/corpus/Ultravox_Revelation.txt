  
I see it every day  
As children play  
There's a future, watching, waiting  
No-one can deny  
The reasons why  
We are hurting  
Much more than believing  
You're deceiving with all these bitter lies  
I've just got to let you know this time  
That we've seen through your disguise  
Politically motivated total mind control  
Just as I predicted  
The innocent grow stronger through it all  
Chorus:  
It's no lie, it's a revelation  
Open your eyes to the revelation  
Visions in your mind  
Unfolding in our time  
There's a new world out there calling  
We are justified  
Almost hypnotised  
We are leading  
Somehow we are changing  
Rearranging the lexicon of life  
And there's nothing left to change this time  
Here we all stand unified  
Together we have motivated absolute control  
And just as I imagined  
We all realised we had it all  
(Chorus)  
Side by side, to the revelation  
Open your mind to the revelation
