[C] There's A Fam'ly [F] Bible on the [C] table  
Each [Am] page is torn and [D] hard to [G7] read  
But [C] The Fam'ly [F] Bible on the [C] table  
Will [F] ever be my [C] key to [G] memo-[C] ries.  
[C] At the close of [F] day when work was [C] over  
And [Am] when the evening [D] meal was [G7] done  
Dad would [C] read to us [F] from The Fam'ly [C] Bible  
And we'd [F] count our many [C] blessings [G7] one by [C] one.  
Refrain:  
I can [F] see us [Bb] sittin' 'round the [F] table  
When from The Fam'ly Bible Dad would [C] read  
(1) I can hear my [F] mother softly [C] singing  
(2) I can hear my [F] mama softly [C] singing  
Rock of Ages, [F] Rock of [C] Ages [G7] cleft for [C] me.  
This old world of ours is full of troubles  
But this world would oh, so better be  
If we'd find more Bibles on the table  
And mothers singing Rock of Ages cleft for me.  
Refrain:
