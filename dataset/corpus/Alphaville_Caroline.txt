Caroline says  
Are you really sure that you know me  
I never met you before, can I trust you  
But she's never cautious, no, never, will she ever learn  
Wil she always send her dreams and poems to imaginary people  
  
And she's tough, yes, real tough  
Standing right in front of the revelation  
All of the big city lights may shine on her eternally  
And caroline's eyes show feelings not from this world  
And if some one asks her, where do you come from  
She thinks for a while before she answers  
  
I don't know, I really don't know  
And she says, there's no destination on this spiral highway  
I don't know, I really don't know  
And she says, I can give you names but I can never give you answers  
  
And she says, listen to the music of your soul  
Follow where it's telling you to go, follow in the footsteps of your soul  
Listen to the music, don't you know, it'll lead you where you what to be  
It's playing there for you and me  
  
Caroline says while looking at the polaroid in her hands  
Isn't it strange to remember  
And when she's out, she never locks the door, she is always like that  
She could never ever cope with the real life of the ordinary people  
And she says, hey, listen to this, I should be leaving here tomorrow  
It's so cold in this city and there's not enough money in the streets  
And caroline's eyes show feelings not from this world  
And if some one asks her  
Where do you go to, she thinks for a while before she answers  
  
I don't know...
