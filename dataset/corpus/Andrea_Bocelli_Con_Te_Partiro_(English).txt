When I'm alone  
I dream on the horizon  
And words fail  
Yes, I know there is no light  
In a room where the sun is absent  
If you are not with me  
At the windows  
Show everone my heart  
Which you set alight  
Enclose within me  
The light you  
Encountered on the street  
  
With you I will leave  
Countries which I never  
Saw and lived with you  
Now, yes, I will live them  
With you I will leave  
On ships across seas  
Which, I know,  
No, no, exist no longer  
With you I will live them  
  
When you are far away  
I dream on the horizon  
And words fail  
And yes, I know  
That you are with me  
You, my moon, are here with me  
My sun, you are here with me  
  
With you I will leave  
Countries which I never  
Saw and lived with you  
Now, yes, I will live them  
With you I will leave  
On ships across seas  
Which, I know,  
No, no, exist no longer  
With you I will live them  
  
With you I will leave  
On ships across seas  
Which, I know,  
No, no, exist no longer  
With you I will live them  
With you I will leave  
I with you
