Walks like a crooked tooth  
And sleeps with a Dexedrine smile  
Keeps finding the holes where old memory can go  
And wash it down liquefied  
Keep that old door swinging  
'Cause you can be the freeloader  
When it's closing time  
When it's closing time  
What you gonna do? It's nothing to see  
But something's got you down on your knees  
I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts  
And it ain't falling down by degrees  
I think I'm gonna die  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Your walls are plastered with ham-fist drunks  
And fagans wrapped in denim and smoke  
So tell me what chance did you happen to dance  
With the step that kicked your feet in the boat?  
Loose band on the radio  
All static and clashin' a hob-nailed hint  
You're never losing ground  
It's just the way it sounds  
What you gonna do? It's nothing you see  
But something's got you down on your knees  
I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts, yeah  
And it ain't falling down by degrees  
I think I'm gonna die  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
You cover me like the sunshine kisses the day  
But a pulse starts in my gut now  
And it's gonna make us pay  
What you gonna do? It's nothing to see  
But something's got you down on your knees  
I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts  
And it ain't falling down by degrees  
I think I'm gonna die  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Oh, bring it on!
