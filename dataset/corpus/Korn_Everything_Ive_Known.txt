Away, I see it's going down  
Today, Hoping in time  
We'll bury all this pain  
And will awake  
Something inside  
  
We pushed our buttons far inside  
We tear our hearts out  
Then we fight  
  
Hey, I know  
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known  
I cannot survive, Alone  
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known  
  
Our lives, were good in every way  
Too late, time after time  
Our love just turned to hate  
But we stayed by, each others side  
  
We pushed our buttons far inside  
We tear our hearts out  
Then we fight  
  
Hey, I know  
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known  
I cannot survive alone  
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known  
  
I keep holding on, I feel I'm where I belong  
Every time we fight it feels so wrong  
I feel so enslaved fuck my pride  
Then we meet again  
  
We pushed our buttons far inside  
We tear our hearts out  
Then we fight  
  
Hey, I know  
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known  
I cannot survive alone  
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
