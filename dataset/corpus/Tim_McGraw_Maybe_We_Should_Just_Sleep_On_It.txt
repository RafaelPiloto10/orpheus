I got an empty feelin' when that moving van pulled up  
It got a little emptier as I walked them fill that truck  
And when they carried out your clothes  
It took my breath away  
Now they're headed for that bed  
The thought keeps running though my head  
  
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight  
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds  
I could be wrong but goodbye just don't feel right  
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight  
  
I'll pay them boys to stop right now  
And leave that truck out by the curb  
The TV and the phones packed up, so we won't be disturbed  
There's not a light left in this room, just a shadow of a doubt  
So let's make sure we don't give up  
Before we've thought this through enough  
  
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight  
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds  
I could be wrong but goodbye just don't feel right  
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
