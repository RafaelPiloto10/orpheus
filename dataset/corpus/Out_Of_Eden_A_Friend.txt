Some say that friendships should be a lifetime thing  
The time that turns the seasons, builds trust and gives us strength  
A friend?s a friend forever, until the end of time  
Through the good and the bad, a friend will be by your side, yeah  
  
If you're looking for a friend, you've found a friend in me  
And not just for tomorrow but throughout eternity  
You're looking for a friend, you can always count on me  
Not just for the moment but for all eternity  
  
A friend is one who listens, always there for you  
A yes when there's a no, a don't when they say do  
Someone who'll forgive you and never turn away  
Arms of love that won't let go when you are afraid, yeah, yeah  
  
If you're looking for a friend, you've found a friend in me  
And not just for tomorrow but throughout eternity  
You're looking for a friend, you can always count on me  
Not just for the moment but for all eternity  
  
If the sun doesn't rise tomorrow  
(If the sun won't shine)  
And the world never turns again  
My heart will never feel no sorrow  
For I know that always the Lord is there  
(That always)  
  
If you're looking for a friend, you've found a friend in me  
(Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no)  
I will be your friend till eternity  
(You can always count on me)  
  
If you're looking for a friend, you've found a friend in me  
(Found a friend in me)  
And not just for tomorrow but throughout eternity  
(Throughout eternity)  
You're looking for a friend, you can always count on me  
(Count on me)  
Not just for the moment, for all eternity
