Jimmy Buffett  
The days drift by  
They don't have names  
And none of the streets here look the same  
And there are so many quiet places  
And smilin' eyes match the smilin' faces.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I have found me a home  
Yes, I have found me a home  
And you can have the rest of everything I own  
'Cause I have found me a home.  
  
My old red bike  
Gets me around  
To the bars and the beaches of my town  
And there aren't many reasons I would leave  
Yes, I have found me some peace.  
  
And the ladies aren't demanding there  
They never ask too much  
And when you're coming off a cold love  
That's sure a nice warm touch.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The days drift by  
They don't have names  
And none of the streets here look the same  
And there aren't many reasons I would leave  
Yes, I have found me some peace  
Yes, I have found me a home.
