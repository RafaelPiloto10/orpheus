I'm crazy, crazy for feelin' so lonely  
And I'm crazy, crazy for feelin' so blue  
Oh I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted  
And then some day, you'd leave me for somebody new  
Worry, why do I let myself worry?  
Wonderin', what in the world did I do? yeah  
I'm crazy for thinkin' that my love could hold you  
Crazy for tryin', crazy for cryin' and I'm crazy for lovin' you  
Worry, why do I let myself worry?  
Wonderin', what in the world did I do?  
I'm crazy for thinkin' that my love could hold you  
Crazy for tryin', crazy for cryin' and I'm crazy for lovin' you  
Crazy for tryin', and crazy for cryin' and I'm crazy for lovin' you
