They say everything can be replaced  
That every distance is not near  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here  
They say every woman needs protection  
Then they turn around and tell you  
Every woman's got to fall  
I swear, I see my own reflection  
Somewhere far beyond this wall  
I see my life come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now, any day now  
I shall be released  
Now, yonder stands there in that lonely crowd  
A man who swears he is not to blame, no, no  
And if you ask him has he ever seen this lonely woman?  
He'll tell you, "No, no, no"  
What's more, he does not know my name  
But I see my light come shining  
Shining, shining, shining from the west  
Straight on down to the east  
Ah, any day now, any, any old day now  
I am going to, I am going to be released, yeah  
They tell ya, they tell ya every woman  
They tell ya every woman got to have protection  
Then they turn around and tell ya  
"No, we gonna make that a woman fall"  
Oh, god, I swear, I swear I see  
I see my, my very own reflection  
Far and away beyond, way, way beyond these four walls  
That's right, I see, I see my life, my life  
My life is shining, shining, shining  
Shining, shining, shining, shining  
From the west straight on down to the east  
And any day now, do you hear me?  
Any day now, I shall be, I am going to be released  
Any day now, any day now, any day now  
Any, any day now, oh, any day now  
Any day, any day, any day  
Any day, any day, any day  
Woah, any day, any day, any old day now  
Yeah, any day now, I am going to, I shall be released  
Woah, any day now, I shall see again  
Any day now, I shall be free again  
Any day now, they'll let me be again  
Oh, any day now, any day now, any day now  
Whoa, help me, any day, any day  
Any old day now
