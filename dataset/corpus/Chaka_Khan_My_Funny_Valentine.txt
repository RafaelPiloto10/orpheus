My funny valentine  
Sweet, comic valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Oooh, mmm  
Your looks are laughable  
Un-photographable  
Yet, you're my favorite work of art  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little bit weak?  
When you open it to speak, are you smart?  
Don't, baby don't, don't you change your hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay, stay little valentine, stay  
Each day is Valentine's...  
Each day is Valentine's Day  
Stay, little valentine, stay  
Stay, stay, yeah yeah  
Each day is Valentine's...  
Each day is Valentine's Day
