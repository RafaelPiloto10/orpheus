Ain't it strange that we destroy  
What we embrace  
And we leave  
What we seek  
It's such a shame  
Ain't it strange that we smile  
When we cry  
And no one knows why we are here  
And where we going to  
Ain't it strange  
We could be, we could be so good together  
Ain't it strange that we share what we hate  
That we break what we love  
It's such a shame  
Ain't it strange when we pray, we betray anyway  
And no one knows what we are for  
Why we're so tough  
When we're so fragile  
Ain't it strange  
  
Ain't it strange, still we could fall into a dream, I'd wish no one  
Will catch that fall  
For we could fall for love, life is but a dream, life is but a dream  
All the tears in the world not in vain for the pain is gone, the  
Shame is washed away  
When we're all one, life is but a dream, life is but a dream  
It's hard to believe after thousands of years  
The world is still drowning in blood and tears  
We've been quite advanced but again we fail  
It is dog eats dog on the ratrace trail  
It is getting too much and we're getting nowhere  
While hatred and fear is all that we share  
I can't take it no more when I'm watching the news  
We must stick together or we're bound to lose
