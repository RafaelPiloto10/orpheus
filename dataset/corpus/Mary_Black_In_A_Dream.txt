Something about this is precious, something about this is sad  
Something about this is better, than I've ever had  
Hard and lean, you know what I mean?  
How do the roots become tangled? why does the spirit grow tired?  
Where is the key to your kingdom? yes that's my desire.  
Chorus:  
There are those who live to count the cost  
And then those who count themselves content  
I see heaven wrapped up in a box  
It is you come back to love again, in a dream, this living dream.  
Up in a heap I'm not bothered, down in the dumps I'm okay  
Here in my heart you're the best road, that I'll ever take, I'm serene yeh.  
Chorus:  
There are those who live to take the chance  
And then more who find themselves content  
I see heaven mapped out in advance  
It is you and that's my journeys end, in a dream, this living dream.  
I'm trying to hang on to the essence, I'm feeling more faint by the day  
It took such a long time to get it, I don't want to see it erased  
Chorus:  
There are those who live to count the cost  
And then more who count themselves content  
I see heaven wrapped up in a box  
It is you come back to love again, in a dream, this living dream  
This living dream.
