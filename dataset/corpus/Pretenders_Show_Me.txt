Show me the meaning of the word  
Show me the meaning of the word  
'Cause I've heard so much about it  
They say, "Hey, you can't live without it"  
  
Welcome to the human race  
With its wars, disease and brutality  
You with your innocence and grace  
Restore some pride and dignity  
To a world in decline  
  
Welcome to a special place  
In a heart of stone that's cold and gray  
You with your angel face  
Keep the despair at bay  
Send it away, and  
  
Show me the meaning of the word  
Show me the meaning of the word  
'Cause I've heard so much about it  
I don't want to live without it  
I don't want to live without it  
Oh, I want love  
I want love  
I want love  
  
Welcome here from outer space  
The Milky Way is still in your eyes  
You found yourself a hopeless case  
One that's seeking perfection on earth  
That's some kind of rebirth, so  
  
Show me the meaning of the word  
Show me the meaning of the word  
'Cause I've heard so much about it  
Don't make me live without it  
Oh, love  
I want love  
I want  
Love  
I want love
