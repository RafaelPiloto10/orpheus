Another day is over,  
Another day is done  
And now I'm getting closer  
To the rising sun  
  
Chorus:  
Hey babe, what you doin'?  
Would you like a little company?  
Hey man, how you doin'?  
Would you like to sit next to me?  
  
Another day is over,  
Another day is done,  
Another night I'm waiting,  
Waiting for the sun  
  
Chorus:  
Hey babe, what you doin'?  
Would you like a little company?  
Hey man, how you doin'?  
Would you like to sit next to me?  
  
Well, I don't know, little lady,  
You're awfully pretty, but I'm a nice man,  
I live a nice life, I have a nice house,  
I have a great wife  
And I'm tired of making decisions  
Without thinking, oh oh oh  
  
Another moon is shining,  
Another evening come  
Another hour unwinding  
'Till the night is done  
  
Chorus:  
Hey man, what you doin'?  
Would you like a little company?  
Hey there, how you doin'?  
Would you like to sit next to me?  
Next to me  
Next to me
