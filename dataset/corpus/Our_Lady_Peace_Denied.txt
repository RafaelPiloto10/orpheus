The telephone is ringing, disconnect the line  
The tension is building but I'm alright  
The stars are colliding, so you might as well let me go  
The television is burning because I set it on fire  
The wheels they keep turning, but I'm fine  
What about the questions we have locked up inside  
Somewhere, somehow  
We've been denied  
Hand in hand we walk behind pretending,  
Defending while our souls are tied  
It's only the third hour, my conscience subsides  
But something reminds me that you lied  
What about the consequences?  
This can't be right
