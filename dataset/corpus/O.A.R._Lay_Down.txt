There was a time now it's far away  
I didn't know you, but I knew your name  
We would talk, I got nothing to say  
But hear me now  
You're like an angel that is just for me  
Bless your heart, let your mind go free  
And it's too loud on the Earth today  
So let's go home and lay down  
And rest here in my arms  
Now lay down  
Lay down  
The universe is ours, lay down  
Lay down, lay down  
Catch a teardrop, bleed the heart  
Masquerade in a world apart  
From a mass I got more to lose  
I'm making a run  
So blessed angel that is just for me  
Catch a dream, there's a lot to see  
But it's too loud on the Earth today  
So let's go home and lay down  
And rest here in my arms  
Now lay down  
Lay down  
The universe is ours, lay down  
Lay down, lay down  
I never seen nobody move the way you do  
Rocking steady and you know it too  
You had to come down from heaven above  
And tease the world  
So listen good, cause I'm telling it straight  
I don't got no more time to waste  
I got a trip planned past the sun  
Taking you home  
Yeah, Ohhhh  
To lay down  
And rest here in my arms  
Now lay down  
Lay down, the universe is ours  
Lay down, lay down, lay down  
Oh now I see  
I bought a planet for you  
I planned it for you my dear  
There's no one above you  
I purchased a room with a view  
So we could fly away to outer space  
We'll be alone just us two  
And you know it's all for you  
It's all for you  
It's all for you  
It's all for you  
It's all for you  
Ooooh lay down  
Mmmm lay down  
Ooooh lay down  
Lay down  
Ooooh lay down
