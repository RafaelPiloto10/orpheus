Why I married me a bad girl, tell you the reason why  
Bad girls will even do things on the sly  
Look for your supper to be good and hot  
She never even put a stew bone in the pot  
She's on the road again, sure as you're born  
Natural born easy on the road again  
Friend come by, say looking for his hat  
Wants to know where your husband's at  
I don't know, he's on his way to the pen  
Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again  
Went to my house the front door was locked  
Went 'round to my window, but my window was locked  
Jumped right back, shook my head  
Big old rounder in my folding bed  
Jumped into the window, broke the glass  
Never seen that little rounder run so fast  
Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again
