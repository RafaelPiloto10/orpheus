Falkenhorstbeen and seen down flight from Chicago  
All aboard the African Queen  
I am on a night boat down to Cairofeeling like a tourist with a foreign man
abroad  
Tells it like he thinks it is, but I know he is fraud  
There is a map tucked under his shoulder  
And a cap perched on his head  
If he looked any older, he might as well be deaddressed in army surplus the
files around me swarm  
On a mission without a purpose, I wish I'd never been bornby the light of a
pale moon - Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamenput you in the picture - 1884  
I'm up to date on the literature  
But I have never been here beforethere is a black boy on the corner trailing
me behind  
Stalking like a vulture money on his mind  
In the shadow of the giant sphinx the archeological tale  
Before the eastern sun sinks I'll be learning brailleby the light of a pale
moon - Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamen  
They are playing our tune - Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamenby the light of a, light of a pale moon -
Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamen  
By the light of a pale moon - Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamen
