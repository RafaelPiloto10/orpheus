So faithful, so constant and so true  
So powerful in all You do  
You fill me, You see me  
You know my every move  
You love for me to sing to You  
  
I know that You are for me, I know that You are for me  
I know that You will never forsake me in my weakness  
And I know that You have come now even if to write upon my heart  
To remind me who You are  
  
So patient, so gracious, so merciful and true  
So wonderful in all You do  
You fill me, You see me  
You know my every move  
You love for me to sing to You  
  
Lord, I know that You are for me, I know that You are for me  
I know that You will never forsake me in my weakness  
And I know that You have come now even if to write upon my heart  
To remind me  
  
Lord, I know that You are for me, I know that You are for me  
I know that You will never forsake me in my weakness  
And I know that You have come now even if to write upon my heart  
To remind me who You are  
To remind me  
  
I know that You are for me, I know that You are for me  
I know that You will never forsake me in my weakness  
And I know that You have come now even if to write upon my heart  
To remind me who You are
