Some people live each week in fun and play  
From sweat by you and by me  
While we must toil so long each day  
Just to stay alive and free  
  
Some people live in homes, so content and reposed  
Unrushed through all the woe  
While we share that woe  
With those who have no woe at all  
  
Some people live with much and care the least  
If war should end or stay  
While we, with less, pay more for peace  
Uum, why should it be this way ?  
  
Oh, the day's sure to come  
When we would have to live  
In love and peace and happiness  
And we will have the will to love  
And to give to those who do have less
