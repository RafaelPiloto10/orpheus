Jet fuel and traffic lines  
Pulling up to the delta signs  
Distant shape of my hometown  
Black stain where the wheels touch down  
  
I pick up the morning news  
I pass the man who's never shined my shoes  
Through security and to the train  
That will take me to the airplane  
  
Count the miles on the highway  
(count the miles on the highway)  
The sum of all my days  
(the sum of all my days)  
  
There's a postcard there's a call  
(there's a call)  
And there's a picture for your bedroom wall  
(bedroom wall)  
  
But do you ever wonder through and through  
Who's that person standing next to you  
(who's that person standing next to you)  
And after all the nights apart  
Is there a home for a traveling heart  
  
But if I weren't leaving you  
(if I weren't leaving, if I weren't leaving you)  
I don't know what I would do  
(I would do)  
  
But the more I go the less I know  
Will the fire still burn on my return  
Keep the path lit on the only road I know  
Honey all I know to do is go  
  
A cup of coffee and my bags are packed  
(coffee and my bags are packed)  
The same vow not to look back  
(same vow not to look back)  
(if I weren't leaving)  
  
Familiar emptiness inside  
(familiar emptiness inside)  
As the distances grow wide  
(if I weren't leaving)  
  
And though I vow to memorize  
(i vow to memorize)  
The last look in your loving eyes  
(the last look in your loving eyes)  
It's here dusk and there dawn  
Oh it's like a curtain getting slowly drawn  
  
But if I weren't leaving you  
(if I weren't leaving, if I weren't leaving you)  
I don't know what I would do  
(I would do)  
  
But the more I go the less I know  
Will the fire still burn on my return  
Keep the path lit on the only road I know  
Honey all I know to do is go  
  
But if I weren't leaving you  
(if I weren't leaving, if I weren't leaving you)  
I don't know what I would do  
(I would do)  
(Leaving you)  
  
But the more I go it seems the less I know  
(but the more I go the less I know)  
Will the fire still burn on my return  
(will the fire still burn on my return)  
Keep the path lit on the only road I know  
(keep the path lit on the only road I know)  
Honey all I know to do is go
