I listened to the whine for way too long  
Time for me to hear a different song  
I waited overtime for things to turn around  
Tired of waiting for it all to hit the ground  
  
You said you knew all about it  
What was right and what was wrong  
You pulled the wool over the eyes of everyone  
Maybe I was weak when I should've been strong  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
You took me by surprise and like a shot in the dark, shot in the dark  
You showed yourself in your truest light, truest light  
You saved yourself by saving nobody else  
You must have cringed when you heard them tell  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
You took the wrong turn at the city of dreams, city of dreams  
You ended up back where you came from it seems, came from it seems  
Back there to where there's nothing else to do  
Back there where you can sit and think of only you  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
Cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
Your lonesome lullaby
