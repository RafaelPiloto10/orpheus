Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhh  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
I love you so much  
I want to light you on fire  
Show you how hot you are  
I want you so bad  
I want to punch you  
In your face  
Hit you  
Till you see stars  
  
I'm a passionate one  
And you're my masterpiece  
But baby  
You must be warned  
I'm a passionate one  
And I will break you  
To pieces  
Trust me  
I've done it before  
  
I can't help it  
(I can't help it)  
I'll put you  
On your knees  
And I'll walk over you  
Just to show you  
How I feel  
I'm in love with you  
I love you so much  
I wanna slash your tyres  
To stop you  
From driving drunk  
Come over here  
I want you  
To taste my poison  
To stop you  
From eating drunk  
  
I know you're the one  
'Cause you're not afraid  
You're not afraid of me  
Let's give it some time  
See if you get scared  
'Cause maybe you should be  
A little pain and pleasure  
Never hurt no-one  
I promise  
To try to be better  
'Cause you're the only one  
  
I can't help it  
(No, no, no)  
I'll put you  
On your knees  
I can't help it  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
And I'll walk over you  
Just to show you  
How I feel  
I'm in love with you  
  
I can't help it  
(Can't help it)  
I'll take you  
Like a whore  
And when I am done  
With you  
I'll feel no remorse  
I'm in love with you  
A little pain  
A pleasure  
Never hurt no-one  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I can't help it  
No, no, no  
I can't help it  
(No, no, no)  
I'll put you  
On your knees  
(I'll put you  
On your knees)  
I can't help it  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
And I'll walk over you  
Just to show you  
How I feel  
I'm in love with you
