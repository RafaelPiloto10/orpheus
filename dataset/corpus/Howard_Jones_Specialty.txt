Don't chop off his head  
To make yourself look tall  
Don't tear a strip off  
To make yourself feel wonderful  
Who wants to compare  
As if this was a competition  
Leave that to teachers at school  
Must preserve their tradition  
'bout time you realized  
You are a specialty  
There is no one like you  
Spend your life worrying  
'bout what you could have been  
Can't you like being you  
Don't need a scalp  
Don't need to be a juror  
Take care of yourself  
No need to feel so insecure  
Waste of energy  
To prove a holier than him  
Waste of energy  
To find out who commits what sin  
'bout time you realized  
You are a specialty  
There is no one like you  
Spend your life worrying  
'bout what could have been  
Can't you like being you  
Don't chop off his head ...  
'bout time you realized ...
