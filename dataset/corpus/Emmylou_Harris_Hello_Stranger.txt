Hello stranger  
Put your loving hand in mine  
You are a stranger  
And you're a friend of mine  
Get up, rounder  
Let a working girl lay down  
You are a rounder  
And you're all out and down  
  
Every time  
I ride the four and six street cars  
I can see my baby  
Peeping through the bars  
  
He bowed his head  
And he waved both hands at me  
He's prison bound  
And longing to be free  
  
I'll see you  
When your troubles are like mine  
Yes I'll see you  
When you haven't got a dime
