Who compares to You?  
Who set the stars in their place?  
You who calmed the raging seas  
That came crashing over me  
  
Who compares to You?  
You who bring the morning light  
The hope of all the earth  
Is rest assured in Your great love  
  
You are magnificent  
Eternally wonderful, glorious  
Jesus, no one ever will compare  
To You, Jesus  
  
Where the evening fades  
You call forth songs of joy  
As the morning wakes  
We, Your children give You praise  
  
You are magnificent  
Eternally wonderful, glorious  
Jesus, no one ever will compare  
  
You are magnificent  
Eternally wonderful, glorious  
Jesus, no one ever will compare  
To You, Jesus, oh yeah  
  
Jesus  
No one ever will compare  
You're so wonderful, you, you  
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus (Jesus)  
  
No one ever will compare  
  
You are magnificent  
Eternally wonderful, glorious  
Jesus, no one ever will compare  
  
You are magnificent  
Eternally wonderful, glorious  
Jesus, no one ever will compare  
To You, Jesus  
No one ever will compare  
To You, Jesus  
  
Ho Jesus, ho Jesus, ho Jesus  
You're so wonderful  
No one ever will compare  
To You, Jesus
