Why am I angry?  
Why am I selfish?  
Could it be that I'm  
Just trying to destroy us?  
  
So come back down  
From where you are  
All of your friends will be erased  
So come back down  
I've waited long enough for you  
  
Take me now  
'Cause I won't give up on you  
(I won't give up on you)  
Take me now  
'Cause I thought I'd be the one  
You'd come back to  
  
Why am I changing?  
Why am I helpless?  
This should be my right  
But you found out how  
And you found a way to save me  
  
So come back down  
From where you are  
All of your friends will be erased  
So come back down  
I've waited long enough for you  
  
Take me now  
'Cause I won't give up on you  
(I won't give up on you)  
Take me now  
'Cause I won't give up on you  
(I won't give up on you)  
Take me now  
'Cause I won't give up on you  
(I won't give up on you)  
And I thought I'd be the one  
Who would support you  
  
You're the only thing  
That drives me crazy  
You're the only thing  
That brings me down  
You're the only one in the world  
That can save me  
Just take my hand  
Don't let me down  
  
Take me now  
(Just take me now)  
'Cause I won't give up on you  
(I won't give up on you)  
Take me now  
'Cause I won't give up on you  
I won't give up on you  
Take me now  
'Cause I won't give up on you  
(I won't give up on you)  
And I thought I'd be  
And I thought I'd be the one  
Who would support you  
It's no doubt you'll be the one  
Who won't take me
