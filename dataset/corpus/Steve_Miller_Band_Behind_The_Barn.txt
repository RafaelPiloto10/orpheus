Well, I went to see my woman  
Way back down on the farm  
Went to see my woman  
Way back on the farm  
Sundown's gonna catch me  
In my sweet baby's arms  
She likes to rock  
She likes to roll  
She likes to  
Push, push, push to the stroll  
Down, down, down, down  
Down behind the barn  
Sundown's gonna catch me  
In my sweet baby's arms  
You know, we went up on the mountain  
Looked down on the sea  
Went up on the mountain  
And we looked down on the sea  
You know, sundown's gonna catch me  
Lovin' my sweet baby  
She likes to rock  
She likes to roll  
She likes to  
Push, push, push to the stroll  
Down, down, down, down  
Way behind the barn  
Sundown's gonna catch me  
In my sweet baby's arms  
Woo  
Woo, woo, woo  
Yeah  
Way behind the barn  
Hoo  
Hoo, hoo, hoo  
Way behind the barn  
Sundown's gonna catch me  
In my sweet baby's arms
