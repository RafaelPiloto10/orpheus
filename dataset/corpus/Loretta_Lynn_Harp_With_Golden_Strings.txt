I love to hear those good old songs they sing unto the Lord  
I love to play my old guitar with them and I wanna choir  
I'm looking forward to the day when I'll reach glory land  
I'll have a harp with golden strings to play with the angel band  
I'm gonna trade my old guitar for a harp with golden strings  
I'm gonna play like David did unto my Lord in pain  
We'll gather round the great white throne and make the heaven's ring  
I'm gonna trade my old guitar for a harp with golden strings  
[ ac.guitar ]  
I hear songs of every time that gives my heart a trill  
Songs of love and happiness and songs about the hills  
But of all the songs I've ever heard there's none that can compare  
To the songs I'll hear the angels sing when I get over there  
I'm gonna trade my old guitar...  
I'm gonna trade my old guitar for a harp with golden strings
