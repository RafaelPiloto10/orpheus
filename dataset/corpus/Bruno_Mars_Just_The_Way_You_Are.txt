Oh her eyes, her eyes  
Make the stars look like they're not shining  
Her hair, her hair  
Falls perfectly without her trying  
  
She's so beautiful  
And I tell her every day  
  
Yeah,  
I know, I know  
When I compliment her  
She wont believe me  
It's so, it's so  
Sad to think she don't see what I see  
But every time she asks me do I look okay  
I say  
  
When I see your face (face)  
There's not a thing that I would change  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile (smile)  
The whole world stops and stares for awhile  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
Yeah  
  
Her lips, her lips  
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me  
Her laugh, her laugh  
She hates but I think it's so sexy  
She's so beautiful  
And I tell her everyday  
  
Oh you know, you know, you know  
I'd never ask you to change  
If perfect's what you're searching for  
Then just stay the same  
So don't even bother asking if you look okay  
You know I'll say!  
  
When I see your face (face)  
There's not a thing that I would change  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile (smile)  
The whole world stops and stares for awhile  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
  
The way you are  
The way you are  
Girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are (are)  
  
When I see your face (face)  
There's not a thing that I would change  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile  
The whole world stops and stares for awhile  
'Cause girl you're amazing  
Just the way you are, yeah
