The middle of December ain't the time to be alone  
It's just too close to Christmas  
And too far to go home  
I ran in to a friend of a friend  
Standing in checkout line  
She said, I've spent too much already  
And there's gifts I just can't find  
I walked her home and when she opened up her door  
I'm not sure what happened then  
Guess magic took it's course  
  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
'Cause what happened here nobody knows  
How could something simple as a kiss  
Change my holiday like this  
And we held each other all night long  
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song  
Playin' on the radio  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
  
I woke up, she was wrappin' gifts beneath the tree  
She said, I know it's early, so I thought I'd let you sleep  
Then she insisted I get up and take a look outside  
Hey sleepyhead, it must have snowed at least a foot last night  
That's when I saw it hangin' up above my head  
She threw her arms around my neck  
Laughin' as she said  
  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
'Cause what happened here nobody knows  
How could something simple as a kiss  
Change my holiday like this  
And we held each other all night long  
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song  
Playin' on the radio  
Blame it on the mistletoe
