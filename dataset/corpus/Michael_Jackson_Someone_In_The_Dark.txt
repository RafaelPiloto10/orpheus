All alone  
Wishing on stars  
Waiting for you to find me  
  
One sweet night  
I knew I would see  
A stranger who'd be my friend  
  
When someone in the dark reaches out to you  
And touches off a spark that comes shining through  
It tells you never be afraid  
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow  
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow  
Like it was written in the stars, I knew  
My friend, my someone in the dark, was you  
  
"Thank you."  
  
Promise me  
We'll always be  
Walking the world together  
  
Hand in hand  
Where dreams never end  
My star secret friend and me  
  
When someone in the dark reaches out to you  
And touches off a spark that comes shining through  
It tells you never be afraid  
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow  
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow  
Look for the rainbow in the sky  
  
Oh, I believe you and I  
Could never really say goodbye  
  
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see  
Someone in the dark for me  
  
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see  
Someone in the dark for me
