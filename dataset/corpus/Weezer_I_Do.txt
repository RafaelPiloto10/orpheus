All the times you came  
I should've ran away  
  
You told me that you'd always love me  
You told me that you'd always love me  
  
And the games you played  
Were meant to lead me on  
  
You told me that you'd always love me  
You told me that you'd always love me  
Always, oooh always  
I do  
  
You told me that you'd always love me  
You told me that you'd always love me  
Always, oooh always  
I do  
  
Never more again  
Will I believe the sun
