Darlin', dearest darlin'  
Put your arms around me baby please  
Darlin', dearest darlin'  
Kiss me one more time before you leave.  
  
If you must go be on your way  
Before I start in begging you to stay with me  
I am getting weak from being strong  
The first thing that you know I'll be down on my knees.  
  
Darlin', dearest darlin'  
Always in my heart and in my thoughts  
Darlin', dearest darlin'  
Havin' loved you once I've never stopped.  
  
Darlin', dearest darlin'  
Put your arms around me baby please
