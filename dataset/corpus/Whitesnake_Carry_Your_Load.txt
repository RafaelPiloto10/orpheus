I take what I want,  
And I got my eye on you  
It's late in the evening  
What are you gonna do  
  
I got the place,  
If you got the time,  
I got the motion, baby,  
If you got the mind  
  
So wise man tell me  
What it means to give and take,  
It's double trouble,  
But, it can ease a little heartache  
  
So you can carry your load  
Down the long, winding road  
Carry your load, down the long, winding road  
  
All I'm asking, all I want to do is just  
Put a little love in your heart,  
Put a little love in your heart  
  
I know what I want,  
And it's close to the bone  
Sooner or later, baby,  
I'll be taking you home  
  
You got the cool,  
But, you give me the heat  
You got the music, baby,  
But, you give me the beat  
  
So wise man tell me  
What it means to give and take,  
It's double trouble,  
But, it can ease a little heartache  
  
So you can carry your load  
Down the long, winding road  
Carry your love,  
Down the long, winding road  
  
All I'm asking, all I want to do is just  
Put a little love in your heart  
  
Wise man tell me  
What it means to give and take,  
It's double trouble,  
But, it can ease a little heartache  
  
So you can carry your load  
Down the long, winding road  
Carry your love  
Down the long, winding road  
You got to carry your load  
Down the long, winding road
