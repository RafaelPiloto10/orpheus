It's the way of the world...  
Remember you were in school and I followed you home.  
I remember, didn't think I existed but we're comin' together right now.  
I've been runnin', I've been hidin', it's the way of the world.  
You say it's over, but the world keeps turnin' 'round.  
  
Remember, I knew I'd be good for you.  
No one better remember, really meant what I said, want to be your lover right
now.  
I've been runnin', I've been hidin', it's the way of the world.  
You say it's over, but the world keeps turnin' 'round.  
World goes round, life goes on, and on, and on.  
You say it's over, but the world keeps turnin' round.  
  
It's the way of the world.  
  
Remember, you were at work and then Friday at five,  
I remember, felt like a pawn, was I dead or alive?  
I remember, thought no one could hear me, I was goin' insane.  
I remember, it was a real fine line, now you've changed my life around.  
I've been runnin', I've been hidin', it's the way of the world.  
You say it's over, but the world keeps turnin' 'round.  
World goes round, life goes on, and on, and on.  
World goes 'round, (i've been runnin')  
World is round (i've been hidin')  
Life goes on and on and on ((it's the way of the world).
