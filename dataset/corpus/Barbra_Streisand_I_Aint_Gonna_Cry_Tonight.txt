I'm starting to walk and I'm learning to run  
I'm seeing my friends and I'm having some fun  
And the heartache and pain  
Like the thunder and rain have all disappeared  
'Cause I'm not gonna cry my eyes out anymore  
There's a brand new world just waiting outside my door  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, not while the music feels so good  
You've got your friends and I'll get mine  
We're out and have a real good time  
I'm changing my style with a positive grin  
And this feeling of joy comes from within  
And the heartache and pain  
Like the thunder and rain have all disappeared  
'Cause I'm not gonna cry my eyes out anymore  
There's a brand new world just waiting outside my door  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, not while the music feels so good  
You've got your friends and I be fine  
We're out and have a real good time  
And the heartache and pain  
And the thunder and rain have all disappeared  
And I'm not gonna cry my heart out anymore  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, gonna have a party  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, I ain't gonna cry tonight  
Not while the music feels so good  
You've got your friends and I get mine  
We're out and have a real good  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, not while the music feels so good  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, I ain't gonna cry tonight  
Learning to walk learning to run  
Seeing my friends and having some fun
