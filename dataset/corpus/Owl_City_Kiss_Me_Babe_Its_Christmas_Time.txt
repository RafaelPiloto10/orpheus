Well it's Christmas time, and I'm warm inside  
Despite the bitter cold  
Cause you're here with me, and I guarantee  
My heart is yours to hold  
So we smile below this mistletoe as if we need a hint  
And the falling snow, well I bet it knows  
How love can pull you in  
  
[Pre-chorus]  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Glowing by the fireside  
Leave the presents on the floor  
Cause you're the one I'm waiting for  
Oh, let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's fly around the world tonight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time  
I love the way you hold me tight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
Can't fight the way I feel inside  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
Oh, let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
Well, it's Christmas time, and I'm warm inside  
Despite the bitter cold  
And it's crystal clear that this Christmas cheer  
Is healthy for the soul  
  
[Pre-chorus]  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Glowing by the fireside  
Leave the presents on the floor  
Cause you're the one I'm waiting for  
Oh, let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's fly around the world tonight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time  
I love the way you hold me tight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
Can't fight the way I feel inside  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
Oh, let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
Let's fly around the word tonight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
I love the way you hold me tight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time
