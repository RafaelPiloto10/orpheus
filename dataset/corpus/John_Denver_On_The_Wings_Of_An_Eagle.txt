Oh, my home is in the mountains  
I am free, I am free  
I am one with wind and eagles  
I am free  
Given wings to sail in gracefulness  
The sky, the sky  
Given voice to sing in breathlessness  
I find that I can fly  
(Fly away)  
  
I been a long time on the highway  
I been a long time one the run  
And it gets to be like chaos  
When I'm so long away from home  
And sometimes it's just too much to bare  
And I hide behind my eyes  
I can picture friendly faces  
And I can dream of friendly skies  
  
And I guess that I'm the lucky one  
For the truth of what I know  
For my heart has not denied me  
And I have somewhere to go  
I shall never be a prisoner  
Trix steel and glass and stone  
If I leave I will return again  
To my rocky mountain home  
  
Oh, my home is in the mountains  
I am free, I am free  
I am one with wind and eagle  
I am free  
Given wing to sail in gracefulness  
The sky, the sky  
Given voice to sing in breathlessness  
I find that I can fly, fly away  
  
In the hands of my father  
In the light of the sunshine  
On the wings of an eagle  
I'm flying again  
(I'm flying again)  
I'm flying again  
(I'm flying again)  
I'm flying again  
(I'm flying again)  
I'm flying again
