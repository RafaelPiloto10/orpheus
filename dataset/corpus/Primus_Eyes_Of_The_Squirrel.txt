Barry swing his bat  
Piano playing cats  
Big mouth drunken whores  
  
The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
Drama that's for free  
On reality TV  
Where's that tuna casserole  
  
The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
  
The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
As we change our minds  
At least a half a dozen times  
Are we leaning red or are we leaning blue  
  
The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
The oil's constant flow  
Through the gulf of Mexico  
Anyone for battered shrimp?

The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
Some idiot start to fester  
Where he shot that child molester  
Some call him hero, some call him con  
  
The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
Another arrogant ass  
Says he's got an N-word pass  
What the hell's an N-word pass

The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
  
The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
Brad and Angeline  
Expand their family  
Who's gonna be the next octomom  
  
The eyes of the squirrel are watching  
Obama wave his pecker  
At the infrastructure wreckers  
Sayin' what you gonna do about that gun control
