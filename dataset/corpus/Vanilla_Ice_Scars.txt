[Verse 1]  
Reality sucks, too much pain  
I can't explain why I want to bash brains  
Still I can see it on the other side  
Got a new baby, want to stay alive  
Give what I give, give what I got  
Make it worth while, cause I got another shot  
Broken families that always got pain  
I break the chain, refuse to be the same  
Mother did as good as you could  
After all the abuse I still understood  
Three times divorced, and three times a kid  
Gave us more love than our father ever did  
Now we've all grown and moved along  
Tried to forget, but my brother did me wrong  
But it's real hard to put it all behind me  
It's like a tattoo frozen in a memory  
I can't seem to erase the stain  
In my brain, things will never be the same  
I remember all the lies, fucked up, now I realize  
Never had a chance as a kid, I was a man  
Fight after fight wasn't really what I planned  
Father!  
Whoever you are  
Beat my mother down, all I see is scars  
And memories - what about me?  
Throw me through a window for watching tv  
Where did I get this anger?  
Where did I get this hate?  
And where did I get my temper?  
Now I'm gonna show my faith  
(huh) never will I be like you, be like you  
Fucked up, that shit, I'm staying true  
My family, true to my family  
I'm true to my family  
True to my family  
Stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
True to my family  
True  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true  
True to my family  
Stay true, stay true  
Never will I be like you, never will I be like you (Repeat to end)
