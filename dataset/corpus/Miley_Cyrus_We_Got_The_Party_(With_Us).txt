C'mon guys tell me what were doin'  
Were hanging around when we could be all over the place  
  
The sun is shinin' just the way we like it  
Lets get out of this hallway show the world our face  
  
It's friday but there's no where to go  
Anywhere is cool but were not going home  
  
We can do anything we wanna do  
It's all up to me and you  
  
PART2:  
Turn this park into a club  
The stars are lights and the moon is a vibe from above us  
Skateboards, here's our ride  
So pull on up everyone is waiting for us  
  
CHORUS:  
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go,  
everybody kno-ows  
We got the party with us  
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go,  
everybody kno-ows  
We got the party with us  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh  
We got the party with us  
Oh oh oh oh oh ohhh  
We got the party with us  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
We got the party with us  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
We got the party with us  
  
  
Radio, let me be your DJ  
I'll turn you up because we're moving 'till we're on a ro-o-oll  
  
  
Everyone is dancing to their own beat  
And letting go, everybody here's out a so-o-oul  
  
  
It's Friday and there's nowhere to be  
We're kickin' it together it's so good to be free  
  
We got each other and that's all we need  
The rest is up to you and me  
  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
  
So anywhere we are  
Anywhere we go  
Everybody knows  
We got the party with us  
Anywhere we are  
Anywhere we go  
Everybody knows  
We got the party with us  
  
Wooo!  
We got the party!  
  
Life is for dreamers and I'm a believer  
That nothing can stand in our way today to start the place to play  
  
  
[Chorus:]  
Turn this park into a club  
the stars and lights and the moon is a vibe from above  
These skateboard's here's our ride so pull on up  
So pull on up everyone is waiting for us  
  
Anywhere we are  
Anywhere we go  
Everybody knows  
We got the party with us  
Anywhere we are  
Anywhere we go  
Everybody knows  
We got the party with us  
  
Turn this park into a club  
the stars and lights and the moon is a vibe from above  
We got the party with us  
Skateboards, heels  
So pull on up everyone is waiting for us  
  
Anywhere we are  
Anywhere we go  
Everybody knows  
We got the party with us  
Anywhere we are  
Anywhere we go  
Everybody knows  
Oh oh oh  
We got the party, we got the party, we got the party, we got the party with us  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
We got the party with us
