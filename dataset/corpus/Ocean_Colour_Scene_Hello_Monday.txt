Hello Monday my old friend  
I come with you to talk again  
And then again I'm still waiting  
There's no point in hanging on  
Watching the sun go down  
Spinning round and round  
  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming  
  
Hello Monday my old friend  
I come with you to talk again  
And then again I'm still waiting  
What's point in hanging on  
Watching the sun go down  
Spinning round and round and round and round  
  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming for me  
Oh for me, for me,  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know  
  
What's the point in hanging on  
After the sun is gone  
I'm hanging on and on and on and on  
  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming
