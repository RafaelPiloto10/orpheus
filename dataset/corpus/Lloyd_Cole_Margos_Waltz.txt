She said don't worry, baby  
I'll do my own crying  
I'm a big girl now  
Now I'm gonna be okay  
Yes, I'll find a new way of living  
You know I will  
And you lie there without sleeping  
And you stare at your wall  
And you realize you're not weeping  
You don't need her anymore  
You say don't hate me, baby  
It won't hurt you if you do  
You got no reason not to  
She'll kiss you on the head  
Says there's no easy road for leaving  
If it hurts you too  
And you lie there without sleeping  
And you stare at your wall  
And you realize you're not weeping  
You don't need her anymore  
You walk by the old place  
Looks like just any other place  
Yeah, that's what you say  
You say I'll be okay  
Yes, I'll find a new way of living  
Sure I will  
And you lie there without sleeping  
And you stare at your wall  
And you realize you're not weeping  
You don't need her anymore  
And you lie there without sleeping  
And you stare at your wall  
And you realize you're not weeping  
'Cause you don't need her anymore  
You guess that it's over
