You say you're so tired, you're never satisfied  
But I can't seem to make you understand  
I see your point of view, but life's been to good to you  
Just stand up and face things like a man  
  
You better get your act together  
If you ever want to take it on the road  
You can't sit around  
Or the bad times are gonna get to you  
And you're never gonna see it through  
  
I know, that things don't seem so good right now  
But you gotta move along some how  
Try to do the best you can  
Sure nuff, thins will slowly turnaround  
You won't always be so down  
I know that it's true  
  
It won't always be such stormy weather  
It may be a cliche but the sun is gonna shine  
So you can't sit around  
Or the bad times are gonna get to you  
And you're never gonna see it through  
  
It don't matter where you've been  
It's where you're going to  
Yeah, and it won't do you no good  
Just livin' in the past  
You know you can't sit around  
Cause the bad times are gonna get to you  
And you're never gonna see it through  
  
And they're never ever gonna go  
Yeah, they'll be here to stay  
Yeah, it's always gonna be that way
