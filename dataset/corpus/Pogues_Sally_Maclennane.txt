Well Jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born  
He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn  
He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn  
And they all looked very happy in the morning  
  
Now Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours  
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks  
When he'd had too many powers  
So sad to see the grieving of the people that he's leaving  
And he took the road for god knows in the morning  
  
We walked him to the station in the rain  
We kissed him as we put him on the train  
And we sang him a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again  
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way  
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)  
I'd like to think of me returning when I can  
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane  
  
The years passed by the times had changed I grew to be a man  
I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally Maclennane  
I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn  
And ended up a barman in the morning  
  
I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down  
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown  
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away  
And some people left for heaven without warning  
  
We walked them to the station in the rain  
We kissed them as we put him on the train  
And we sang them a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing them again  
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way  
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)  
I'd like to think of me returning when I can  
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane  
  
When Jimmy came back home he was surprised that they were gone  
He asked me all the details of the train that they went on  
Some people they are scared to croak but Jimmy drank until he choked  
And he took the road for heaven in the morning  
  
We walked him to the station in the rain  
We kissed him as we put him on the train  
And we sang him a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again  
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way  
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)  
I'd like to think of me returning when I can  
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane
