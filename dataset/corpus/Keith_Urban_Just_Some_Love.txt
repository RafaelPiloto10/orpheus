I heard the rumor that we're callin' it off  
And we won't last too long  
But I got this feelin' when I'm looking at you  
Baby,  
They couldn't be more wrong  
They've been sayin' it's a shaky romance  
And they don't give the two of us too much of a chance  
  
[Chorus]  
But if the Grand Canyon is just some ditch  
Dorothy and Toto fought just some witch  
And if Babe Ruth was just a guy with a glove  
Then oh baby this is just some love  
Oh baby this is just some love  
  
I speak my mind baby that's the truth  
But you've got a temper too  
So when they see us start to fuss and fight  
I guess they think we're through  
But if they're judgin' us by what they see  
Then they don't have a clue about you and me  
  
Cause if the Rocky Mountains are just some hills  
Niagara Falls is just some water spills  
And if Humphrey Bogart was just some tough  
Then oh baby this is just some love  
Oh baby this is just some love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh baby this is just some love  
Oh baby this is just some love
