Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox.  
I'm the one that's singing this sad song.  
Well, I'll cry every time  
That you slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad song one,  
One more time.  
  
Southern California, that's as blue  
As the boy can be,  
Blue as the deep blue sea,  
Won't you listen to me now.  
I need your golden gated cities  
Like a hole in the head,  
Just like a hole in the head, I'm free.  
  
Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox.  
I'm the one that's singing this sad song.  
Well, I'll cry every time  
That you slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad song one,  
One more time.  
  
I do believe I'm headed home.  
Hey mister, can't you see that  
I'm as dry as a bone.  
I think I'll spend some time alone,  
Yes, unless you've found a way  
Of squeezing water from a stone.  
  
Let the doctor and the lawyer do  
As much as they can.  
Let the springtime begin.  
Let the boy become a man.  
I done wasted too much time  
Just to sing you this sad song.  
I done been this lonesome picker  
A little too long.  
  
Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox.  
I'm the one that's singing this sad song.  
Well, I'll cry every time  
That you slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad song one,  
One more time.  
  
I've been spreading myself thin these days,  
Don't you know?  
Goodbye.
