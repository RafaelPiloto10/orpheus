Wake the fuck up 8times  
  
Each day more frighting  
All of us want to die  
The pressures tightening  
I don't even want to try  
Should I take all this stupid bullshit  
What makes them think they  
Can get away with it  
I'm no happy I wish they'd just..  
  
Wake the fuck up wake the fuck up  
  
Wake the fuck up wake the fuck up  
  
I can't take no more  
What are we fighting for  
You are my brothers  
Each one I would die for  
Please just let it go  
all our heads are blown  
Just take the stage and  
Remember what were playing for  
  
No more fighting  
I swear in gonna leave  
Talking shit to spite me  
I wish they'd just  
  
Wake the fuck up wake the fuck up  
Wake the fuck up wake the fuck up  
  
I can't take no more  
What are we fighting for  
You are my brothers  
Each one I would die for  
Please just let it go  
all our heads are blown  
Just take the stage and  
Remember what were playing for  
  
I can't take no more  
What are we fighting for  
You are my brothers  
Each one I would die for  
Please just let it go  
All our heads are blown  
Just take the stage and  
Remember what were playing for  
  
I can't take no more  
What are we fighting for  
You are my brothers  
Each one I would die for  
Please just let it go  
All our heads are blown  
Just take the stage and  
Remember what were playing for  
  
Remember what were playing for  
Remember what were playing for  
Remember what were playing for  
Remember what were playing for
