Oh baby let's play some hide and go seek  
Seen an alligator go jumpin' in the river  
Singin' a song about five, ten, fifteen, twenty  
Twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, fourty, fourty-five  
Fifty, fifty-five, sixty, sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five  
Eighty, eighty-five, ninety, ninety-five, a hundred  
I ain't gonna count but one more time  
And that's gonna be when the sun goes down  
I say last night and the night before  
Twenty-four hours knock in' on the door  
I ran upstairs to get my gun  
And when I got back the robbers had run  
Didn't go east, didn't go west  
They must have run back to the robbers' nest  
Oh, I'm gonna catch you this time honey  
  
I ain't gonna count but one more time  
I'm gonna get you sweetie pie  
I'm gonna catch you, yes I'll do  
Please don't let me search for you  
I say last night and the night before  
Twenty-four hours knockin' on the door  
I ran upstairs to get my gun  
And when I got back the robbers had run  
Didn't go east, didn't go west  
They must have run back to the robbers' nest
