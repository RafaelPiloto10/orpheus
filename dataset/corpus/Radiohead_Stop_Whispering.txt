And the wise man said "I don't want to hear your voice"  
And the thin man said "I don't want to hear your voice"  
And they're cursing me  
And they won't let me be  
There's nothing to say  
And there's nothing to do  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
  
And my mother say "We don't't love you son some more"  
And the buildings say "Let me spit on your face some more"  
And the feeling is  
That there's something wrong  
'Cause I can't find the words  
And I can't find the song  
  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
  
Dear Sir, "I have a complaint  
"Can't remember what it is  
"That's why I'm here"  
  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
Stop whispering, start shouting
