I was young when I left home,  
And I been out a'ramblin' 'round,  
And I never wrote a letter to my home.  
To my home, Lord, to my home,  
And I never wrote a letter to my home.  
  
It was just the other day  
I was drinkin' on my pay  
When I met an old friend I used to know.  
He said your mother's dead and gone,  
Your baby sister's all gone wrong,  
And your daddy needs you home right away.  
  
Not a shirt on my back,  
Not a penny on my name.  
Well I can't go home this a'way.  
This a'way, Lord Lord Lord,  
I can't go home this a'way.  
  
If you miss the train I'm on,  
Count the days I'm gone,  
And you'll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles.  
A hundred miles, a hundred, baby,  
Lord Lord Lord,  
And you'll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles.  
  
When I's playin' on the track,  
Maw would come and whip me back,  
On them tressles down by ol' Jim McKay's.  
  
When I pay the debt I owe  
To the commissary store,  
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.  
Oh home, Lord Lord Lord,  
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.  
  
I used to tell my Maw sometimes,  
When I see them ridin' blinds,  
Gonna make me a home out in the wind.  
In the wind, Lord, in the wind,  
Make me a home out in the wind.  
  
I don't like it in the wind,  
I want to go back home again,  
But I can't go home this a'way.  
This a'way, Lord Lord Lord,  
And I can't go home this a'way.  
  
I was young when I left home,  
And I been all a' ramblin' 'round,  
And I never wrote a letter to my home.  
To my home, Lord Lord Lord,  
And I never wrote a letter to my home.
