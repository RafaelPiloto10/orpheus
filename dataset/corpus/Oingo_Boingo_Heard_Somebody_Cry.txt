(I thought I heard somebody cry--  
I though I heard somebody cry)  
I went to see what I could find  
Like flowers in the dead of night  
Like shadows in the moonlight--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
A choir with a single voice--A picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
CHORUS  
It isn't true  
I am not the ghost  
Without a soul . . . Come  
Listen to my heart  
You feel the beat . . . Stop  
Listen to the sound  
Of moving feet . . . Walk  
Through the halls at night  
When I'm asleep  
I don't believe . . .I don't believe  
The shoe is on the other foot--The glove is on the fist  
The first is like a cannonball--But it feels like a kiss  
I got a bed that's real soft--In a room that's always sad  
I thought I heard a window sigh--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
CHORUS  
A choir with a single voice--a picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
I sip the running water--Like rivers from your eyes  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cry--I thought I'd go and see  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be me
