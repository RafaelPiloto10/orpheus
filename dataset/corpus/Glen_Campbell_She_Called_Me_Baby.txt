She called me baby baby all night long used to hold and kiss me till the dawn  
Then one day I awoke and she was gone there's no more baby baby all night long  
Well she called me baby baby all night long  
She kissed my tears away when things went wrong  
What I'd give if she'd just come back home and call me baby baby all night
long  
  
She called me baby baby baby all night long  
She held me up so high when things went wrong  
Now each time in dreams just like a song I still hear baby baby all night long  
Oh I hear baby baby baby all night long  
Oh I hear baby baby baby all night long  
Oh I hear baby baby baby all night long
