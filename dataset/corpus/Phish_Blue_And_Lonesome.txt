The lonesome sound of the train goin' by  
Makes me want to stop and cry  
I recall the day  
It took you away  
I'm blue and I'm lonesome too  
  
Well, when I hear that whistle blow  
Well I want to pack my suitcase and go  
The lonesome sound of the train goin' by  
Makes me want to stop and cry  
  
(Instrumental solo)  
  
In the still of the night and pale moonlight  
The wind blows and cry  
These lonesome blues  
I just can't loose  
I'm blue and I'm lonesome too  
  
Well when I hear that whistle blow  
Well I want to pack my suitcase and go  
The lonesome sound of the train goin' by  
Makes me want to stop and cry  
  
These lonesome blues  
I just can't loose  
I'm blue and I'm lonesome too  
I'm blue and I'm lonesome too
