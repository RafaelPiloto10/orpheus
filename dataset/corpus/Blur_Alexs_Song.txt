Picked up the girl  
And he sailed around the world  
Why not?  
What else have you got?  
  
If you're not  
Anyone that I like  
Love Will give me the moon  
Whoops  
  
And beyond these voices  
And danced on the groove  
In a dream forever  
Starts when you wake up  
  
Starts when you wake up  
Picked up the girl  
And he sailed around the world  
What?  
  
Oh yeah sorry  
Around the world  
Why not?  
What else has he got?  
  
I don't know  
And I know  
I don't know  
Love will give me the moon  
  
Oh dear  
And beyond these voices  
And danced on the groove  
In a dream forever  
  
Starts when you wake up  
Starts when you wake you
