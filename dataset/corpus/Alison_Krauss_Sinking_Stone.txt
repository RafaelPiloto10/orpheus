I called you today  
Wanting a change  
I never meant to hurt anyone  
Never meant for you to pull out your guns  
But feelings won't stay  
In this meager parade  
You're beating to a different drum  
In this lack of all the luster we've become  
  
Save your breath  
You know we've both  
Tried our best  
But it's leaving  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on  
I'm untying this sinking stone  
  
Don't sit on the fence  
Living past tense  
Holding on to wishes and words  
Folding out a picture we blur  
'Cause here in the end  
I'm losing a friend  
Fighting back a tear when it burns  
Dividing up the pieces that we were  
  
Save your breath  
You know we've both  
Tried our best  
But it's leaving  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on  
I'm untying this sinking stone  
  
I can't say you're all alone  
I'm accepting what I own  
Here lies a blanket and not a bandage  
  
I'm unable to restrain  
When the wake that we became  
Is drawing me under  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on  
I'm untying this sinking stone
