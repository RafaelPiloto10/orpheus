[Chorus:]  
Girl I wanna die in your arms tonight  
I really don't care about the wrong or right  
The fruit is forbidden but it's sweet and ripe  
I think I'm gonna pick me some and take me a bite  
  
Baby girl looks so good, she walk so mean,  
Got a vicious little sway, I think she's semi-obscene  
She'll pick your bones clean, oh my god she's so fine  
She's sweeter than the dew out on the grapes on the vine  
I'm gonna pick her gonna squeeze her, I'm gonna make me some wine  
I'm a drinker till I'm a crazy, I'ma drink till I'm blind  
I'm gonna touch her so good, I'm gonna treat her so fine,  
I'm gonna make love to her soul, I'm gonna fuck all with her mind  
  
Girl I wanna die in your arms tonight  
I really don't care about the wrong or right  
The fruit is forbidden but it's sweet and ripe  
I think I'm gonna pick me some and take me a bite  
  
Baby girl acts so proper, like daddy's little daughter  
A wolf in sheep's clothing leading lambs down to the slaughter  
She's looking so young, she's smelling so pretty  
She's a junkie on a binge, and her drug is the city  
She's a vicious little bitty, attitude is shitty  
If I get my way she's probably gonna come home with me  
Talk ain't good for nothing  
Eyes are made for crying  
Bombs are made for dropping  
Your arms ain't made for dying  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]
