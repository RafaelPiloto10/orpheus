The Bully  
If you know what's good for you  
Stay out of his way  
If you have no insurance  
Stay out of his sight  
He's a bully, from Soweto  
I can tell he's looking for a fight  
Look at his face  
I can tell he's looking for a fight  
Look at his nose, he kills for fun  
He's one of those people we were warned about  
So many years ago  
His days gonna come  
Every dog has his day  
  
[Chorus]  
Sinners shall never go to heaven [Repeat: x4]  
  
If you're on the right side of the law, don't be where he is  
He is wanted dead or alive  
He kills for fun, stay out of his way  
I can tell he's looking for a fight  
Look at his face  
I can tell he's looking for a fight  
Look at his nose  
He's a bully from Soweto  
In his world dog eat dog  
That is how we know his day is gonna come  
Every dog has his day
