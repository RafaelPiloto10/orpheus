Oh, you're a precious little prude?  
But tell me the truth now  
Have you ever had a care in the world  
So tell me what's it all about  
You say oh you're so attacked  
Well you'll never be so right  
Oh you can cry yourself dry  
But i'd be surprised if you can munster  
Up a single crocodile  
You'll never be a hopeless child  
Throw caution to the wind  
Forgive yourself your sins  
And don't you know you  
Really are the sweetest thing  
There isn't heart enough from you  
Do you no longer care or feel that  
You no longer have nothing left to prove  
Oh tell me that it isn't true  
I wanted to tell you  
That I used to admire you  
Oh you know really that I don't cared  
No I never cared for you  
But I used to read about you  
And you oftenly would throw caution to the wind  
And don't you know you  
Really are the sweetest thing
