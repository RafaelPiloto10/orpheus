Losers - losers - losers - losers  
  
The moment I saw your face  
Your eyes swept me away  
The moment I heard your voice  
I knew we'd touch someday  
But we're losers in love  
Afraid of what we feel  
Please don't turn away  
Just because I'm beeing real  
'Cause I've been through this before  
And I don't want to be a loser in love  
  
Loser - loser  
I don't want to be  
Loser - loser  
  
I know it's not my time so I'll be on my way  
I'll never forget your smile  
And I won't forget this day  
'Cause we're losers in love  
In a time of empty dreams  
Just two losers in love  
Afraid of what we feel  
Please don't turn me away  
'Cause I don't want to be losers in love
