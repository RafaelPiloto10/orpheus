The speed of light slows down  
As the feather hits the ground  
And if nothing else gets proved  
It's always faster than it sounds  
  
A star that shines so bright  
Would be eclipsed tonight  
When you kiss the satellite  
Because there was always you  
  
And you alone believed  
That light could bend this way  
It don't seem right  
To spend tonight  
As I did today  
  
If I had known that you would call  
If I could dream that you would fall  
If I could change these wrongs to right  
I would have stayed at home tonight  
  
There's nothing you can do  
To make this all brand new  
And nothing you can say  
To make it go away  
  
You've never been so wrong  
So how can you act strong  
When a fall from grace so hard  
Should never take so long  
  
And sat goodbye as you did today  
  
If I had known that you would call  
If I could dream that you would fall  
If I could change these wrongs to right  
I would have stayed at home tonight  
  
So the speed of light remains  
Ever constantly the same  
Again tonight as it today  
  
If I had known that you would call  
If I could dream that you would fall  
If I could change these wrongs to right  
I would have stayed at home tonight  
  
If I had known that you would call  
If I could dream that you would fall  
If I could change these wrongs to right  
I would have stayed at home tonight
