Don't sing me lullabies  
I won't close my eyes,  
I can't close my eyes  
It's true,  
I'm doomed  
'til dawn  
Shines through  
Got too many things to do  
Got friends to see,  
I can't miss a thing  
It's true,  
I'm through  
I'm screwed,  
Unglued  
  
I won't close my eyes, I can't close my eyes,  
I never close my eyes  
You see, they're always there with funny hair,  
Oh, I'm so scared  
  
It happens to me every night  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
They always want to take a bite  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
And if you think this isn't real  
I'll show you wounds that never heal  
To them I'm just a happy meal  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
  
Make the coffee black as night  
Help me through the night  
I know their appetite for me  
I'm meat  
But I'm sweet  
As can be  
And if I do too much booze  
I begin to snooze  
I hear the big old floppy shoes  
It's true,  
I'm stew,  
Unchewed  
  
I won't close my eyes, I can't close my eyes,  
I never close my eyes  
See, they're always there with that funny hair,  
Oh, I'm so scared  
  
It happens to me every night  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
They always want to take a bite  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
And if you think this isn't real  
I'll show you wounds that never heal  
To them I'm just a happy meal  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me
