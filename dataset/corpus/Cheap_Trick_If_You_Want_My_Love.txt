Ah  
Ah  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you want my love you got it  
When you need my love you got it  
I won't hide it  
I won't throw your love away, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I thought you were a mystery girl  
A special girl in this crazy old world  
You couldn't see me when I laid eyes on you  
  
'Cause lonely is only a place  
You don't know what it's like  
You can't fight it  
It's a hole in my heart, in my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You hold the secrets of love in this world  
I'm hypnotized by your every word  
A special face, a special voice  
A special smile in my life  
  
'Cause lonely is only a place  
You don't know what it's like  
You can't fight it  
It's a hole in my heart, in my heart  
  
[Chorus x3]
