Watch it!  
  
Just like the one's that got away,  
Supposedly if so far.  
I threw my hook into the water,  
I nearly gotta.  
House design now  
[I'm up the creek]  
Although I lost a little ground  
[I'm up the creek]  
I know that time is on my side  
[I'm up the creek]  
Don't you go pull the plug on me.  
[I'm up the creek]  
There more than one fish in the sea.  
I'm not about to let it be.  
I know that I am up the creek.  
  
Hey, hey  
  
The foreign legions always there. I need a holiday.  
Daydream in the dessert, with no pressure, that's the way, cause  
[I'm up the creek]  
Although I've lost a little ground.  
[I'm up the creek]  
I know that time is on my side.  
[I'm up the creek]  
Don't you go pull the plug on me.  
[I'm up the creek]  
There more than one fish in the sea.  
I'm not about to let it be.  
I know that I'm up the creek.  
  
[I'm up the creek]  
Without a paddle.  
[I'm up the creek]  
But that don't matter at all.  
[No matter at all]  
No matter at all.  
[No matter at all]  
[I'm up the creek]  
Without a paddle  
[I'm up the creek]  
I'm learning to paddle it all,  
[Don't mention at all]  
[Don't mention at all]  
Paddle it all.  
[Don't mention at all]  
  
Oh  
  
Hey, hey  
  
I'm, up the creek  
I'm, up the creek  
[I'm, up the creek]  
Here I go! You want to go?  
[I'm, Up the creek]  
Help me! Help me! Help me!  
[I'm, up the creek]  
[I'm, up the creek]  
  
Watch it! Wow!  
  
[I'm, up the creek]  
[I'm, up the creek]
