Chorus:  
I'm a boogeyman, oh yes I am  
I'm a boogeyman, oh yes I am  
Boooooo! I'm a boogeyman  
  
Well, I boogey with a dog, I boogie with a cat  
Boogey with a bird, boogey with a rat  
Boogey with a horse, boogie with a cow  
I love to boogie let me show you how!  
Booooo... !  
I'm a boogie man  
  
Chorus  
Well I boogey at night, boogey in the day  
Boogey at work, boogey at play  
There's boogey in my toes, boogie in my head  
And I 'll probably still boogey, when I'm dead  
Booo... !  
I'm a boogie man  
  
We're the boogie girls, oh yes we are  
We're the boogie girls, oh yes we are  
Boooo... ! We're the boogey girls  
  
We can boogey on a mountain, boogey in the sea  
We can boogie on the ground, boogie in the sky  
So let's all boogie with Mr. I.  
Booo... !  
We're the boogie girls.  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm a boogeyman, oh yes I am  
I'm a boogey man, oh yes I am  
Booooo! I'm a boogie man!
