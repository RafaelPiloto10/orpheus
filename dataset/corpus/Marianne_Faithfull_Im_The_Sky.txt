I'm the sky  
'Cause the sky doesn't sing in my song in the wind  
I can dodge  
Both your eyes with my smile  
'Cause I'm singing my song  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
Long ago  
I was blinded, my mind couldn't see  
The world's sorrow  
Every place that I went in the stillness  
I left people alone  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
Till one day  
In the spring, in the springtime I saw a good day  
And I heard as a child laughing wild  
That I heard you can grow  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
When you grow  
In the springtime you'll sing loudly songs in your soul  
In the air you can feel all the life  
And the force you've been weary  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free
