Now you say you belong to me  
Do you ever take the time to ask me  
If I want to be more involved in your life  
It's so sad  
You don't realize  
What I can do for you  
It's so sad  
  
You won't spend more time alone with me  
When you could be discovering my love  
Can't you see just how much you're hurting me  
When you say one thing and then do another  
I forgive you  
But still you take me for granted  
It's so sad  
  
You don't realize  
What I can do for you  
It's so sad  
  
You won't spend more time alone with me  
When you could be discovering my love  
You know there are times  
When nothing else takes my place  
And those times  
Mean more to you than anything else  
But still you need more of me  
And I need more of you, give me more of you  
It's so sad  
  
You don't realize  
What I can do for you  
It's so sad  
  
You won't spend more time alone with me  
When you could be discovering my love
