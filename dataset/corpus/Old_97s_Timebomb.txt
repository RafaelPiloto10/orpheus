I got a time bomb, in my mind, Mom  
I hear it ticking but I don't know why  
I call the police but they don't like me  
I hear 'em whispering when I walk by  
  
I got a land mine in my bloodline  
I'm not immune to getting blown apart  
She's like a claymore, that's what she's there for  
She's waiting 'round here to get blown apart  
  
Having her on my brain's like getting hit by a train  
She's gonna kill me, oh, Celeste, oh, Celeste  
Oh, Celeste, oh, Celeste  
  
I got a time bomb, in my mind, Mom  
It's gonna go off but I don't know when  
I need a doctor to extract her  
I got a feeling she'd get right back in again  
  
I got a time bomb, in my mind, Mom  
I got it badly for a stick-legged girl  
She's gonna kill me and I don't mean softly  
I got it badly for a stick-legged girl  
  
Having her on my brain's, getting hit by a train  
She's gonna kill me, oh, Celeste, oh, Celeste  
Oh, Celeste, oh, Celeste  
  
Oh, Celeste
