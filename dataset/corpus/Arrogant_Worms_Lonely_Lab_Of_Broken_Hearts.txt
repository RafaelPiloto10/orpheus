I met you in biology in high school  
You told me after college we'd be wed  
You were my favorite lab partner  
Till you ran off with that brilliant young pre-med  
  
My pain would show up on a cat-scan  
My optic nerves are only seeing blue  
My blood hates to flow  
Because it has to go  
Through the four-chambered heart that cries for you  
  
I'm in the lonely lab of broken hearts  
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart  
I'm in the lonely lab of feelin' blue  
And my pheremones can find no trace of you  
  
You were as sweet as crystalline carbohydrates  
The rods and cones in my optical receptors are filled with tears  
I wanted to elope  
So we could make some isotopes  
With a half-life of a million thousand years  
  
If I suspended my trachial dilations till you returned here  
My muscles would need atp anarobic respiration  
Adenine, cidozine, guanine, and thianine  
Might make up my dna  
But my love gene must be missin' from it's station  
  
I'm in the lonely lab of broken hearts  
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart  
I'm in the lonely lab of feelin' blue  
And my pheremones can find no trace of you  
  
The metallurgist is the musicians best friend. This statement  
Has been echoed throughout the ages, for without the metallurgist, we  
Could not have such musical things as triangles, cymbals, margerine  
Tubs, or guitar strings. Guitar strings are produced by the  
Wire-drawing process, where solid metal is pulled through dies with  
Progressively smaller diameters, until the desired diameter, or guage,  
Is reached. The ability to be drawn into wires is called ductility,  
And seperates metals from other materials, such as wood, ceramics, or  
Plastic milk jugs, which are made by the blow-molding process. You  
Put the milk in later.

You stands for uranium. There are several isotopes of uranium,  
Three of which are radioactive.
