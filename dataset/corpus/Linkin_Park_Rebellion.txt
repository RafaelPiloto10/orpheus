[Verse 1]  
I've seen the blood, I've seen the broken,  
The lost and the sights unseen.  
I want a flood, I want an ocean,  
To wash my confusion clean.  
I can't resolve this empty story,  
I can't repair the damage done.  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
  
[Verse 2]  
We act it out, we wear the colors,  
Confined by the things we own.  
We're not without, we're like each other,  
Pretending we're here alone.  
And far away, they burn their buildings  
Right in the face of the damage done.  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
  
[Bridge]  
Rebellion, rebellion,  
We lost before the start!  
Rebellion, rebellion,  
One by one we fall apart!  
We fall apart! We fall apart! We fall apart!  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of, Imitations of...  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
Rebellion, rebellion, rebellion.
