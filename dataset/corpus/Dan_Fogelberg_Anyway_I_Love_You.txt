Here's another little song for you  
Hope you'll listen to it well  
Means no different than the others do  
It won't change you I can tell  
  
[Chorus:]  
Anyway, I love you  
Everyday I get more sure  
Anyway, I love you  
More and more and more and more and more  
  
I have so much I can offer you  
More to please you with than most  
But trying to tie you down is harder than trying to hold on to a ghost  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
So if you ever feel the need for me, darlin'  
Let it carry you along  
Don't be shy and try to hold it down  
'Cause what you feel just can't be wrong  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
More and more and more and more  
And more and more and more and more.
