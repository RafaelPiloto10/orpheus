I've shown you all the places I'm dreaming of  
I'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun  
We are seventeen, we have just begun  
I have loved to fight for and then some  
You are the one, the one, the one, the one,  
The one, the one, the one, the one  
  
Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed  
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies  
There will be no blood and there will be no pain  
I want to fall in love with you again, again,  
Again, again, again, again, again, again  
Again, again  
  
You have stolen all my senses  
There's a fever in my heart  
And you are taking my defenses  
You are pulling me apart  
Forever we are and we are dying  
And we still be standing on our ground  
So I will take away my feeling  
I will be an animal  
An animal  
  
I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you  
We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth  
I'll color in the sky, and I'll color you  
I want to join your skin again, again,  
Again, again, again, again, again, again  
Again  
  
You have stolen all my senses  
There's a fever in my heart  
And you are taking my defenses  
You are pulling me apart  
Forever we are and we are dying  
And we still be standing on our ground  
So I will take away my feeling  
I will be an animal  
An animal  
  
We will run away from danger  
We will run away  
  
I-I-I-I-I will fight for  
  
You have stolen all my senses  
There's a fever in my heart  
And you are taking my defenses  
You are pulling me apart  
Forever we are and we are dying  
And we still be standing on our ground  
So I will take away my feeling  
I will be an animal  
An animal
