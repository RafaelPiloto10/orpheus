I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Back to where my baby's from  
I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Indiana here I come  
  
I spread my wings for greener pastures  
I still ain't found what I was after  
I got the blue and that is why I sing  
I just want to do my thing  
  
I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Indiana here I come  
I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Cause that's where my baby's from  
  
Okay tito you got it!  
  
I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Indiana here I come  
I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Cause that's where my baby's from  
  
Hollywood you got a lot of pretty things  
I saw alot of movie stars with diamond rings  
But I ain't got my baby and I'm feelin' wrong  
That's why I gotta sing my song  
  
I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Indiana here I come  
I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Cause that's where my baby's from  
  
Ooh  
I'm comin' I'm comin' I'm comin' I'm comin' I'm home yeah  
  
Ha ha sis boom bah  
One more time for Roosevelt high  
Johnny ray tex scooter and Lorenzo too  
It's t w lou from the boogaloo  
Every soul that passes by  
This songs to you from the Jackson 5  
I'm comin' home it's plain to see  
I still got Indiana soul in me  
  
I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Indiana here I come  
I'm goin' back to Indiana  
Cause that's where my baby's from
