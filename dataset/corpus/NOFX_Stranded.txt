She once told me not to listen,  
Find the answers, intuition,  
Follow no one, trust your instincts,  
Face the world, find out it stinks.  
  
Don't come crying,  
Don't come crying,  
Don't come cry to me.  
I'm not your friend,  
I'm just your lover,  
Don't put your faith,  
Don't put your faith in me,  
You cut me up and rob me blind,  
But now I'm fine.  
  
She told me about the places I could never find,  
She told me how to walk while by her side,  
Don't be fooled by teardrops,  
They're worth a thousand lies,  
When I saw them running down her face,  
I believed in her.  
  
Stranded  
Stranded  
  
Hit me in the gut,  
Like a brick through a window,  
Left me in the gutter like a wet news rag,  
Sitting alone, thinking about the times we never had,  
'Cause you were my life.  
  
She told me if and whether,  
We'd spend the night together,  
She made so many promises,  
I believed in her
