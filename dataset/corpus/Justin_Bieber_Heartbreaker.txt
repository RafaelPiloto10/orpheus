Girl you don't know how I feel (how I really feel)  
Since you been away, oh baby  
Any chance that you could take my call (take my call), if I got you today  
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool  
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone  
  
And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
  
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go  
'Cause I really wanna be alone  
And baby nobody else gotta know  
Just meet me later on the low  
  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking  
  
Girl you see me standing here (standing here)  
Standing in the rain(oh baby)  
Any chance that you could stay right here  
And never go away  
  
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool  
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone  
  
And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
  
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go (secret place that we can go)  
'Cause I really wanna be alone (I really wanna be alone)  
And baby nobody else gotta know (nobody else)  
Just meet me later on the low (would you meet me on the low, girl)  
  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker (baby don't tell me, no)  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker (oh baby)  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking (heart is breaking)  
  
So what I'm really trying to say is, and what I hope you understand  
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man  
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around  
But, this is, this is personal, this is, for me and you  
And I want you to know that I still love you  
And I know the seasons may change  
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain  
But I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name  
And you know I don't wanna lose that  
  
(I still believe)  
I still believe in love  
I still believe in us  
I hope you believe in us  
The way I believe in us  
  
You don't see, 'cause what you don't see, is when we don't speak  
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya  
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feelin'  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I, the way that I  
  
You told me to be careful with your heart, your baby jeans  
  
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart  
Be careful with your heart
