This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters  
We never stood a chance  
And I'm not sure if it matters  
If you are the shores, I am the waves begging for big moons  
I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town  
  
I know this hurts, it was meant to  
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one  
And it's mind over (you don't) matter  
  
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters  
But it must be said again that all us boys are just screaming  
Into microphones for attention  
Because we're just so bored  
I never knew that you would pick it apart, oh  
I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts  
  
I used to obsess over living,  
Now I only obsess over you  
Tell me you'd like boys like me better  
In the dark lying on top of you  
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
