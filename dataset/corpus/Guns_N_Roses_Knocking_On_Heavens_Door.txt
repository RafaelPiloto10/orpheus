Mama take this badge from me  
I can't use it anymore  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Mama put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore  
That cold black cloud is comin' down  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
  
"You just better start sniffin' your own  
Rank subjugation jack 'cause it's just  
You against your tattered libido, the bank  
And the mortician, forever man and it  
Wouldn't be luck if you could get out of  
Life alive"  
  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
