I want to shake up this world  
And not to feel so useless  
And I long to wake up happy  
And not to feel so hopeless  
I want arms that never held me  
To pull me to my senses  
And wrap themselves around me  
Oh, please let it come true  
There's only one thing for me  
Darling, darling, darling  
You know it's you.  
  
I want someone up here beside me  
To wake up in heaven with all my worries behind me  
That's what I'd love to do  
There is something I have seen  
A vision in my dreams  
Who only comes it seems to tell me  
What I already knew  
There's only one thing that can save me now  
And baby you know it's you  
  
Ah - d'you ever see just what I see?  
My whole life just flashed in front of me  
All my fears, all my mistakes  
The heart that sings before it breaks  
Oh I want arms that never held me  
To wrap themselves around me  
And not to let me down too gently  
I need something to look forward to  
There's only one thing that will do  
And you know darling you know it's you
