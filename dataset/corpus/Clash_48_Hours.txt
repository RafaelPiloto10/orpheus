Friday or Saturday, what does that mean  
Short space of time needs a heavy scene  
Monday is coming like a jail on wheels  
  
Forty eight hours needs forty eight  
Forty eight hours needs forty eight  
Forty eight hours needs forty eight  
Thrills  
Forty eight thrills  
  
So tell me an' I'll take the tube  
You know a girl, yeah well she's bound to be rude  
Can't get nothing at the places I've been  
  
I've combed this town from top to bottom  
I try to get around but my legs are broken  
Every time I miss it 'cause I ain't got a ticket  
  
Forty eight hours needs forty eight thrills  
Kicking for kicks
