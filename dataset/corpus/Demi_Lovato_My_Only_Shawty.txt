[Verse 1]  
Last night was crazy  
And today it's setting in  
Did you really mean it and  
Could you say it again?  
Oh, Oh  
Even if you say it over the phone (Come on and make it real)  
  
Love makes me crazy, dumb, restless, and paranoid  
But I'll take a chance on us and  
Hope you don't destroy my heart  
Just give me one guarantee  
I'm the only girl you see what you say boy?  
  
[Chorus]  
Your my only shorty,  
Your my only shorty  
I'm telling you the truth, girl,  
It's only you  
You're my only, you're my only,  
You're my only, one and only  
You're my only shorty  
(Am I your only shorty?)(x2)  
I'm telling you the truth,  
Oh, girl, it's only you, whoa  
You're my only(x3)  
You're my only shorty  
  
[Verse 2]  
Every night and day  
You got an open invitation, whoa  
As long as I'm your one and only destination  
Fly with me,  
I'll be your fantasy  
You're in demand  
But baby, baby, so am I  
But if you're weak and try to sneak  
I'll have to tell you bye, bye  
  
I'm gonna put you on the spot  
Am I your only girl or not?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
What you say boy?  
  
[Chorus]  
You're my only shorty,  
You're my only shorty  
I'm telling you the truth, girl,  
It's only you  
You're my only, you're my only,  
You're my only, one and only  
You're my only shorty  
(Am I your only shorty?)(x2)  
I'm telling you the truth,  
Oh, girl, it's only you, whoa  
You're my only(x3)  
You're my only shorty  
  
[Bridge]  
Please, baby, please, give me  
All your attention, say it  
Don't let my heart go  
Seeking no other direction  
I've gotta be the only one for your affection,  
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention  
  
[Chorus]  
You're my only shorty  
(Am I your only shorty?)  
You're my only shorty  
(Baby, come clean)  
I'm telling you the truth, oh, girl,  
It's only you, oh  
You're my only(x3)  
You're my only shorty  
You're my only shorty  
(Am I your only shorty?)(x2)  
I'm telling you the truth,  
Oh, girl, it's only you, whoa  
You're my only(x3)  
You're my only shorty  
  
[Outro]  
Am I your only? (x2)  
(Yeah)Tell me,  
Am I your only (Yeah) shorty?  
Yes you are (I want to hear you say yeah)  
Yes you are.  
Am I your only shorty?
