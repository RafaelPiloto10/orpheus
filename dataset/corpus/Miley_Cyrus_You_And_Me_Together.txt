Looks like we found ourselves  
Up against a wall  
In need of a little help  
But no one wants to call  
After all we've been through  
Do we let our friendship end  
You need me and I need you  
No, we will not break  
Never break  
But even if we bend,  
  
Yeah, it's  
Chorus  
YOU AND ME TOGETHER (together, together, together)  
ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE [on your side]  
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT  
C'MON LET EM TRY [let em try]  
CAUSE IT'S YOU AND ME TOGETHER NOW  
  
Anyone can have a day  
When their heart is on their sleeve  
No one wants to see a way  
And agree to disagree  
You'd think it'd be easier  
But it feels like you just can't win  
But somehow we'll make it work  
Cause we deserve it- we know we're worth it  
You can't give up on friends  
  
'Cause it's  
Repeat Chorus  
  
TOGETHER NOW  
Oh, now, now, now  
  
It's  
YOU AND ME TOGETHER [together, together, together]  
ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE [on your side]  
Oh, whoa-whoa  
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT  
C'MON LET EM TRY (let em try)  
  
It's  
YOU [it's you] AND ME [and me] TOGETHER [together, together, together]  
Yeah, I'm ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE [on your, on your side]  
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT  
C'MON LET EM TRY  
[Let em try]  
Cuz it's you and me together ah-ah-ah-ah-ah  
Together now, now  
Together now, now
