The sea so deep and blind  
The sun, the wild regret  
The club, the wheel, the mind,  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
The club, the wheel, the mind  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
The blood, the soil, the faith  
These words you can't forget  
Your vow, your holy place  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
The blood, the soil, the faith  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
A cross on every hill  
A star, a minaret  
So many graves to fill  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
So many graves to fill  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
The sea so deep and blind  
Where still the sun must set  
And time itself unwind  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
And time itself unwind  
O love, aren't you tired yet?
