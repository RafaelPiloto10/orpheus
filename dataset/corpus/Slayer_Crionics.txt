Eyes upon me  
Watching me in my perpetual sleep  
Dreams deceive me  
My future depends on a mindless dream  
I've fallen from promises  
Damned to take risks on my own  
The masterful science that freezes your  
Mind and your soul  
The wretched dream is realized  
The human race is to be crystallized  
  
Thoughts of laughter  
Filling the head of the master in charge.  
Worlds of wonder  
Is this a cure or a painless death  
I'll fight and resist  
Till they all see the end that is near  
The doctors the lawyers and G-men  
Are living in fear  
Living my life with one distant hope  
A cure that will kill my invincible foe
