You and I can share the silence  
Finding comfort together  
The way old friends do  
  
And after fights and words of violence  
We make up with each other  
The way old friends do  
  
Times of joy and times of sorrow  
We will always see it through  
Oh, I don't care what comes tomorrow  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do  
  
You and I can share the silence  
Finding comfort together  
The way old friends do  
  
And after fights and words of violence  
We make up with each other  
The way old friends do  
  
Times of joy and times of sorrow  
We will always see it through  
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do  
  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do
