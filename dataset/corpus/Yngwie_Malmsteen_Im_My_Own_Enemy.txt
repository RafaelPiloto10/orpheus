From now on I'm dancing with myself  
To the sound of a blue and broken string  
Left behind with the dust upon a shelf  
The remains of a long forgotten song.  
All that we had but now again  
I stand alone all love has an end.  
You cannot see this is my destiny  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you  
You cannot see this is my reality  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you.  
From now on I'm sleeping with my shadow  
In the night my thoughts can be my own  
All the pain and all this endless sorrow  
I miss you more than I will ever know.  
Holding you never again  
It cannot be all love has an end.  
You cannot see this is my destiny  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you  
You cannot see this is my reality  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you.  
Now I know there is no-one that is waiting  
At the end of that long and winding road  
Memories in the dead of night are calling  
All the way I carry on my heavy load.  
All that we had but now again  
I stand alone all love has an end.  
You cannot see this is my destiny  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you  
You cannot see this is my reality  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you.
