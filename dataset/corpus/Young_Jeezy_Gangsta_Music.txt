I'm here now you old news  
Got a couple old porches, couple old schools  
I'll line ya ass up push ya tape backwards  
'Cause I'm a real nigger I don't like rappers  
  
And that ain't this and this ain't that  
And bitch I'm strapped  
Fuck wit real nigger that'll cut ya throat  
And they don't drink Pepsi they just sell Coke  
  
All I do is talk dro its like my brain on drugs  
See me out nigger I do my thing in clubs  
Listen up Jeezy gotta a little riddle  
Stack of 20-dollar bill two bands in the middle  
  
[Chorus]  
All the gangstas they gon ride to this  
They goin' grind to this  
They goin' shine to this  
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, and  
this is gangsta music  
All the hustlers they goin' ride to this  
They goin' grind to this  
They goin' shine to this  
This is hustler music, this is hustler music, this is hustler music, and  
this is hustler music  
  
We don't talk on the phone 'cause it might stick  
Gotta play for the 7 call it Mike Vick  
Dirty birds nigger we play wit them falcons  
Know some niggers in the Decatur that pay for them falcons  
  
Talking young hungry niggers eat ya whole plate  
Jeezy place the order niggers eat ya whole face  
You got me Mr. Scrooge all fucked up  
Jump out hit the switch light ya ass up  
  
Carbon 15 wit the one pound drum  
Got plenty for any nigga think he wants some  
We don't leave 'em at the house we bring 'em out  
My chain for yo life we can swap it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The hoes love my voice  
Make they pussy moist  
Certified g shit and I'm the gangster's choice  
Niggers popping off hope they bullet proof  
  
Leave holes inside ya like a sunroof  
Mack 11 in the club and a sub nose  
Swear to God knock you niggers out ya clothes  
Lay ya ass flat like a doormat  
  
Niggers ask for but they don't want that  
In the rap game takin' niggers clientele  
White ones like the powder that I used to sell  
Give a fuck about a player hater  
Hit 'em wit the tool bust his whole radiator
