Cheap, cheap  
I was born to be cheap, cheap  
A child no mother could keep, cheap  
As sure as there's trash  
I was born to be cheap.  
  
I was born to be helpless, I was born to be cold  
I was born to never do what I'm told  
I was to be shallow, wasn't born to be deep  
Of all the things I was to be cheap.  
  
Cheap, cheap  
I was born to be cheap, cheap  
A child no mother could keep, cheap  
As sure as there's trash  
I was born to be cheap.  
  
I was born to be crass, a loud brassy tart  
No one can accuse me of having a heart  
I was born to fast  
I don't do it twice with anyone, get cheap!  
  
Cheap, cheap  
I was born to be cheap, cheap  
As I'm walking down the street, cheap  
I'm always too much  
I was born to be cheap.  
  
I was born to be helpless, I was born to be cold  
I was born to never do what I'm told  
I was to be shallow, wasn't born to be deep  
Of all the things I was to be cheap.  
  
I'm cheap  
I was born to be cheap, cheap  
A child no mother could keep, cheap  
As I'm walking down the street, cheap  
I've always wanted to be cheap  
I was born to be cheap
