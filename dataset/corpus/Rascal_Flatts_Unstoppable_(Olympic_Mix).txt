Ooh  
So, so you made a lot of mistakes  
Walked down the road a little sideways  
Cracked a brick when you hit the wall  
Yeah, so you didn't do your best  
It pulled you down faster than a sunset  
Hey it happens to us all  
When the cold hard rain just won't quit  
And you can't see your way out of it  
  
You find your faith has been lost and shaken  
Here's your chance and it's worth taking  
Get on your knees and dig down deep  
You can do what you think is impossible  
Keep on believing don't give in  
You've got the strength to raise the wind  
Remember what one dream can do  
You are unstoppable  
  
You, you can weather any storm  
Don't you know that you were born to win  
Oh, you find a helping hand when you need it most  
A lighthouse shining on the coast that never goes dim  
When your back's against the wall  
When you, when you stumble and you fall  
  
You find your faith has been lost and shaken  
Here's your chance and it's worth taking  
Get on your knees and dig down deep  
You can do what you think is impossible  
Keep on believing don't give in  
You've got the strength to raise the wind  
Remember what one dream can do  
You are unstoppable  
  
Like a river keeps on rolling  
Like a north wind blowing  
Don't it feel good knowing  
Yeah  
  
You find your faith has been lost and shaken  
You take back what's been taken  
Get on your knees and dig down deep  
You can do what you think is impossible  
Keep on believing don't give in  
You've got the strength to raise the wind  
Remember what one dream can do  
You are unstoppable  
  
Yes you, you are unstoppable  
So you made a lot of mistakes  
But you got right back into the game  
You, you are unstoppable
