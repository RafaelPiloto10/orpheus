People everywhere  
A sense of expectation hanging in the air  
Giving out a spark  
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark  
And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end  
  
[Chorus:]  
Masters of the scene  
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more  
You know what I mean  
Voulez-vous (ah-ha)  
Take it now or leave it (ah-ha)  
Now is all we get (ah-ha)  
Nothing promised, no regrets  
Voulez-vous (ah-ha)  
Ain't no big decision (ah-ha)  
You know what to do (ah-ha)  
La question c'est voulez-vous  
  
Voulez-vous...  
I know what you think  
"The girl means business so I'll offer her a drink"  
Feeling mighty proud  
See you leave your table, pushing through the crowd  
I'm really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Voulez-vous...  
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha  
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha  
Voulez-vous (ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)  
Voulez-vous (ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
