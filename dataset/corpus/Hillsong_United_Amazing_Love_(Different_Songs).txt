"I'm so amazed  
at how you take my life  
love me more, more than I deserve.  
  
"I'm blown away,  
by your power to  
change this life once lost  
and plant it in you.  
  
"And who would know  
that I was once  
on a road  
so far away from you.  
All I know is that I live my life  
to show the world your amazing love,  
Your amazing love.  
  
"Your love is so pure,  
Your love's so divine,  
Your love transforms my soul, my mind.  
Your love has the power to  
breed through hope(?)  
Amazing Love,  
amazing love.  
  
I'm so amazed, wonderful creation.  
I will live to honor you, my LORD,  
You are the gold treasure of a life,  
I will rest in you and praise eternally.  
  
"And who would know  
that I was once  
on a road so far away from you  
All I know is that I live my life  
to show the world your  
amazing love.  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
I'm so amazed."
