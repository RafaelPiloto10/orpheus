It was long after midnight  
When we got to unconditional love  
She said sure, my heart is boundless  
But don't push my limits too far  
  
I said if love was so transcendent  
I don't understand these boundaries  
She said just don't disappoint me  
You know how complex women are  
I'll be around  
If you don't let me down  
Too far  
  
It was just before sunrise  
When we started on traditional roles  
She said sure I'll be your partner  
But don't make too many demands  
  
I said if love has these conditions  
I don't understand those songs you love  
She said this is not a love song  
This isn't fantasy-land  
I'll be around  
If you don't push me down  
Too far  
  
Don't go too far  
The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea  
Is a cold fire  
Don't cross the line  
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor  
Is a cold fire  
Don't let me down  
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond  
Is a cold fire  
Don't break the spell  
The look in your eyes as you head for the door  
Is a cold fire  
  
Love is blind if you are gentle  
Love can turn to a long, cold burn
