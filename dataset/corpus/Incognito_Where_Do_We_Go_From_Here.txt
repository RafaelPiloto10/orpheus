Na na na na na na na na na hey  
Na na na na na na na na na hey  
  
Without you baby  
There's no love in my life (No)  
My head's been spinnin' (Spinnin')  
These small cuts like a knife  
Oh mother  
  
Without you baby (Without you)  
My lonely heart can't find a way (Find a way)  
My whole world's fallin'  
Apart when you go runnin' away  
  
  
Chorus:  
I just want to know where we go from here  
Could this be the end I fear  
I just want to know where  
Where do we go from here  
  
Na na na na na na na na na hey  
Na na na na na na na na na hey  
I just want to know where  
Where do we go from here  
  
We both know that it (Aha)  
Don't matter who's wrong or right (Who's wrong or right)  
Just as long as we feel the yearnin' inside  
  
Chorus  
  
Without you baby  
My lonely heart can't find a way  
Don't you know my world is falling  
Apart when you go runnin' away  
  
Chorus  
  
Na na na na na na na na na hey  
  
Repeat (Fade)
