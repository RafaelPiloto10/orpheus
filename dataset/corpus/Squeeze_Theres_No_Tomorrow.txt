There's no tomorrow  
When you feel sorrow,  
There's just the evening  
There's just the night,  
To drink the feelings  
Right out the ceiling  
There's no tomorrow, now there's tonight.  
There's no remembers  
There's no pretenders,  
There's just the weakness  
There's just the thought,  
So drink those troubles  
Through several doubles  
There's no tomorrow, 'cause life's too short.  
  
There's no expression  
There's no aggression,  
There's just the sadness  
There's just the pain  
So drink to mysteries,  
With one more whiskey  
There's no expression, I'm drunk again.  
  
There's no tomorrow  
When you feel hollow,  
There's just the barman  
To lend an ear  
So drink to lovers,  
If there are others  
There's no tomorrow, tomorrow's here.
