Hurt you.  
How could anyone hurt you  
Leave you  
How could anyone want to  
You must forget him  
Turn away from your sorrow  
Let me love you  
And I'll show you tomorrow  
Just let me into your life  
Let me tear down the wall  
That is keeping you outside the heart of you  
Let me into your life  
If I can't have you all  
Then at least give me one little part of you  
Let me into your life  
Trust in me  
Let your heart learn to trust in me  
Need me  
That's the way that it must be  
Just let me love you  
Can't you see I was made to  
Let me love you  
Why are you so afraid to  
Just let me into your life  
Let me tear down the wall  
That is keeping you outside the heart of you  
Let me into your life  
If I can't have you all  
Then at least give me one little part of you  
Let me into your life  
Just let me into your life  
I will love you forever if you let me into your life
