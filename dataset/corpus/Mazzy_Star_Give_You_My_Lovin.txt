Give you my lovin'  
Seven days a week  
I'll be your honey  
If you'll be sweet  
I know I'm the only one for you  
I know that you think this is not true  
  
Man says it's rainin'  
Rainin' outside  
I'll be out there in a little while  
'Cause you see  
Rain reminds me of you  
And everything has turned to you  
  
See you in places  
I'm following you  
You'll be upstairs  
And I'll be there too  
Everywhere you go  
I will follow  
I know it won't be the same tomorrow  
  
People give me warnings  
Stay away from you  
They say you'll hurt me  
I don't think that's true  
Discomfort arouses when I speak of you  
As if you've been sayin' something bad  
About me  
  
When I see you  
I want to kiss you  
But I know that ain't right  
So I ask if I can hold you  
Oh babe I need you so bad  
Oh babe I only want to make you  
Glad
