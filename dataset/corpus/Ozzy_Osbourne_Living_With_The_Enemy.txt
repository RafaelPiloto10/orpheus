I gave you all that you wanted  
And still you come back for more  
You say that you're brokenhearted  
But then you walk out the door  
  
Maybe it is time for us to say goodbye  
Where are the tears you never cried?  
Hey baby what you got on your mind  
Are you looking for some sympathy?  
  
I can tell you if it's a truth or a lie  
Cause it's just like living,  
Living with the enemy  
  
You got me going in circles,  
I'm slowly loosing my head  
What did I do to deserve this,  
You make me wish I was dead  
  
Tell me I'm wrong and i'll be on my way  
See you around another day  
Hey baby what you doin' tonite?  
Are you giving me the perfect dream  
  
I'm so tired and I don't wanna fight  
Cause it's just like living,  
Living with the enemy, enemy  
Living with the enemy, living with the enemy, enemy  
Living with the enemy, enemy  
Living with the enemy, living with the enemy, enemy
