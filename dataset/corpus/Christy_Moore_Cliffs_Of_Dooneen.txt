You may travel far far from your own native home  
Far away o'er the mountains, far away o'er the foam  
But of all the fine places that I've ever seen  
There's none to compare with the cliffs of Dooneen  
  
Take a view o'er the mountains, fine sights you'll see there  
You'll see the high rocky mountains on the west coast of Clare  
The towns of Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen  
From the high Rocky slopes of the Cliffs of Dooneen  
  
Fare thee well to Dooneen, Fare thee well for a while  
And to all the fine people I'm leaving behind  
To the streams and the meadows where late I have been  
And the high rocky slopes of the Cliffs of Dooneen  
  
You may travel for far from your own native home  
Far away o'er the mountains, far away o'er the foam  
But of all the fine places that l've ever seen  
There's none to compare with the Cliffs of Dooneen
