Sit down, girl, beside me,  
Come tell me 'bout your lights.  
Got so much to talk about,  
Yeah, we could stay out all night.  
Long time ago we were lovers  
Like no one ever knew.  
Long time ago  
Your face was falling out of view.  
Haunting me  
I used to say that you were haunting me.  
Haunting me  
You know your memory was haunting me.  
Now when I'm looking at you  
I see more than just a pretty face.  
Well, I say I want you with me, girl,  
Because no one could take your place.  
Long time ago we were too free  
And easy to fool.  
Long time ago we thought  
That the fire would cool.
