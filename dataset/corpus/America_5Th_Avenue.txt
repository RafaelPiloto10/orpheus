Walking down 5th Avenue  
I saw him walking there with you  
People see and people talk  
Word travels fast round my block  
Might just save you the price of writing  
I could save you an hour or two  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Don't know what to ask of you  
My mind is gettin' so confused  
Even when I really try  
Keeps sounding like I'm saying goodbye  
Somewhere deep in my heart I'm hurtin'  
'Cause I keep on remembering you  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Such a long way to go  
How many times must I look up and say  
What kind of fool am I  
But I can't turn my back on the times that we shared  
No matter how I try  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Can't seem to shake the thought of you  
Even in the dark of night  
Your memories of shining light  
Though I'm tryin' to change direction  
I pray what I saw ain't true  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Such a long way to go  
Do, do, do, do ...
