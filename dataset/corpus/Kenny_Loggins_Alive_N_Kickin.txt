Back in the days of the 33 and 45  
First time I remember feelin' alive  
Playin' like a'ringin' a bell 'n' I learned it off the radio  
Sure it was only mama's broom but I was strummin' like a fool  
A true believer till the day I die  
If you'd a plugged me in, in front of all my friends  
I would'a set the livin' room on fire  
I was alive  
Alive 'n' Kickin'  
Like a time bomb tickin'  
Headed for the Hullaballoo  
There were no big gigs in sight  
No bright white-hot spotlight  
But everybody knew that I was Alive 'n' Kickin'  
Got in a battle of the bands when I stole my big brother's guitar  
Let me tell you, that'll never get you far  
2000 Overnights later 'n' I'm still not on the radio  
Got a new Best Friend  
He was more than Sittin' In  
'N' we were makin' our mark on the road  
Our regalia'd hit Full Sail  
'N' we were trapped into the Mother Lode  
We was alive  
Alive 'n' Kickin'  
Like a time-bomb tickin'  
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone  
As far as we could see  
It was the way it was meant to be  
The whole world knew that we was  
Alive 'n' Kickin'  
It's been miles 'n' miles  
Still Alive  
And pickin'  
Now I'm in the daze of the downloadin' digital fights  
Bit by bit, byte by byte  
But everybody says it's music 'cause they hear it on the radio  
'N' when I hit the stage I'm gonna rattle your cage  
I still remember how to howl at the moon  
And I can carry the load whether I'm on the road  
Or jus' appearing in my living room  
'Cause I am alive  
Alive 'n' Kickin'  
Like a time-bomb tickin'  
This boy's ready to blow  
Don't need to tell you why  
I'm gonna love to do it 'til the day I die  
Everybody's gonna know that I  
Am Alive 'n' Kickin'  
We been rockin' since '73  
And just between you 'n' me  
You better believe that we  
Are alive  
Alive 'n' Kickin'
