I want to spend the night  
With you  
Forever  
  
Every time we wind up spending the night  
Together  
Do you ever feel it?  
  
I want to share my life  
With you  
Forever  
  
Ever time we wind sharing a night  
Together  
Do you ever feel it?  
  
And when I stay away from you  
I never get to sleep  
I try to hug my pillow  
And pretend that you're with me  
But I can't feel it  
  
Then when we are together  
It's right there for me to see  
I can't keep looking at loneliness  
And trying to call it freedom  
Do you ever feel it?  
  
I want to spend the night  
With you  
Forever  
  
Every time we wind up spending the night  
Together  
Do you ever feel it?  
  
[Repeat x6]  
Do you ever want to spend the night?
