MAYBE NEXT YEAR  
  
When you turn on the radio  
You hear the cheerful sound  
Of Christmas carols old and new  
Sung out loud  
  
When you look around  
You can see the decors, Hanging bright  
People in panic but smiling  
Rushing around, laughing out loud  
  
It's not the best of times to say  
We're better off apart  
It's not the best of times to tell  
The people we both love  
That it's over  
That it's over  
  
CHORUS:  
But since this is the season of cheer  
We'll just brush away our tears  
And go on our way pretending  
That we're together still  
We'll tell tem tomorrow  
Or may be another day  
Maybe we won't have to say a single thing  
Maybe next year we'll say hello again  
Instead of goodbye
