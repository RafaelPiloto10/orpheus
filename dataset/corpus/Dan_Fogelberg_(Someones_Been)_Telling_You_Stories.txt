So you've heard I've been flyin'  
And tryin' to get into  
Somebody new  
And I'm off on a new love  
And don't hardly ever  
Think about you.  
  
He's gotten so cold  
He ain't the same old  
Lover you used to know.  
He's in a nose dive  
Barely half alive  
And just about to let go.  
  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
And they just ain't true  
No, they just ain't true.  
  
So you heard I got laid  
And betrayed by a maid in a one night stand  
And I'm caught in the middle of something I don't really understand.  
He's gotten so lost  
He's been double-crossed  
By a change in the wind.  
  
He's gone solo again  
And he can't slow down now  
To pick up a friend.  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
And they just ain't true  
No, they just ain't true  
They just ain't true.  
  
So you've heard I've been flyin'  
And tryin' to get into  
Somebody new  
And I'm off on a new love  
And don't hardly ever  
Think about you.  
He's gotten so cold  
He ain't the same old  
Lover you used to know.  
  
He's in a nose dive  
Barely half alive  
And just about to let go.  
  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
And they just ain't true  
Oh no, they just ain't true  
They just ain't true.
