Had to be  
No escape, no room for doubt  
No way out  
Seeing you, it was easy to decide  
Cut and dried  
Had to be  
Now we know why we exist  
Don't resist, don't even think at all  
Simply fall in love  
This is what  
Had to be  
She was easy to seduce  
Let her loose  
In a world where the fake and shallow shine  
She'll be fine  
Had to be  
She's a woman, nothing more  
Falling for wathever comes along  
She's so wrong  
A fool to herself  
Had to be  
  
Don't ever tell me  
How to live my life, who to love, what to do  
And don't try to hold on  
You are in my past I am no longer tied to you  
  
Had to be (no-one can tell me)  
For we get what we deserve (how I should live mu life)  
Lose your nerver (no-one can tell me)  
And the fates hustle in and take control (or take control)  
Of your soul  
Had to be  
But the spark of hope remains  
Adn sustains the echo of a smile  
(sustains the echo of a smile)  
For a while (no-one can tell me)  
We're fools to ourselves -have to be  
(no-one has told me)  
We're fools (it had to be)  
To ourselves  
Had to be  
You are the reason  
I am in this world  
I will be all you need  
You won't come to grief now  
You're my every thought, every word, and my every deed  
  
Had to be (you are the reason)  
For we get what we deserve (who I am in this world)  
Lose your nerve (You are the reason)  
And the fates hustle in and take control (I'll take control)  
Of your soul  
  
Had to be  
But the spark of hope remains  
And sustains the echo of a smile  
For a while (you are the reason)  
We're fools  
To ourselfs - have to be (you are the reason)  
We're fools (it had to be)  
To ourselves  
Had to be
