A night flight out to D.C.  
Phone rings with the news  
My God I'm so excited  
It's time to look for baby shoes(yes)  
Everyone says I'm glowing  
From a heart filled with joy  
To soon to be showing  
Is it a girl is it a boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Found out your My Darling Girl  
Don't you know you change my world  
Your my little doll so sweet  
You nearly knock me off my feet  
Your my little darling child seeing you makes me smile  
God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me  
  
Here's my favorite picture  
When you were 10 minutes old  
And we were right there with ya  
To wrap you up and keep you warm  
And now that your a little older  
I see your personality  
And every time that I hold ya  
I'm sure you'll know much more than me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause your My little Darling Girl  
Don't you know you change my world  
Your my little doll so sweet  
You nearly knock me off my feet  
Your my little darling child seeing you makes me smile  
God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me  
  
And you were perfect from the first day  
They getting tired of hearing me say  
I'm not ashamed to stand up and tell  
The world that your my my my baby girl oh  
  
Ladadadadada  
Ladada dada dada dada  
Hanging tight with your mama  
Traveling round the globe  
  
Telling folks about Jesus  
And how he came to save their souls  
Obviously what's important(yeah)  
  
Gotta keep teaching you  
Gotta be your example  
That shows his life in all I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You are My Darling, Darling Girl  
Don't you know you change my world  
Your my little doll so sweet  
You nearly knock me off my feet  
Your my little darling child you know I love to see you smile and  
God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me  
Oh Yes God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me...  
  
[Yolanda talking to baby]  
You go say something? Come on say something... yeah...
