Livin' in the city  
Ain't never been my idea of gettin' it on  
But the job demands that you make new plans  
Before your big chance is gone  
  
You get a house in the hills  
You're payin' everyone's bills  
And they tell you that you're gonna go far  
But in the back of my mind  
I hear it time after time  
"Is that who you really are?"  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
But your mind's on Tennessee  
Lookin' back, I can remember the time  
When I sang my songs for free  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
Take a look at everything you own  
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home  
  
Talkin' on the telephone  
Settin' up another day of people to meet  
You've gotta do what's right  
You've gotta spend the night  
Stayin' in touch with the street  
  
When you're surrounded by friends  
They say the fun never ends  
But I guess I'll never figure it out  
'Cause in the back of my mind  
I hear it time after time  
"Is this what it's all about?"  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
But your mind's on Tennessee  
Lookin' back, I can remember the time  
When I sang my songs for free  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
Take a look at everything you own  
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
But your mind's on Tennessee  
Lookin' back, I can remember the time  
When I sang my songs for free  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
Take a look at everything you own
