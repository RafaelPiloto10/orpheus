I'm sittin' here all alone, and I am thinking, ' startin' out in the rain I
felt, it pourin on the window pane  
  
I saw your face and I look, and wait to see if you're lookin back at me, I
swear it hit me like I want to be, like I want to be with you, girl  
  
I've been running and running around, been looking for you but there's no one
around  
I tried so hard to find you, you've been blowing my mind, coz I want you, girl  
  
I returned to the place, where I saw you, sittin' out in the rain, I'm wet, I
felt it rollin down my face  
  
I felt the pain that I took, coz I'm wanting you bad, girl, if you only knew  
I wish I know just what to do, you know I'm dying just to have you  
  
[Bridge:]  
I've been longing, I've been longing for a girl like you, I want to find you,
I want to love you  
I really want to be with you
