I love hearing that shower turn on  
Bet there's nothin' but a towel on you  
You sing along with some Timberlake bumpin'  
But he ain't got nothin' on you  
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring  
A goodbye kiss, then lockin' the door yeah  
Sounds like leavin' you, oh  
  
It's a little too loud on the highway  
I wanna pull back in your driveway  
It's way too quiet at my place  
Wanna come on over, come on over  
I just wanna hear that ringtone  
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone  
Wanna hear you say come on over  
'Cause when you tell me to come on over  
I like the sound of that  
  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
  
Love the sound of the thunder rollin'  
Makes you move a little closer to me  
Girl I bet that your neighbors hate us  
'Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep  
We can worry 'bout the world in the mornin'  
Light up a candle, lock the door  
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do  
  
It's a little too loud on the highway  
I wanna pull back in your driveway  
It's way too quiet at my place  
Wanna come on over, come on over  
I just wanna hear that ringtone  
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone  
Wanna hear you say come on over  
'Cause when you tell me to come on over  
I like the sound of that  
  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
  
Turn your radio on, baby turn down the lights  
I'm ain't goin' nowhere, I'm all yours tonight  
  
It's a little too loud on the highway  
I wanna pull back in your driveway  
It's way too quiet at my place  
Wanna come on over, come on over  
I just wanna hear that ringtone  
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone  
Wanna hear you say come on over  
'Cause when you tell me to come on over  
I like the sound of that  
  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
Yes I do  
I like the sound of that  
Oh
