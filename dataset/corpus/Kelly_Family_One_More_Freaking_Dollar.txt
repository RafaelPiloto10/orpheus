Hey you listen body have you got a dime  
  
For a cup of coffe

And I hear the boulevard

Just to check in a little cash  
  
All I want is one more freaking dollar  
  
All all I want is one more freaking dollar  
  
And next side they what they need  
  
And all my family we wack like do a rich party

Help me out I know that you can  
  
Anything is better then nothing  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Lucky blue came for the money in my pocket
