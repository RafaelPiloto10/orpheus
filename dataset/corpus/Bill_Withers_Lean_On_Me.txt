Sometimes in our lives we all have pain  
We all have sorrow  
But if we are wise  
We know that there's always tomorrow  
  
Lean on me, when you're not strong  
And I'll be your friend  
I'll help you carry on  
For it won't be long  
'Til I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on  
  
Please swallow your pride  
If I have faith you need to borrow  
For no one can fill those of your needs  
That you won't let show  
  
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
I just might have a problem that you'll understand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
  
Lean on me, when you're not strong  
And I'll be your friend  
I'll help you carry on  
For it won't be long  
'Til I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on  
  
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
I just might have a problem that you'll understand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
  
If there is a load you have to bear  
That you can't carry  
I'm right up the road  
I'll share your load  
  
If you just call me (call me)  
If you need a friend (call me) call me uh huh(call me) if you need a friend
(call me)  
If you ever need a friend (call me)  
Call me (call me) call me (call me) call me  
(Call me) call me (call me) if you need a friend  
(Call me) call me (call me) call me (call me) call me (call me) call me (call
me)
