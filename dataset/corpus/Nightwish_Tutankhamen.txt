As the sun sets beyond the pyramids  
To greet me with its rays  
I place my hand on my forehead  
To see your chariots' flames  
  
Watch me kneel before you  
Hear the cats meowing in the temple  
They yearn the milk you cascaded  
As I yearn that promised treasure  
  
[Chorus]  
Treasure of  
Tutankhamen  
I am the one it is  
Take me with you  
Through the stargate  
To the valley of the kings  
  
Sacrifice me  
Tutankhamen  
And let me be your queen  
Take me  
Tonight and always  
We'll breed to fill all earth  
  
Three milleniums it took me to guard your rest  
Your slumber in mighty Phoenix's nest  
But tonight the darkness in the tomb has perished  
For Carter has come to free my beloved  
  
[Chorus]
