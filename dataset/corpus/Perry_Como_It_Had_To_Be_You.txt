It had to be you, it had to be you,  
I wandered around an' finally found  
Somebody who  
Could make me be true  
Could make me be blue  
And even be glad, just to be sad, thinkin' of you,  
Some others I've seen  
Might never be mean  
Might never be cross, or try to be boss,  
But they wouldn't do  
For nobody else gave me a thrill,  
With all your faults, I love you still,  
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you!
