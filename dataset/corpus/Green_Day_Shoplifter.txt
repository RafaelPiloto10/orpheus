Shoplifter you'll never learn  
When you commit the crime  
Shoplifter your getting burned  
And now you gotta the time  
  
It's a one, two, three on the felony  
Well not everything is free  
Now that you've served the community  
It's a life of a petty thief  
  
It's not considered stealing  
Unless your getting caught  
But you be caught stealing  
Trying to take something you haven't got  
  
Shoplifter you'll never learn  
With lies behind your back  
Not a burgular, or a bankrobber just a kleptomaniac  
  
It's not considered stealing  
Unless your getting caught  
But you be caught stealing  
Trying to take something you haven't got  
  
Shoplifter you'll never learn  
When you commit the crime  
Shoplifter your getting burned  
And now you gotta do the time  
Well now you gotta do the time  
Well now you gotta do some time
