Take good care of what you've got  
My father said to me  
As he puffed his pipe and baby B.  
He dandled on his knee  
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away  
Keep all good company  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Take care of those you call your own  
And keep good company  
  
Soon I grew and happy too  
My very good friends and me  
We'd play all day with Sally J.  
The girl from number four  
Very soon I begged her won't you  
Keep me company  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Come marry me for evermore we'll  
Be good company  
  
Now marriage is an institution sure  
My wife and I our needs and nothing more  
All my friends by a year  
By and by disappeared  
But we're safe enough behind our door  
  
I flourished in my humble trade  
My reputation grew  
The work devoured my waking hours  
But when my time was through  
Reward of all my efforts my own  
Limited company  
  
I hardly noticed Sally as we  
Parted company  
All through the years in the end it appears  
There was never really anyone but me  
  
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe  
But no-one's there to see  
I ponder on the lesson of  
My life's insanity  
Take care of those you call your own  
And keep good company
