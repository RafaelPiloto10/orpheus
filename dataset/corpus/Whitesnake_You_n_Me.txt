Well it's five in the morning  
When will you be home,  
I'm tired of waiting here baby  
All on my own  
All I got for comfort is some cheap red wine  
But, the thought of what you're doing gives me no peace of mind  
  
You 'n' me, it's got to be just you 'n' me,  
Can't you see, baby  
Can't you see what you're doing to me  
  
I know those page three girls  
In the playboy books,  
Ain't got nothing on you  
In the way that you look  
But, an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth  
When you get home  
You better give me some truth  
  
Tell me no lies  
When I ask you the questions,  
Tell the truth  
Your lies ain't gonna make it no more  
Tell me no lies,  
Baby you're no exception to the rule,  
Because I've heard it all before  
And babe believe me I never forget  
  
You 'n' me, baby baby  
Just you 'n' me,  
Can't you see, baby  
If you don't stop what you're doing to me  
I'm gonna do it to you  
  
Tell me no lies  
When I ask you the questions,  
Tell the truth  
Your lies ain't gonna make it no more  
Tell me no lies,  
Baby you're no exception to the rule,  
Because I've heard it all before  
And babe believe me, I never forget  
  
You 'n' me, baby baby  
Just you 'n' me,  
Can't you see, baby  
Can't you see what you're doing to me  
  
You 'n' me, baby baby  
Just you 'n' me,  
Can't you see, baby  
If you don't stop what you're doing to me,  
I'm gonna do it to you!
