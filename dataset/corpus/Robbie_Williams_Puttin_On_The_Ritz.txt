(Irving Berlin)  
Have you seen the well-to-do  
Up and down Park Avenue  
On that famous thoroughfare  
With their noses in the air  
  
High hats and arrowed collars  
Wide spats and fifteen dollars  
Spending every dime  
For a wonderful time  
  
If you're blue and you don't know  
Where to go to, why don't you go  
Where fashion sits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Different types, who wear a day coat  
Pants with stripes, and cut away coat  
Perfect fits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Dressed up like a million dollar trooper  
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper  
Super-duper!  
  
Come, let's mix where Rockerfellers  
Walk with sticks, or umber-ellas  
In their mitts  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Spangled gowns upon a beauty  
Of hand-me-downs, on clown and cutie  
All misfits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Strolling up the avenue so happy  
All dressed up just like an English chappie  
Very snappy!  
  
You'll declare it's simply topping  
To be there, and hear them swapping  
Smart tidbits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
Puttin' on the Ritz
