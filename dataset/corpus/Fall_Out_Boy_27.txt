If home is where the heart is  
Then we're all just fucked  
I can't remember  
I can't remember  
  
And I want it so bad  
I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins  
I can't remember the good old days  
  
And it's kind of funny  
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts  
When being anchored aboard just feels like a curse  
  
[Chorus]  
My mind is a safe  
And if I keep it then we all get rich  
My body is an orphanage  
We take everyone in  
Doing lines of dust and sweat  
Off last night's stage  
Just to feel like you  
  
The milligrams in my head  
Burning tobacco in the wind  
Chasing the direction  
Chasing the direction  
Chasing the direction you went  
  
You're a bottled star  
The planets align  
Just like Mars  
You shine in the sky  
You shine in the sky  
  
Are all the good times getting gone?  
They come and go and come and go and come and go  
I've got a lot of friends who are stars  
But some are just black holes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And it's kind of funny  
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts  
When being anchored aboard just feels like a curse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If home is where the heart is  
Then we're all just fucked
