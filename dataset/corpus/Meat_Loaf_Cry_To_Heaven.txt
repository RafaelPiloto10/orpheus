Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
Say a prayer and light a candle  
Toll a bell  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
If that doesn't do it for you  
Go ahead, and cry like hell  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
Storm the castle, stem the tide  
Rise above yourself  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Cry, cry to heaven  
If that doesn't do it for you  
Go ahead, and cry like  
Go ahead, and cry like  
Go ahead, and cry like hell
