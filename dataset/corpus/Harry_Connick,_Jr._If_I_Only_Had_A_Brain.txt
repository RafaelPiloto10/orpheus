I could while away the hours  
Conferrin' with the flowers  
Consultin' with the rain  
And my head I'd be scratchin'  
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'  
If I only had a brain  
  
I'd unravel any riddle  
For any individd-el  
In trouble or in pain  
With the thoughts I'd be thinkin'  
I could be another Lincoln  
If I only had a brain  
  
Oh, I could tell you why  
The ocean's near the shore  
I could think of things I never thunk before  
And then I'd sit and think some more  
  
I would not be just a nothin'  
My head all full of stuffin'  
My heart all full of pain  
Perhaps I deserve you  
And be even worthy serve you  
If I only had  
If I only had a brain
