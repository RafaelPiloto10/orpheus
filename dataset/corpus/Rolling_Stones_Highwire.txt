We sell 'em missiles, we sell 'em tanks  
We give 'em credit, you can call the bank  
It's just a business, you can pay us in crude  
You'll love these toys, just go play out your feuds  
We've got no pride, don't care whose boots we lick  
We act so greedy, makes me sick sick sick  
  
So get up, stand up, out of my way  
I want to talk to the boss right away  
Get up, stand up, whose gonna pay  
I want to talk to the man right away  
  
We walk the highwire  
Sending the men up to the front line  
Hoping they don't catch the hell fire  
With hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
We walk the highwire  
Sending the men to the front line  
And tell 'em to pipe in the sunshine  
With hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
Our lives are threatened, our jobs at risk  
Sometimes dictators need a slap on the wrist  
Another Munich we just can't afford  
We're gonna send in the eighty-second airborne  
  
Get up, stand up, who's gonna pay  
I want to talk to the boss right away  
Get up, stand up, outta my way  
I want to talk to the man right away  
  
We walk the highwire  
Putting the world on a deadline  
And hoping we don't taste the shellfire  
Of hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
We walk the highwire  
Putting the world on a deadline  
Catching the bite on the prime time  
With hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
Get up! Stand up!  
Dealer! Stealer!  
  
We walk the highwire  
We send our men to the front lines  
An' we're hoping that we backed the right side  
With hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
We walk the highwire  
Send our men to the front lines  
And hoping they don't catch the hellfire  
With hot guns and cold cold, cold, cold,  
Cold nights  
  
Yeah! Oh yeah!  
  
We walk the highwire  
We walk the highwire  
Oh Yeah  
With hot guns and cold, cold, cold nights  
  
Oh yeah!
