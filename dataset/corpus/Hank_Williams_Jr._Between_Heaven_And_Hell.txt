Well I've seen the devil  
And I've seen the light  
And I know the difference  
Between wrong and right  
But there still are times  
When it's so hard to tell  
If I'm going the wrong way  
To heaven or hell  
  
Cause I've been a sinner  
And I've been a saint  
There's a few things I ain't done  
And a few things I can't  
I was this close to heaven when I slipped and fell  
Between a rock and a hard place  
Between heaven and hell  
  
Cause I have been lost  
And I have been found  
I've been a square  
And I've been around  
I'm down on my knees  
At the heartbreak hotel  
Begging for directions  
Between heaven and hell  
  
Cause I've been a sinner  
And I've been a saint  
There's a few things I ain't done  
And a few things I can't  
I was this close to heaven when I slipped and fell  
Between a rock and a hard place  
Between heaven and hell  
  
Lord I'm down here on my knees  
At some old hotel  
Asking for directions  
To heaven or hell
