Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonite,  
Shinin' thru the trees,  
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs  
Are floatin on the breeze  
Baby get ready.....  
  
Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stump road  
I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows  
Baby get ready..... Ooooooooooo  
  
You and me going fishing in the dark,  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows.  
Down by the river in the full moon light,  
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night  
Just movin' slow...  
  
Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you...  
  
Spring is almost over and the summer's come  
And the days are gettin' long  
Waited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you along  
Baby get ready.....  
  
And it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite  
Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night  
Baby get ready..... Ooooooooooo.  
  
Repeat the chorus (x3)  
  
You and me going fishin in the dark!
