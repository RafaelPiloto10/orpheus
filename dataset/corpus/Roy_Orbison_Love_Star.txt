Love Star, oh star of love have you forgotten me?  
I'm so lonely for someone to love  
Love Star, oh star of love look down so you may see  
Someone for me like I'm dreaming of  
  
You see because my heart is shy  
Somehow love has passed me by  
And no one knows how much I cry  
When I'm all alone for a love of my own  
  
Love Star, they say for every heart a love star shines  
So please, please shine for mine and let me find my love.

So please, please shine for mine and let me find my love.
