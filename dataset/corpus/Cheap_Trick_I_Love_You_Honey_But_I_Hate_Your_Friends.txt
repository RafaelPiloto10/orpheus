I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate those friends  
  
That fat cat frank got a heart of gold  
He's got a head of lead, he's young but he acts old  
That limp wristed two-fisted diplomat  
Better draw a map, to see where he's at  
Around and round when he rambles on  
'bout the latest deal we should be in on  
We shouldn't give him the time of day  
He doesn't give a damn if we sink or swim  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
  
Did some toot, yeah we had a blow  
Look man, no holes, real nose  
When he says hi he really means the moon  
He was there long before armstrong  
He stays loose, he says, fill her up  
For eternal youth from those swiss docs.  
He's thirty but he feels like sixteen  
Check it out: yep, hundred-n-sixteen!  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey, let's dance  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah yeah  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
  
Let's see, there's miss tique and miss informed  
General disaster, mister know-it-all  
Missus a lot and private stock  
Corporal punishment 'bout to blow his mind  
Mister mock, mister completely,  
Miss de plot, miss story,  
Mister call, mister de gaulle,  
The aging mister martin and that ain't all  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate those friends  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
They love your money  
But they'll be the end of me, oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate your friends
