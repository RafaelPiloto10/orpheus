7 am  
The garbage truck  
Beeps as it backs up  
And I start my day thinking about  
What I've thrown away  
Could I push rewind?  
All the credits strewn  
In signifying the end  
But I missed the best part  
Could we please go back  
To the start?  
Forgive my indecision  
  
Then again, then again, then again  
You're always first when  
No one's on your side  
Then again, then again, then again  
The day will come when  
I want off that ride  
  
11 am  
By now you would think  
That I would be up  
But my bedsheets shade  
The heated choices I made  
What did I find?  
I never thought I could want  
Someone so much  
'Cause now you're not here  
And I'm knee deep  
In my own fear  
Forgive my indecision  
I am only a man  
  
Then again, then again, then again  
You're always first when  
No one's on your side  
Then again, then again, then again  
The day will come when  
I want off that ride  
  
12 pm and my dusty telephone rings  
I get up from my pillow  
Who could it be?  
I hope its you  
It's you, oh  
  
Then again, then again, then again  
You're always first when  
No one's on your side  
Then again, then again, then again  
The day has come and  
I want off that ride
