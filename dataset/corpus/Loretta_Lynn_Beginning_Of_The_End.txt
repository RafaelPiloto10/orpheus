(I know we've reached the beginning of the end)  
I know your love is growing cold for your kiss is barely warm  
It's like the quiet before the night it's like the calm before the storm  
When we're kissing something's missing  
And things aren't like they've been  
I know we've reached the beginning of the end  
The beginning of the end for you and me  
I love you but I've lost you I can see  
I don't know who I've lost you to  
I don't know where or why or when  
I know we've reached the beginning of the end  
I know we've reached the beginning of the end
