Dance with me darlin' 'til dawn  
I want to sway in your arms  
'Til the stars fade away  
Fade away  
Moving together as one  
'Til the first gentle rays of the sun  
Light up the day  
Light the day  
  
[Chorus]  
And while the music still plays  
Please let me hear you keep saying  
Over and over I'm falling  
Falling in love with you  
  
Say there's no way I could lose you  
Hold me tight  
I'm falling in love tonight  
Touch me and tell me it's true  
That I'm not asleep and that you  
Are not just a dream  
Just a dream  
  
Here with your heart pressed to mine  
We flow like the river that winds  
It's way to the sea  
To the sea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say there's no way I could lose you  
Hold me tight  
I'm falling in love tonight  
Hold me tight  
I'm falling in love tonight
