Strong and invincible  
They know every rule  
Seems inconceivable  
Anything they do  
  
They made us their slaves  
We weren't unified  
Ever since we paid  
For selling our lives  
  
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland  
Don't you, won't you say that we''ll be free again  
  
Deprived of our consciousness  
We can't predict what's more  
Can you remember how  
Things used to be before?  
  
I secretly dream  
Of things we will be taught  
Will someone esteem  
For those who have fought?  
  
(Solo)  
  
Strong and invincible  
They know every rule  
Seems inconceivable  
Anything they do  
  
Deep in our hearts  
We hope our dreams come true  
The only thing is  
What are we to do?  
  
Won't you say it  
Can't you feel it?
