Star people  
Counting your money until your soul turns green  
Star people  
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen  
  
I do not count myself among you  
I may have been living in a dream  
It's just there seem so many of you  
Can't help but hope there's a difference between  
  
And if I live to be a hundred and one  
I will never understand what you are, honey?  
  
I'm looking for sympathy  
Just get me on NBC  
And where's the hell's my dumb ass PR?  
  
I said maybe your mama gave you up boy  
(It's the same old same old)  
I said maybe your daddy didn't love you enough girl  
(How much is enough)  
  
Star people  
Never forget your secrets safe with me  
Just look at all the wonderful people  
Trying to forget just who and what they have been  
  
Oh, it's a dream  
With a nightmare stuck in the middle  
Are you serious? I'm just curious  
Without all this attention  
You'd die  
I'd die  
We'd die (Wouldn't we baby)  
  
And if I live to be a hundred and one  
I will never understand what you are  
(I'm talking to you)  
You're looking for sympathy from people who work to eat  
And they don't really seem to mind  
  
I said maybe your mama gave you up boy  
(It's the same old same old)  
I said maybe baby your daddy didn't love you enough girl  
  
How much is enough?  
How much is enough?  
How much is enough?  
Are you serious? I'm just curious  
Are you serious? I'm just curious  
  
Yeah more glycerin  
Let's go back to the day  
DJ (Why do you wanna tell me that?)  
DJ (Get yourself some Oprah cash)  
Is that what makes a star?  
  
Did you get off on a bad foot, baby  
Do you have a little tale to tell  
Did you get off on a bad foot, bad, bad foot?  
Is that why you're a star?  
  
Do you really think you've got it so hard?  
Do you think it might do you some good to look around you  
And decide how you might feel  
If the pain you felt was real  
Tell me  
  
Now nothing comes for nothing, baby  
That fame and fortune's heaven sent  
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling  
'Cause you can pay the rent  
You can pay
