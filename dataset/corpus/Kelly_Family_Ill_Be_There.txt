Should the sky just turn to black  
And all birds die and fall  
When the ghosts go marching down the street  
Marching through you walls  
Chorus:  
I'll be there for you  
With you, my friend  
I'll be there for you  
With you, my friend  
Hear my cry, hear my cry  
Should a flower be stoned to death  
And love is not around  
When you're hungered and you tongue is dry  
But your bread is filled with worms  
Chorus  
Hear my cry, hear my cry  
Hear my cry, hear my cry  
Should the stars decide not to shine  
And the world is cold as ice  
Whe babies only crie  
Chorus  
Here my cry, here my cry
