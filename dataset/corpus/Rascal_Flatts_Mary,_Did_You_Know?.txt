Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Would one day walk on water?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Would save our sons and daughters?  
  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has come to make you new?  
This child that you've delivered  
Will soon deliver you.  
  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will give sight to a blind man?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will calm a storm with His hand?  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has walked where angels trod?  
And when you've kissed your little baby  
Then you've kissed the face of God.  
Oh Mary did you know?  
  
Mary did you know?  
The blind will see the deaf will hear  
The dead will live a-gain  
The lame will leap the dumb will speak  
The praises of the Lamb.  
  
Oh Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Is Lord of all creation?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will one day rule the nations?  
  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Is heaven's perfect Lamb?  
And the sleeping child you're holding  
Is the great I am.  
Oh Mary
