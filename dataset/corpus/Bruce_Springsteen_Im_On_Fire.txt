Hey little girl is your daddy home?  
Did he go and leave you all alone?  
Mm-Hm, I got a bad desire  
  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
  
Tell me now baby is he good to you?  
And can he do to you the things that I do? -  
Oh no, I can take you higher  
  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
  
Sometimes, it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull  
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull  
  
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet  
And a freight train running through the middle of my head  
Only you, can cool my desire  
  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
  
Hoo Hoo Hoo  
Hoo Hoo Hoo  
Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo  
Hoo Hoo Hoo  
Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo
