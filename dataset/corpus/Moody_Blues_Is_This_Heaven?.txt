Walking home with you last night  
You said the world is beautiful  
And how things look that way when you're  
Love  
I love this world  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
  
I opened up the letter that the  
Postman gave to me this morning  
Had to stop myself from shouting out  
"I love this world"  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
  
I know that heaven waits  
For those whose love is true  
I want to be there when  
The age love is come again  
  
Tell me all about yourself  
And how you came to me like in a dream  
And every night I dream of you  
I dream of you  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
  
I know that heaven waits  
For those whose love is true  
Don't ask me where or when  
The time for us will come again  
  
I sit and watch the sun go down  
And in the darkness there's no sound  
While in the sky tonight the stars all cry "I love  
You"  
Are they crying out over you  
''cause you're in my heart  
Is this heaven?  
''cause the story starts and ends with you
