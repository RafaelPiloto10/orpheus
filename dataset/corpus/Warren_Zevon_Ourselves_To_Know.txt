Warren Zevon, Zevon Music BMI  
We left Constantinople in a thousand ninety-nine  
To restore the one True Cross was in this heart of mine  
To bring it to Jerusalem and then sail home to Rhodes  
We took that holy ride ourselves to know  
We took that holy ride ourselves to know  
Everyone got famous, everyone got rich  
Everyone went off the rails and ended in the ditch  
But we had to take that long, hard road to see where it would go  
We took that holy ride ourselves to know  
We took that holy ride ourselves to know  
Now if you make a pilgrimage I hope you find your grail  
Be loyal to the ones you leave with even if you fail  
Be chivalrous to strangers you meet along the road  
As you take that holy ride yourselves to know  
You take that holy ride yourselves to know
