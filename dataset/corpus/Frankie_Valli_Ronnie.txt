I'll go on living and keep on forgiving  
Because you were my first love  
So very warm and tender the way you loved me  
Hey girl can't you remember and want more of me  
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie why did you go  
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I am regretting but can't stop forgetting  
Because you were my first love  
You say now you don't need me because I cheated  
Why didn't you believe me when I repeated  
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie you'll never know  
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving  
Because you were my first love  
I walk alone I cry at home  
Night after night  
Day after day  
Oh I never cheated  
Oh I still repeat it  
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie you'll never know  
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving  
Because you were my first love  
Repeat to fade I'll go on living and keep on forgiving  
Beacuse you were my first love
