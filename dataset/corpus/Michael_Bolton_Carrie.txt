Carrie is a girl disillusioned by the world and her crazy man  
So she takes her vows and she swears no matter how she'll never fall again  
Carrie, who can blame you if you find some kind of refuge in your solitude  
But there's gotta come a time when your passion for your freedom makes a slave
of you  
She said wait, wait, wait  
  
Chorus:  
  
Carrie don't you run, Carrie don't you run, Carrie, Carrie, don't you hide  
What's going on inside  
Carrie don't you run, Carrie don't you run, Carrie, Carrie, don't you hide  
What's going on inside  
  
Carrie once again in the company of friends 'Cause she's so alone  
Ever so aware of a part of her that no one's ever really known  
There will come a day when she'll find a way to fade into the scenery  
Carrie are you alive or just going through the motions like you seem to be  
She lives in a dream to wait for a dream who waits for tomorrow  
She said wait, wait, wait  
Now Carrie don't you fight it, no don't even try  
'Cause in your heart what's been decided just will not be denied  
Am I getting through to you all I wanna do for you, is take you for a ride  
Oh Carrie, Carrie, Carrie  
  
Chorus:  
  
Carrie don't you run, Carrie don't you run
