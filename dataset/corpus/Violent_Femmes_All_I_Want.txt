All I want is to talk to you  
All I want is to talk to you  
I'm achin' for your touch  
I'm breakin' cause I miss you so much  
Do you miss me, too?  
All I want is to walk with you  
All I want is to walk with you  
I'm hopin' for your kiss  
I'm dopin' cause I miss you so much  
Do you miss me, too?  
Little bit closer, little bit closer, someday  
When I try to get closer, then you move away  
And all I want to say is all I want is to be with you  
All I want is to be with you  
You're hurting deep inside  
You're flirting cause you need to feel that you are still alive  
Little bit closer, little bit closer, someway  
When I try to get closer, then you move away  
And all I want to say is all I want is to walk with you  
All I want is to talk with you  
I'm prayin' for one night  
I'm layin' so low cause I love you so though I know it ain't right
