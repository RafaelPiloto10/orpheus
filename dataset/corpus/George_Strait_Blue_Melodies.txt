I don't know how to write you a song  
That says, I'm sorry, I know I was wrong  
I can't find the words that don't make it cheap  
It's right on the verge and just out of reach  
It must be a sad song with a blue melody  
And I'll bet you it's lonesome, as lonesome as can be  
But I'm starting to wonder if there's such a thing  
As a sad song that's too sad to sing  
  
Maybe tonight, maybe this time tomorrow  
Me and this guitar will get right with this sorrow  
And I'll play it for you, and you'll come back to me  
'Cause you were always a fool for the blue melodies  
  
So it must be a sad song in three quarter time  
That chills down to the bone when the steel guitars cry  
But if it's not the one that brings you home to me  
Then it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing  
  
Awe but if it's not the one that brings you back to me  
Then it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing  
  
Oh, it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing
