At the edge of the world  
Where you were no one  
Yet you were the girl  
The only one  
At the edge of the world  
In the desert heat  
One shivering star  
Sweet indiscreet  
  
I knew you  
When we were young  
I knew you  
Now you're gone  
  
In a little Narcissus pool  
Drawn by its spell  
We saw ourselves  
Raw excitable  
I knew you  
When we were young  
I knew you  
Now you're gone  
  
We didn't know  
The precariousness  
Of our young powers  
All the emptiness  
  
Wild,wild hair  
Sad,sad eyes  
White shirt black tie  
You were mine  
  
You grabbed the ring  
Of the carousel  
Tangoing  
From Heaven to Hell  
I knew you
