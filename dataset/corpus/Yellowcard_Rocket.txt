Sleeping late on  
Warm afternoon  
Waking up to  
Bright silver moon  
  
Silent words from  
My heart to you  
My empty filled  
Filled up with you  
  
Rockets fly  
Rockets fly  
I slip another smile in your pocket  
My heart is racing to you like a rocket  
  
Rockets fly  
Rockets fly  
I slip another smile in your pocket  
My heart is racing to you like a rocket  
The two of us we dream like one  
Our energy could light the sun  
The two of us take breath as one  
The two of us... The two of us...
