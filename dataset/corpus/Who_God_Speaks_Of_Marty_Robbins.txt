And when the world began  
I'd been asleep forever  
I opened one eye  
'Twas then it was I  
Got the whim to wake  
  
And when the weight of space  
Rolled like it was an ocean  
One became one  
Father and son  
Watched the sunrise break  
  
And as the ocean warmed  
And from this dream we woke  
One sang to greet the dawn  
One pursed his lips and spoke  
  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear the music play  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear what the people say  
  
I heard the heavens sing  
Predicting Marty Robbins  
I knew I'd find  
Music and time  
Were the perfect plan  
  
I watched my son sail on  
A little ship a-bobbin'  
I had to grow  
I needed to know  
Exactly who I am  
  
And as the ocean warmed  
And from this dream we woke  
One sang to greet the dawn  
One pursed his lips and spoke  
  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear the music play  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear what the people say  
  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear the music play  
Wake up and hear the music  
Wake up and hear what the people say
