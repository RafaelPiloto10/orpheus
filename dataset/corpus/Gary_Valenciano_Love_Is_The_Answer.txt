Name your price  
Ticket to paradise  
I can't stay here anymore  
And I've looked high and low  
I've been from shore to shore  
If there's a shortcut, I'd have found it  
But there's no easy way around it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Light of the world, shine on me  
Love is the answer  
Shine on us all, set us free  
Love is the answer  
  
Who knows why  
Someday we all must die  
We are hopeless boys and girls  
And we are never heard  
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely world  
People turn their heads and walk on by  
Tell me is it worth just another try  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Tell me, are we alive  
Or just a dyin' planet  
(What are the chances?)  
Ask the man in your heart  
For the answer  
  
And when you feel the pain (love one another)  
And when you've lost your way (love one another)  
And when you're all alone (love one another)  
And when you're far from home (love one another)  
And when you're down and out (love one another)  
And when your hopes run out (love one another)  
And when you need a friend (love one another)  
And when you're near the end (love, we've got to love)
