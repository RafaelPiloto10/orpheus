How can things go wrong  
When you're here with me  
All of time and space would stop  
They'd stop for you and me  
How can we go wrong  
We're like words within a song  
Perfect rhyme and perfect time  
And perfect harmony  
Now our words have lost their way  
And all they seem to say  
You don't intend to stay with me  
Tell me why  
When we have come this far  
We're happy as we are  
But now  
How can I feel right  
When you're not by my side  
Strange that I'm here all alone  
As I recall the happy times  
The happy songs, the perfect rhymes  
How can I go on  
How can I move on  
How can I, how can I  
Without you  
Now our words have lost their way  
And all they seem to say  
You don't intend to stay with me  
Tell me why  
When we have come this far  
We're happy as we are  
But now, now  
How can I feel right  
When you're not by my side  
Strange that I'm here all alone  
As I recall the happy times  
The happy songs, the perfect rhymes  
How can I go on  
How can I move on  
How can I, how can I, how can I
