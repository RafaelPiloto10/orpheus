I've played the game of love before  
Too young to know  
How hard the fall could be  
I never thought I'd try again  
Somehow you brought  
The gambler out in me  
  
You can deal me in this time around  
Even though the odds are high  
We'll play them down  
You may be a chance I need to take  
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake  
  
Happy is the way I'm feelin'  
And I know it comes from being with you  
All at once my life is changin'  
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love  
With you  
Fallin' in love with you  
Fallin' in love  
Fallin' in love with you  
  
If this is luck then let it ride  
If it's the stars  
They're surely on my side  
I've never been so satisfied  
By love before  
For all the times I've tried  
  
These beginnings could mean more  
Than the brief affair I bargained for  
Little did I know when we began  
That my time had come to win a hand  
  
Happy is the way I'm feelin'  
And I know it comes from being with you  
All at once my life is changin'  
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love  
With you  
Fallin' in love with you  
Fallin' in love  
Fallin' in love with you  
  
Please forgive me if I seem  
To be walking through a waking dream  
Laughter never came so easily  
There's a freedom here that's new to me  
  
Happy is the way I'm feelin'  
And I know it comes from being with you  
All at once my life is changin'  
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love  
With you  
Fallin' in love with you  
Fallin' in love  
Fallin' in love with you
