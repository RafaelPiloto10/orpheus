Ladies and gentleman, the preacher's son  
Patti LaBelle is in the building  
  
Let's celebrate, have a basement party  
A barbeque how we used to do  
On the avenue, have a family reunion  
Man, how I miss those days  
When the kids was kids, no knives on the street  
When the ice cream man came around the way  
Lord, Miss Patti, won't you help me sing  
Lord knows how I miss those days  
  
Dressing up for church on Easter Sunday (how I miss those days)  
Doing the electric slide at every party (how I miss those days)  
Oh, if only you knew, what I've been through (you would celebrate)  
You would celebrate (everybody just celebrate, how I miss those days)  
Get up, you would celebrate (celebrate, everything's gonna be ok, how I miss
those days)
