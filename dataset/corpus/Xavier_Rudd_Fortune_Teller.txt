Well I see, because this is my window  
Your questions, with every move I make  
So much time, I filled up with answers  
To why my feet, will always hold their ground  
Need to be the one  
Redefine yourself  
See it in your mind  
This is all a game  
Do it all again  
Redefine yourself  
See it in your mind  
This is all a game  
This is my fortune  
Well I see, the sun in my window  
That questions will remain  
This is my fortune
