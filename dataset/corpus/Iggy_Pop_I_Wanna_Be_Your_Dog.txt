So messed up I want you here  
And in my room I want you here  
And now we're gonna be face to face  
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place  
Yeah you know what that is  
  
Now I want to be your dog  
Now I want to be your dog  
Now I want to be your dog  
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it)  
  
Ooh give it to me  
Now I'm ready to close my eyes  
Yes now I'm ready to close my mind  
Now I'm ready to feel your hands  
Lose my heart on the burning sand  
  
Now I want to be your dog  
Now I want to be your dog  
Now I want to be your dog  
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it)  
  
Do it  
Yeah that's right  
  
So messed up I want you here  
And in my room I want you here

Now I want to be your dog  
Now I want to be your dog  
Now I want to be your dog  
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it)  
  
Well come on  
I'll be your dog
