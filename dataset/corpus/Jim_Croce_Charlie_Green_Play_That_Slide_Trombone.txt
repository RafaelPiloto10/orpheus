I know a fool who blows a horn  
He comes from way down South, oh yeah  
And you ain't seen some blowin' since you been born  
Like when a trombone's to his mouth  
He wails and moans, grunts and groans  
He can moan just like a cow  
And you ain't seen some blowin' since you been born  
Cause he won't show them how  
Chorus:  
Oh Charlie won't you play that thing  
I mean the slide trombone  
Make it talk  
Make it sing  
I mean the slide trombone  
If Gabriel knew how you could blow  
He'd let you lead his band I know  
Oh Charlie won't you play that thing  
I mean the slide trombone  
Chorus  
Now you ain't seen such movin' hips  
Like when the trombone's to his lips  
Charlie Green play that thing  
I mean the slide trombone  
Oh yeah, I mean the slide trombone
