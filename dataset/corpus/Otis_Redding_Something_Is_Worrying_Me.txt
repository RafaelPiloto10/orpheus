Something is worrying me, yeah  
And that something is driving me in misery, oh  
I can tell the way things change  
That you've been loving some other man  
That's why something keeps on worrying me, yes it is  
That's why something is worrying me, oh  
  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
I can tell by the way you smile  
I know things haven't been this way  
I stopped to love you each and every day  
And that something keeps on worrying me, yeah  
That's why something is driving me in misery, yeah  
  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
That you've been loving some other guy  
That's why something keeps on worrying me, oh yes it is  
That's why something keeps on worrying me, darling  
That something baby  
Is deep down in my heart  
Is worrying me baby  
I know you love somebody  
I know you have somebody else  
It's worrying me baby  
I need you right here by my side
