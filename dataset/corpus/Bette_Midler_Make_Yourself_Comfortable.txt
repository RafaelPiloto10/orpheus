I've got some records here  
To put you in the mood.  
The phone is off the hook  
So no one can intrude.  
I feel romantic  
And the record changes automatic, baby.  
Sweetheart, we hurried through the dinner  
And we hurried through the dance.  
We left before the picture show was through.  
Why did we hurry through the dinner  
And hurry through the dance?  
To leave some time for this.  
To hug and hug and kiss and kiss.  
Take off your shoesies, dear,  
And loosen up your tie.  
I got some kisses here.  
Let's try one on for size.  
Turn the lights low. oooh, turn 'em low.  
Whoa, baby.  
Ooh, to hug and hug and kiss and kiss.  
Now, baby, take off your shoes  
And loosen up you tie.  
I got some kisses here.  
Let's try one on for size.  
Turn the lights low. come on, turn 'em low.  
Ohh, baby.

You know I just wanna take you up with me to paradise.  
Boy ya da bah do bah do do bah buh bah da.  
Please pour a little bit of wine, will ya pretty baby?  
Pretty baby, why don't you come over here  
And get comfortable? make yourself comfortable.  
All I really wanna hear is that  
Ya really like what I'm givin'.  
And I hope that you know I love you.  
Darlin'! look how much time  
It took me to say I love you!  
Look what I went through to say I love you!
