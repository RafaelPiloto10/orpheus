Take a hard look around you, babe,  
There ain't nobody got it made  
So you can live in your head  
Or you can live in your heart  
But if you don't live at all  
Then why the hell did you start ?  
Thrill's a thrill  
I said a thrill's a thrill  
Even in paradise  
A thrill's a thrill.  
Now the young boys are all hanging out in the bars,  
Old men they don't have to cruise all night in cars.  
And those young girls love the smell of flowers,  
Old women love to play with them for hours.  
Gays are straight -  
And straights are weird  
The bi's just call  
Everybody 'dear'.  
You know a thrill's a thrill  
I said a thrill's a thrill  
Even in paradise.  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
Down to get up -  
Yeah, up to get down.  
Oh, I will try anything  
If it makes my head go round.  
Leather whips  
And fingertips  
I know a boy who is growing, growing.  
A thrill's a thrill  
A thrill's a thrill  
Even in paradise  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
Take a hard look around you, baby,  
Ain't nobody got it made.  
You can live in your head,  
You can live in your heart  
And if you don't live at all  
Then why the hell did you start ?  
A thrill's a thrill  
A thrill's a thrill  
Even in paradise  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
A thrill's ...
