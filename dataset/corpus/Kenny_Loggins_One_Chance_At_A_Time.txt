Hello there  
You tell me  
You got a lot of real respect  
For my kind  
The Old Timers  
I'm old enough to know the rules.  
But nobody gave me the book  
I had to learn to improvise myself  
'n time 'n time I let me down  
Until I learned the hard way  
How to feel  
What's real  
  
Chorus:  
  
But you get one chance at a life  
To give it all and get it right  
'n after all this time in mine  
Everything I thought I knew  
Was tellin' me  
To give it up  
And leave it all behind  
But you get endless second chances  
To take it One Chance at a Time  
  
For love 'n money  
I made a lot-a dumb mistakes  
In my time  
Believe me  
I proved and proved it  
I can't believe I'm gonna prove it again  
It's time to reinvent myself  
But where the hell does the fire come from  
When makin' it don't make it anymore?  
  
Chorus  
  
Time and Love  
I been lookin' all my life  
For time and love  
Hoping a breeze will come 'n take me  
I been waiting  
And waiting  
And sailing in one place  
Like a bird against the wind  
Afraid to turn and fly away
