You tell me what you think I'm feelin', you know why I do what I do  
Why should you listen to a word I'm sayin', when it's already so clear to you  
You tell me 'bout my bad intentions, you doubt the very things I hold true  
I can no longer live with your misconceptions, baby all I can say to you, is  
  
[Chorus]  
That ain't love, I believe you've got the wrong emotion  
That ain't love, at least it doesn't feel like love to me  
As long as I say what you want to hear  
Do what you want to do, be who you want me to be  
You think that's love, well baby that ain't love to me  
  
We've got to talk it over sometime, these feelings won't just disappear  
I'm just gonna keep telling you what's on my mind  
Even if it's not what you want to hear  
Oooh right now your world and mine are such different places  
Through yours I wander lost and confused  
And I feel like I'm speaking in a different language  
And the only words I haven't used, are  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You keep tellin' me, you know a place where your life would be better  
You're makin' plans long-range  
But I don't know how you expect to get there, when you refuse to change  
  
Oooh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh baby that ain't love, that ain't lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love  
That ain't love, oh no, baby that ain't love, that ain't love  
(That ain't love, that ain't love, that ain't love, oohoo)
