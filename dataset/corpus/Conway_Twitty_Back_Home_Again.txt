There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rollin' in  
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders  
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away  
The whinin' of his wheels just makes it colder  
  
He's an hour away from ridin' on your prayers up in the sky  
Ten days on the road are barely gone  
There's a fire softly burnin', suppers on the stove  
It's the light in your eyes that makes him warm  
  
Hey, it's good to be back home again  
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend  
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again  
  
There's all the news to tell him, how'd you spend your time  
What's the latest thing the neighbors say?  
And your mother called last Friday, sunshine made her cry  
You felt the baby move just yesterday  
  
Hey, it's good to be back home again  
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend  
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again  
  
Oh, the time that I can lay this tired old body down  
Feel your fingers feather soft upon me  
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way  
The happiness that livin' with you brings me  
  
It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you  
It's the little things that make a house a home  
Like a fire softly burnin' and supper on the stove  
The light in your eyes that makes me warm  
  
Hey, it's good to be back home again, you know it is  
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend  
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again  
I said hey, it's good to be back home again
