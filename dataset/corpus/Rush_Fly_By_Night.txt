Why try? I know why  
The feeling inside me says it's time I was gone  
Clear head, new life ahead  
It's time I was king now -- not just one more pawn  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fly by night, away from here  
Change my life again  
Fly by night, goodbye my dear  
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend  
  
Moon rise, thoughtful eyes  
Staring back at me from the window beside  
No fright or hindsight  
Leaving behind that empty feeling inside  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fly by night, away from here  
Change my life again  
Fly by night, goodbye my dear  
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend  
  
Start a new chapter  
Find what I'm after  
It's changing every day  
The change of a season  
Is enough of a reason  
To want to get away  
Quiet and pensive  
My thoughts apprehensive  
The hours drift away  
Leaving my homeland  
Playing a lone hand  
My life begins today  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fly by night, away from here  
Change my life again  
Fly by night, goodbye my dear  
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
