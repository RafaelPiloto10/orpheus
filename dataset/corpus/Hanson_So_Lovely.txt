She owns a shotgun and a fourty-four  
And a five-pound chihuahua named El Salvador  
She likes to lie under the stars at night  
And watch the sky as the plains pass by  
  
You know that skirt's so short your eyes could bleed  
Yes, she acts like she's a royal queen of modesty  
She'll keep you guessing 'cause her eyes deceive  
When you think you got it made  
She's got the aces up her sleeve  
  
She's so lovely  
And she lets you believe what you want to believe  
When she loves me  
All you know she can do no wrong  
  
You know she wants to buy a limousine  
So she can always look important everytime she's seen  
She's got a smile that you can't believe  
And the junk in her trunk! It'll bring you to your knees  
  
She's so lovely  
And she lets you believe what you want to believe  
When she loves me  
All you know she can do no wrong  
  
Oh no, she can do no wrong  
Say, you know she can do no wrong  
When she loves me  
  
When she goes out with the girls at night  
She won't be back until the dawn of the morning light  
She quit her job at the sales and loan  
Now she's working for the nation  
Got a job in immigration  
  
She's so lovely  
And she lets you believe what you want to believe  
When she loves me  
All you know she can do no wrong  
  
Oh no, she can do no wrong  
Say, you know she can do no wrong  
When she loves me
