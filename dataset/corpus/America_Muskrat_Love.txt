Muskrat, muskrat candlelight  
Doin' the town and doin' it right  
In the evenin'  
It's pretty pleasin'  
  
Muskrat Susie, muskrat Sam  
Do the jitterbug out in muskrat land  
And they shimmy  
And Sammy's so skinny  
  
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed  
Singin' and jinglin' the jango  
Floatin' like the heavens above  
It looks like muskrat love  
  
Nibblin' on bacon, Chewin' on cheese  
Sammy says to Suisie "Honey would you please be my missus?"  
And she says yes  
With her kisses  
  
And now he's ticklin' her fancy  
Rubbin' her toes,  
Muzzle to muzzle, now anything goes  
As they wiggle  
And Sue starts to giggle  
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed  
Singin' and jinglin' the jango  
Floatin' like the heavens above  
It looks like muskrat love
