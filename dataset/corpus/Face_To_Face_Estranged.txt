Day after day you go on living  
While I wait it still feels the same  
I'm stuck for answers while you place the blame  
I guess it comes to this again  
So what's there left to say  
You thought you'd feel no different  
Now that everything has changed  
  
I guess it comes to this again  
What difference does it make?  
That you and I think better  
Of the choices that we've made  
It's fading away  
I don't remember everything  
The words we used to say  
Seem insignificant today
