Now I'll tell you plainly, baby, what a plan to do.  
Say, I may be crazy, woman, but I ain't no fool.  
Your daddy's rich, mama, and you're overdue  
But I ain't the one, baby, been messin' with you.  
Got bells in your mind, lady, and it's easy to see.  
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe.  
  
Or are you tryin' to put a hook on me? oh no...  
  
Now you're talkin' jive, woman, when you say to me  
That your daddy's gonna take us in, baby, 'n take care of me.  
You know and I know, woman, I ain't the one.  
I never hurt you, sweetheart, said, I never pulled my gun.  
Got bells in your mind, mama, and it's easy to see.  
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe.  
  
Time for me to put my boots out in the streets.  
Are you ready?  
Walk on!  
  
Alright little missy, let me tell you a thing or two...  
  
Now you're talkin' jive, woman, when you say to me  
That your daddy's gonna take us in, baby, 'n take care of me.  
You know and I know, woman, I ain't the one.  
I never hurt you, sweetheart, said, I never pulled my gun.  
Got bells in your mind, mama, and it's easy to see.  
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe.  
  
Oh, I must be in the middle of some kinda conspiracy...
