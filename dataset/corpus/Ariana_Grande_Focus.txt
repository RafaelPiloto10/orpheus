[Intro]  
Hey  
  
[Verse 1]  
I know what I came to do  
And that ain't gonna change  
So go ahead and talk your talk  
Cause I won't take the bait  
I'm over here doing what I like  
I'm over here working day and night  
And if my real ain't real enough  
I'm sorry for you, bae  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Let's find a light inside our universe now  
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down  
Just come and get it, let them say what they say  
Cause I'm about to put them all away  
  
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Ariana Grande)]  
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me  
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me  
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me)  
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me)  
  
[Verse 2]  
I can tell you're curious  
It's written on your lips  
Ain't no need to hold it back  
Go 'head and talk your shit  
I know you're hoping that I'll react  
I know you're hoping I'm looking back  
But if my real ain't real enough  
Then I don't know what is  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Let's find a light inside our universe now  
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down  
Just come and get it, let them say what they say  
Cause I'm about to put the mud away  
  
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Ariana Grande)]  
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me  
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me  
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me)  
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me)  
  
[Breakdown]  
1, 2, 3, c'mon girls  
You're gonna like it  
Come on, now, now  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Let's find a light inside our universe now  
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down  
Just come and get it, let them say what they say  
Cause I'm about to put the mud away  
  
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Ariana Grande)]  
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me  
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me  
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me)  
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me)  
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me  
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me  
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me)  
Focus on me (Focus), f-f-focus on me (Focus on me)
