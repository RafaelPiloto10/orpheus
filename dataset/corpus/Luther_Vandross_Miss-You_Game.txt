Been so long since we brokeup  
But it still feels just the same  
Still feels like I'm a pawn  
Playing the miss-you game.  
  
The same sun rises and then it sets  
The waves toss and turn and break  
The clocks tick away louder each time  
But I still lie here awake.  
  
The croked smile still appiers  
When some one mentions your name  
Gonna be a victom forever  
A victom of this miss-you game.  
  
Time is the only strong whip  
That can make my wild passions tame  
Till then I'm on the board forever  
Dragging on the miss you game.
