Something in your eyes makes me wanna lose myself  
Makes me wanna lose myself in your arms  
Something in your voice, makes my heart beat fast  
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life  
  
If you knew how lonely my life has been  
And how low I've felt for so long  
And if you knew how I wanted someone to come along  
And change my world the way you've done  
  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like I'm all the way back where I've come from  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong  
  
Another window breaks down a long, dark street  
And a siren wails in the night  
But that's alright, 'cause I have you here with me  
And I can almost see, through the dark there is light  
  
Well, if you knew how much this moment means to me  
And how long I've waited for your touch  
And if you knew how happy you are making me  
I never thought that I'd love anyone so much  
  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like I'm all the way back where I've come from  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
