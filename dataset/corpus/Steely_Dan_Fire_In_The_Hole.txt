I decline  
To walk the line  
They tell me that I'm lazy  
Worldly wise  
I realize  
That everybody's crazy  
A woman's voice reminds me  
To serve and not to speak  
Am I myself or just another freak  
  
Don't you know  
There's fire in the hole  
And nothing left to burn  
I'd like to run out now  
There's nowhere left to turn  
  
With a cough  
I shake it off  
And work around my yellow stripe  
Should I hide  
And eat my pride  
Or wait until it's good and ripe  
My life is boiling over  
It's happened once before  
I wish someone would open up the door  
  
Don't you know  
There's fire in the hole  
And nothing left to burn  
I'd like to run out now  
There's nowhere left to turn
