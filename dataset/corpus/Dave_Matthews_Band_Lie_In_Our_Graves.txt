When I step into the light  
My arms are open wide  
When I step into the light  
My eyes searching wildly  
Would you not like to be  
Sitting on top of the world with your legs hanging free  
Would you not like to be  
Ok ok ok  
  
When I'm walking by the water  
Splish splash me and you takin a bath  
When I'm walking by the water  
Comes up through my toes  
To my ankles  
To my head  
To my soul  
And I'm blown away  
  
When I'm walking by the water  
Splish splash me and you takin a bath  
When I'm walking by the water  
Comes up through my toes  
To my ankles  
To my head  
To my soul  
And I'm blown away  
  
I can't believe that we would lie in our graves,  
Wondering if we  
Had spent our living days well  
I can't believe that we would lie in our graves  
Dreaming of things that we might have been  
  
Would you not like to be  
I can't believe that you would not like to be  
Ok ok ok  
Ok ok ok
