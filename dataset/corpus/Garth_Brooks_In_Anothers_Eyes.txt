In another's eyes  
I'm someone who  
Loves her enough  
To walk away from you  
I'd never cheat  
And I would never lie  
In another's eyes  
In another's eyes  
I can do no wrong  
And he believes in me  
And his faith is strong  
I'd never fall  
Or even compromise  
In another's eyes  
In another's eyes  
I'm afraid that I can't see  
This picture perfect portrait  
That they paint of me  
They don't realize  
And I pray they never do  
'Cause every time I look  
I'm seein' you  
In another's eyes  
In another's eyes  
Starin' back at me  
I see a sinkin' soul  
Tryin' desperately  
To turn the tide  
Before it dies  
In another's eyes  
And what they don't see  
Is killing me  
It's blessing and a curse  
That love is blind  
'Cause in another's eyes  
I'm afraid that I can't see  
This picture perfect portrait  
That they paint of me  
And they don't realize  
And I pray to God they never do  
'Cause every time I look  
I'm seein' you  
In another's eyes
