I breathe the scent of your hair  
(Your emerald eyes are closed)  
There's still some music in the air  
(Feels like time no more flows)  
We sit, you're in my arms  
(Watching the first daylight gleam)  
You say, "I like your warmth"  
(A voice just in a dream)  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the fire  
Of the time when it was wild  
I was dreaming far too sweet  
And so you disappear  
In chaos waters I do swim  
(And you're the stone one's thrown into)  
A frail creature now gets dim  
(As the gold turns into blue)  
Made me think you were so damn near  
(Like a bright shining star)  
But reaching out, you disappeared  
(For real you are so very far)  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the fire  
Of the time when it was wild  
I was dreaming far too sweet  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the fire  
Of the time when it was wild  
I was dreaming far too sweet  
And so..  
(I dreampt of the wind)  
I'd run, so sweet  
(I dreampt like the child)  
I'd burn, so sweet  
(I dreampt of the fire)  
(Of the time it was wild)  
I'd run, so sweet  
(I dreampt of the wind)  
(I dreampt like the child)  
I'd burn  
(I dreampt of the fire)  
And so you disappeared
