Intro  
  
Every morning when I wake up  
I know someone's thinkin' of me  
By the moment I turn the radio on  
I know that I'll be singin' it too  
  
Refrain  
'Cause every time I remember our moments together  
It will make me smile  
How wonderful it is to belong  
To someone who cares like you in my life  
Ooh ooh  
  
Every time I see a little kid  
Playin' on the street  
I would think of you holding me  
Oh, how I long for your embrace  
  
Refrain  
And every time I remember our moments together  
It will make me smile  
How wonderful it is to belong  
To someone who cares like you  
  
[Repeat refrain]  
  
Chorus  
In my life, in my life  
There's only you in my life  
Dreams do come true in my life  
Nobody brings me happiness like you do  
In my life  
(In my life, hoo hooh)  
  
Every second of each passing time  
I could feel you heart next to mine  
And at the moment the wind blows at my face  
I close my eyes and feel you kiss  
  
Refrain  
'Cause every time I remember our moments together  
It will make me smile  
How wonderful it is to belong  
To someone who cares like you  
  
Chorus  
In my life, in my life  
There's only you in my life  
Dreams do come true in my life  
Nobody brings me happiness like you do  
  
In my life, in my life  
There's only you in my life  
Dreams do come true in my life  
Nobody brings me happiness like you do  
In my life  
  
Ad lib  
(In my life)  
  
Refrain  
Every time I remember our moments together  
It will make me smile  
How wonderful it is to belong  
To someone who cares like you  
  
Chorus  
In my life, in my life  
There's only you in my life  
Dreams do come true in my life  
Nobody brings me happiness like you do  
  
In my life, in my life  
There's only you in my life  
Dreams do come true in my life  
Nobody brings me happiness like you do  
In my life  
  
Coda  
In my life
