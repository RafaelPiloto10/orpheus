Baby you know me well  
You know I mean what I say  
Before I say farewell  
I'll give you just another day  
  
You'd better find out what's happening  
Find out what's happening before long, Oh yeah  
If you don't find out what's happening  
You're gonna find out that I've gone now, Oh yeah  
  
Tell me what you're gonna do  
You'd better make up your mind  
It all depends on you  
I'm leaving you behind  
  
You'd better find out what's happening  
Find out what's happening before long, Oh yeah  
If you don't find out what's happening  
You're gonna find out that I've gone now, Oh yeah  
  
Baby you know it's true  
We've been through thick and thin  
But if you don't come through  
You won't ever see me again  
  
You'd better find out what's happening  
Find out what's happening before long, Oh yeah  
If you don't find out what's happening  
You're gonna find out that I've gone now, Oh yeah  
You'd better find, find, better find out  
  
Better find out  
Better find, better find out  
Better find, better find out  
If you don't find, you're gonna find out that I'm gone
