If I changed my mind  
If I changed my faith  
Every time a stop light signaled  
Each time I made mistakes  
I don't think that I would be where I am today  
I live my life without regrets  
What you see is, what you see is  
What you see is what you get and I'm  
Unashamed of the life I lead  
Unashamed of the strength on my knees  
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved  
Of things I've done, my belief in the one  
Unashamed of the words of my friends  
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends  
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart  
Unashamed, unashamed  
Adding up my life, it totals all my dreams  
I'm counting all my blessings and the gifts I have received  
Still there's always someone, something to overcome  
Took all my life to understand that I am what I am, who I am  
Unashamed  
Unashamed of the life I lead  
Unashamed of the strength on my knees  
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved  
Of things I've done, my belief in the one  
Unashamed of the words of my friends  
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends  
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart  
Unashamed  
Do you wanna know how it goes?  
Do you wanna control how I feel?  
Do you wanna stay in my life?  
Then listen here and listen good  
You got to get it, got to get it, got to get it right  
Unashamed  
Unashamed of the life I lead  
Unashamed of the strength on my knees  
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved  
Of things I've done, my belief in the one  
Unashamed of the words of my friends  
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends  
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart  
Unashamed  
Unashamed of the life I lead  
Unashamed of the strength on my knees  
The choices I've made, of the love that I've saved  
Of things I've done, my belief in the one  
Unashamed of the words of my friends  
I know who they are make mistakes, make amends  
Follow my instincts, my star, on my sleeve I wear my heart  
Unashamed
