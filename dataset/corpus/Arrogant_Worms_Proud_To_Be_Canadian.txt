Our fair country Canada  
Is north of the USA  
Our maritimes are lovely  
And our prairies give us hay  
You might think you Yankees are better than us Canucks  
But we don't need no microchips inside our hockey pucks  
  
We know that you've got Disney World  
And you keep it very clean  
We don't have Bob Dole  
But we can drink when we're 19  
We even watch your TV shows for hours and hours and hours  
We'll give you Alan Thicke but Shania Twain is ours  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
Your beer is not too tasty  
And you weather can't be beat  
We all fly south in the winter time  
To escape the snow and sleet  
We're pleased to say we've enjoyed all your southern charms  
But we get sun burnt when we exercise our right to bear our arms  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
Alanis Morrissette  
She is our latest pride and joy  
She used to sing about high school dances  
And chancing after boys  
But now she is fed up and about as angry as can be  
She's got one hand in her pocket and the other is on guard for thee  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
Tears are not enough!
