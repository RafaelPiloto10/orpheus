We wake up different, rifle through our dreams another placid day, ripples at
the seams  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right?  
Or cause I don't want to fight?  
So tangle-minded then so becalmed it's all so Subway-grim and then it's gone  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right?  
Or cause I don't want to fight? we get so weary,  
Taking fish off hooks it's not as effortless as it may look  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right?  
Or cause I don't want to fight?  
We lay down seething, smell our pillows burn and drift off to the place where
you'd think we'd learn  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right?  
Or cause I don't want to fight? I said, "I give"
