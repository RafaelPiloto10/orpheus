In life's many battles that you will have to fight  
Just stay close to Jesus and journey in His light  
Then on that judgment morning when all pain has fled  
You'll stand in God's Kingdom when the Book Of Life is read  
When the seals are broken and names are read aloud  
You'll see many loved ones standin' in the crowd  
So brother, keep on prayin' and follow where you're lead  
You'll stand in God's Kingdom when the Book Of Life is read  
All your dreams of heaven will come true on that day  
When the sky shall open and this earth melt away  
Then all God's faithful children will raise up from the dead  
United in God's Kingdom when the Book Of Life is read  
What a happy feelin' to know He'll always care  
And when our work is over heaven with Him we'll share  
There's be no pain or sorrow, no tears will ever be shed  
When we stand there in God's Kingdom and the Book Of Life is read
