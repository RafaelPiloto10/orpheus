Well it was on this Monday morning  
And the day be calm and fine  
A harbor grace excursion  
With the boys who had the time  
And just before the sailor  
Took the gangway from the pier  
I saw some fellow haul me wife  
Aboard as a volunteer  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife cry  
Oh me, oh my, I think I'm gonna die!  
Oh me, oh my, I heard me old wife say,  
"I wish I'd never taken this excursion around the bay"  
  
We had fourteen hundred souls aboard, oh what a splendid sight!  
Left strong and regimental to make our spirits bright  
And meself being in the double, when a funny things they'd say  
They choke themselves from laughing when they'd see us in the bay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Me wife she got no better, she turned a sickly green  
I fed her cake and candy, fat pork and kerosene  
Castor Oil and sugar of candy, I rubbed pure oil on her face  
And I said she'll be a dandy when we reaches Harbor Grace!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My wife she got no better, my wife me darling dear  
The screeches from her trolley could hear in Carbonear  
I tried every place in Harbor Grace,  
Tried every store and shop,  
To get her something for a cure or take her to the hop  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She died below the brandy's as we were coming back  
We buried her in the ocean, wrapped up in a Union Jack  
So now I am a single man, in search of a pretty face  
And the woman that says she'll have me, I'm off for Harbor Grace!  
  
[Chorus]
