Oh, Louisiana, I stayed away from you too long  
Oh, Louisiana, how can a true love go so wrong ?  
She put me in shame and in sorrow and I come home tomorrow  
Oh, Louisiana  
Oh, Louisiana, yea, yea, Creole baby, Cajun queens  
Quaint porches and windows, filet de gumbo, the Basin beans  
Your beautiful Delta and bayous in greens  
Oh, Louisiana  
Oh, Louisiana, yea-e-e, yea, I'm flyin' on Delta Nine-o-three  
Right over St. Louis, high over Memphis, Tennessee  
On southward to the sea, where I long to be  
Oh, Louisiana  
Oh, o, Louisiana, yea, yea, them Yankee nights are cold and long  
Oh, Louisiana, she broke my heart and wrecked my home  
She shamed me in sorrow, to face my tomorrow  
Oh, take me back, oh, Louisiana
