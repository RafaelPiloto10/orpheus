If I had one call to make  
I would dial yesterday and warn myself  
Tell my lips the words to say  
Not let you just walk away  
With someone else  
With someone else  
  
[Chorus]  
Next time, I wont suffer this kind of pain  
Own my mistakes  
Not just pass off all the blame  
If you were here, we could figure this out  
Then I wouldn't be bitter  
I'd just be better now  
  
To be the strong and silent one  
A lot of good that has done  
Yes, you'd agree  
No more tryin' to understand  
Or fix these things because you can  
Guess it's up to me  
Yeah, it's up to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd be much better off  
Much better off, maybe  
If I could just let it go  
With no regrets then  
  
[Chorus]  
Next time, I won't suffer this kind of pain  
Own my mistakes  
Not just pass off all the blame  
You'd still be here,and we'd figure this out  
Then I wouldn't be better (I wouldn't be better)  
Oh, no I wouldn't be bitter  
I'd just be better now  
  
Oh
