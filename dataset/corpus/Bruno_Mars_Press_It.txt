It's been so long since you been gone,  
And now we're here  
The music's on,  
We're feeling freaky (oh)  
I want you in my bedroom,  
You want me closer to you  
What are we doing?  
Let's get to it  
  
I lay you down,  
Take off your clothes,  
Then kiss your lips  
It feels so good, ooh you're saying more  
I wanna be inside you  
Ooh girl you got that fire  
I can't wait no longer  
I just gotta take control  
  
The lights in the club are turning you on  
Now girl let's pretend we both are alone  
We'll finish this up when we get home  
The only thing I need from you girl  
  
Is to press your body,  
On my body  
Do it fast, do it slow,  
You control the tempo  
  
Look over your shoulder  
Bring it back now  
Let me feel your body  
Just (press it, press it)  
  
My favorite place is that space between your legs and your hips  
Ooh, got me licking my lips  
Wanna get up on it  
It's a special thing that we be doing  
Feelin' bit bad boy  
Girl I'm doing  
It ain't no secret 'bout what it is  
Come on girl serve me the dish  
  
The lights in the club are turning you on  
Now girl let's pretend we both are alone  
We'll finish this up when we get home  
The only thing I need from you girl  
  
Is to press your body,  
On my body  
Do it fast, do it slow,  
You control the tempo  
  
Look over your shoulder  
Bring it back now  
Let me feel your body  
  
Just  
Press your body,  
On my body  
Do it fast, do it slow,  
You control the tempo  
  
Look over your shoulder  
Bring it back now  
Let me feel your body  
Just press  
  
Girl you're the only thing that I see  
So don't you take your body from me  
And there's no other place I'd rather be  
  
Oh girl there's something about your body, body, body  
Ooh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty  
Right now we got our own little party, party, party  
  
So good,  
The way you press your body on me  
All I need from you  
  
Is to press your body,  
On my body  
Do it fast, do it slow,  
You control the tempo  
  
Look over your shoulder  
Bring it back now  
Let me feel your body  
Just  
Press your body,  
On my body  
Do it fast, do it slow,  
You control the tempo  
  
Look over your shoulder  
Girl there's something about your body, body, body  
Oh the way you shakin' is so naughty, naughty, naughty  
Right now we got our own little party, party, party  
So good,  
The way you press your body on me  
All I need from you  
Is to press it
