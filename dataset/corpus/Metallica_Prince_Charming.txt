There's a black cloud overhead  
That's me  
And the poison ivy chokes the tree  
Again it's me  
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street  
You walk on by  
I'm the little boy that pushes hard  
And makes it cry  
There's a dirty needle in your child  
Haha stick me  
Empty bottles still in hand still dead  
Still me  
I'm the suit and tie that breaks the street  
And still wants more  
I'm the 45 that's in your mouth  
I'm a dirty, dirty whore  
Yeah  
Look it's me  
The one who can't be free  
Much too young to focus  
But too old to see  
Hey  
Look it's me  
When no one wants to see  
See what you brought this world  
Just what you want to see  
Hey ma  
Hey ma, look it's me  
Yeah  
He wants to become father now  
Me again, me  
The marks inside your arms still leaves me alone to me  
I'm the nothing face that plants a bomb  
And strolls away  
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right  
As children play  
Yeah  
Look it's me  
The one who can't be free  
Much too young to focus  
But too old to see  
Hey  
Look it's me  
When no one wants to see  
See what you brought this world  
Just what you want to see  
Hey ma  
Hey ma, look it's me  
It's me  
Look up to me  
What you've been and what you've feared  
Look up to me  
Look it's me, what you hear  
See right through me  
See the one who can't be free  
See right through me  
Look it's me when no one wants to see  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hm, now see the black cloud overhead  
That's me  
Hm, in this poison ivy chokes the tree  
Again it's me  
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street  
You walk on by  
And I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes  
Makes it cry  
Yeah  
Look it's me  
The one who can't be free  
Much too young to focus  
But too old to see  
Hey, hey  
Look it's me  
When no one wants to see  
See what you brought this world  
Just what you want to see  
Hey ma  
Hey ma, look it's me  
Yeah  
It's me  
Hey ma  
Hey ma, look it's me  
See right though me  
Look up to me  
See right though me  
Look up to me
