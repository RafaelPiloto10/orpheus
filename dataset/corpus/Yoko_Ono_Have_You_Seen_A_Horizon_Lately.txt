Have you seen a horizon lately,  
If you have, watch it for a while.  
For you never know,  
It may not last so long.  
  
Have you seen an evening light lately?  
If you have, watch it for a while.  
For you never know,  
It may not be the same.  
  
Have you seen a snowflake lately?  
If you have, hold it in your hand.  
For you never know,  
It may melt away.  
  
Have you been in love lately?  
If you have, hold it in your heart.  
For you never know,  
It may be the last.
