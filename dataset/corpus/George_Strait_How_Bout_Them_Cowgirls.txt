I felt the rush of the Rio Grande into Yellowstone  
I've seen first-hand Niagara Falls  
And the lights of Vegas  
I've Criss-crossed down to Key Biscayne  
And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine  
Think I've seen it all  
And all I can say is  
  
[Chorus]  
How 'bout them cowgirls  
Boys ain't they something  
Sure are some proud girls  
And you can't tell them nothing  
And I tell you right now girls  
May just be seven wonders of this big, whole round world  
But how 'bout them cowgirls  
  
She's riding colts in Steamboat Springs  
Bailing hay outside Abilene  
She's trying hard  
To fit in some city  
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky  
And the Northern Plains and those other wide open spaces  
Now a-days there ain't as many but  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me  
She can do just fine on her own two feet  
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself  
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide  
Her stubborn will or her fighting side  
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else  
  
Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls  
Boys ain't they something  
Sure are some proud girls  
But you can't beat their loving  
  
And I'll tell you right now girls  
May just be seven wonders of this big, old round world  
But how 'bout them cowgirls  
How 'bout 'em boys
