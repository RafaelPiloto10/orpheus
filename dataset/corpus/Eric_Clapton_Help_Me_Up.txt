Are you going to help me or will you let me down?  
I'm looking for a true love but am I lost or found?  
And will we cry in passion or will we cry in pain?  
And will our lonely teardrops fill the world with rain?  
  
Help me up, don't you let me down  
I'm gonna wake up in heaven, not the cold, cold ground  
  
Can't you hear the lovers crying in the night?  
They spend their whole lives trying, still can't get it right  
I don't know where we're going but I guess we'll start  
And just to show that I mean it, baby here's my heart  
  
Help me up, don't you let me down  
I'm gonna wake up in heaven, not the cold, cold ground  
  
Living on my feelings, feelings all I know  
Baby once we touch it, we'll never let it go  
  
Are you going to help me or will you let me down?  
I'm looking for a true love but am I lost or found?  
And will we cry in passion or will we cry in pain?  
And will our lonely teardrops fill the world with rain?  
  
Help me up, don't you let me down  
I'm gonna wake up in heaven, not the cold, cold ground  
Help me up, don't you let me down  
I'm gonna wake up in heaven, not the cold, cold ground
