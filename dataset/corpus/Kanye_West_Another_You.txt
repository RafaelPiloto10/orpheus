It don't really matter what you do  
It don't matter baby  
Baby I don't want to be in your shoes  
It don't really matter what you do  
Still, never feel doubt about you  
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove  
Still never feel doubt about you  
  
A b c d e f  
We picking up right where we left out  
And I took a reassess  
When I get back you going to take that off  
In the mural I hate me, state me  
I make money  
Money don't make me  
Hey honey what do you take me for  
Don't look at me like I'm crazy  
Don't ever think daddy faze me  
You ain't fit to do that  
You ain't crazy  
You ain't built like that  
Hey baby what it feel like  
Just forget I said it, screw it  
It don't really matter what you do when you do it  
  
It don't really matter what you do  
It don't matter baby  
Baby I don't want to be in your shoes  
It don't really matter what you do  
Still, never feel doubt about you  
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove  
Still never feel doubt about you
