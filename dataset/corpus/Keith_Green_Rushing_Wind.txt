Rushing wind blow through this temple,  
Blowing out the dust within,  
Come and breathe you breath upon me,  
I've been born again.  
  
Holy spirit, I surrender, take me where you want to go,  
Plant me by your living water,  
Plant me deep so I can grow.  
  
Jesus, you're the one, who sets my spirit free,  
Use me lord, glorify, your holy name through me.  
Separate me from this world lord.  
Sanctify my life for you.  
Daily change me to your image,  
Help me bear good fruit.  
Every day you're drawing closer.  
  
Trials come to test my faith.  
But when all is said and done lord,  
You know, it was worth the wait.  
Jesus, you're the one, who set my spirit free,  
Use me lord, glorify, your holy name through me.  
  
Rushing wind blow through this temple,  
Blowing out the dust within,  
Come and breathe you breath upon me,  
For I've been born again.
