Now I know, you've been cheatin' and lyin' all the time  
I didn't know you were gonna be so unkind  
I've been trying just to find out how we went wrong  
But I know that I can't trust you girl anymore  
  
Rip it out, take my heart, you wanted it from the start  
You got it now, so goodbye, so rip it out, watch me cry  
  
It's so sad, I'm not glad to be with you today  
And it's bad, 'cause I can't stop the pain day by day  
If I knew how to stop you, I don't think I'd try  
I think it's better if we just part and don't say goodbye  
  
Rip it out, take my heart, you wanted it from the start  
You got it now, so goodbye, so rip it out, watch me cry  
  
I hope you suffer!  
  
Rip it out, take my heart, you wanted it from the start  
You got it now, so goodbye, so rip it out, watch me cry  
  
Rip it out, take my heart, you wanted it from the start  
You got it now, so goodbye, so rip it out, watch me cry  
  
Rip it out (repeats out)
