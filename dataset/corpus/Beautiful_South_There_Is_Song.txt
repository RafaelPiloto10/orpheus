There's a bench in every park dedicated to  
Those who sat there once but didn't make it through  
There are names carved deep in bark on every tree  
By those who spent their time like you and me  
And wherever geography may place you now  
There's a piece of history all folk carry around  
Whatever your situation, whatever it may allow  
There's an even larger piece in every lost and found  
There is song, there's always a song  
Wherever there's perfection there's a wrong  
There's always song but a broken bond  
And an unkissed frog in every village pond  
There's a name that we graffiti'd up on a wall  
To the folks who live there now, makes no sense at all  
And in every underpass, on every street  
A promise someone made but couldn't keep  
A tiny piece of chalk in every coat  
In every film the smallest lump in throat  
In every song you've sung in every novel read  
That unkissed love will rear, rear its head  
There is song, there's always song  
Wherever there's a right there's always wrong  
There's always a song but a broken bond  
And an unkissed frog in every village pond
