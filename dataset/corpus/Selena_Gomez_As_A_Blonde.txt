I was looking in the mirror,  
Trying to find, a new reflection.  
Wanna take the road, less traveled in,  
A different direction.  
Make some new mistakes,  
Forget the ones I made.  
Cry some tears of joy,  
And dress more like a boy.  
  
[Chorus]  
And come back as a blonde,  
Try a different lipstick on, as a blonde,  
Will I get whatever I want?  
I'd be ever so incising,  
Eat a lot of icing,  
Never have to watch my weight.  
Yeah when I'm gone,  
I'm gonna come back as a blonde.  
  
I wanna I meet myself, as someone else,  
Just to see what it feels like.  
Take a walk, on the other side,  
Cause you know that I just might.  
Break some different hearts, finish what I start.  
I'm not gonna wait, to mess around with fate.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm tainted, I'm tired, of being the same, yeah.  
I'm desperate, I'm bored, I'm begging for change.  
What if you're normal and wanna be strange?  
Come back, come back, come back.  
I wanna Come back, come back, come back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As a blonde, try a different lipstick on, as a blonde,  
Will I get whatever I want?  
I'd be ever so incising, cake a lot of icing,  
Never have to watch my weight.  
Oh, when I'm gone,  
I'm gonna come back as a blonde  
Wave my magic wand, as a blonde,  
Will I get whatever I want?  
I'd be ever so incising, cake a lot of icing,  
Never need to wash my face.  
Yeah when I'm gone, I'm gonna  
Come back, come back, come back.  
(I'm gonna come back)  
Come back, come back, come back.  
(I'm gonna come back)  
Come back, come back, come back.  
As a blonde.
