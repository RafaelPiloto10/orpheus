It's the way she fills my senses  
It's the perfume that she wears  
I feel I'm losing my defenses  
To the color of your hair  
  
And every little piece of her is right  
Just thinking about her takes me through the night  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time we meet the picture is complete  
Every time we touch the feeling is too much  
She's all I ever need to fall in love again  
I knew it from the very start  
She's the puzzle of my heart  
  
It's the way she's always smiling  
That makes people think she never cries  
Feel like I'm losing my defenses  
To the color of her eyes  
  
And every little piece of her is right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a miracle should meant to be  
She became the light inside of me  
Like a feeling like a memory from long ago  
  
[Chorus]
