Spent the morning - unaware  
Spent the daytime - didn't care  
Spent the evening - drawing breath  
Spent the nightime - fearing death  
One more down some more to go  
Then I'll know or I won't know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything  
Saw a picture I didn't know  
Of a football game played 50 years ago  
You see the jersey's being worn so proud  
But look behind them, look up at the crowd  
A sea of heads pointing right up to the sky  
Some of them are still with us and some of them have died  
I think the one's who've left are still with us aswell  
Cause I can hear them when the voices start to swell  
One more down some more to go  
Then I'll know or I won't know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything  
Well I hear you, I don't see you  
Yes I hear you but I don't see you  
But it won't be long till I'm gone  
And then I'll know if my ears or eyes are wrong  
Spent the morning - unaware  
Spend the daytime - didn't care  
Spent the evening - drawing breath  
Spent the nightime - fearing death  
One more down some more to go  
Then I'll know or I won't know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything  
One more down some more to go  
Then I'll know or I won't know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything
