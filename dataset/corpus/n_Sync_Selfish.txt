I just don't understand  
Why you running from a good man baby  
Why you want to turn your back on love, why you've already given up  
See I know you been hurt before but I swear I'll give you so much more  
I swear I'll never let you down, 'cause I swear its you that I adore and  
I can't help myself babe, 'cause I think about you constantly and my heart
gets no  
Rest over  
You  
  
[Chorus]  
You can call me selfish but all I want is your love  
You can call me hopeless baby 'cause I'm hopelessly in love  
You can call me imperfect, but whose perfect tell me what do I gotta do to  
Prove  
That I'm the only one for you, so what's wrong with being selfish, yea yea yea  
  
I'll be taking up ya time till the day I make you realize (realize) that for
you  
Their could be no one else I just gotta have you for myself, baby I would take
good care of  
You no  
Matter what it is you're going through, I'll be there for you when you're in  
Need,  
Baby believe in me, 'cause if love is a crime, punish me 'cause I don't want
to live without  
You, what  
Can I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why do you keep us apart, why won't you give up your heart, you know that
we're  
Meant  
To be together, why do you push me away, all that I want is to give you love,  
Forever  
And ever and ever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Selfishly I'm in love with you 'cause I've searched my soul and I know that
its you  
  
To prove that I'm the only one for you, so what's wrong with being selfish,  
Selfish, selfish  
So what's wrong with being selfish, yeah
