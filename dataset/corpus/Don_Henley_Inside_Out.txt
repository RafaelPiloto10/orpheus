The biggest lie you ever told  
Your deepest fear about growin' old  
The loneliest night you ever spent  
The angriest letter you never sent  
  
The girl you swore you'd never leave  
The one you kissed on new year's eve  
The sweetest dream you had last night  
Your darkest hour, your hardest fight  
  
I wanna know you like I know myself  
I'm waiting for you, there ain't no one else  
I wanna know you inside out  
  
I wanna dig down deep, I wanna lose some sleep  
I wanna scream and shout, I wanna know you inside out  
I wanna take my time, I wanna know you're mine  
You know there ain't no doubt, I wanna know you inside out  
  
The saddest song you ever heard  
The most you said with just one word  
The loneliest prayer you every prayed  
The truest vow you ever made  
  
What makes you laugh? What makes you cry?  
What makes you mad? What gets you by?  
Your highest high, your lowest low  
These are the things I wanna know  
  
I wanna dig down deep, I wanna lose some sleep  
I wanna scream and shout, I wanna know you inside out  
I wanna take my time, I wanna know you're mine  
You know there ain't no doubt, I wanna know you inside out  
  
I wanna know your soul, I wanna lose control  
Come on and let it out, I wanna know you inside out  
  
I wanna dig down deep, I wanna lose some sleep  
I wanna scream and shout, I wanna know you inside out  
I wanna take my time, I wanna know you're mine  
You know there ain't no doubt, I wanna know you inside out  
  
The biggest lie you ever told  
Your deepest fear about growin' old  
The loneliest night you ever spent  
  
What makes you laugh? What makes you cry?  
What makes you mad? What gets you by?
