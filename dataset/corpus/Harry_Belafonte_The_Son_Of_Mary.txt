Auntie Mary, open up the door  
Auntie Mary, open up the door  
Auntie Mary, open up the door  
What I did last night I ain't gonna do no more  
Auntie Mary, open up the door

Auntie Mary, open up the door  
What I did last night I ain't gonna do no more  
  
Falumi:  
Charlie cannot take a drink  
When he get out never stop to think  
He would drink and drink more and more  
When he get home I won't open up the door  
I will not open up the door  
I will not open up the door  
I will not open up the door  
What he did last night I won't let him do no more  
  
Harry:  
Well Mary, you buggin' me  
I tell you I must be free  
Woman I've got to have some fun  
I work all day at night I drink my rum  
  
So Mary open up the door  
Woman open up the door  
I tell you open up the door  
What I did last night I ain't gonna do no more  
  
Auntie Mary open up the door  
Oh Mary open up the door  
Auntie Mary open up the door  
What he did last night he will not do no more  
  
Auntie Mary open up the door  
Oh Mary open up the door  
Auntie Mary open up the door  
What he did last night he will not do no more  
  
Falumi:  
Now Charlie listen to me  
You can't be free and still have me  
I'm tired of gettin' in a fight  
If you get drunk you will sleep outside tonight  
'Cause I will not open up the door  
No I will not open up the door  
What you did last night I won't let you do no more  
  
Harry:  
Well I guess I got no more home  
I'm going out on my own  
I'm go get myself a fishing boat and oar  
And you can try sleeping with the door  
  
Auntie Mary open up the door  
Oh Mary open up the door  
Auntie Mary open up the door  
What he did last night he will not do no more  
  
Harry: Auntie Mary, open up the door  
Falumi: Would be an improvement  
Harry: Woman, I said open up the door  
Falumi: Would be an improvement  
Harry: I ain't gonna do no more
