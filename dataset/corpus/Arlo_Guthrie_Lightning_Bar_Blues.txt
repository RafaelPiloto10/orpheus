[Chorus]  
I don't need no diamond ring  
I don't need no Cadillac car  
Just want to drink my Ripple wine  
Down in the Lightnin' Bar  
Down in the Lightnin' Bar  
  
Some people value fortune and fame  
I don't care about 'em none  
Just want to drink my Ripple wine  
I want to have my good time fun  
Have my good time fun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I die don't cry for me  
Don't bury me at all  
Place my livin', laughin', lovin' bones  
In a jar of alcohol  
Hundred proof alcohol  
  
[Chorus]
