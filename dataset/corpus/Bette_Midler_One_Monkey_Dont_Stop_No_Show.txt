My baby jumped up this morning  
'N sat on the side of the bed  
He said, "I'm leaving you, baby"  
And this is just what I said  
I said, "I can't make you stay if you want to go  
But it's high time, baby, that you should know  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
So, if you still want to go, go ahead"  
And I mean every word I said  
  
My baby thought I was jivin'  
And he went right out the door  
He left me about three in the morning  
I got me a man at four  
Some women cry when their men bleed 'em  
Dry, long and slow  
But I found out somethin' a long time ago  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
So if he gets too big for his pants  
You better spring that new one and give him a chance  
  
I used to be chicken hearted  
Cry when he'd walk out the door  
'Cause I was just young and stupid  
Ha! Ain't like that no more  
'Cause I had a hard way to go  
But I learned the score  
And I'm here to tell you  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
Let him do anything he choose  
There's a million men who can fill his shoes  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
You can tell him I told you so  
  
"All right"
