Power To Love  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Their leader was gone now  
Their number was few  
Left in the world full of hate  
They gathered together  
And started to pray  
All they could do now was wait  
That's when the power  
Came into the room  
Praise started filling the air  
Suddenly they were no longer afraid  
They felt His love everywhere  
Chorus:  
It's the power to love  
The power to reach out  
To someone in need  
It's the power to love  
The power to conquer  
This world full of greed  
There is no equal on earth  
Below or above  
We have the power to love  
It spread through the city  
And out in the street  
A multitude gathered around  
The power of heaven  
Was filling the earth  
It turned the whole world upside down  
People were singing  
And praising the Lord  
Laughter was filling the air  
Filled with His glorious  
Power and strength  
They took His word everywhere  
Chorus  
We will never lose  
We will conquer through love  
Chorus
