Jumping off the rooftops  
Making all the clouds pop  
Come one and all  
It's time for a shake up  
  
Faking is the new wheel  
Liars make a new deal  
Watch it unravel  
How dumb do you feel?  
  
I don't really care about society  
I don't really care go on and lie to me  
I don't really care if we don't agree  
I don't really care what you think about me  
  
Mic check 1, 2  
Firewall break it through  
Molotov's are falling (Pump up the volume)  
A minor threat like you  
Paperweight torn in two  
Kill switch stalling (Pump up the volume)  
  
I don't give a fuck about your revolution  
I don't give a fuck about your institution  
I don't give a fuck and I ain't gonna listen  
I don't give a fuck about your expectation  
I don't give a fuck about your motivation  
I don't give a fuck and I ain't gonna listen  
  
Crashing in a new car  
Burning like an old star  
Rise for the fall of it all  
It's a new war  
  
Money makes a mean shield  
Bleed as your skin peels  
Knees cut in gravel  
How numb do you feel?  
  
I don't really care about your anarchy  
I don't really care if you're judging me  
I don't really care about your jealousy  
I don't give a fuck what you think about me  
  
I really really care about what you're thinking  
All of your thoughts all the money you're making  
I really really care about what you're drinking  
How did you get so cool?  
I really really care to hear about your day  
Of all the cool people that you met today  
Really really care what you have to say  
Nah, I'm just kidding  
Fuck off!  
  
Mic check 1, 2  
Pump up the volume!
