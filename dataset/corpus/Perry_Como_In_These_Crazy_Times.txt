( in these crazy times,  
How very sweet to know,  
Our love is like the love of long ago . . .  
In these crazy times,  
When life is wild and strange,  
Our feelings for each other never change . . . )  
Old things make way for new things,  
Yet we still cling to the true things,  
We will always be ruled by the heart!  
In these crazy times,  
When rockets fly in space,  
When quick success is all they're dreaming of,  
How blessed we are with our love!
