She goes away for a couple of days  
So you phone a few number you fancy a change  
You say you'll miss her but deep down inside  
There are thoughts of another girl waiting somewhere for you  
  
She's been away for a couple of days  
The affairs weren't so good so you're mending your ways  
You realize that there's nobody else who can do what she does for you  
You tell yourself don't be a fool  
Don't let her go chase as hard as you can  
Or you'll be the loser  
Swallow your pride you can still be a man  
She'll never refuse you  
  
She deserved to be loved, she wants to love you  
If you went away you know she'd be true, yes you do.  
  
Baby i was lonely, still love you only, but i was a bad boy  
Know you couldn't see me, thought you'd never leave me, so i was bad boy  
Even though i'm trying, there is no denying i am just a bad boy  
Met a little baby, thought she was a lady, still i was a bad boy  
  
She gives me everything a girl's supposed to do  
She gives me everything still i can't be true  
She gives me everything, she gives me everything  
  
Going off to different places  
All i see is different faces  
I love them all but not like you  
  
She deserves to be loved, she wants to love you  
If you went away you know she'd be true, yes you do.  
  
She deserves to be loved - yes she does, you know she does  
She deserves to be loved - even if she goes away  
She deserves to be loved - no one else can take her place  
She deserves to be loved - you'll be the loser if you let her go  
She deserves to be loved - she gives you everything a girl's supposed to do  
She deserves to be loved - you love them all but she's the one for you  
She deserves to be loved - yes she does, you know she does  
She deserves to be loved - even if she goes away  
She deserves to be loved - no one else can take her place
