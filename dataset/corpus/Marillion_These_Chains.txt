Everything crashed  
His wife left him  
He lost all his money  
And most of his friends  
He lay awake all night  
Lonely and desperate  
Contemplating starting again  
  
These chains are all your own  
These chains are comfortable  
  
Four in the morning  
Sat in the kitchen  
Keys on the table  
Went out for a drive  
He didn't know  
Where he was going  
Didn't know  
If he was alive  
  
The dawn was breaking  
A new day was rising  
Shadows creepin' over the fields  
He watched the pink light  
Steal across the horizon  
He realized  
He saw with new eyes  
  
These chains are all your own  
These chains are comfortable  
This cage was never locked  
Born free but scared to be  
This cage was made for you  
With care and constant attention  
This cage is safe and warm  
Will you die and never know what it's like  
Outside
