[Chorus]  
When you grow up in my hood  
Help don't show up in my hood  
Gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood  
Feel like I'm trapped in my hood  
Young kids get clapped in my hood  
That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood  
In..my..hood, in my hood, in my hood  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
I'm always close to..  
Feeling like a corner stander, stoop sitter, or hallway post-er  
No matter where I go it's always 'posed to, feel just like I'm (in my hood)  
Cops drive in it every 5 minutes, look at your faces, pat your waists'  
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist  
But I know.. it ain't the same in they town  
And as fucked up as it may sound (in my hood)  
It's 2 ways to make it happen off the streets  
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats  
You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete, when they clappin' off the heat  
Then the yellow tape's trappin off the street  
But that's the way we was raised  
Preying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays  
  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
They drink 'til the cups dry, eat 'til the plate's clean  
Niggaz be in state greens 'fore they turn 18  
'Round here you never let the beef slide twice  
Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice  
Them mothers are getting younger today  
Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way  
We don't have role models  
But we got them handguns that hold hollows (in my hood)  
Ain't no diplomas or degrees  
But you can get high from the aroma of the trees (in my hood)  
I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience  
I'ma get mine, you better get yours, 'cause everyday is a struggle  
And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you  
That's how it is, 'cause your rights be wrong  
And everybody got a white T on, when you're in..my..hood  
  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3: Fab]  
We try to make the most of what we got  
You either been hit, or been close to gettin shot (in my hood)  
Any nigga that boast be getting got  
And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got  
And young niggaz be like they slow  
But you give them a blunt..bet they roll the weed like a pro  
If you trick it's not a problem it gets you laid  
But if you stick without a condom, it gets you AIDS  
No Sesame Street, kids watch BET  
Look up to niggaz that don't got a GED  
I know a dude with the deadbeat tag  
Kids don't got diapers but he ridin' in the red G-Wag'  
In the hood, you and your beef is sure to bump heads  
And everybody grew up sleepin on bunk beds  
They telling me to vote..and I would  
If it made a change in my hood..mu'fucka.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Fab talks 'til the end]
