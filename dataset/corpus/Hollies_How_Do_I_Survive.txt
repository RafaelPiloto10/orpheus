How do I survive if you break my heart?  
I'm not strong enough  
Just to smile and make things easy  
I can't put on my brave face anymore  
I always took it for granted  
That I could take whatever you gave me  
I guess, you never really know for sure  
'Cause there was never a doubt in mind  
How it was meant to be  
So who do I turn to darlin' if you should leave  
How do I survive if you break my heart?

I've got no excuses  
For bein' your fool  
I never thought that it would be forever  
But after so much time together  
I've come to depend on you  
What else am I supposed to do?  
'Cause there was never a doubt in mind  
It wouldn't be easy  
But I never realized how much you mean to me, ho
