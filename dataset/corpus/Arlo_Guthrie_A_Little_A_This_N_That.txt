Words and music by Pete Seeger  
  
My grandma she can make a soup  
With a little a this n that  
She can feed the whole sloop group  
With a little a this n that  
Stone soup! You know the story  
Stone soup! Who needs the glory?  
But with grandma cookin no need to worry!  
Just a little a this n that  
  
Grandma likes to make a garden grow  
With a little a this n that  
But she likes to have the ground just so  
With a little a this n that  
Not too loose and not too firm  
In the spring it s all got to be turned  
In the fall lots of compost to feed the worms  
With a little a this n that  
  
Grandma knows we can build a future  
With a little a this n that  
And a few arguments never never hurt ya  
With a little a this n that  
True this world's in a hell of a fix  
And some say oil and water don't mix  
But they don't know a saladmaker's tricks  
With a little a this n that  
  
The world to come may be like a song  
With a little a this n that  
To make everybody want to sing along  
With a little a this n that  
A little dissonance ain't no sin  
A little skylarking to give us all a grin  
Who knows  
But God's got a plan for the people to win  
With a little a this n that
