Everybody knows that they're guilty  
Everybody knows that they've lied  
Everybody knows that they're guilty  
Resting on their conscience eating their inside  
It's freedom, I said it's freedom time now  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now  
Time to get free, or give your selves up now  
It's freedom, said it's free time yo  
There's a war in the mind over territory, for the dominium  
Who will dominate the opinions?  
Schisms and isms, keeping us in forms of religion  
Conforming our vision to the world church of decision  
Trapped in a section, submitted to committing election  
Moral affection, epidemic lies and deception  
Insurrection, of the highest possible order  
Distorting our tape recorders from hearin' it like underwater  
Beyond the borders, find the sin in disorder  
Bound by the strategy of a systemic depravity  
Heavy as gravity, head first in the cavity without a bottom  
A fate, worst then Sodom,  
What's gotem drunk of the spirit?  
Truth comes we can't hear it when you've been programmed to fear it  
I had a vision I was falling in indecision  
Appalling, calling religious a program on television  
How can... Dominate wisdom  
Be recognized in the system  
Of antichrists'? The majority rules  
Intelligent fools  
P. H. D. 's in illusion, masters of mass confusion  
Bachelors of past illusion  
Now who you choosing?  
The head or the tail?  
The bloodshed of the male or confidence in the veil?  
Conferences at Yale discussing doctrines of Baal  
Causing peoples to fail keeping a third in jail  
His words nailed everything to the tree  
Severing all of me from all that I use to be  
Formless and void, totally paranoid  
Enjoyed darkness's, Lord keeping me from the sword
