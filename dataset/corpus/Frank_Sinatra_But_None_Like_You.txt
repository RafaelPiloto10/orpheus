The world is full of people, but none like you,  
They're ordinary people, but none like you.  
How far away is yesterday before you came along.  
It seemed to be just a dream to me, until you proved here on.  
The lanes are full of lovers, but none like you,  
  
Just ordinary lovers, not dreams like you,  
I shut my eyes to realize this grand surprise is true,  
That I'm the lucky one who found you.  
I shut my eyes to realize this grand surprise is true,  
That I'm the lucky one who found you.
