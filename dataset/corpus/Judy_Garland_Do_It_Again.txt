You really shouldn't have done it,  
You hadn't any right.  
I really shouldn't have let you kiss me.  
And although it was wrong,  
  
I never was strong.  
So as long as you've begun it,  
And you know you shouldn't have done it,  
Oh, do it again.  
  
I may cry no, no, no, no, no, but do it again.  
My lips just ache to have you take  
The kiss that's waiting for you.  
You know if you do you won't regret it.  
  
Come and get it.  
Oh, no one is near,  
I may cry oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, but no one can hear.  
Mama may scold me 'cause she told me  
  
It was naughty but then, please, do it again.  
Yes do it again, and again and again and again and again.  
Turn out the light.  
And hold me close in your arms  
  
All through the night.  
I know tomorrow morning  
You will say goodbye and amen.  
But until then, please do it again.
