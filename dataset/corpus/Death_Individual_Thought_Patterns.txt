So quick to judge, so easily we forget,  
What it's like to be dissected  
Where feelings are tossed aside  
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds that go unparalyzed  
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption  
That live their lives only to criticize  
Where is the invisible line that we must draw to create individual thought  
Patterns  
  
Prisoners of mental deception be free within singular judgment  
Twisting words to control the masses  
To cover up one's self insecurities  
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds that go unparalyzed  
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption  
That live their lives only to criticize  
Where is the invisible line that we must draw to create individual thought
