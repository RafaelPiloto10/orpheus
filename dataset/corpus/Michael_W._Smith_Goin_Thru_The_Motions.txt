Actions have been justified  
All is compromised  
Looking for approval there  
In someone else's eyes, oh  
Dodging all you really are  
Becomes your greatest task  
Acting out your lonely part  
You hide behind your mask  
  
[Bridge]  
Never true to yourself  
Knowing well this is not like you  
Fooling yourself  
You're just living a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
Goin' goin'  
Goin' through the motions  
Goin' goin'  
Goin' through the motions  
Goin' goin'  
Goin' through the motions  
Goin' goin'  
Goin' through the motions  
  
Victim of the circumstance  
Prisoner of the shame  
But it's the double standard life  
That keeps you in the game  
Taken by your own disguise  
But when it's wearing thin  
You'll do anything it takes  
To impress your friends  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]
