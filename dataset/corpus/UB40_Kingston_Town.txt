The night seems to fade,  
But the moonlight lingers on  
There are wonders for everyone  
The stars shine so bright,  
But they're fading after dawn  
There is magic in Kingston Town  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh Kingston Town,  
The place I long to be  
If I had the whole world  
I would give it away  
Just to see, the girls at play  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
And when I am king,  
Surely I would need a queen  
And a palace and everything, yeah  
And now I am king,  
And my queen will come at dawn  
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when I am king,  
Surely I would need a queen  
And a palace and everything, yeah  
And now I am king,  
And my queen will come at dawn  
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town
