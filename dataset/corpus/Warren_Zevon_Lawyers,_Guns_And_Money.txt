I went home with a waitress the way I always do  
How was I to know she was with the Russians, too?  
  
I was gambling in Havana - I took a little risk  
Send lawyers, guns, and money  
Dad, get me out of this  
  
An innocent bystander  
Somehow I got stuck between a rock and a hard place  
And I'm down on my luck  
Yes, I'm down on my luck  
Well, I'm down on my luck  
  
I'm hiding in Honduras - I'm a desperate man  
Send lawyers, guns, and money  
The shit has hit the fan  
  
Send lawyers, guns, and money...
