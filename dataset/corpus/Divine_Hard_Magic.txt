Tried to get away from you  
When you said that I was wrong  
I tried to get away from you  
But your hold is much too strong  
  
You've got a magic spell on me  
And there's nothing I can do  
You've got a magic spell on me  
And I can't get away, get away from the....  
  
Chorus  
Hard, hard magic, hard magic you do  
Hard, hard magic, hard magic with you  
Shake, shake I could break everytime  
Think, think give or take, losing my mind  
With all the hard, hard magic, hard magic you do.  
  
I tried to break away from you  
But I didn't wanna fight  
I tried to break away from you  
But your grip is much too tight  
  
You've got a magic spell on me  
And I'm stuck to you like glue  
You put a magic spell on me  
So I can't get away, get away, from the...  
  
(chorus)  
  
I've tried everything I know  
I don't think I like your hard magic  
I've struck every single blow  
But the spell is much to hard for me  
  
Oh my, I'm not scared, go away  
Not another night with vampires  
Hey is your bite any worse than your bark?  
Oh, how divine, keep howlin' baby!
