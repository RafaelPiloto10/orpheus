Can't get out of bed  
Straighten up my head  
I swear this is goodbye  
I feel like lying here  
I feel like dying here  
And only you can save me tonight  
  
I felt this earth spin and crash  
The end of the world shouldn't come so fast  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't stop sucking me in  
Making me come back to you  
No one will ever compare  
Will ever be better than you  
  
I feel powerless  
I feel under dressed  
I swear this is goodbye  
I don't want to go  
I just seem to blow everything that I love tonight  
I've been hiding here  
I've been lying here  
Watching life passing by  
And I want you to know  
I want you to know  
I'd die for you  
I'd die for you  
  
I felt this earth spin and crash  
The end of the world shouldn't come so fast  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't stop sucking me in  
Making me come back to you  
No one will ever compare  
Will ever be better, better, better than you  
  
Oh everyone's losing their minds  
Healthy in paranoid times  
I've said all my prayers for tonight  
It's never goodbye  
It's never goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't stop sucking me in  
Making me come back to you  
Oh, no one will ever compare  
Will ever be better, better, better than you  
  
Better than you  
Better than you  
Better than you  
Better than you.
