I can't stay here much longer, Melinda  
The sun is getting high  
I can't help you with your troubles  
If you won't help with mine  
I gotta get down  
I gotta get down  
Gotta get down to the mine  
  
You keep me up just one more night  
I can't stop here no more  
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight  
You kept me up till four  
I gotta get down  
I gotta get down  
Or I can't work there no more  
  
Lotta poor man make a five dollar bill  
Will keep him happy all the time  
Some other fellow's making nothing at all  
And you can hear him cry  
  
Can I go, buddy, can I go down  
Take your shift at the mine  
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine  
That's where I mainly spend my time  
  
Make good money, five dollars a day  
If I made any more I might move away  
  
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland Blues  
He can't win for losing  
Lotta poor man got to walk the line  
Just to pay his union dues  
  
I don't know now, I just don't know  
If I'm coming back again  
I don't know now, I just don't know  
If I'm coming back again
