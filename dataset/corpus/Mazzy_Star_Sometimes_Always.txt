I gave you all I had  
I gave you good and bad  
I gave but you just threw it back  
  
I won't get on my knees  
Don't make me do that please  
I've been away but now I'm back  
  
Don't be too sure of that  
What makes you sure of that  
You went away you can't come back  
  
I walked away from you  
I hurt you through and through  
Aw honey give me one more chance  
  
Aw you're a lucky son  
Lucky son of a gun  
You went away, you went away  
You went away but now youre back  
  
I got down on my knees  
And then I begged you please  
I always knew you'd take me back
