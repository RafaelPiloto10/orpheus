[Chorus]  
Are you wondering why  
No one talks any more  
And all you hear  
Is the cry for war  
Are you wondering if  
There are people who  
Hurt inside the same as you  
  
There are grey-faced men always telling me  
Things ain't like they used to be  
You kids have got no self respect  
Wake up old man to your neglect  
It's dog eat dog  
It's hand to mouth  
It's east and west  
It's north and south  
Just like you drummed it into me  
Things ain't like they used to be  
  
I'll tell you why I can't afford  
To hang my hopes upon your word  
And when I'm done, I'll join the queue  
And take my chance, no thanks to you  
It's in or out  
It's stop and go  
It isn't what  
It's who you know  
I've heard you, now can you hear me  
Things ain't like they used to be  
  
Ancient rules for ancient men  
But this is now and that was then  
Don't lay your heavy hand on me  
And sink me in your poison sea  
It's us and them  
It's me and you  
It's guessing games  
It's what to do  
Exactly like you said to me  
Things ain't like they used to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Are you wondering why  
No one talks any more  
And all you hear  
Is the cry for war  
Are you wondering if  
There are people who  
Hurt inside the same as you
