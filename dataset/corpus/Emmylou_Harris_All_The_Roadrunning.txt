(feat. Mark Knopfler)  
  
A million miles our vagabond heels  
Clocked up beneath the clouds  
They're counting down to show time  
When we do it for real with the crowds  
Air miles are owing  
But they don't come for free  
And they don't give you any for pain  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
The rimshots come down like cannon fire  
And thunder off the wall  
There's a man in every corner  
And each one is giving his all  
  
This is my fife  
This is my drum  
So you never will hear me complain  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning  
  
Well if you're inclined  
To go up on the wall  
It can only be fast and high  
And those who don't like the danger  
Soon find something different to try  
When there's only a ringin' in your ears  
And an echo down memory lane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
  
The show's packing up  
I sit and watch the convoy  
Leaving town  
There's no pretending I'm not a fool,  
For riding around and around  
Like the pictures you keep of your old wall of death  
You showed me one time on the plane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
A million miles of vagabond sky  
Clocked up above the clouds  
I'm still your man for the roaming  
For as long as there's roamin' allowed  
  
There'll be a rider  
And there'll be a wall  
As long as the dreamer remains  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning
