I'm feelin' low, no place to go  
And I'm a-thinking that I'm gonna scream  
Because a hotel all alone is not a  
Rock and roll star's dream  
  
But just when I'm about to shut the light and go to bed  
A lady calls and asks if I'm too tired or if I'm just to dead for  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no  
  
My plane's delayed and I'm afraid  
They're gonna keep me waiting here till nine  
Then a stewardess in a tight blue dress says  
"I got the time"  
  
But just as I'm about to take my coat and get my flight  
She says "Oh please", she's on her knees  
And one more time before I leave I get some  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no, no  
  
In my home town, I'm hangin' 'round  
With all the ladies treatin' me real good  
A sweet sixteen lookin' hot and mean says  
I wish you would  
  
But just as I'm about to tell her "Yes, I think I can"  
I see her dad, he's getting mad  
All the time he knows that I'm in need of  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no, I can't say no  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, you take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no  
  
Room service, well maybe baby, room service
