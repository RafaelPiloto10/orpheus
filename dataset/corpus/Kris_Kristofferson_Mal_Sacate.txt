Mr. money man, I know you've had your way  
And I know the way you're winning  
And that bloody hand you're holding  
Ain't no bargain at the price you had to pay  
You have stolen all the land that you can steal  
And you killed so many heroes  
But the dreams they left behind them  
Ain't as easy as a man to blow away  
Chorus:  
And they say, "el mal sacate ni el fuego lo quema"  
And los mexicanos dicen, "cosa mala nunca muere"  
Don't you know ?  
The fire don't burn a bad weed boy  
And a bad thing never dies  
Like the bad weeds growing wild around  
The broken wounded body of el salvador  
They killed so many heroes  
Like zapata (presente!) and fonseca (presente!)  
And sandino (presente!) and guevarra (presente!)  
And allende (presente!) and aquino (presente!)  
And steve biko (presente!)  
But they can never kill the human spirit  
Not in nicaragua !  
Chorus:  
And they say, "el mal sacate ni el fuego lo quema"  
And los mexicanos dicen, "cosa mala nunca muere"  
Don't you know ?  
Aiiiiiaiiiaiiiiii nicaragua !  
Aiiiiiaiiiaiiiiii sandinista !
