Even if you own a wife  
Even if you like in my state  
I could never want a bribe  
I've been there no matter what that  
  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday  
  
Even if you wanted light  
I could never matter to play  
Even if you want a life  
Even if I like it you're sad  
  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
  
Even if you own a wife  
Even if you wanted, one thing  
I could never want a life  
I could never only, one day  
  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound
