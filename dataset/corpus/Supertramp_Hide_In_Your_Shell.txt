Hide in your shell 'cause the world is out to bleed you for a ride  
What will you gain making your life a little longer?  
Heaven or hell, was the journey cold that gave your eyes of steel?  
Shelter behind painting your mind and playing joker  
  
Too frightening to listen to a stranger  
Too beautiful to put your pride in danger  
You're waiting for someone to understand you  
But you've got demons in your closet  
And you're screaming out to stop it  
Saying life's begun to cheat you  
Friends are out to beat you  
Grab on to what you scramble for  
  
Don't let the tears linger on inside now  
'Cause it's sure time you gained control  
If I can help you, if I can help you  
If I can help you, just let me know  
Well, let me show you the nearest signpost  
To get your heart back and on the road  
If I can help you, if I can help you  
If I can help you, just let me know.  
  
All through the night as you like awake and hold yourself so tight  
What do you need, a second-hand-movie-star to tend you?  
I as a boy, I believed the saying the cure for pain was love  
How would it be if you could see the world through my eyes?  
  
Too frightening- the fire's getting colder  
Too beautiful- to think you're getting older  
You're looking for someone to give an answer.  
But what you see is just an illusion  
You're surrounded by confusion  
Saying life's begun to cheat you  
Friends are out to beat you  
Grab on to what you can scramble for  
Don't let the tears  
Just let me know  
I want to know  
I want to know you  
Well let me know you  
I want to feel you  
I want to touch you  
Please let me near you  
Can you hear what I'm saying?  
Well I'm hoping, I'm dreamin', I'm prayin'  
I know what you're thinkin'  
See what you're seein'  
Never ever let yourself go  
  
Hold yourself down, hold yourself down  
Why d'ya hold yourself down?  
Why don't you listen, you can  
Trust me,  
There's a place I know the way to  
A place there is need to feel you  
Feel that you're alone  
Hear me  
I know exactly what you're feelin'  
'Cause all your troubles are within you  
Please begin to see that I'm just bleeding to  
Love me, love you  
Loving is the way to  
Help me, help you  
Why must we be so cool, oh so cool,?  
Oh, we're such damn fools
