Why did you tell your girlfriend you were hanging with the boys  
She called me last night and I tried to cover for ya  
She asked if I liked the flick that we all went out to see  
I said, "ooo uh, it was nice"  
She said, "Don't you lie to me"  
You messed up you shoulda warned me first (she saw you)  
I'm sad to tell ya  
You shoulda told me 'cause you made it worse (she saw you) unlucky fella  
You better take that credit card (she saw you) to Cartier  
You better hope with all you got (she saw you)  
She feels like forgiving you today  
Too bad for you  
You were out there trying to be a player, now she's gone, it's true  
It's hard to feel that sorry for you  
She saw you, now this is the end  
Saw you kiss the very girl (who's supposed to be) only your friend  
She's convinced you took her heart  
And played with it like a toy  
And from what I heard, you just might need you a lawyer  
It's too late for feeling bad, you did not respect the girl  
You tried to play around  
And got caught with your pants down  
You can't escape from what you've done (she saw you) your time is up  
You're like a deer who's caught up in (she saw you) the headlights of love  
You can't be too proud to plead (she saw you) she's gonna make you pay  
Forgiveness is what you need (she saw you) she's too mad to let you get away  
Looks bad to me  
You were busy trying to be a player  
Now she's gone, breathe deep  
You can't be doing that creep, creep, creep, creep  
She saw you, now this is the end  
Saw you kiss the very girl (who's supposed to be) only your friend
