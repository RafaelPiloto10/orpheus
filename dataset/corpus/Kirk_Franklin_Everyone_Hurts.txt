Everyone hurts and goes through pain  
Whatever's first, it feels the same  
Be young or poor, old age or fame  
Know this for sure, everyone hurts, we all feel pain  
  
Everyone hurts, everyone falls  
We let love in, still heartbreak calls  
Tell me how much can my soul take  
We make mistakes, we hurt we need amazing grace  
  
So we pray tonight, that you don't get weak  
And please pray that I, don't forget what I believe  
'Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work  
Pray until He heals the hurt  
I trust God will heal the hurt  
  
Everyone hurts, we all ask why  
Sinner or saint, everyone tries  
Life cuts so deep, feels like your dying  
No cross no crown can't give up now please heal tonight  
  
So we pray tonight, that you don't get weak  
And please pray that I, don't forget what I believe  
'Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work  
Pray until He heals the hurt  
I trust God will heal the hurt  
  
So tonight we cry out for the world  
Cry out for the world 'cause everyone hurts  
Everyone goes through sorrow  
Tonight we cry out for the world  
Cry out for the world  
Please heal our hearts tonight  
  
Everyone hurts but not for long  
That weight you bare, will make you strong  
Your guilty stains can be erased  
The final price paid by His life amazing grace  
  
So we pray tonight, that you don't get weak  
And please pray that I, don't forget what I believe  
'Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work  
Pray until He heals the hurt  
I trust God will heal the hurt  
  
I know He will, He'll heal the hurt  
I know He will, He'll heal the hurt  
I know He will, He'll heal the hurt  
I know He will, He'll heal the hurt  
I know He will, He'll heal the hurt  
I know He will, He'll heal the hurt  
I know He will, He'll heal the hurt  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Tonight we cry out for the world  
Cry out for the world 'cause everyone hurts  
Everyone goes through sorrow
