By David Allan Coe  
I'VE DONE SOME RAMBLING DOWN IN MISSISSIPPI  
I'VE DONE SOME TIME IN TENNESSEE  
I SERVER MY SENTENCE IN A FENDER TWIN AMPLIFIER  
HONEY DON'T YOU LAT THAT SHIT ON ME  
  
HONEY DON'T YOU LAY THAT SHIT ON ME  
I PAID MY DUES TO THE MUSICIANS UNION  
HONEY DON'T YOU LAY THAT SHIT ON SLIM  
  
I'VE BEEN A RODIE FOR SATAN HONEY  
I WAS A SOUND MAN FOR THE DEVIL YOU SEE  
NOW I'm A GUITAR WITH THE HEART OF A BANJO  
HONEY DON'T YOU LAY THAT SHIT ON ME
