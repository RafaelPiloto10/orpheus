[Verse 1: Harry Styles]  
Who's that shadow holding me hostage?  
I've been here for days  
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never 'gonna get away?  
  
[Verse 2: Zayn Malik]  
I know they'll be coming to find me soon  
But I fear I'm getting used to  
Being held by you  
  
[Chorus: All Members]  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby look what you've done now  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby you got me tied down  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
  
[Verse 3: Louis Tomlinson]  
Who's this man that's holding your hand  
And talking about your eyes?  
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind  
  
[Verse 4: Niall Horan]  
I know they'll be coming to find me soon  
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room  
Yeah I fell for you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby look what you've done now  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby you got me tied down  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
  
[Bridge: Liam Payne]  
All my life I've been on my own  
I used the light to guide me home  
But now together we're alone  
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna' go  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby look what you've done now  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby you got me tied down  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way
