Goodbye bye bye bye forever  
Goodbye bye bye bye my love  
How can you say you still love me  
When seen in the arms of a friend  
The flame that burns for me is dying slowly  
It's time we both wake up, let's not pretend  
  
Goodbye bye bye bye forever  
Goodbye bye bye bye my love  
We're fooling ourselves just by thinking  
Let's not pretend anymore  
You can stop writing me letters  
I took my phone off the hook  
I don't have time to play around with romance  
It's love I want, so please let's not pretend  
  
Goodbye bye bye bye forever  
Goodbye bye bye bye my love  
We're fooling ourselves just by thinking  
Let's not pretend anymore
