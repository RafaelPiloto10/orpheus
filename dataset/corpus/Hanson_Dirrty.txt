Oh, I'm overdue, give me some room  
I'm coming through  
Paid my dues, in the mood  
Me and the girls gonna shake the room  
  
Dj's spinning, show your hands  
Let's get dirrty, that's my jam  
I need that, uh, to get me off  
Sweat until my clothes come off  
  
It's explosive, speakers are pumping  
Still jumping, six in the morning  
Table dancing, glasses are mashing  
No question, time for some action  
  
Temperature's up, can you feel it?  
About to erupt, gonna get my girls  
Get your boys  
Gonna make some noise  
  
Wanna get rowdy  
Gonna get a little unruly  
Get it fired up in a hurry  
Wanna get dirrty  
  
It's about time that I came to start the party  
Sweat dripping over my body  
Dancing gettin' just a little naughty  
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival
