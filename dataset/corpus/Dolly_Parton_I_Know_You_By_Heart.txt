Everybody wants to find a love  
Somebody, somebody who will always care  
We get locked up in our own worlds  
With feelings and secrets we're afraid to share  
But all I have to do is see you smile  
And maybe, just maybe if I brush your hand  
Something happens, I cannot explain  
And somehow, oh, somehow I can understand  
I, I think you're gonna find  
Gonna find you, gonna find you  
I'm reading your mind  
I know you by heart  
And you're so much a part of me  
I know you by heart, yes, I do  
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do  
I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you, I know you by heart  
I know every time you're gonna call  
I pick up the phone before it ever rings  
And when you need some lovin'  
I'll be there beside you, anticipating everything  
Oh, it's like I always said  
You're the one I want  
All I want is you  
I'm inside your head  
I know you by heart  
Girl, you're so much a part of me  
I know you by heart, yes, I do  
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do  
I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you, I know you by heart  
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do  
I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you, I know you by heart  
I know you by heart  
And you're so much a part of me  
I know you by heart, I know you, I know you, I know you  
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do  
I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you, I know you by
