(Buck Owens)  
  
Oh the sun's gonna shine in my life once more  
Love's gonna live here again  
Thing's are gonna be the way they were before  
Love's gonna live here again  
  
Love's gonna live here  
Love's gonna live here  
Love's gonna live here again  
  
No more loneliness  
Only happiness  
Love's gonna live here again  
  
I hear bells a ringing  
I hear birds a singing  
Love's gonna live here again  
  
I hear bees a humming  
And I know the days a coming  
Love's gonna live here again
