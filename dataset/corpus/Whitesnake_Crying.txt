I smell trouble  
And where there's smoke  
There must be fire  
You sow your seeds of jealousy  
And the flames  
Just keep on growing higher  
  
This can't be love anymore,  
I know, 'cause I've done  
Everything I can  
And all that you can do  
I pour gasoline  
On a burning man  
  
Tears of rage, tears of pain,  
Burning my eyes,  
I realize, I'm crying  
Crying, I'm crying  
Bitter tears falling like rain  
  
Lies  
I can never understand,  
You play your cards under the table,  
Dealing me a losing hand  
  
Tears of rage, tears of pain,  
Burning my eyes,  
I realize, I'm crying  
Crying, I'm crying  
Bitter tears falling like rain  
Crying, always crying, crying  
Bitter tears falling like rain  
  
I want to be there  
When your demons come to call  
  
I'm gonna finish what you started, baby,  
Watch you burn little house down,  
Burn it down, down, down  
  
Then I'll see you crying,  
Crying, crying  
Bitter tears falling like rain
