It seems like only yesterday  
I didn't have a clue  
I stood alone not knowing where to turn  
Now suddenly I look around  
And everything looks new  
I don't know why but I think I'm starting to learn  
  
They call it understanding  
Understanding  
A willingness to grow  
I'm finally understanding  
Understanding  
There's so much I could know  
  
Until the day you came along  
I used to just get lost  
I only heard the things I wanted to hear  
It always seemed like no cared  
Then you took the time  
And now I look and everything seems clear  
  
You've got me understanding  
Understanding  
You've really helped me see  
I'm finally understanding  
Understanding  
It's meant so much to me  
You've got me understanding  
Understanding  
  
You've given me some pride  
I'm finally understanding  
You're really on my side  
Really on my side  
Got me understanding  
Understanding  
  
Understanding  
You've got me understanding  
Understanding  
Understanding  
You've got me understanding  
  
For the first time  
You've got me understanding  
You've got me understanding  
  
Understanding...
