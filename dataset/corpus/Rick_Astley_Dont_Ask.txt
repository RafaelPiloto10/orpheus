I may not always show it  
But deep down don't you know that I care  
There are no words to tell you  
But if there were I'd tell you I swear  
I'm not the kind of guy  
Who shows how he feels inside  
  
Don't ask me to say it, you know that I love you  
Don't ask me to prove it, there's no one above you  
  
I watch you when you're dressing  
I love the way you play with your hair  
The simple things I notice  
I'd know if they were no longer there  
I just can't explain  
Why I'm speechless once again  
  
Remember the good times we had it all  
We shared them together  
Forget all the bad times we beat them all  
We beat them together  
  
Don't ask me to say it, you know that I love you  
Don't ask me to prove it, there's no one above you
