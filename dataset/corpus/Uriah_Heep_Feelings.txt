Feelings, empty feelings  
Prayin', hopin', needin'  
Just when I wanted to hold you  
You're leavin', you're leavin'  
leavin', you're leavin'  
  
I remember those magic nights  
Those nights when it  
All seemed right  
But I knew that by mornin'  
You'd be gone  
And though you tell me  
That it's not for long  
It ain't easy here holdin' on  
You gotta tell me where I stand  
  
'cause either you don't give a damn  
Or you don't even care to pretend  
Or you won't spare a thought  
Though you know  
It must come to an end  
  
You'd better know that  
I've made up my mind  
I gotta high of a different kind  
And it's gonna take me  
Where I wanna be  
Sure I'll miss ya but I gotta choose  
You can't believe that  
I came here to lose  
And you ain't a winner  
That's easy to see  
  
So I'll see you around or I'll write  
And I'll send you some love  
'cause where I wanna go  
There ain't nothing to do but move
