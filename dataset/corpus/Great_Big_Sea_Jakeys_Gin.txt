When I was a young man I was let astray  
I met with a body down in Logy Bay  
We went out in a weather  
We wore out our shoes,  
And up Kingsway road for a drink or two  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Drink 'er up boys its well after ten  
Drink 'er up boys its well after ten. [Repeat]  
  
Some people say that the pinky is fine  
Others will swear by a drop of moonshine  
But as for myself I'm a bottle of each,  
Mixed in with a gallon of dipper or screech  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Its the old shavin' lotion that's made me this way  
Sweeter than Pepsi and stronger than tea  
And when in the evening when we're feeling fine  
We'll stop into Jakey's for icon and shine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Its the old shavin' lotion that's made me this way  
Sweeter than Pepsi and stronger than tea  
And when in the morning when I'm feeling rough  
I curse, ol' Jakey who sold me this stuff  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
