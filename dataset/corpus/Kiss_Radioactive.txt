You're my food, you're my water  
You've got to be the Devil's daughter  
Can't get near, can't get far  
You've got the power, but know who you are  
  
She's radioactive  
She's very selective  
She's what I need, she's so pretty indeed  
She wants it all the time  
  
And I'm crazy, kinda hazy  
I'm not sorry, gonna worry  
I'm not lonely, she's my only  
She's got me eatin' out of her hands  
  
She's radioactive  
She's very selective  
She's what I need, she's so pretty indeed  
I've gotta make her mine  
  
She's radioactive  
She's very selective  
She's what I need, she's so pretty indeed  
I've gotta make her mine  
  
She's radioactive  
She's very selective  
She's what I need, she's so pretty indeed  
I've gotta make her mine  
  
She's my little baby  
She's such a lady  
She knows how I feel, she knows that it's real  
She wants it all the time
