I still remember  
That hazy September  
I've been waiting for somebody like you  
To come back around  
  
We would walk in the park  
Every Saturday  
Brand new  
All in love  
Kissing time away  
You was all up on me  
It was plain to see  
That I was your girl  
Way back when it was the simple thing  
Anklets, Nameplates  
That you gave to me  
Sweet tarts, Ring pops, and that candy bling  
And you were my world  
  
Now I wish I could go back and make time stop  
I would take this love throwback from the top  
Go DJ play my song  
And I'm a think about you all night long  
  
Back in the days we were in love  
Were not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
Back in the days we were in love  
Were not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
  
It was personal things we would do  
Things we were to  
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  
Now I'm back to the future missing you  
  
My sweet baby  
My sweet thang  
Like candy  
Felt like real love  
Not just play play  
Missing you  
My sweet baby  
  
It was everything that I could do  
To stay awake  
And I often reminisce  
About the games we played  
It was Tag, Chess, Spin The Bottle  
Then butterflies would last till tomorrow  
Then the lights came on  
I had to run right home  
  
And now I wish I  
Could go back and my time stop  
And I would take this love throwback from the top  
Go DJ play my song  
And I'm a think about you all night long  
  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I still wishing we was in one again  
  
It was personal things we would do  
Things we were to  
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  
Now I'm back to the future missing you  
  
My sweet baby  
My sweet thang  
Like candy  
Felt like real love  
Not just play play  
Missing you  
My sweet baby  
  
I'm a see Mimi  
Felt the need to change me  
Butterfly flow  
Like Mohamed Ali  
Wish I can bring you back  
Like the O.D.B  
Thinkin' bout the world  
Plus me you and Jack  
No matter what I do  
Well the memories are stacked  
Thinkin' tenth grade  
Thinkin' 'bout eleventh  
When you went doggy fresh  
All the way to heaven heaven heaven  
  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I still wishing we was in one again  
  
It was personal things we would do  
Things we were to  
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  
Now I'm back to the future missing you  
  
My sweet baby  
My sweet thang  
Like candy  
Felt like real love  
Not just play play  
Missing you  
My sweet baby
