Baby you pretend that things ain't what they seem  
All this tension telling me just exactly what we should be  
Now I don't mind us being some kind of casual thing  
Listen, all I want to do right now is have your contact on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Can you put your hands my waistline  
Want your skin up against mine  
Move my hips to the baseline  
Let me get mine, you get yours  
Hang a please don't disturb sign  
Put my back into a slow grind  
Sending chills up and down my spine  
Let me get mine, you get yours  
  
If you see me with a man  
Understand that you can't question me  
The feelings that you call, it ain't my fault  
It can't help your jealousy  
If you can handle the fact that  
What we have has got to be commitment free  
Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin', hittin'  
Underneath the sheets  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now listen  
So, come on and freak my body  
We can get nasty, naughty  
All night a private party  
Gotta hit that spot just right  
Work me like a 9 to 5  
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'  
Cause this is a physical lovin'  
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'  
Gotta hit that spot just right  
Work me like a 9 to 5  
  
We have a physical thing  
We'll make love, but don't fall in love  
Let me get mine, you get yours  
You spend time  
Just enough so you get yours, and I get mine  
No strings attached  
I want your body, not your heart  
Let me get mine, you get yours  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Come here  
Don't be shy  
I won't bite  
Let me get mine, you get yours
