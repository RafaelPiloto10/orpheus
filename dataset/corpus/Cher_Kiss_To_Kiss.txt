Do nothing 'til you hear from me  
Leave a number where you're gonna be  
These times are dangerous for you and me  
But I'll get a message through  
  
He'll be watching every move you make  
He'll be waiting for that one mistake  
Somebody's heart is gonna have to break  
Before we're through  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause we can't live from kiss to kiss  
Making up for all we miss  
Hiding in the daylight shadows  
Until it's time to say goodbye  
Wishing it could be alright  
Living with the loneliness  
From kiss to kiss  
  
Don't ask me now what's right or wrong  
I've been wondering since you came along  
We we're weak and love was strong  
Now there's nothing we can do  
  
So I'll meet you at the same old place  
I know it's worth it when I see you face  
Someday we'll disappear without a trace  
Baby that's the truth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I keep hoping we'll find a way  
I keep wondering, who's gonna pay  
I keep waiting for judgment day  
Some people's lives just get in the way  
That's the truth  
  
[Chorus]
