Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me  
Oh things are gonna happen naturally  
And taking your advice I'm looking on the bright side  
And balancing the whole thing  
But often times those words get tangled up in lines  
And the bright lights turn to night  
Until the dawn it brings  
A little bird who'll sing about the magic that was you and me  
  
'Cause you and I both loved  
What you and I spoke of  
What you and I spoke of  
Others only dream of the love that I love  
  
See I'm all about them words  
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words  
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages forwards  
More words then I had ever heard and I feel so live  
Now you and I, you and I  
Not so little you and I anymore  
And with this silence brings a moral story  
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy  
  
You and I both loved what you and I spoke of  
And others just read of and if you could see now  
Well I'm already finally out of  
  
And it's okay if you have go away  
Just remember the telephone works both ways  
And if I never ever hear it ring  
If nothing else I'll think the bells inside  
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay  
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang  
  
You and I both loved what you and I spoke of  
And others just read of and if you could see now  
Well I'm already finally out of words
