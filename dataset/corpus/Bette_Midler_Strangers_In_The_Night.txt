Ooooooh. Wooooh.  
Strangers in the night, exchanging glances,  
Wondering in the night what were the chances  
We would fall in love before the night was through.  
  
Something in your eyes was so exciting,  
And in your smile, ooh, inviting.  
In my heart I knew I must have you.  
  
Strangers in the night, lonely people.  
Strangers in the night up to the moment  
We said our first hello. Little did we know  
Love was just a glance away, embracing dance away.  
It's just a glance away. It's just a chance away.  
  
Dancin', dancin' in the night. Stranger,  
C'mon, c'mon, treat a stranger right.  
I'm dancin', dancin' in the night. Stranger,  
I say what's on my mind.  
Let us be lovers. Yeah, it's gonna be all right  
For strangers in the . . .  
  
Yeah, woo-hoo!  
I'm dancin', dancin' in the night.  
Hello stranger. see'mon, whoa.  
Dancin', I'm dancin' in the night. Hello stranger.  
Woo. I'm dancin' in the night. Hello stranger.  
Oh-wo. Ohhhh.

Doo-be-doo-be-doo. Don't want to be strangers.  
No, Doo-be-doo-be-doo. Don't want to be
