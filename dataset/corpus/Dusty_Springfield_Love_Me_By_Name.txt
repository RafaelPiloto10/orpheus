I tried so hard to be carefree  
Rolling out of someone's bed  
Into the sunshine  
But the sun, oh, coming up  
Doesn't always bring the light, oh  
And somehow, somehow I feel, oh  
It's just not right  
No, not for me  
  
Well it's been so long  
Since I've been loved by name, oh-ho  
Love me by name, ah  
Love me by name  
Come on, come on, ooh-hoo  
Love me  
  
Here I feel afraid, ooh  
And I don't know why  
You're surely not the first I've had, ah, oh  
Who held me gently, yeah  
Oh, who took the sweet time  
Just to ask me about me  
Well, well maybe this time  
Oh God, let it be  
Oh, it's such so, so, so long  
Since I've been loved, oh, by name  
  
Love me by name  
Ah, love me by name  
Come on and love me, oh baby  
Yes, love me, aah, aah  
  
Oh, love me by name, oh  
Why don't you love me, ah  
Come on, come on, ahh, ahh  
Sweet baby  
Oh won't you love me, yeah  
Love me by name
