I don't know what I'm searching for,  
I never have opened the door.  
Tomorrow may find me at last,  
Turning my back on the past.  
But time will tell of stars that fell,  
A million years ago.  
Memories can never take you back,  
Home, sweet, home.  
You can never go home any more.  
All my life I never really knew me till today.  
Now I know I'm just another step along the way.  
I lie awake for hours,  
I'm just waiting for the sun,  
When the journey we are making has begun.  
Don't deny the feeling,  
That is stealing through your heart,  
Every happy ending needs to have a start.  
All my life I never really knew me till today.  
Now I know I'm just another step along the way.  
Weep no more for treasures,  
You've been searching for in vain,  
'cause the truth is gently falling with the rain.  
High above the forests,  
Lie the pastures of the sun,  
Where the two that learned the secret now are one.  
I don't know what I'm searching for,  
I never have opened the door.  
Tomorrow might find me at last,  
Turning my back on the past.  
But time will tell of stars that fell,  
A million years ago.  
Memories can never take you back,  
Home, sweet, home.  
You can never go home any more.
