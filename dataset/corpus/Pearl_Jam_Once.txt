I admit it, what's to say  
I'll relive it, without pain  
Backstreet lover on the side  
Of the road  
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode  
I got a .16 gauge buried  
Under my clothes, I play  
  
Once upon a time I could control myself  
Once upon a time I could lose myself  
Oh try and mimic, what's insane  
I am in it, where do I stand?  
  
Indian summer I hate the heat  
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat  
I got my hand in my pocket  
So determined  
Discreet, I pray.  
  
Once upon a time I could control myself  
Once upon a time I could lose myself  
Once upon a time I could control myself  
Once upon a time I could lose myself  
Once upon a time I could love myself  
Once upon a time I could love you  
Once  
Once  
Once  
Once  
Once  
Once  
Yeah yeah
