Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill  
There's a stranger, stranger and life about to spill  
Oh no move me out of harm  
I need a spell and a charm  
Fly like the wind  
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on  
Kill the king  
Tear him down  
  
Kill the king, yeah  
Strike him down  
  
Power, power it happens every day  
Power, devour all along the way  
Oh no, move me out of harm  
I need a spell and a charm  
And fly like the wind  
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on  
Kill the king  
  
Treason, treason, the specter looms again  
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then  
Oh no, move away from harm  
I need a spell and a charm  
Fly like the rainbow  
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on  
  
Kill the king  
Tear him down  
Kill the king, yeah  
Got to take his crown  
  
Kill the king  
He'll rule no more  
Strike him dead  
The people roar  
  
Kill the king, yeah  
Take his head  
Down, down, down, down  
Oh, kill  
Oh, kill  
Oh, ohoh!
