And we all just need the same things  
I tell you what I know  
We're heading in the same direction  
So never let it go  
  
There are few of us  
Who will never know  
We're counting on every day  
  
I'm not sure about  
You're not sure about  
Why things are going this way  
  
Believe it  
You can see it  
  
I will turn around  
Try to understand  
All of the feelings unsaid  
  
If you're serious love is dangerous  
It changes my world every day
