The morning it is sad  
The morning so beautiful  
The sunshine it is sad  
The sunshine no friend of mine  
You awake  
It is day  
As you go from me away  
The morning it is sad  
The morning so beautiful  
So, alone I will stay  
The daylight takes you away  
So I wait 'til good night  
Begins to end the daylight  
The daytime, the daybreak  
The dawning  
Come away, until day  
Come away with me my love  
Come away, until day  
Come away and sing the night  
The morning it is sad  
The morning so beautiful  
The sunshine it is sad  
The sunshine no friend of mine  
You awake it is day  
As you go from me away  
The morning it is sad  
The morning so beautiful
