I Will Praise The Lord  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz  
Bleeding in the darkness  
The cell was cold and black  
Driven to unconsciousness  
By the stripes upon His back  
He heard a voice call out his name  
His mind began to clear  
And in the darkness he replied,  
Silas, I am here  
You know my brother Silas,  
Paul uttered with a groan,  
Today I thought for sure  
We were going home  
And when I opened up my eyes  
I'd look upon His face  
But here we are together  
In this dreadful place  
Chorus:  
But I will praise the Lord  
I will praise the Lord  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
Or what it has in store  
I know I will praise the Lord  
This may be a prison  
These may be chains  
Still I am free  
Free to praise His name  
In tribulation  
My heart still sings  
He is Messiah  
He is the King of Kings  
Prisoners started waking up  
Singing filled their ears  
Some men started swearing  
Others were in tears  
Then suddenly it happened  
There was no mistake  
As Paul and Silas praised the Lord  
The walls began to shake  
Chorus  
1989 Shepherd Boy Musicascap.
