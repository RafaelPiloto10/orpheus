How can I see when the light is gone out?  
How can I hear when you speak so silently?  
More than enough is never too much  
Hold out a hand I'm so out of touch  
  
Do unto me as your heart would have you do  
Words in my head can I get the message through?  
Sword in my hand can cut through the wood  
Peace in my heart can soften the mood  
  
What shall I do when they stand smiling at me?  
Look at the floor and be oh, so cool  
Oh, so cool?  
  
How shall I know when to start singing my song?  
What shall I do if they all go wrong?  
What shall I do?  
  
What shall I do when they stand laughing at me?  
Walk through the door and be oh so cool?  
  
How shall I know when to stop singing my song?  
What shall I do when it all goes wrong?
