I'm not in this world  
To live up to your expectations  
Neither are you here to live up to mine, yeah  
  
I don't owe no one  
No obligation  
No I don't mean none  
So everything is fine, fine  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x4]  
I said I am that I am  
I am I am I am  
  
Don't underestimate  
My ability  
Don't definite my character  
Don't belittle  
My authority  
It is time you recognized my quality  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Learn to love  
To love your brother  
Don't covet your neighbor  
  
Flee from the city  
It's getting shitty  
It is full of out-a-quity(Inequity)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I am the rock of the ages  
You cannot move I at all  
I am the son of lightning  
You cannot move I at all  
Son of Jacob  
Cannot move me at all  
I am the son of Moses  
You can't move I at all  
I am the son of David  
You cannot move I at all  
  
I am a firm ripe diamond  
You cannot move I at all  
You could a shed more tears  
You cannot move I at all  
  
You could a full of evil  
You cannot move I at all  
You could a try more nuttin'  
You cannot move I at all  
  
And you can try make a something  
That can't move I at all  
And could a come with ism  
You can't move I at all  
  
And could come with skism  
That can't move I at all
