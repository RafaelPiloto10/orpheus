I have the blues before sunrise,  
Tears standing in my eyes.  
I have the blues before sunrise,  
Tears standing in my eyes.  
It was a miserable feeling, now babe,  
A feeling I do despise.  
  
I have to leave, leave you baby,  
Because you know you done me wrong.  
I have to leave you baby,  
Because you know you done me wrong.  
I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling  
And break up my happy home.  
  
I have to leave, leave you baby,  
I'm gonna leave you all alone.  
I'm gonna leave you baby,  
I'm gonna leave you all alone.  
I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling  
Because you know you done me wrong.  
  
Well now goodbye, goodbye baby,  
I'll see you on some rainy day.  
Well now goodbye baby,  
I'll see you on some rainy day.  
You can go ahead now little darling,  
'Cause I want you to have your way.
