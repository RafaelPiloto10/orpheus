My head's moving like a spinning top  
How in the world do I make it stop  
'Round and 'round and faster still  
I'm gonna live till I had my fill  
  
Call the crowd and gather 'round  
You're gonna find me in the lost and found  
Bright lights, that's my style  
Don't be goin' awhile  
  
Got no time for sittin' 'round  
Tops are livin' proof to  
Ain't gonna wait another day  
Pack my bags and get on my way  
  
Gone and turn around  
You're gonna find me in the lost and found
