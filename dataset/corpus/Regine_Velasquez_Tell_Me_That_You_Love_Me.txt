So far away on a cold, lonely night  
If I could only hear your voice,  
That, I?d be alright  
Tell me that you love me,  
Tell me that you care  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Come floating through the air  
Telephones are lonely  
Tell me you?re alright  
I just wanna feel you near  
When I lay down tonight.  
I?d give anything to see your face  
Just to share the silence of your eyes  
Your love is something no one can replace  
And While I?m gone I don?t want you to cry  
Please don?t cry.  
Tell me that you love me,  
Tell me you?re okay  
Telephones are lonely  
It sounds so far away  
Tell me that you need me  
Tell me it?s alright  
I just wanna hear your voice  
When I lay down tonight.  
I?d give everything to taste your kiss  
Just to feel your body touching mine  
It hurts me to be wanting you like this  
So tell me that you love me one more time  
One more time?  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me you?re alone  
I just wanna hear your voice  
I?m so far from home  
Tell me that you love me,  
Tell me that you care  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Come floating through the air.  
Oh Tell me that you love me,  
Tell me that you care  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Come floating through the air  
Telephones are lonely  
Tell me you?re alright  
I just wanna feel you near  
When I lay down tonight.  
so far away...
