I've been up to the top of a heartbreak mountain  
I've been down in the valley of the blues  
I've been down the road of loneliness and back again  
And I've got farther to go than I've been  
I've been down in the dust of broken mem'ries  
I've been up on the clouds of happiness  
I've seen many a glass held high in the house of sin  
And I've got farther to go than I've been  
I've got farther to go I've got things to forget  
I've got things I remember about you  
I've been up when you told me that you love me  
I went down when you told me we were through  
Cried until my eyes would dry then I cried again  
And I've got farther to go than I've been  
Yes I've got farther to go than I've been
