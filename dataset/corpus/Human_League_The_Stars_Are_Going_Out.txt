Naked under bedclothes, fallen to the floor, hot  
Anticipation, causes slumber to withdraw, are you going  
Out tonight? will the evening be alright or more?  
  
The stars are going out, the stars are going out, we used  
To be so hot, a million kilowatt or more,  
  
Sifting through the wreckage, at a hundred miles an hour,  
Searching for a night club, a source of worship power,  
Grabbing worn out cast off lovers, throwing out a trail of  
Need or more, I never called you baby, made the necessary  
Motion, swallowed pride for peace of mind, while  
Swimming in your ocean, I always had to fit, or be aware of  
It or more,  
  
The stars are going out, the stars are going out, we used  
To be so tough, but just not tough enough that's all,  
  
The stars are going out, the stars are going out, we used  
To be so bad, but that was just a fad that's all,  
  
The stars are going out, the stars are going out,  
The stars are going out, the stars are going out, we used  
To be so bright, but now we shake with fright that's all,  
  
The stars are going out, the stars are going out, we used  
To be so bad, but that was just a fad that's all,  
  
The stars are going out, the stars are going out, we used  
To be so tough, but just not tough enough that's all,
