Show me a bar with a good lookin woman  
Then just get out of my way  
Show me the jukebox, I'll tell you a song you should play  
Sooner a later a few shots of bourbon  
And I'll think of somethin to say  
Whoa, I can take her or leave her  
But I like to take her away  
  
Liquor and music, a good combination  
If you've got love on the brain  
I never knew two women who acted the same  
Some want a drink first  
And some want to just sit and talk  
Whoa, oh, it's two in the morning  
I'm running and she wants to walk  
  
Something's got a hold on me  
It's cheap but it ain' free  
Love or somethin like it's got a hold on me  
  
That's when I asked her  
My place or your place  
I hope I'm not out of line  
I asked the wrong thing  
But just the right woman this time  
Cause she knew a hotel  
She even had a name we could sign  
Whoa, oh, the cheaper the grapes are  
The sweeter the taste of the wine  
  
Something's got a hold on me  
It's cheap but it ain' free  
Love or somethin like it's got a hold on me  
  
Something's got a hold on me  
It's cheap but it ain't free  
Love or somethin like it's got a hold on me  
Love or somethin damn near like it's got a hold on me
