When I lay down to take my rest  
Most of the time my minds on happiness, yes  
Some of the time but not for long  
I get a feeling of something that's yet to come  
I get a picture telling me what's undone  
  
[Chorus]  
When I find out that you don't love me honey  
When I find out that your going away  
There'll be no surprise  
Because I saw you running  
Saw you running from where I lay  
There'll be no surprise  
Because I saw you running  
Saw you running from where I lay  
  
Well I've got an eye upon the road  
And I've got a hand to hold my heavy load oh yes  
I've got a man and I've got a gun  
One is for fighting oh the other one is just for fun  
One is for fighting oh the other one is just for fun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I lay down to take my rest  
Most of the time my minds on happiness, yes  
Some of the time but not for long  
I get a feeling of something that's yet to come  
I get a picture telling me what's undone  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
