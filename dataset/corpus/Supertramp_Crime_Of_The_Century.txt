Now they're planning the crime of the century  
Well what will it be?  
Read all about their schemes and adventuring  
It's well worth a fee  
So roll up and see  
And they rape the universe  
How they've gone from bad to worse  
Who are these men of lust, greed, and glory?  
Rip off the masks and let see.  
But that's not right - oh no, what's the story?  
There's you and there's me  
Thank you for that
