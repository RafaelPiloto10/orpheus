Should I try to take you in?  
Another fool brought to the fold  
With not a gaze or arms  
but deathlike grip to hold  
To hold [Repeat: x3]  
  
Should I try to take you in?  
And hope for the perfect docile pet  
Hope that you'll not defile or wreck my home  
Sweet home [Repeat: x3]  
  
[Chorus]  
Here there's only faith no doubt  
You can be taken anywhere  
Here is where you choose the place  
With pleasure and pain in equal share  
A refuge for truth and deceit  
Where all who come are taken in  
  
Should I try to take you in?  
Pretending what you have not felt  
In passion sorrow sleep or death eyes closed  
Eyes closed [Repeat: x3]  
  
Here there's only faith no doubt  
You can be taken anywhere  
Here is where you choose the place  
With pleasure and pain in equal share  
A refuge for truth and deceit  
Where all who come are taken in  
  
Should I try to take you in  
Who'll pity me if I forget?  
It's said to be and not to be in love  
Is to regret  
Regret [Repeat: x3]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Should I try to take you in  
Who'll pity me in my regret?  
For those who've never been in love  
Need not forget  
Forget  
Forget
