Rising, setting, been trying to get into the sun yeah  
Wanting, getting, gonna' get more baby when I'm done  
All my life I had been waiting, then you turn me on  
Now there'll be no hesitating, I'm getting into the sun  
Growing, knowing, you learn more everyday yeah  
Needing, succeeding, sun don't go away  
  
Things are changing for the better, now I'm not afraid  
I'll be writing you a letter, 'cause I just got paid  
Growing, knowing, you learn more everyday yeah  
Needing, succeeding, sun don't go away  
Things are changing for the better, now I'm not afraid  
I'll be writing you a letter, 'cause I just got paid
