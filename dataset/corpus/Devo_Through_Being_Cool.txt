We're through being cool  
Eliminate the ninnies and the twits  
Going to bang some heads  
Going to beat some butts  
Time to show those evil spuds what's what  
If you live in a small town  
You might meet a dozen or two  
Young alien types who step out  
And dare to declare  
Spank the pank who try to drive you nuts  
Time to clean some house  
Be a man or a mouse  
Waste those who make it tough to get around  
If you live in a big place  
Many factions underground  
Chase down mister hinky dink  
So no trace can be found  
Put the tape on erase  
Rearrange a face  
We always liked Picasso anyway  
Mash 'em
