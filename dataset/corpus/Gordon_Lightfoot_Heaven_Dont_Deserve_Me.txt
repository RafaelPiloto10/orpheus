I'm not afraid that when I'm dying  
There'll be no one to hold my hand  
If there's a God up there he loves me  
As much as my old women can  
  
I don't intend to be a martyr  
I don't give a damn what people say  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven don't deserve me anyway  
  
I've tasted life both good and evil  
At times I was cruel and did not pay  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven don't deserve me anyway  
  
I don't know what it was I came for  
But I've enjoyed it up 'till until now  
If there's a friend who ever needs me  
I'll do my best to help somehow  
  
I don't intend to keep no secrets  
I don't give a damn what people say  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven don't deserve me anyway  
  
I know and I'll admit my failures  
I don't give a damn what people say  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven don't deserve me anyway  
  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven don't deserve me anyway
