You Take A Chance on an airplane  
You Take A Chance when you cross the street  
You Take A Chance when you love somebody  
When you're standing near the heat  
  
You Take A Chance when you're honest  
You Take A Chance when you tell lies  
You Take A Chance when you trust somebody  
When you look 'em in the eyes  
  
Take A Chance on me  
Take A Chance on me  
I'm exactly what you see honey  
Take A Chance on me  
  
You Take A Chance when you're indecisive  
You Take A Chance when you're aloof  
You Take A Chance when you judge somebody  
When you've really got no proof  
  
You Take A Chance when you refuse to hear  
You Take A Chance when you're unkind  
You Take A Chance when you refuse to grow up baby  
You end up left behind  
  
Take A Chance on me  
Take A Chance on me  
I'm exactly what you see honey  
Take A Chance on me  
  
You Take A Chance when you're ruthless  
You Take A Chance when you're cruel  
You Take A Chance when you make a vow babe  
To be nobody's fool  
  
You Take A Chance when you're distant  
You Take A Chance when you live inside  
You Take A Chance when someone loves you  
And you leave them with no pride  
  
Take A Chance on me  
Take A Chance on me  
I'm exactly what you see honey  
Take A Chance on me  
  
Oh Take A Chance on me  
Take A Chance on me  
I'm exactly what you see honey  
Take A Chance on me
