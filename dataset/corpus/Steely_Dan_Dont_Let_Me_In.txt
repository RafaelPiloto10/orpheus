I hear you found a brand new friend  
Well if I try to take you back again  
If I decide to make amends  
Don't let me in  
You know, I'd like to be inside  
But don't you listen when you hear me cry  
Not even just to say goodbye  
Don't let me in  
I say no no no no, oh no  
Don't let me in  
I say no no no no, oh no  
Don't let me in  
Don't let me in  
I never wanna do you harm  
Don't pay no head to all my false alarm  
If I should come with pleading arms  
Don't let me in  
You hear it knocking on your door  
You pound another heart you can't ignore  
But soon it isn't there no more  
[Chorus]  
[Solo]  
[Chorus (3x)]
