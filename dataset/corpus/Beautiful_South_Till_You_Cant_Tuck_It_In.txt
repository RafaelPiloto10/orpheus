Your figure like your friendship  
Gradually grows and grows  
The clothes that you thought that you'd shrunk  
Their size just froze  
  
When the body that you thought of as yours  
Just ups and goes  
I'll be happy with the weight  
Of the partner that I chose  
  
Your quick-step is slower  
But your spirit's still out on the floor  
And you can still hack it  
'Cause you know what your feet are free for  
And I'll love my dear  
'Til you can't tuck it in anymore, anymore  
  
Your second grey hair came a month  
After the first  
It didn't make you better  
But it didn't make you feel any worse  
  
Your third grey hair appeared  
With the fourth on your beard  
Your fifth, sixth, seventh sprouted out  
From your nose and your ears  
  
And I'll love you my partner  
'Til you can't hide the grey anymore  
Your distinguished good looks  
Am the ones young girls cannot ignore  
And I'll love you my partner  
'Til the grey hairs hairdressers floor, hairdressers floor  
  
Your eighth and your ninth and your tenth  
You just looked to the sky  
Like the charge of the Light Brigade  
Was passing you by  
  
Your quick-step is slower  
But your spirit's still out on the floor  
When it comes to raw beauty  
You've a whole whorehouse waiting in store  
Your corset has grown  
Bid you're still always first to the drawer  
  
And I'll love you my partner (And I'll love you my partner)  
'Til the grey hairs the hairdresser's floor  
Hairdresser's floor, hairdresser's floor
