Sittin in the porch swing  
Listenin' to the light rain  
Beatin' on the tin roof  
Baby, just a-me and you  
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Slide on over  
Baby hold me closer  
Movin' to and fro  
Just swayin' like a slow freight train  
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
So let the breeze keep blowin'  
(Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain that's fallin')  
(Night birds are singin' the crickets are callin')  
Oh, my heart will never be the same.  
Keep the sweet feelin' flowin'  
(Whisper in my ear baby)  
(Ooh, feels so fine)  
(Nights like this come once in a lifetime)  
Me and my baby rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Oh baby hold me tight  
Say-hey-hey you love me  
That's all I want to hear tonight  
  
Sittin' in the porch swing  
Listenin' to the light rain  
Beatin' on the tin roof  
Baby, just me and you  
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Slide on over  
Baby hold me closer  
Movin' to and fro  
Just swayin' like a slow freight train  
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
So let the breeze keep blowin'  
(Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain that's fallin')  
(Night birds are singin' the crickets are callin')  
Oh, my heart will never be the same.  
Keep the sweet feelin' flowin'  
(Whisper in my ear baby)  
(Ooh, feels so fine)  
(Nights like this come once in a lifetime)  
Me and my baby rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Me and my baby rockin' with the rhythm of the, rain  
Ow
