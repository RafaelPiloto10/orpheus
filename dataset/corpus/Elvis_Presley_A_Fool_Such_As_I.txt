Now and then, there's a fool such as I  
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye  
Don't be angry with me should I cry  
Now when you're gone, yet I'll dream a little dream as years go by  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I am over you  
You taught me how to love and now  
You say that we are through  
I'm a fool but I'll love you dear until the day I die  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I am over you  
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are  
I'm a fool but I'll love you dear until the day I die  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I  
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
