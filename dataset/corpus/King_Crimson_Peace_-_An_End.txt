Peace is a word  
Of the sea and the wind  
Peace is a bird who sings  
As you smile  
Peace is the love  
Of a foe as a friend  
Peace is the love you bring  
To a child  
  
Searching for me  
You look everywhere  
Except beside you  
Searching for you  
You look everywhere  
But not inside you  
  
Peace is a stream  
From the heart of a man  
Peace is a man, whose breadth  
Is the dawn  
Peace is a dawn  
On a day without end  
Peace is the end, like death  
Of the war
