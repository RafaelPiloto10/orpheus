A year ago today  
Was when you went away  
But now you come back knockin' on my door  
And you say you're back to stay,  
But I say...  
Go cry  
On somebody else's shoulder  
I'm somewhat wiser now  
And one whole year older  
I sure don't need you now  
And I don't love you  
Anymore  
You cheated me baby,  
And told some dirty lies about me  
Fooled around with all those other guys  
That's why I had to set you free  
I sure don't need you now  
And I don't love you  
Anymore  
A year ago today  
You went away  
And now you come back crying  
Crying, crying: please, let me in  
But I don't need you  
No I don't love you anymore  
So go lean on...go cry on  
Somebody else's door  
Go cry  
On somebody else's shoulder  
I'm somewhat wiser now  
And one whole year older  
I sure don't need you now  
And I don't love you  
Anymore (oh, my darling!)  
(spoken:)  
Go ahead and cry  
Go ahead and let the tears fall outa your eye  
Let 'em fall on your dress  
Who cares if it makes a mess?  
I gave you my high school ring  
At the root beer stand  
We had a teen-age love baby  
I thought it was sharp  
It was really so grand...but  
You cheated me baby  
And told some dirty lies about me  
Fooled around with all those other guys  
That's why I had to get my khakis pressed  
I sure don't need you now  
And I don't love you  
Anymore  
(spoken:)  
Baby, I love you so much, darling  
Why don't you dig me?  
I dig you  
But you don't dig me  
I don't understand what it is  
I had my car re-upholstered  
I got my hair processed  
I got a nice pompadour job on it  
I bought a new pair of shoes  
I got some new khakis and I met you  
And we went out to get a coca-cola...
