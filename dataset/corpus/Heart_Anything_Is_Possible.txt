There are times in your life they take you by surprise  
You and I, I know we can talk about it  
You're important to me like the air that I breathe  
You and me, I know we can talk about it  
  
When my conscience comes undone I unfold and morning comes  
I know you're my friend, hold on and transcend  
I know anything is possible, I don't ask for much  
Just show who you are and I'll know anything is possible  
There's a shadow of doubt turning you inside out  
What you reveal can make you so strong  
  
Tell me where is the proof?  
Does it lie in the truth?  
I believe we can be anyone  
  
When my conscience comes undone I unfold and morning comes  
I know you're my friend, hold on and transcend  
I know anything is possible, I don't ask for much  
Just show who you are and I'll know anything is possible  
  
I want to know you  
I want to feel you  
I know you're my friend, hold on and transcend  
I know anything is possible, I don't ask for much  
Just show who you are, then I'll know anything is possible
