You promise us a bright golden future  
You say you will save the world  
That there will be no more hunger and pain  
But we only see your golden hands  
  
You say you take care of our survival  
Sending us missiles instead  
But you just betray us, deny us and lie  
And you always say you would  
  
Fight for freedom, fight for rights  
I see treason in your eyes.  
  
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand  
Judas - sittin' in the government  
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ  
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified  
  
Your worship money and economy  
There's nothing that you wouldn't do  
If the payment is right you don't care about life  
'Cause economy is your truth  
  
You are the one selling terror and pain  
In all the parts of the world  
You are preparing the final grand slam  
But you keep on tellin' you'll  
  
Fight for freedom, fight for rights  
I see treason in your eyes.  
  
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand  
Judas - sittin' in the government  
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ  
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified  
  
Judas, Judas - are you still human?  
Judas, Judas - I can't believe it  
Judas, Judas - dealing with evil  
Judas, Judas  
You'll keep on telling you'll  
  
Fight for freedom, fight for rights  
I see treason in your eyes.  
  
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand  
Judas - sittin' in the government  
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ  
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified  
  
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand  
Judas - sittin' in the government  
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ  
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified
