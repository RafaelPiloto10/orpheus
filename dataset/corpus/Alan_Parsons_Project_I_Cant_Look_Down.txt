Another passenger  
"your baggage thank you sir"  
I don't wanna go  
What am I doing here  
I feel so sick with fear  
God don't let it show  
  
I must control myself  
You must control me too  
  
Cover my eyes cause I'm so high  
I can't look down  
I'm scared to fly and I'm so high  
I can't look down  
  
They say they'll care for me  
But I would rather be  
Both feet on the ground  
What if the engine dies  
These are no friendly skies'  
My head's spining round  
  
It's all a twist of fate  
But it's myself I hate  
  
Cover my eyes cause I'm so high  
I can't look down  
Afraid to fly and I'm so high  
I can't look down  
  
I must control myself  
You must control me too  
  
Cover my eyes cause I'm so high  
I can't look down  
Afraid to fly and I'm so high  
I can't look down  
I can't look down.....
