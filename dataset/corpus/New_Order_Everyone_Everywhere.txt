At the end of the day there's no food on our plate  
So we beg and we steal for we know love is real  
And if we don't take a chance in a spare sideways glance  
These are all the chains I wanted to justify the things I do  
And when we kiss we speak as one  
And in a single breath this world is gone  
And when we kiss we speak as one  
With a single breath this world is gone  
It's a crisis I know at the end of the show  
People change but we don't falter 'cause we know love is real  
This is no place to shiver so get up off the grass  
You were once the main attraction but all that's in the past  
How much is free for me and you?  
I'm on my knees, I am a fool  
But when we kiss we speak as one  
With a single breath this world is gone  
This world is gone  
How could I fail to give her when she cried such a lot?  
People change but we don't falter 'cause we use what we've got  
And when we kiss we speak as one  
With a single breath this world is gone  
And when we kiss we speak as one  
With a single breath this world is gone  
This world is gone  
This world is gone  
This world is gone
