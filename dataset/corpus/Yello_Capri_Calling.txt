It's the time of April snows  
And how it shows  
In Hannah's eyes  
  
Calling she's calling  
Calling each midnight  
Take me to new heights  
Falling I'm falling  
  
A secret power  
Sweet with surprises  
Leaves no disguises  
When you feel pure  
  
Until I'm yours...  
It's the time of April snows  
And how it shows  
In Hannah's eyes  
  
Time and she's all  
A pool of thought  
I sometimes call  
In Hannah's eyes
