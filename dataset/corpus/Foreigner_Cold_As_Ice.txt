You're as cold as ice  
You're willing to sacrifice our love  
You never take advice  
Someday you'll pay the price, I know  
  
I've seen it before  
It happens all the time  
Closing the door  
You leave the world behind  
  
You're digging for gold  
Yet throwing away  
A fortune in feelings  
But someday you'll pay  
  
You're as cold as ice  
You're willing to sacrifice our love  
You want paradise  
But someday you'll pay the price, I know  
  
I've seen it before  
It happens all the time  
Closing the door  
You leave the world behind  
  
You're digging for gold  
Yet throwing away  
A fortune in feelings  
But someday you'll pay  
  
(Cold, as, ice)  
You know that you are  
(Cold, cold) (as, as) (ice)  
As cold as ice to me  
(Cold, cold, cold) (as, as, as) (ice)  
  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, you're as cold as ice)  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
You're as cold as ice  
(Cold as icccce)  
Cold as ice I know  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
You're as cold as ice  
(Cold as icccce)  
Cold as ice I know  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
Oh, yes I know  
(Cold as icccce)  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
You're as cold as ice  
(Cold as icccce)  
Cold as ice I know  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
Oh, yes I know  
(Cold as icccce)
