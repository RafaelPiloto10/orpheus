Well, you knock, knock, knock and I say, "Come in."  
You open the door and you take a big spin.  
Slap your heels and you slap your knees.  
Why don't you do the Head and Shoulders with me.  
  
Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes  
Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes  
And eyes and ears and mouth and nose,  
Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes  
  
Well, you knock, knock, knock and I say, "Come in."  
You open the door and you take a big spin.  
Slap your heels and you slap your knees.  
Why don't you do the Head and Shoulders with me.  
  
Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes  
Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes

Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes  
  
Neck, elbows, hips and feet, hips and feet  
And thighs and rears and lips and teeth,
