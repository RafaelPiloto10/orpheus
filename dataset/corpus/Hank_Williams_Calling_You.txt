When you've strayed from the fold  
And there's trouble in your soul  
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?  
When your soul is lost in sin  
And you're at your journey's end  
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?  
  
[Chorus]  
Callin' you?, [callin' you?]  
Callin' you?, [callin' you?]  
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?  
He will take you by the hand  
Lead you to that promise land  
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?  
  
As you journey day by day  
And temptation comes your way  
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?  
If you'll follow in his light  
He will always guide you right  
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When your soul is burdened down  
And your friends can not be found  
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?  
If you'll follow him each day  
He will brighten up your way  
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?  
  
[Chorus]
