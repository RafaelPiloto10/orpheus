Gotta keep it on the down low  
I'll never let my momma know  
Only call him on my cellphone  
Only see him after dark  
  
I met him on the six train  
Just the way he said my name  
The brother had a lot of game  
Had me opened from the start  
  
He scoops me up in his ride  
Friday about a quarter to nine  
So fly and so fun  
And I'm so glad that he's all mine  
  
There's a thug in my life  
How am I goin' tell my momma  
She's gonna say it ain't right  
But he's so good to me  
  
There's a thug in my life  
And he's gonna cause crazy drama  
And when I see him tonight  
I'm gonna give him everything  
  
I know his crew's kinda shady  
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy  
But he's treating me like a lady  
Gives me everything I need  
  
I don't care whose hatin' on me  
'Cause every night he's waiting on me  
He's got mad personality  
A side you never see  
  
My friends tell me to slow down  
But every time that he's around  
My heart's on lock down  
Feel loved and I'm so proud  
  
There's a thug in my life  
How am I gon' tell my momma  
She's gonna say it ain't right  
But he's so good to me  
  
There's a thug in my life  
And he's gonna cause crazy drama  
And when I see him tonight  
I'm gonna give him everything  
  
Momma don't worry, I'm not in a hurry  
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry  
He's the one for me  
We'll be together, from now 'til forever  
I know it's the real thing, if you don't, whatever  
And I know it's meant to be  
  
There's a thug in my life  
How am I gon' tell my momma  
She's gonna say it ain't right  
But he's so good to me  
  
There's a thug in my life  
And he's gonna cause crazy drama  
And when I see him tonight  
I'm gonna give him everything  
  
Momma don't worry, I'm not in a hurry  
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry  
He's the one for me
