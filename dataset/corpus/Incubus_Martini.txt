She was a new mean beauty queen  
Money, drugs, magazines  
That didn't do nothin'  
That didn't do nothin'  
They gave her diamonds  
Shiny boys, city speak, every toy  
That didn't do nothin'  
No nothin' for her  
You can  
Lead a horse to water  
But you can't expect it to drink  
Now ain't that somethin'  
Now ain't that somethin'  
Yea when the world is  
At you're gate that won't satiate  
Why are you crying  
If you work for nothing at all?  
  
Don't be a fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about  
  
Fast cars, blue jean bars  
Trial and drowning scars  
It wont do nothing, it wont do nothing  
Even the best frame wont change  
Your wet painting into the Mona Lisa, the Mona Lisa  
You've got to dry your eyes baby, i know that your body will  
Cry if you want to, cry if you want to  
If the world is at your gate and that don't fill your plate  
Why are you cryin'  
If you work for nothing at all?  
  
Mmmmm  
  
Don't be a fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about  
  
A fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about  
  
A fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about  
  
A fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about
