Well the last thing that you knew  
He was walking out on you  
To the point of no return  
Where I found you  
  
When I couldn't find my way home  
I could always make my way to you  
When I couldn't drink myself sober  
I found you  
I found you  
I found you  
  
Well the last thing that you need now  
Is a shoulder there to bleed on  
But I believe I've seen light  
Coming through you, yeah yeah  
  
When I couldn't find my way home  
I could always make my way to you  
When I couldn't drink myself sober  
I found you  
Baby I found you  
I found you  
  
When I couldn't find my way home  
I could always make my way to you  
When I couldn't drink myself sober  
I found you  
I found you  
  
I couldn't find my way home  
But I found you  
I couldn't find my way home  
But I found you  
I couldn't find my way home  
But I found you  
I couldn't find my way home  
I couldn't find my way home  
But I found you  
I couldn't find my way home  
But I found you  
I couldn't find my way home
