You already know who it is nigga, 'King of Da Ghetto'  
It's a new day and time but shit  
It ain't all good but shit it ain't all bad no mo' either doe  
Why'knahmsayin'? I'm tryin' to keep it civilized  
But motherfuckers keep fuckin' with me doe mayne  
  
In case you don't know my name, I'm 'bout to tell you my name  
Z-Ro the crooked, 'King of Da Ghetto' all about my change  
I remember when Joseph wasn't able to have thangs  
Now I'm able to flip a 300-M and grab grain  
There's some niggaz mad at me 'cause I got cash mayne  
I'm the future of rap-a-lot, quit livin' in the past mayne  
Remember flippin' with a brick, in the dash mayne  
Now every time I roll up bitch give me bomb-ass brain  
  
Probably be somebody, baby momma, I ain't ask mayne  
Baby, daddy got a problem, we can hit the grass mayne  
An asshole by nature, livin' in the fast lane  
Stay rilla fo' reala, fuck with me and that's yo' ass mayne  
Honor roll student, but I dropped out of class mayne  
Ain't got a diploma, but got knots of cash mayne  
To you haters I'm a waiter waitin' to serve somebody  
I kill all you motherfuckers but I  
  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain  
  
I guess they never seen a guerilla when he stompin' and pissed  
But they 'bout to see a young guerilla, whoop, they ass with his fist  
I tried to move around, motherfuckers roachin' and shit  
My attitude, fuck, watch how you approachin' me bitch  
Asshole and ain't gon' fake it 'cause I had it by nature  
And that's the result of everywhere you go niggaz hate ya  
And I ain't trippin', I'ma catch one of them marks on the back street  
With the black heat, slugs run up like a track meet  
  
I'm an anybody killa, but everybody can get it  
Servin' suckers in neighborhoods got it crackin' like a stick  
I didn't come to hurt nobody but you bumped into mine  
But we gangsters I pull a fo' and told you po' out that wine  
If I wanted flex, I coulda got a strap at that moment  
I'd rather keep ca-cash, ca-cash, 'cause I'm already wanted  
I'm an asshole by nature, my flag's on the left side  
Gave him a pass before I stepped [Incomprehensible] side  
  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain  
  
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody, but that's a lie  
Cause it's a delight for me to bust a lip or black an eye  
Or smoke a nigga like a syrup covered black 'n' mild  
So don't fuck with me when I'm tryin' to make money stackin' piles  
Some niggaz trie to rob me before, try to jack me now  
Fuck Danny Glover, I'm the lethal weapon with maxi nine  
Can't a nigga lavish any mo'?  
Without a gang of niggaz and they kickin in his do'?  
  
And nine times out of ten it'll be one of my friends  
That'll lead me to my grave, murder me to get my ends  
Do the crime and make a cape escape from my residence  
But still show up at my funeral services 'n shit  
I ain't fin' to let it happen to me, you gon' respect me  
Ain't gon' be no bad actin' with me, homie  
And to you haters I'm a waiter waitin' to serve somebody  
I kill all you motherfuckers but I  
  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain
