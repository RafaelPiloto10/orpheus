Peace like a river ran through the city  
Long past the midnight curfew  
We sat starry-eyed  
We were satisfied  
  
And I remember  
Misinformation followed us like a plague  
Nobody knew from time to time  
If the plans where changed  
If the plans were changed  
  
You can beat us with wires  
You can beat us with chains  
You can run out your rules  
But you know you can't outrun the history train  
I've seen a glorious day  
  
Four in the morning  
I woke up from out of my dreams  
Nowhere to go but back to sleep  
But I'm reconciled  
  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm gonna be up for a while  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm gonna be up for a while
