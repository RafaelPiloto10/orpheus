What's the story, Mr. Blue  
Did she pull the rug from under you  
Did she chop your dreams up two by two  
And kick them out the door  
I could sympathize you, son  
But pity words stick to my tongue  
And sorry words have all been sung  
So many times before  
  
Oh, Mr. Blue, you blew your chances long ago  
Oh, Mr. Blue, you're through  
Quit acting like you didn't know  
  
Hang on one more day or two  
Then I promise I'll be laying you  
Odds that she's found someone new  
While you stand around and rust  
She don't need no part-time man  
With no part-time answer, understand  
She don't want an hour's fall of sand  
For a lifetime full of dust  
  
Oh, Mr. Blue, you blew your chances long ago  
Oh, Mr. Blue, you're through  
Quit acting like you didn't know  
  
Mr. Blue, you missed the shot  
Didn't turn out quite the way you thought  
It would, I'll bet, cause you got caught  
Out playing Donald Juan  
She's got polish, she's got class  
And someday when on the street you pass her house  
You'll wonder why the grass  
Looks greener on her lawn  
  
Oh, Mr. Blue, you blew your chances long ago  
Oh, Mr. Blue, you're through  
Quit acting like it isn't so
