I'll only miss your tears in my eyes  
A tear that's been a prisoner way to long  
The fool that's made excuses for your lies  
Now confessin' the love he's never known.  
  
You're the girl who almost gave heart to me  
You're the girl who almost made my dreams come true  
Forever in my mind there'll be a memory  
Of a stranger, the girl I almost knew.  
  
Each day I told myself you'll change tomorrow  
For a fool in love will hide what's right or wrong  
Behind my back you planted seeds with sorry  
And they grew till the hurt became full grown.  
  
You're the girl who almost gave heart to me  
You're the girl who almost made my dreams come true  
Forever in my mind there'll be a memory  
Of a stranger the girl I almost knew
