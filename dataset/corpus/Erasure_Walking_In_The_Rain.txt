I want him, and I need him,  
And someday someway wooo I'll meet him  
He'll be kind of shy, and real good lookin' too  
And I'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do  
  
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)  
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above  
And being so in love  
  
When he's near me, I'll kiss him,  
And when he leaves me woo I'll miss him  
Though sometimes we'll fight, I won't really care  
And I'll know it's gonna be alright cause we've got so much we share  
  
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)  
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above  
And being so in love  
  
(Johnny) no no he'll never do  
(Bobby) no it isn't him too  
They would never no they'd never never ever love  
Walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)  
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above  
And being so in love  
  
Oh oh oh where can he be oh oh
