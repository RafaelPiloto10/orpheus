Hang a picture up on your wall  
Tighten all the nails so it don't fall  
In this picture, could have been a picture of my face  
Something painful, went and took it's place  
If he can't have you, guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while, smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown  
If he can't have you, guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while, smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown  
  
Drink your coffee in the morning,  
And at night, go and drink your beer  
All along you don't feel so welcome here  
And I walk by, and you steer clear  
You always said, it'd come passionate here  
Don't like what you see, you don't like what you hear  
  
If he can't have you, guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while, smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown  
If he can't have you, guess that no one else will  
Watch him think a while, smoke a cigarette and smile as I frown
