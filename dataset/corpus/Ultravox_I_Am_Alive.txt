I, I'm moving through time  
Being human by design  
Life  
Unfulfilled but divine  
Never ending  
How could I be so blind?  
What is this world  
Doing to me?  
Notwithstanding the lies  
All the tears I have cried  
I've opened my eyes  
  
(Chorus:)  
I am alive  
I am who I want to be  
Walls are falling  
I am alive  
And this is my destiny  
The king is calling  
I am alive  
Far from the maddening crowd  
Playing mind games  
Way out loud  
Pictures of heroes  
Lined up one by one  
Embracing the future  
I have begin  
  
(Chorus)  
Passing strangers  
Artificial life  
Slowly falling  
Look out for me  
I am alive  
  
(Chorus)
