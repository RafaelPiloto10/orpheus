Strong and wrong you win--  
Only because  
That's the way its always been.  
Men love war!  
That's what history' s for.  
History...  
A mass--murder mystery...  
His story  
  
Strong and wrong  
You lose everything  
Without the heart  
You need  
To hear a robin sing  
Where have all the songbirds gone?  
Gone!  
All I hear are crows in flight  
Singing might is right  
Might is right!  
  
Oh the dawn of man comes slow  
Thousands of years  
And here we are...  
Still worshiping  
Our own ego  
  
Strong and wrong  
What is God's will?  
Onward Christian soldiers...  
Or thou shall not kill...  
Men love war!  
Is that what God is for?  
Just a Rabbit's foot?  
Just a lucky paw  
For shock and awe?  
Shock and awe!  
  
The dawn of man comes slow  
Thousands of years  
Here we are  
Still worshiping  
Our own ego  
Strong and Wrong!  
Strong and Wrong!
