Bows and flows of angel hair  
Ice cream castles in the air  
And feathered canyons everywhere  
I'd look at clouds that way  
  
Now they only block the sun  
They rain and snow on everyone  
So many things I could have done  
The clouds got in my way  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down and still somehow  
It's cloud's illusions I recall  
I really don't know cloud at all  
  
Moons and Junes and Ferris Wheels  
Dizzy dancing way you feel  
As every fairy tale complete  
I'd look at love that way  
  
But now it's just another show  
You leave 'em laughin' when you go  
And if you care don't let them know  
Don't give yourself away  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From up and down and still somehow  
It's love's illusions I recall  
I really don't know love at all
