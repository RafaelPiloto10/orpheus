I was a clown when I thought I had found  
A love for me and only me but she laughed at the clown  
Turned him down turned him down  
  
I never frown ah, ah, ah, I'm the clown  
For it breaks my heart I play the part of a clown  
Runnin round trouble bound I'm the clown  
  
I wander all around wondering if you ever cared  
I go from place to place, I look from face to face  
Hoping that you will be there  
  
All over town the word is out It's all around  
That I love her still guess I always will I'm the clown  
Runnin round trouble bound I'm the clown
