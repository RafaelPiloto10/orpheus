Someone told someone and someone told you  
But they really wouldn't hurt you, not much  
But since everyone tells the story  
With his own little personal touch  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seams  
Of anyone's dreams is over my head  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the words  
Of others you've heard, I haven't a chance  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I've been untrue?  
When we're apart, the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
Some kiss may cloud my memories  
And other arms may hold a thrill, yes yes yes  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill, hold that thrill  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
So please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will
