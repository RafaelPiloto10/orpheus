One of the black boys said  
"I need none of your pity"  
It's your mama that don't  
Like you loose in the city  
  
But stick about, take note  
Take a tip, take no back lip  
Come come a little closer  
Let me see you snap your fingertip  
  
Because standing on the corner  
Just might suit you or maybe baby  
There's something else you wanna do  
  
Like rolling dice, nice  
Like shooting pool, hey that's cool  
  
I'm a little black boy and I don't know my place  
I'm just a little black boy, I just threw my ace  
I'm a little black boy, recognize my face  
  
One of the black boys said  
"I'm a giving a warning"  
"People been putting me down"  
"I'm so tired I'm yawning"  
  
A new suit, pretty boots to boot  
And I'm feeling slick  
Gonna go to town, look around  
And pull a chick  
  
Of course standing on the corner  
Might suit you or maybe baby  
There's something else that you wanna do  
  
Like playing poker, joker  
Like to back a race, ace  
  
I'm a little black boy and I don't know my proper place  
I'm a little black boy, get my head in its space  
I'm a little black boy, I just play my bass  
I'm a little black boy, it's no disgrace
