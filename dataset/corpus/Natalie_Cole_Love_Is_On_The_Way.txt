Oh, ho  
You're the only one who knew why I was leaving  
And you're the one who kept right on believing  
I felt that I needed space to make it  
I put a strain on love, I hope I didn't break it  
  
But it's been so long  
Now I'm coming home  
(Love) oh honey, I've been thinkin' 'bout our love all day  
(Love is on the way)  
I'm comin' home baby (love), 'cause I just can't stay away  
(Love is on the way)  
Ooh, I can hardly wait to see your face and kiss ya  
And once I'm in your arms, you'll know how much  
I've missed you, baby  
All the lonely nights I longed to have you near me  
Calling out your name, hoping you would hear me  
  
But it's been so long  
Now I'm comin' home  
(Love) hey, honey  
I've been thinkin' 'bout our love all day  
(Love is on the way)  
I'm comin' home, honey (love),ooh  
'Cause I just can't stay away  
(Love is on the way)  
Oh (ooh), oh (ooh)  
  
Hey, babe, If the love's still there the feeling won't be lost  
Sure would like to pick up right where we left off  
I'm gonna pack my bags and catch me an early flight  
Love is on my mind, so I'll be home tonight  
(Love) Yeah, baby, hoo,oh (love is on the way)  
Love is on the way (love)  
Hoo, hoo, yeah (love is on the way)  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
(Love is on the way, yeah, love is on the way, love is)  
Love is on the way, yeah,  
Love is on the way, ooh, baby  
  
(love is on the way) oh, honey (yeah, love is on the way)  
I've been thinking 'bout our love all day (love is)  
Love (Love), oh, ooh, ooh, yeah (love is on the way)  
(Love) My love is on the way (love is on the way)  
Yes it is, I'm coming home, (love is on the way) baby  
(Yeah, love is on the way) I'm coming home, honey
