Momma, I'm sorry  
You know I never meant to hurt you, no  
But I'm in love with the boy next door  
Momma, please understand  
And momma, I'm so sorry  
But I don't think that I can let him go  
I'm in love with the boy next door  
  
Starring at your picture, my vision is blur  
My eyes are feeling petite with every word  
They're trying to tell me, I'm only a kid and that I  
Can't be in love, I don't know what it is  
  
And they keep trying to convince me  
That you ain't no good for me  
(You're to young to know, baby, just let it go)  
And they just won't accept what we are  
And what we can be  
(So this letter reads)  
Momma, please understand  
  
Momma, I'm sorry  
You know I never meant to hurt you, no  
But I'm in love with the boy next door  
Momma, please understand  
And momma, I'm so sorry  
But I don't think that I can let him go  
I'm in love with the boy next door  
  
And I know that she thinks that I'm young and naive  
Don't know what's good for me, think of your future  
She says with tears in her eyes  
(Don't throw away your dreams)  
About loving some guy  
  
Momma please, have more faith in me  
You didn't raise a fool, I'm gonna stay by ya side  
Though I know you don't want me to  
So this letter reads  
Momma, please understand  
  
Momma, I'm sorry  
You know I never meant to hurt you, no  
But I'm in love with the boy next door  
Momma, please understand  
And momma, I'm so sorry  
But I don't think that I can let him go  
I'm in love with the boy next door  
  
Nothing I can say to make you feel the way you feel  
But finally I found the love that I know is real, really real  
And I ain't gonna give it up, not for nothing  
I ain't gonna give it up  
(No)  
So momma won't you please understand the way I feel  
Please understand  
  
Momma, I'm sorry  
You know I never meant to hurt you, no  
But I'm in love with the boy next door  
Momma, please understand  
And momma, I'm so sorry  
But I don't think that I can let him go  
I'm in love with the boy next door
