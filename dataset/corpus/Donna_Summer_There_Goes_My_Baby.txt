All alone I sit looking out of the window  
And the rain just keeps coming on down  
Well I cry to myself  
So many things that I've done wrong  
Now I'm watching you walk out  
  
There goes my baby  
Moving on down the line  
Wonder where, wonder where  
Wonder where he is bound  
  
I broke his heart  
And made him cry  
Now I'm alone, so all alone  
What can I do, what can I do  
  
Where is he going  
How is he what is he gonna do  
Where is he going  
And what on earth will he be going through oh  
  
There goes my baby  
Moving on down the line  
Wonder where, wonder where  
Wonder where he is bound  
  
I broke his heart  
And made him cry  
Now I'm alone, so all alone  
What can I do, what can I do  
  
Sing this song forever  
Till we're back together
