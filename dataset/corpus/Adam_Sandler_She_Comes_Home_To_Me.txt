Though I have been a fool for love  
I have finally made my score  
I got a girl, and I don't mean to boast  
But she loves me the most  
  
Even though she's a highly paid whore  
She'll give head to a sheep  
She can stuff three cocks in her cheek  
But she comes home to me  
  
She'll do the groom and the best man  
She'll slap your ass in the back of a van  
But she comes home to me  
She could fuck nine guys in a row  
  
But still have a tenth for me  
And I'm the only one who gets to kiss them lips  
Unless you pay an extra fifty  
So mister, don't you fall in love  
  
'Cause I'm the only cat who doesn't wear a glove  
Since her heart belongs to me  
She has a throat that just won't quit  
She can take all of it  
  
And still have room for your balls  
But she shops in the malls for me  
She'll say twelve then call back and say one  
But I don't care I know it's just work not fun  
  
When she blows you, Jack  
Don't you think she's not thinking of me  
She'll go down on a yack, lick a horse's nutsack  
But strictly for the cash  
  
And it's only me who doesn't pay a fee  
to watch her put a water bottle in her gash  
(Put a water bottle in her gash)  
She'll let you suck her nips till they're leakin'  
  
But don't you dare try to go antique-ing  
'Cause she does that with me  
Her pussy's sweet as honey  
But when she moans, it's just for the money  
  
Unless she's sittin' on me  
She'll cram your asshole with a mouse  
But she won't do it in our house  
Tough luck, Jack  
  
She knows that don't fly with me  
She might eat your wife's box  
But she won't tell ya where you left your socks  
She rolled up and down your fat prick  
  
But it was me who took her to the Meg Ryan flick  
She's got a face full of nuts  
And a mouth full of cocks  
She's done Seal, Larry King, four New Kids on the Block,  
  
She blew the Winnepeg Jets right after a game  
But they never got to know her actual name  
On your face she will piss  
On your chest she might poop  
  
But she won't prepare her famous vegetable soup  
That's simply reserved..  
Oh she'll bite ya, she'll spank ya  
But she'll never thank you for free  
  
'Cause baby... comes home to me.  
Comin' home!
