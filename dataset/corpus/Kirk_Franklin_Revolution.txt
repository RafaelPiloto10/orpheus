The Book of Revelations  
Chapter 7:Verses 16 and 17  
They shall hunger no more,  
neither shall they thirst anymore (preach preacher!)  
And God shall wipe away  
every tear from the eye  
Get ready  
for the revolution  
  
CHORUS:  
Whoaaaa-o-o-oooooo-ohhhhh  
Do you want a revolution?  
Whoop Whoop!  
I said, Do you want a Revolution?  
Whoop Whoop  
Whoaaaaa-o-o-Whoaaaa-ohhh-ohhh  
Do you want a revolution?  
Whoop Whoop  
Come on, do you want a revolution?  
Whoop Whoop!  
  
Sick and tired of my brothers, killin' each other,  
Sick and tired of Daddys leavin' babies with their mothers,  
For every man who wants to lay around and play around,  
It's important you be man enough to stay around  
Sick and tired of the Church, talkin' religion  
But then they talk about each other, make a decision  
No more racisim, two face-ism  
No pollution  
the solution  
a revolution  
  
Chorus  
  
No crime, No dying  
Politians lying, Everybody's trying  
to make at dollar, it makes me want to holler  
The way I do my life, the way they do my life  
There's gonna be a brighter day  
All your troubles will pass away  
A revolution's comin', yes its comin' comin' brother  
A revolution's comin', yes it's comin'  
A revolution's comin' comin'  
  
Chorus  
  
What you feelin', what you want, son?  
Who you callin' to, son?  
You know Jesus is the truth, son?  
The second in the Trinity  
Yeah I know you feelin' him  
500 days left, until the new millennium  
You hearin' him, the trumpet sounds  
Christ, the last, the first, the first, the last, it won't pass  
so don't be caught slippin', don't be trippin' brother  
'cause when I see him, I'm givin it, come on  
  
Even when we go they say we move too much,  
we do too much,  
if you step against us,  
then you lose too much  
ain't no stoppin' what we doin' when the spirit is movin'  
don't be hatin' what we doin'  
I'm the vessel he's usin'  
everywhere I be they try to judge me,  
they try to shake me  
they try to budge me  
but they can't break me 'cause I'm down with Christ  
DarkChild and Nu Nation make ya feel alright
