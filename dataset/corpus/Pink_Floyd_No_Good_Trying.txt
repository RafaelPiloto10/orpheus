It's no good trying to place your hand  
Where I can't see because I understand  
That you're different from me  
Yes I can tell  
That you can't be what you pretend  
And you're rocking me backwards  
And you're rocking towards the  
Red and yellow mane of a stallion horse.  
  
It's no good trying to hold your love  
Where I can't see because I understand  
That you're different from me  
Yes I can tell  
That you can't be what you pretend  
The caterpillar hood won't cover the head of you  
Know you should be home in bed.  
  
It's no good holding your sequin fan  
Where I can't see because I understand  
That you're different from me  
Yes I can tell  
That you can't be what you pretend  
Yes you're spinning around and around in a car  
With electric lights flashing very fast...
