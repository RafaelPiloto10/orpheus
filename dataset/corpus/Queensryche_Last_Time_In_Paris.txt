Last time in Paris was a little strange,  
Had time to myself,  
Headed out to see the city sights.  
  
Met a little thing on the Champs-Elysee's,  
Stole my heart away,  
You know I never could pronounce her name.  
She didn't mind at all.  
  
We were sitting there,  
Seemed like hours  
Pass the day away,  
Till they said we had to pay,  
Or do the dishes or something,  
I don't know.  
  
Living at the plaza Athene,  
Got to rest for the show.  
Man at the front desk knew my face.  
Said he had a room with a view for two.  
But he forgot to say,  
Renovation next door starts today.  
Can't fing another room.  
All day long they banged,  
14 hours.  
  
Show time on my mind,  
And wringing somebody's throat,  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange  
Overslept, missed the bus to the show  
Had to find my own ride.  
  
Took the metro out to Avignon.  
Man at the backstage, didn't know my name.  
Said hey, I'm with the band!  
You and everyone today.  
  
What is this guy new?  
15 minutes fly,  
Someone sees me.  
  
Inside let me go  
Hey Geoff, we need photos  
Before the show!  
  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange
