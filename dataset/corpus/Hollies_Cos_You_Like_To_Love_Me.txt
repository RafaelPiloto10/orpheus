I feel that's something's right  
You don't like holding me tight  
What's wrong with me  
I don't know  
Maybe it's time I should go  
  
But just as I get to the door  
You look at me and say no  
Come and be good to me  
Come and make love to me  
Stay Stay  
  
Cause you like to love me  
And just me and nobody else  
And I like to love you  
And just you and nobody else  
  
We should get out more I know  
But we're just too lazy to go  
What's outside that's not in here  
Nothing's so good that's so near
