You, you make all my dreams come true  
  
Another time, a lesson learned  
Another one, I crashed and burned  
But I believe there is someone for everyone  
A small cafe and lots of noise  
A crowded place but just one voice  
And from that moment I saw your face  
I just knew...  
  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
An angel smiled at me  
The finest thing I've seen  
  
(Baby)  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
A shining star I see  
That heaven sent to me  
That heaven sent to me...  
  
I've been ignored, I've been deceived  
I hardly enjoyed the goals I achieved  
And what's the meaning of success  
That you can't share  
Although I'm used to be apart  
I'll never get used to a broken heart  
But when I see you I gladly  
Take that risk again  
  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
An angel smiled at me  
The finest thing I've seen  
  
(Baby)  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
A shining star I see  
That heaven sent to me  
That heaven sent to me...  
  
You...  
  
I fell in love with you today  
I fell in love when I first saw you  
And I hope you'll see me too  
And if you don't I do, understand  
And that is ok, but I have never  
Felt this way  
  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
An angel smiled at me  
The finest thing I've seen  
Baby you, you make all my dreams come true  
A shining star I see  
That heaven sent to me  
That heaven sent to me  
  
You...  
You...  
  
You, you make all my dream come true  
I hope and I believe  
That we are meant to be
