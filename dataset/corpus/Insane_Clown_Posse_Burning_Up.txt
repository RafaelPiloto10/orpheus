[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
All walks of life up in here tonight baby!  
[Verse - Violent J]  
This bitch Rashell fucked on her boyfriend in her boyfriend's bed  
And Crazy Carlos smacked his baby mama off in the head  
And Jonathan beat his son like his daddy beat him  
But swore he'd never do nobody like his daddy did him  
And then Sandra used her pussyhole to get to the top  
And Baby D, he shot somebody, it went bad from the drop  
And then Diane worked at a hospital, took care of old souls  
She was abusive, her afterlife sees no gold roads  
And Mr. Richards was a richie fella, born with every penny  
Everyone around him hungry but he never gave 'em any  
And then Steven was a businessman, an educated citizen at the top  
Pornography of children in his laptop  
Take your spot and hang on 'cause it's crowded in hell  
You in the belly of the beast now, it was Heaven in jail  
And don't try to make no friends 'cause don't nobody got no tongues  
If the Witch look your way, somehow it crushes your lungs..  
[Verse - Violent J]  
Playa Playa was a boss man, callin' out shots  
'Til he caught one, then everything stops, the floor drops  
As he's screamin' and fallin', we see how pointless was the ballin'  
When eternity is callin', agony will be appallin'  
Don't cry for the dead 'cause they cry for you  
Because we laugh about an aftermath but they know how true  
And listen, ain't no-fuckin'-body gettin' it worse than you and me  
And ain't nobody gettin' it worse than you and me and we will see  
A pterodactyl swoop through the caverns of Hell  
And carry 2 unfortunates off to the Ogre's cell  
It ain't no guards playin' cards, ain't no uniforms needed  
You the only one around butt-naked, bloody and bleedin'  
With 7 demons in your ear got you believin' your heathen  
Talk you into pulling out your own intestines to get even  
You were born with the shine but you lost it down the line  
You fucked life up and you can't rewind..  
[Hook - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Fuck what you're tellin' me!  
We burning up!  
The witch keeps sellin' me!  
We burning up!  
Sins, we earn em' up!  
They keep turning up!  
And we turn corrupt!  
'Til we burning lovely!  
[Verse - Violent J]  
Judge Shaw was a judge, snake holes are his eyes  
There go anohter judge, another judge, somebody despise  
And there go so many judges, the judges in Hell  
So many fuckin' judges in Hell, they bludgeon 'em well  
Fat Pat like his daddy was a bigot pullin' duty  
He can tell it to them gargoyles fuckin' on his booty  
And Shawna liked money but mistook it for love  
Now when the Witch's wings spread, she give him head and look above  
Black Sundays, Armageddon, maggots and rape  
Hell's Pit got some fire for you faggots with hate  
Eddie Burrow hit his wife and put a tooth in his knuckle  
Later on he lost his life in a scuffle, now he in trouble  
You was a rebel, you nobody no mo'  
To the Devil on the double you go  
Ain't no level to the trouble you know  
And eternity goes..and eternity goes..

Fuck what you're tellin' me!  
We burning up!  
The witch keeps sellin' me!  
We burning up!  
Sins, we earn em' up!  
They keep turning up!  
And we turn corrupt!  
'Til we burning lovely!
