Gonna tell you a story that you won't believe  
But I fell in love last Friday evenin'  
With a girl I saw on a bar room TV screen  
Well I was just gettin' ready to get my hat  
When she caught my eye and I put it back  
And I ordered myself a couple o' more shots and beers  
  
[Chorus]  
The night (you know) that I fell in love with a Roller Derby Queen  
(Round 'n' round, oh round 'n' round)  
The meanest hunk o' woman  
That anybody ever seen  
Down in the arena  
  
She is a five foot six and two fifteen  
A bleached-blonde mama with a streak of mean  
She knew how to knuckle  
And she knew how to scuffle and fight  
And the roller derby program said  
That she were built like a 'fridgerator with a head  
The fans called her "Tuffy"  
But all her buddies called her "Spike"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
  
Well I could not help it but to fall in love  
With this heavy-duty woman I been speakin' of  
Things looked kind of bad  
Until the day she skated into my life  
  
Well she might be nasty she might be fat  
But I never met a person who would tell her that  
She's my big blonde bomber  
My heavy handed Hackensack mama  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round
