I'm lying to myself  
And this dagger is my excuse  
I'm a pawn  
I should have paid up  
And I left an hour late  
I was laid up  
  
I must abuse myself  
I'm against all that I've made up  
Set in stone the sun will come  
And I hate light  
You know I hate light  
To me it looks so pretty burning  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
I must have caught something  
In the heat of all these dances  
I'm a worm with no more chances  
And I've lost all doubt  
In a chemical romance  
  
I can't stop itching  
Over thoughts of tarnished hope  
Kinda funny  
Lonely feeling  
I'm not in love  
You know it's not love  
Don't make it look so pretty burning  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
Brothers and sisters  
I'm right here with you  
Cause everyone's got one  
A story to to kill me  
I'm so apathetic in my resentment  
Living, loving, knowing not  
  
Take my hand(x8)  
Take my life  
Take my heart take my mind  
Take my life take my life  
  
Burn the sun burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
Burn the sun burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand take my life  
Take my life  
Take my life
