There's a long white line stretching out on the road ahead  
And there ain't one magazine that I ain't read  
I haven't seen you in weeks but I hear you on the radio  
Singing soft and low  
  
We're so far apart  
This old highway ain't home  
When the heartache starts  
I just turn the radio on  
  
There never seems to be time for me and you  
That's a price you pay for the life you choose  
Tonight's the loneliest night I've ever known  
It just goes on and on  
  
We're so far apart  
This old highway ain't home  
When the heartache starts  
I just turn the radio on  
  
It does my heart good to see you shine  
So I'll just keep on counting these white lines  
I haven't seen you in weeks but I hear you on the radio  
Calling me back home  
  
We're so far apart  
This old highway ain't home  
When the heartache starts  
I just turn the radio on
