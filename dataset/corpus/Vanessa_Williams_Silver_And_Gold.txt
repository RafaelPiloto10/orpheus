Silver, silver and gold  
Silver and gold, silver and gold  
Everyone wishes for silver and gold  
How do you measure its worth?  
Just by the pleasure it gives here on earth.  
  
Silver and gold, silver and gold  
Mean so much more when I see  
Silver and gold decorations  
On every Christmas tree.  
  
Silver, silver and gold  
Silver, silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
  
Wise men brought gifts to the mange I'm told  
Mary was humble to see  
Shepherds and kings there on bended knees  
It's silver and gold, silver and gold  
  
Feeling the world with their lives  
Silver and gold how they shimmer on every Christmas night  
On every Christmas night  
Silver, silver and gold
