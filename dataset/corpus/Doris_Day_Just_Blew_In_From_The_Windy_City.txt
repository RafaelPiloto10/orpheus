I just blew in from the windy city  
The windy city is mighty pretty  
But they ain't got what we got, no sirree  
They've got shacks up to seven storeys  
Never see any Morning Glorys  
But a step from our doorway  
We got 'em for free  
  
They've got those minstrel shows  
Pretty ladies in the big chapeauxs  
Private lawns, public parks  
For the sake of civic virtue  
They've got fountains there that squirt you  
  
I just blew in from the windy city  
The windy city is mighty pretty  
But they ain't got what we got  
I'm tellin' ya, boys  
We got more life in Deadwood City  
Than in all of Illinois  
  
You should-a seen me a-windo' shoppin'  
A-windo' shoppin' with eyes a-poppin'  
At the sights that you see there, yes sirree  
Press a bell and a moment later  
Up you go in an elevator  
Just as fast as a polecat a-climbin' a tree  
  
I heard claim hundreds came  
To a thing they call a baseball game  
Cigar stores, revolving doors  
They got new inventions coming  
'Stead of outdoor, indoor plumbing  
  
I just blew in from the windy city  
The windy city is mighty pretty  
But they ain't got what we got  
I'm tellin' ya, boys  
I ain't a-swappin' half of Deadwood  
For the whole of Illinois
