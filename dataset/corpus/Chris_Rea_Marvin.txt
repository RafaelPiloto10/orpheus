Oh Marvin,  
Seems so long  
But I still remember you  
I would have given everything  
If I could have talked to you  
For just one small moment  
In the quiet of the day  
You took my pain away  
  
Oh Marvin  
The one who wanted,  
The one that could not stay  
With a flash of illusion  
Oh the big one that got away  
Just one small moment  
In the quiet of the day  
You took my pain away  
  
Oh Marvin  
Oh Marvin  
  
Oh how we miss you  
Oh how we wish somehow  
I could hold onto your wings  
And fly away  
Because the pain you knew  
Was the pain I knew too  
Misunderstood like the  
thorn of a rose  
Before the summer came,  
Your beauty washed away  
Like pretty petals in the wind and rain
