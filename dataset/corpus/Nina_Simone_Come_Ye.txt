Come ye ye who would have peace  
Hear me what I say now  
I say come ye ye who would have peace  
It's time to learn how to pray  
  
I say come ye ye who have no fear  
What tomorrow brings child  
Start praying for a better world  
Or peace and all good things  
  
I say come ye ye who still have hope  
That we can still survive now  
Let's work together as we should  
And fight to stay alive  
  
I say come ye ye who would have love  
It's time to take a stand  
Don't mind abuse it must be paid  
For the love of your fellow man  
  
I say come ye come ye  
Who would have hope  
Who would have hope  
Who would have hope  
Who would have hope
