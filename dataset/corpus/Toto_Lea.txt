Here's to the few. Who fared, my love  
Only for you, I cared, my love  
I've given it hope, and I know it's only you  
Encased in silence  
  
Here's to the you, who saved, my love  
Only to you, I gave, my love  
I've given it thought, and it's not all that appears  
  
[Chorus]  
Lea, how long will you still want me to want you  
In and around you  
Lea, my concertina  
Will you still want me to want you  
  
Here's to the you, who dared, my love  
Only with you, I shared, my love  
I've given it though, and it's not all that appears  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who cares, what the cynics say  
I care, if only you're on your way  
Lea, don't let the same be true  
Lea, do you still want me to want you
