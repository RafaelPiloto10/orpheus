The distance  
(oliver james)  
  
The sky has lost it's color  
The sun has turned to gray  
At least that's how it feels to me  
Whenever you're away  
  
I crawl up in the corner  
To watch the minutes pass  
Each one brings me closer to  
The time you're coming back  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't take the distance  
I can't take the miles  
I can't take the time until I next see you smile  
I can't take the distance  
And I'm not ashamed  
That with every breath I take I'm calling your name  
I can't take the distance  
  
I still believe my feelings  
But sometimes I feel too much  
I make believe you're close to me  
But it ain't close enough  
Not nearly close enough  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't take the distance  
I can't take the miles  
I can't take the time until I next see you smile  
I can't take the distance  
And I'm not ashamed  
That with every breath I take I'm calling your name  
  
I'd breathe fire and I'd be free  
To be by your side, I'd do anything  
I can't take the distance  
  
I will go the distance  
I will go the miles  
That's how much you mean to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't take the distance  
I can't take the miles  
I can't take the time until I next see you smile  
I can't take the distance  
And I'm not ashamed  
That with every breath I take I'm calling your name  
I can't take the distance
