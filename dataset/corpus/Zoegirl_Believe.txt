I used to close my eyes and pray the time would pass me by  
So I could fly away in my dreams to anywhere unreal  
And I'd hide away from everything  
I didn't know what was real, I didn't know the truth  
There was a day when somebody introduced me to You  
And You breathed Your life in me  
You set me free  
  
Now I'll shout it from the mountain  
That I'm not the same that I used to be  
I believe in God, believe in God  
I'm not ashamed to talk about it  
To a world that slowly slips away  
That I believe in God, believe in God  
  
Now at the end of the day when nothing seems to go my way  
I've got a friend, I've got a love that's never gonna let me go  
Since You gave Your life for me  
You set me free  
  
Oh, when I feel so alone  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay  
Oh, when my emotions flow  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay  
  
Oh, when I feel so alone  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay  
Oh, when my emotions flow  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay
