Flow gently sweet afton : to barbara mcpherson  
Flow gently sweet afton among the green braes  
Flow gently I'll sing thee a song of thy praise  
My marys' asleep by the murmuring stream  
Flow gently sweet afton disturb not her dream  
Thou stock dove whose echo resounds thro' the glen  
Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den  
Thou greencrested lapwing thy screaming forbear  
I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair  
Thy crystal stream aftom how lovely it glides  
And winds by the cot where my mary resides  
How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave  
As gathering sweet flowerets she stems thy clear wave  
Flow gently sweet afton among thy green braes  
Flow gently sweet river the theme of my lays  
My mary's asleep by the murmuring stream  
Flow gently sweet afton disturb not her dream
