[Chorus]  
Away in a manger  
No crib for a bed  
The little lord Jesus laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle all glory the baby awakes  
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes  
I love the Lord Jesus look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle till morning is ney.  
  
[Chorus]  
Away in a manger  
No crib for a bed  
The little lord Jesus laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
