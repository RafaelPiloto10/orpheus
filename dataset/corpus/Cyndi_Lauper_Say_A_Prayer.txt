Say a prayer for all the souls in bloom cut down  
Far too soon under the scarlet moon...  
Under the scarlet moon...  
Say a prayer...  
  
So, what are you weaving there marionette  
Keepin' your balance by a single thread...  
Keepin' your heart strings tight and pure  
All you can muster and nothing more and nothing more  
Until you're sore and still you're sore when do you soar...  
Sometimes justice is the line you walk or sign,  
But justice is complex and a matter of time  
Sometimes it's hanging in the balance or  
Dancing in the shadow like a silhouette  
So what are you weaving there marionnette...  
So what are you weaving there marionnette...  
Say a prayer for all the souls in bloom cut down  
Far too soon under the scarlet moon  
Say a prayer, go on say a prayer...  
  
Some people get a sadness so long  
They just go on thinking it's a natural thing  
Some people throw their hands in the sky  
And they wonder why god don't reply  
Well it's strange, strange time all our friends  
Dropping like flies everything that's come to pass  
All the time we thought would last.  
Well I'll just button my coat and cover my neck  
I got barely enough time to catch my breath...  
All these pictures I can't forget...  
It can fill your cup with regret...  
It can fill your cup with regret  
Say a prayer, for all the souls in bloom...  
Say a prayer...say a prayer...
