Come on  
I'm goin' down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine  
I'm goin' down to New Orleans and leavin' all of this behind  
Headin' south from Detroit  
I got Cajun cookin' on my mind  
When I get to New Orleans someone gonna treat me right  
Yeah in a town like New Orleans someone gonna treat me right  
I'll be high 10 Rollin' till the early morning break daylight  
  
A jambalaya and a crawfish pie gonna start my day  
But when the sun goes down we gonna "bon temps roulez"  
Hey  
  
I'm goin' down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine  
I'm goin' down to New Orleans where the stars on the sidewalk shine  
Burnin' through Mississippi with the Big Easy on my mind  
  
When I get to New Orleans someone gonna treat me right  
Yeah in a town like New Orleans someone gonna treat me right  
And I'm gonna party like the devil if the Neville brothers play tonight  
  
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie gonna make my day  
Down on the Bayou singing Hey Pocky Way  
  
I'm goin' down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine  
Down in New Orleans good peoples they's hard to find  
I bet he's making gumbo and drinkin' homemade wine  
A jukebox shakin' and breakin' down in New Orleans  
I'll be the highest hillbilly that Bourbon Street has ever seen  
Oh yeah, yeah  
  
I'm goin' down to New Orleans to see about a friend of mine  
I'm goin' down to New Orleans and leavin' all of this behind  
If the good Lord's willing and the rivers don't start to rise  
  
And when I get to New Orleans someone's gonna treat me right  
Said in a town like New Orleans someone gonna treat me right  
All the cats in the cradle gonna rock this kid tonight  
Oh hey  
  
A jukebox shakin' and breakin' down in New Orleans  
And if you're payin' for fun a french quarters really all you need
