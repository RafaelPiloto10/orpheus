Lying here in this sleepy town  
Listening to the sun go down  
The only one who hears the sound  
Is you  
  
You look at life so wild and free  
I love the way you smile at me  
The only love I'll ever need  
Is you  
  
I need you  
To start a clear blue mornin'  
I need you  
At the end of a long hard day  
  
I've never seen you wear a frown  
Blues don't even come around  
The only love I've ever found is you  
  
We don't go much of anywhere  
Sunday church and county fairs  
The world looks good from these rocking chairs  
It's true  
  
Be my woman, I'll be your man  
We'll go through life hand in hand  
All I want to understand  
Is you  
  
I need you  
To start a clear blue mornin'  
I need you  
At the end of a long hard day  
  
I've never seen you wear a frown  
Blues don't even come around  
The only love I've ever found is you  
  
I've never seen you wear a frown  
Blues don't even hang around  
The only love I've ever found is you
