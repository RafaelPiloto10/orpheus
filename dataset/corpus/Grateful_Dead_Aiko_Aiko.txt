My spy boy saw you spy boy sittin by the bi-yo  
My spy boy told your spy boy, I'm gonna set you flag on fi-yo.  
  
I said, hey now, hey now,  
Aiko aiko all day, jockomo feeno na na nay, jockomo feena nay.  
  
My grandma and your grandma were sitting by the fire  
Said my grandma to your grandma, gonna get your tail on fire.  
  
I said, hey now, hey now,  
Aiko aiko all day, jockomo feeno na na nay, jockomo feena nay.
