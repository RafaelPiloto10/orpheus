Violence surround me  
Violence in society  
Violence in our eyes  
Violence in their cries  
Violence it's our fate?  
Violence it's too late?  
Violence no escape?  
Violence give in to hate?  
  
Is it human nature to act like animals?  
We're all guilty, we're all criminals  
Selfish species headed for a self destruction  
Violent product of a moral corruption  
  
Violence for love  
Violence because of hate  
Violence revolution  
Violence of the state  
Violence you will find  
Violence it grips your mind  
Violence it's too late?  
Violence give in to hate?
