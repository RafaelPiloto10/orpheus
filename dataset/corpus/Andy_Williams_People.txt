People, people who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world  
  
We're children needing other children  
And yet, letting our grown up pride  
Hide all the need inside  
Acting more like children than children  
  
Lovers, are very special people  
They're the luckiest people in the world  
With one person  
One very special person  
A feeling deep in your soul says  
You were half, now you're whole  
  
No more hunger and thirst  
But first be a person who needs people  
People who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world
