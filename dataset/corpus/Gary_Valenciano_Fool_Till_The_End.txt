Before you go away  
To the one you do belong  
So glad we met and you stayed  
Though it wasn't very long  
Was it only just a dream  
Its over now it seems  
If there were no goodbyes  
Would you stay that you still care  
I won't believe my eyes  
When I see you won't be there  
'Cause this love so hard to find  
Now you're leavin' me behind  
Oh please  
  
Chorus:  
Show me and tell me  
How do you put this love aside  
(And) Put it away for another time  
With no guarantee that you'll be mine  
A fool I am it seems  
'Cause I'll been lovin' you in my dreams  
Until I wake up and I find out  
That time ain't our friend  
I'll just stay a fool till the end  
  
(Till the end, I'll be a fool)  
(Till I find its me and you)  
If it only was game  
Why'd you have to fool my heart  
Oh girl ain't it a shame  
That we promised from the start  
That our love was here to stay  
For each and everyday  
If I had only known  
And if I didn't have to care  
Then being all alone  
It wouln't be so hard to bear  
This love so hard to find  
That we're leavin' here behind  
Oh please  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I maybe over acting  
I know I must stay strong  
But you pulled the string too hard  
And now we're going on our own  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Till the end  
You know I just stay a fool
