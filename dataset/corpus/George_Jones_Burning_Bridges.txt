Found some letters that you wrote me this mornin'  
And they told of a love we once knew  
Now they're gone, I burned them to ashes  
Don't want nothin' to remind me of you.  
  
Burning bridges behind me  
It's to late to turn back now  
Burning bridges behind me  
All I want is to forget you somehow.  
  
Sold the house we once planned together  
I said goodbye to the friends we once knew  
Then I moved to a faraway city  
Trying hard to forget about you.  
  
Burning bridges behind me  
It's to late to turn back now  
Burning bridges behind me  
All I want is to forget you somehow.  
  
All I want is to forget you somehow
