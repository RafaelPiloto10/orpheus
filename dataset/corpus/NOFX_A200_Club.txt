Why do I keep scratching,  
Scratching my balls?  
I don't like this feeling,  
I don't like it at all.  
  
'Cause I got crabs,  
I got crabs,  
I got crabs,  
I got those little fuckers biting and sucking my blood.  
  
There's crab eggs in my bed,  
They're in the carpet too,  
I'll go to the store,  
Buy A200 shampoo.  
I got rid of them,  
I got all of them,  
They won't be back,  
Wait a second,  
What is this itching in my crack?  
  
'Cause I got crabs,  
I got crabs,  
I got crabs,  
I got those little fuckers biting, sucking my blood.  
  
'Cause I got crabs,  
I got crabs,  
I got crabs,  
I got those little fuckers biting and sucking my blood.
