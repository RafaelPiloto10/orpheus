Little darlin' of my life  
You keep movin' cross my mind  
You gave me a sunny day  
Now it looks as if I'll pay  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why do they say, bluebird is dead  
I can still see her, touch her, my bluebird  
The love that she gave, I don't believe, no, no, I don't believe  
  
Bluebird came to me tonight  
Waiting patiently for light  
She said I know that you will grieve  
But my darlin' I must leave  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bluebird say it is not so  
Please I cannot hear you speak  
It must be that you're so tired  
In the darkness of the night  
  
[Chorus]
