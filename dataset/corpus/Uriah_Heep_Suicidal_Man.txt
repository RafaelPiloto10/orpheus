Waiting by the window  
Staring at my shadow  
Not believing what I'd seen  
Touching but not feeling  
And wondering what I was dealing  
And not knowing where I'd been  
  
So I began walking  
To myself I was talking  
But didn't know which way to go  
Then I found a direction  
And now I needed some action  
But I should have just said no  
Should have said no  
  
Why won't you help me  
Or give me hand  
'Cause I'm close to becoming  
A suicidal man  
What I need is someone  
With a definite plan  
For I've waited for just about  
As long as I can  
  
Suicidal man, suicidal  
  
So on my travels  
Still with all my troubles  
I found someone who cared  
The answer was so easy  
That all she did to please me  
Was to say a problems smaller  
When it's shared  
  
He was a suicidal man
