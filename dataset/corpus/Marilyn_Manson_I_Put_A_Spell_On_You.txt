I put a spell on you  
Because you're mine.  
I can't stand the things that you do.  
No, no, no, I ain't lyin'. No.  
I don't care if you don't want me  
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.  
Yeah, I'm yours, yours, yours.  
I love you. I love you.  
[Repeat Three Times]  
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  
Yeah....  
I put a spell on you.  
Lord! Lord! Lord!  
.... 'Cause you're mine, yeah.  
I can't stand the things that you do  
When you're foolin' around.  
I don't care if you don't want me.  
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.  
Yeah, yours, yours, yours!  
I can't stand your foolin' around.  
If I can't have you,  
No one will!  
I love you, you, you!  
I love you. I love you. I love you!  
I love you, you, you!  
I don't care if you don't want me.  
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.
