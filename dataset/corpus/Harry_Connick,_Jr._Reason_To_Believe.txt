I'm catchin a plane home  
I can feel the wind on my hair  
Maybe someone's out there  
Someone just as bare  
And if somebody stacked the cards  
I hope they're stacked for me  
You see...  
I feel just like a kid on christmas eve  
You may not know my reason  
But I've got reason to believe  
My eyes gettin heavy  
Hope I can make a bed tonight  
I'll go to sleep alone  
My true love stays unknown  
My life's an open book  
And it starts on chapter nine  
I'm fine...  
A tangled web is easier to weave  
You may not know the reason  
But I've got reason to believe  
I had my fortune told  
By a fork tongued lady  
She told me I'd amount to what I paid her  
I left her feeling worse  
Than I did when I came in  
And I know more now than I'd find out later  
I wish I had an easy mind  
And a pretty girl to hold my hand  
Seems the closer I get  
The water isn't wet  
This lonely life of mine  
Is the best I've ever had  
It's not bad...  
My coat's the only thing that's on my sleeve  
You may not know my reason  
But I've got reason to believe
