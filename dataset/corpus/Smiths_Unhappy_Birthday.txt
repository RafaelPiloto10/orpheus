I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
'Cause you're evil  
And you lie  
And if you should die  
I may feel slightly sad  
(But I won't cry)  
  
Loved and lost  
And some may say  
When usually it's Nothing  
Surely you're happy  
It should be this way ?  
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"  
And : "May the lines sag, may the lines sag heavy and deep tonight"  
  
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday

And if you should die  
I may feel slightly sad

Loved and lost  
And some may say  
When usually it's Nothing  
Surely you're happy  
It should be this way ?  
I said "No"  
And then I shot myself  
So, drink, drink, drink  
And be ill tonight  
  
From the one you left behind  
From the one you left behind  
From the one you left behind  
From the one you left behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Oh, unhappy birthday  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind
