Well I woke up this morning woah-oh  
And the sun refused to shine  
I knew I'd leave my baby oh  
With a troublin' mind  
It rains every morning oh  
And evening is the same  
And it's gonna be a long time oh  
'Til I hear the 2:10 train  
  
Well I looked out my window oh  
And I couldn't keep from cryin'  
I knew the old 2:10 oh  
Would take me down the line  
That driver on that engine oh  
Well he ain't no friend of mine  
He's taken all the women oh  
And he's left the men behind  
  
Well now he won't be leaving Big Ben oh  
For another seven years  
I'm gonna find another baby oh  
To laugh away my tears  
When I get back to Houston woah-oh  
I'm gonna shout and tell  
How the Big Ben bought 'em oh  
It's a living burning hell  
  
Now when your lovin' baby leaves you oh  
Don't you feel so bad  
It makes you think about the good times oh  
With the one time man you've had  
He's crying don't leave me here baby  
Shackled to a chain  
But let me ride down with you oh  
Along the 2:10 train
