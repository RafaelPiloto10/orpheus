Now let's see what you're made of  
He is coming, you can't run  
Violators that get caught  
Will wish that they'd never been born  
  
Exterminator  
You are dead mutilate  
  
Sharpened razor  
Takes your head Jugulator  
  
Predit hater  
You are trapped decimate  
  
Desecrator  
Your neck snapped Jugulator  
  
Jugulator he is near  
Attracted by the stench of fear  
Part demonic, part machine  
Hungry and it's time to feed  
  
Iron claws and fangs of steel  
Dripping from his tasty meal  
Now it's time to jugulate  
Feel your skull disintegrate  
  
Jugulator killing time now  
Reaches in and rips your spine out  
  
Violator  
Big mistake mutilate  
  
Vindicator  
Rib cage break  
  
Flesh and bones  
Are massacred  
  
Jugulator  
Desecrator  
Jugulator
