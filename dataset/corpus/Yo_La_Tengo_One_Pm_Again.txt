Well, it's 1 PM again  
I guess I'm ready to begin  
And it's reeling, there is a feeling  
Let's not make any sudden moves  
You don't have to show me how  
But I'm not ready to right now  
There is a feeling, and it's reeling  
Let's not make any sudden moves  
And if we don't leave today  
There's no hurry anyway  
I'm on the road here, safe at home here  
So let's make sure we're sure  
That it is reeling, and I'm pleading  
Let's not make any sudden moves
