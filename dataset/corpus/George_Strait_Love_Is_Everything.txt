Love is everything  
It's a whole lot more than going to the store for a wedding ring  
It's kissin' and a huggin' but it's also the kicking and the cussing thing  
I've been told  
  
Love is everything  
It's a smile on your face on a cold winter day at the thought of spring  
It's getting up at night for the cry of a little bitty baby thing  
And it's growing old  
  
Love is everything  
It's those fires that daddy stoked those nights to keep you warm  
It's the hell your mama went through the day you were born  
And it's a thunderstorm  
  
Love is everything  
Oh, it's going off to war, it's the back and forth on a front porch swing  
It's the kiss that you got in the old parking lot of a Dairy Queen  
And it's you and me  
  
Love is everything  
It's looking out for everybody else but number one  
And it's all that really matters when all's said and done  
And the race is run  
  
Love is everything  
It's a rose on a stone, it's the words in a song that the choir sings  
It's the tears of goodbye and the place that you fly to, to get your wings  
Yeah love's the king  
Love is everything  
Love is everything
