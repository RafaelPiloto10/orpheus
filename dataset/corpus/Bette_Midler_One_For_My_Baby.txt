Johnny: "okay. and once again, here's bette midler."  
  
Bette: "well, you know, when they asked me to come on and. .. I can't believe
it! The last, the last guest. The last fool mr. Carson will have to suffer
gladly. You are the wind beneath m  
Gs. Oh, well he is. "  
  
Quarter to three. There's no one in the place  
Except you and me.  
So set 'em up, joe. Got a little story  
I think you should know.  
  
We're drinkin', my friend, to the end  
Of a sweet episode.  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road.  
  
Got the routine. So drop another nickel  
In the machine.  
Oh, gee, I'm feelin' so bad. Wish you'd make the music  
So dreamy and sad.  
  
You could tell me a lot. But it's not  
In a gentleman's code.  
Let's make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road.  
  
You may not know it,  
But buddy you're a kind of poet.  
And you've had a lot of things to say.  
And when I'm gloomy  
You always listen to me,  
Until it's talked away.  
  
Well, that's how it goes.  
And john I know you're getting  
Anxious to close.  
So, thanks for the cheer.  
I hope you didn't mind me  
Bending your ear.  
  
For all of the years,  
For the laughs, for the tears,  
For the class that you showed,  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road.  
That long long road.  
  
Johhny: "thank you, bette. ah."
