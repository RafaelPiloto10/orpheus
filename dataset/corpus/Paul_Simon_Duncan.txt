Couple in the next room  
bound to win a prize:  
they've been going at it all night long!  
Well, I'm tryin' to get some sleep  
but these motel walls are cheap:  
Lincoln Duncan is my name,  
and here's my song, here's my song.  
  
My father was a fisherman,  
my mama was a fisherman's friend,  
and I was born in the boredom and the chowder.  
So when I reached my prime  
I left my home in the Maritimes,  
headed down the turnpike for New England, sweet New England.  
  
Holes in my confidence,  
holes in the knees of my jeans,  
I was left without a penny in my pocket  
Oo-oowee, I was about as destituted as a kid could be  
and I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it  
I'd like to hock it  
  
A young girl in a parkin' lot  
was preaching to a crowd,  
singing sacred songs  
and reading from the Bible.  
Well, I told her I was lost  
and she told all about the Pentecost,  
and I seen that girl as the road to my survival,  
my survival.  
  
Just later on  
the very same night  
when I crept to her tent with a flashlight  
and my long years of innocence ended:  
well, she took me to the woods,  
sayin' "Here comes something, and it feels so good!",  
and just like a dog I was befriended, I was befriended.  
  
Oh, oh, what a night,  
oh, what a garden of delight  
Even now that sweet memory lingers:  
I was playing my guitar  
lyin' underneath the stars  
just thankin' the Lord  
for my fingers,  
for my fingers
