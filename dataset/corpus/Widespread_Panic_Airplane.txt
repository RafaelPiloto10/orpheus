Sittin' around, waiting for an airplane  
Don't know how to fly, but that's okay  
Got me a pilot, she's going my way  
If she's got wings, if she's got wings  
  
Sittin' around, waiting for the mailman  
I don't how he could be so slow  
My good friend said you wrote me a letter  
Must have been a year ago  
  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
  
Sittin' around, watching the rainfall  
I don't know how it could rain so long  
They say the ocean, she is a woman  
Who waits for her man to come home  
  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving  
  
Sittin' around, waiting for an airplane  
Don't know how to fly, but that's okay  
I got me a pilot, she's going my way  
If she's got wings, if she's got wings  
If she's got wings, if she's got wings  
If she's got wings, if she's got wings
