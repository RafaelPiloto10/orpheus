I've spent my life  
Lookin' for you  
Findin' my way  
Wasn't easy to do  
But I knew there was you  
All the while  
And it's been worth  
Every mile  
  
[Chorus]  
So, lay down beside me  
Love me and hide me  
And kiss all the hurtin'  
Of this world away  
Hold me so close  
That I feel your heart beat  
And don't ever wander away  
  
Mornings and evenings  
All were the same  
There was no music  
Till I heard your name  
I knew when I saw you smile  
And now I can rest for a while  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And hold me so close  
That I feel your heart beat  
And don't ever wander away  
  
Love me and hide me  
  
Till I feel your heart beat
