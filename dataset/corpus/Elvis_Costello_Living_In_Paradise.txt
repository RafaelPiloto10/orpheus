I don't like those other guys looking at your curves  
I don't like you walking 'round with physical jerks  
Everything they say and do is getting on my nerves  
Soon they will be lucky to be picking up the perks  
'Cause when they pull the shutters down and throw up in the dark  
They'll find that all the dogs outside bite much worse than they bark  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here we are living in paradise, living in luxury  
Oh, the thrill is here but it won't last long  
You better have your fun before it moves along  
And you're already looking for another fool like me  
  
I call you Betty Felon 'cause you are a pretty villain  
And I think that I should tell them that you'd make a pretty killing  
'Cause meanwhile up in heaven they are waiting at the gate  
Saying, "We always knew you'd make it, didn't think you'd come this late"  
And now it's much too dangerous to stop what you've begun  
When everyone in paradise carries a gun  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Later in the evening when arrangements are made  
I'll be at the keyhole outside your bedroom door  
'Cause I'm the first to know whenever the plans are laid  
That never go further than floor to floor  
You think that I don't know the boy that you're touching  
But I'll be at the video and I will be watching  
  
[Chorus:]
