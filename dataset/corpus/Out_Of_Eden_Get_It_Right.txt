So many times I've walked this way  
Too many times from you I've strayed  
Fallen way behind, too my former state of mind  
I look around what do I see, so many strugglin' just like me  
Tryin' to live this life, falling down to compromise  
But then I have a question, is that what we're living for?  
Aren't we called to perfection, to strive for so much more  
I find that we have settled too many times  
Should not be so, I think it's time God's letting us know  
Chorus:  
We need to get it right  
No need to walk this way this way no more  
We need to step in the light,  
And find out what we're livin' for  
The voice of God is drawing near  
Only the wisest ones will hear  
Seeing the world today will you choose to go his way  
It doesn't end in choosin', because in all we do  
We're called to keep on goin', pressin' on just to remain true  
(chorus)  
I can see how the other life it must look so nice  
But what lies after it's over far from paradise  
Gotta know there is nothing worth missing the call  
Let me tell you He is calling and you've got to give your all  
(chorus out)
