I listened to a friend who'd do the same for me last night  
'Cause it takes one to really understand  
And I watched him try to walk the line  
Between what's wrong and right  
And knew that fool was gonna fall again  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ah, but the fool I've been ain't nothing like the fool I'd be  
To keep believin' dreams that don't come true  
Because, you know, it never was too far from love to make believe  
And I'll be leavin', if it's all the same to you  
  
It's hard to lead a friend in need of somethin' hard to face  
'Cause simple truth ain't simple when it's sad  
And misery loves company, but, Lord, it's such a waste  
To go on throwin' good love after bad  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I'll be leavin', 'cause it's all the same to you
