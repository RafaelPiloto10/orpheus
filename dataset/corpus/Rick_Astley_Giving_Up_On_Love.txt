Giving up on love  
Giving up on love  
  
I was so crazy about you, everyone knew  
I couldn't sleep when I found out, yeah  
You feel the way you do  
So maybe it's my turn now  
to show you how I feel  
  
So listen to what I say  
'Cause these feelings I can't conceal  
  
I'm giving up on love  
'Cause I've been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I don't want you no more  
Giving up on love  
'Cause I've been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I don't want you no more  
  
I don't believe that you need me  
So don't say you do  
There ain't no reason for staying  
We both know we're through  
  
So don't try and stop me now  
'Cause all we had has gone  
(All we had has gone)  
So listen to what I say  
'Cause these feelings are oh so strong  
  
I'm giving up on love  
'Cause I've been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I don't want you no more  
Giving up on love  
'Cause I've been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I don't want you no more  
  
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love  
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love  
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love  
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love  
  
So don't try and stop me now  
'Cause all we had has gone  
(All we had has gone)  
So listen to what I say  
'Cause these feelings are oh so strong
