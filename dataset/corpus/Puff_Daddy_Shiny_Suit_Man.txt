Yo what up?  
This shiny suit man  
Now, i know you've heard my name before  
You know, whether it was out the mouths of other rappers.. or you know, the
lox,  
Or you know whoever else wanna say my name is the shiny suit man  
But then not wanna say my government name  
My government name is sean combs.. sean john combs  
Some of you may even know me as puffy.. puff daddy.. or p. diddy  
But i just wanna get the record straight  
That when they talking about the shiny suit man  
They talking about me  
And i own this five hundred million dollar  
Shiny suit  
And, oh yeah, next time.. say my name  
If you really a man, just call on  
SHINY SUIT MAN!  
Hahah.
