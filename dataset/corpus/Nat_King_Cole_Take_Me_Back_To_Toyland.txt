(Please, take me back  
Please, take me back  
To Toyland, Toyland)  
  
Please, take me back to Toyland  
Everyone's happy there  
It's more than a girl and boy land  
Where dreams just like  
Toys can be shared  
  
If you believe in Toyland (Toyland)  
Believe in things that you cannot see  
All the world would become a joy land  
What a wonderful world this would be
