I wake up every morning, Six o'clock, I'm right on time  
I eat a low fat breakfast, I tie a perfect tie  
I kiss the wife, I hug the kids, I pat the dogs and cats  
I never lose anything, my car keys or my hat  
  
'Cause I'm the man of the year  
I'm the man of the year  
  
I never cheat at finals, or miss a day at school  
My urine tests are perfect, my prostate is a jewel  
  
'Cause I'm the man of the year  
I'm the man of the year  
'Cause I'm the man of the year  
I'm never, ever jealous  
Never, ever cruel  
I'm a graduate of Harvard  
Where I never broke the rules  
  
The queen made me a knight  
The pope made me a saint  
The president plays golf with me  
I make Madonna faint  
  
So why am I so lonely  
Depressed and in despair  
If I pull this trigger in my mouth will anybody care  
  
It was the greatest funeral, I laid in perfect state  
And later I will meet the lord, I bet he just can't wait  
  
To meet the man of the year  
I'm the man of the year  
Stand in line to meet the man  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
