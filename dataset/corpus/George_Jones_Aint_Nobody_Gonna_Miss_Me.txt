Well, I remember back in my younger days of high school  
Back then baseball was my biggest dream  
So when I stood in line for my turn at bat  
I found that wasn't where they wanted me at  
I wound up rotten the water for all the teams.  
  
Well, there ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm leavin'  
There ain't nobody ever loved me very long  
No matter how much I miss our show  
I get kicked around everywhere I go  
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone.  
  
So when my Uncle Sam called me to serve my country  
I stood up brave and smiled and packed my duds  
But to my surprise when I got there  
They gave me the boots and cut my hair  
I wound up scrubbin' the floor and a peelin' spuds.  
  
No, ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm leavin'  
There ain't nobody ever loved me very long  
No matter how much I miss our show  
I get kicked everywhere I go  
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone.  
  
Well, I met me a pretty little girl one day in Nashville  
I loved her more than all of my wildest dreams  
She took me for my money, my house and my boat  
And didn't even leave me a goodbye note  
I gave it all up, boy, did she strip me clean.  
  
Well, there ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm leavin'  
There ain't nobody ever loved me very long  
No matter how much I miss our show  
I get kicked around everywhere where I go  
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone, when I'm gone.  
  
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone.  
  
Sittin' in the middle and I musta gone
