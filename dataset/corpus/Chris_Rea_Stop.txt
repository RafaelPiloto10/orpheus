Gone too far  
Gone too long  
Messed it up completely  
Till everything is wrong  
Stop, start over, start again  
Too many pieces  
Too much to chew  
How can you ever win  
When you're so scared to loose  
You better stop, start over, start again  
Stop, start over, start again  
Walk away  
See what it looks like from here  
If you stay you will only drown  
If a mass of fear  
You need to sleep  
You need a break  
You got to find out before it's to late  
Stop, start again  
You better stop, start over, start again
