I just met infatuation, it's something in his smile  
My obsession can't stand the thoughts you and I  
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet  
Before I know it I got you pushing up on me  
  
On the floor  
Under the burning lights,  
Screaming look behind,  
Hands on this waist of mine  
And I don't know where this will lead  
But I'm hoping you tell me  
Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby  
  
Doin' it like I'm at work  
I'm making that thang jump  
  
I'm making that thang twirk (so get up on it baby)  
I'm doin what I do  
I make it move  
Got me out here whipping my hair awww  
  
Baby, I just might have what you need  
Sprinkling you with pieces of me  
Now lets make it a sight to see, baby  
  
On the floor  
Under the burning lights  
Screaming look behind  
Hands on this waist of mine.  
And I don't know where this will lead  
But I'm hoping you tell me  
Out her whipping my hair all crazy, baby  
  
Doin it like I'm at work

I'm making that thang twirk (so get up on it baby)  
I'm doin what I do  
I make it move  
Got me whipping my hair, awww  
  
We flashing pictures, kodak moment memory  
Look at the flickers, sparks on my camera screen  
The buried treasure, come with me and we will find  
Create a perfect world just for you and I  
  
On the floor  
... Burning lights  
Screaming look behind  
Hands on this waist of mine.  
And I don't know where this will lead  
But I'm hoping you tell me  
Out her whipping my hair all crazy, baby
