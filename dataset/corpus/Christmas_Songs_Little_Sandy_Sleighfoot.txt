His name is Sandy Sleighfoot,  
And oh so sad was he,  
For though he stood just 4 feet tall  
His feet were 3 feet 3.  
He tried to help make Santa's toys  
But with his feet so long,  
He'd trip and fall and break them all  
Just every thing went wrong.  
  
Now little Sandy Sleighfoot  
Don't you feel so blue:  
Even with your feet so long  
God has a place for you.  
The other kids made fun of him,  
They laughed at him with glee,  
  
But Sandy Sleighfoot learned one day  
Without skis he could ski
