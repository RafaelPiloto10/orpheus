How can you refuse him now how can you refuse him now  
How can you turn away from his side  
With tears in his eyes on the cross there he died  
How can you refuse Jesus now  
There's a story old that has often been told of how our Saviour died  
As they nailed his hands he cried they don't understand  
As the blood flowed from his side  
How can you refuse him now...  
[ steel ]  
As he hung there on the tree he prayed for you and me  
There was no one his pain to ease  
Before he died he faintly cried oh father forgive them please  
How can you refuse him now...
