Give your broken heart to me  
Let me give you my soul  
For you to keep  
Just give me some words,  
To speak  
  
I'm gonna leave it down  
Cause all I wanna do is be with you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Someone like you  
Someone like you  
Someone like you no fool can suffer  
I just can't wait long enough  
For someone else to take your love  
  
Let me open my heart,  
For you to see  
Let me give you my soul,  
For you to keep  
Let your love go  
Just let it go with me  
  
Have I ever let you down?  
Cause all I wanna do it be around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I can learn to live again  
And wash away the hurt inside  
  
I'm gonna leave it down,  
Cause all I wanna do is be with you  
  
Someone like you  
Someone like you  
Someone like you no fool can suffer  
Someone like you no fool can suffer
