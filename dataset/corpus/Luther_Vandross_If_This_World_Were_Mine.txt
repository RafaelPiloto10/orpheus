If this world were mine  
I would place at your feet  
All that I own  
You've been so good to me  
If this world were mine  
  
I'd give the flowers the birds and the bees  
And it'd be your love beside me  
That would be all I need  
If this world were mine  
I'd give you anything  
  
If this world were mine  
I would make you a king  
With wealth untold  
You could have anything  
If this world were mine  
  
I'd give you each day, so sunny and blue  
And if you wanted the moonlight  
I'd give you that too  
If this world were mine, oh baby  
I'd give you anything  
  
Oh baby, you're my inspiration  
And I feel so much sensation  
When I'm in your arms  
When you squeeze me  
  
Oh, the way that you do  
Oh, the way that you love me my  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, the way that you do  
Ooh, the way that you love me  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
You know I need you honey  
You know I need you baby  
Keep on loving me  
  
Lovin' me the way you do my lover  
I love the way that you, the way that you love me, baby  
Oh and I don't wanna let you go, wanna let you go  
Wanna let you go, my love, no  
  
You know the world, the world would be yours  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah hey  
Yes, it would, yes, it would  
The world would be yours baby, baby, ooh hoo  
It would be yours
