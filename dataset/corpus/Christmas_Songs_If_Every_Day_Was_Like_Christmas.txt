I hear the bells  
Saying Christmas is near  
They ring out to tell the world  
That this is the season of cheer  
  
I hear a choir  
Singing sweetly somewhere  
And a glow fills my heart  
I'm at peace with the world  
As the sound of their singing fills the air  
  
Oh why can't every day be like Christmas  
Why can't that feeling go on endlessly  
For if everyday could be just like Christmas  
What a wonderful world this would be  
  
I hear a child  
Telling Santa what to bring  
And the smile upon his tiny face  
Is worth more to me than anything
