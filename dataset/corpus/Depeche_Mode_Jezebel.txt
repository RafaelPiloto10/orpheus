They call you Jezebel  
Whenever we walk in  
You're going straight to hell  
For wanted acts of sin - they say,  
And that I'll have to pay  
But I need you just this way  
  
They call you Jezebel  
For what you like to wear  
You're morally unwell  
They say you never care for me  
But what the fail to see is that your games are the key  
  
Open their eyes to the beauty  
Open their hearts to the fun  
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone  
  
They call you Jezebel  
Whenever men walk by  
They say that they can tell  
The longing in your eyes is real  
And how you really feel  
But they can't see your appeal  
  
Jezebel
