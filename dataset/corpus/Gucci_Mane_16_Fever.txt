[Bridge]  
I'm charging 16 fever, 16 fever, nigga my price cheaper, 16 fever  
  
[Chorus x2]  
16 fever coke-I-ina, X pills bubble kush mid grade reefa  
Hoes ridin' vics dog but I ride beemurs  
I swear da red chain'll cost 16 fever  
  
[Verse 1]  
16 5-0, there go 5-0  
I'm up 2-5 but I need 4 more  
I got uncles blowin bundles, mine do numbers while I drive lambo  
Off white yayo digital scale, fish scale sending my pigeons by mail  
Bring in my drain folk, especially them white folk  
Just bring me that cane folk  
Gucci got good dope pillz purp and sizzurp, my workers don't move nothing less
than a bizzurd  
Gucci got good dope pillz purp and sizzurp, my workers don't move for nothing
less than a bizzurd  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
[Verse 2]  
Bricks can't keep em 16 fever, bemmur speakers, geek-a-meters  
Misdemeanors several subpoenas, see I'm gone drink up cause we just linked up  
The squad been teamed up we cutting off fingers, it's 16 fever and that's
since April  
My corvette paid for my old school paid for, the hummer roll up that means you
assed out  
And you didn't cash out see this my traphouse I slam fiends backs out we push
white sacks out  
See this my traphouse I slam fiends backs out we push white sacks out, them
backs get pushed out  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'm scraping the bowl up, I'm whipping up cake mix  
But this ain't red velvet don't eat it, ya smoke it  
Your options are open, you even can snort it  
3 dollar sacks so you know you can score it, say you can't afford it  
Yo I can ignore it, well don't call them dope boys you know you feel boring  
You know that you feenin' you know that you need it, it's Gucci I'm greedy, my
niggas stay eating  
  
[Chorus x2]
