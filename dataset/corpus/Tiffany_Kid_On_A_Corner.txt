You keep me hanging like a kid on a corner  
Just because you think you can  
Don't be so certain that I'll always be there  
Just because I've always been  
People change  
And I've been changing  
Don't you notice after all this time?  
  
I'm not gonna be just another kid  
On a corner  
Hiding my heart  
Saving my love any longer  
I'm not gonna be just a kid  
On a corner  
  
You should know by now that  
Everything changes  
Even start fall from the sky  
So if your nights all seem a little  
Bit colder  
Just remember so do mine  
Once I tried  
Now I'm through trying  
You still don't know me after all this time  
  
I'm not gonna be just a kid on a corner  
Hiding my heart  
Saving my love any longer  
I'm going to be just another kid  
On a corner  
  
Looking down the street  
Out across the night  
It took some time to see
