I'm just a girl with my head screwed on  
I'm just a girl with a smoking gun  
I got my fingers stung, my fingers stung yeah  
I'm just a girl with my fingers stung  
Bless these bones, bless this skin  
All of me and the mess I'm in  
Yeah the mess I'm in but I don't care  
Don't know where I've been but I'll get me there  
I'm alive yeah yeah and it's alright  
I'm alive yeah yeah and it's alright  
Power to the meek and power to speak  
I got the power within me yeah yeah  
Power to the shine in my worn out shoes yeah  
Power to me, power to you  
Bless this head, bless this hair  
Bless me to the dirt in my fingernails yeah  
Bless this day bless this night  
Give me something good make me feel alright  
I'm alive yeah yeah and it's alright  
I'm alive yeah yeah and it's alright  
I'm alive yeah yeah and it's alright  
I'm alive yeah yeah and it's alright  
Power to the meek and power to speak  
I got the power within me  
I got my fingers stung, my fingers stung yeah  
I'm just a girl with my fingers stung  
Bless these bones, bless this skin  
All of me and the mess I'm in  
Yeah the mess I'm in but I don't care  
Don't know where I've been but I'll get me there
