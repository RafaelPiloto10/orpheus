How does the time slip by so fast  
Why can't it once stand still  
For us this night, will always last  
With every breath until  
And if you find you're all alone  
Remember you have wings  
As long as there is air to breathe  
And music left unsung  
You know that in the darkest night  
A dawn has just begun  
So think of us, we'll think of you  
Together we'll take flight  
For we shall never say goodbye  
We only say goodnight  
For we shall never say goodbye  
We only say goodnight
