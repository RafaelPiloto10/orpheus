Home again I turned my collar to the wind started home again  
Home again a place where I can find the friends that's home again  
Well I've seen everything that I wanted to see  
And I finally see what's important to me I'm going home I'm going home  
  
Home again I've been too long upon my way this way don't pay  
Home again too many names I can't recall it's coming home  
Well I've done everything I thought I wanted to do  
When each step I took took me far away from you I'm going home I'm going home  
  
Home again I can't extend by even time joys ain't crime  
Home again somehow I know there's time enough enough to love  
Well I've had everything that I thought I would need  
Now I'm going home I'm gonna try my hand of freedom  
I'm going home I'm going home I'm going home
