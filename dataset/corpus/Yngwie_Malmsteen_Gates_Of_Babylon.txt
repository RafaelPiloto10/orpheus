Look away from the sea  
I can take you anywhere  
Spend a vision with me  
A chase with the wind  
  
Move closer to me  
I can make you anyone  
I think you're ready to see  
The Gates to Babylon  
The power of what has been before  
Rises to trap you within  
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more  
A city of heavenly sin  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away  
Oh Gates of Babylon  
  
You can see but you're blind  
Someone turned the sun around  
But you can see in your mind  
The Gates of Babylon  
You're riding the endless caravan  
Bonded and sold as a slave  
A saber dance removing all the veils  
Getting as good as you gave  
A saber dance removing all the veils  
Getting as good as you gave  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away  
  
Look away from the sea  
I can take you anywhere  
Spend a vision with me  
A chase with the wind  
  
Move closer to me  
I can make you anyone  
I think you're ready to see  
The Gates of Babylon  
The power of what has been before  
Rises to trap you within  
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more  
A city of heavenly sin  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away  
Black Gates of Babylon  
The devil is me  
And I'm holding the key  
To the gates of sweet hell  
Babylon
