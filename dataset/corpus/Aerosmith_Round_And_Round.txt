If you believe in me  
Like I believe in you  
You wouldn't be tellin' me things  
That weren't exactly true  
  
Now everything changes  
Ain't got nothing to say  
I'm having the strangest feeling, baby  
I can't remember my name  
  
'Cause the life I've been livin'  
And the love I've been givin'  
Will be sure to send you spinnin'  
With your feet never touching the ground  
Goin' round n' round  
  
When it was one for all  
And it was all for one  
And everything that we did  
Never bothered anyone  
  
Now everything changes  
Ain't nothing the same  
I'm having the strangest feeling, baby  
I can't remember my name  
  
'Cause the life I've been livin'  
And the love I've been givin'  
Will be sure to send you spinnin'  
With your feet never touching the ground  
Goin' round n' round  
  
Can you remember the days  
When you were sweet sixteen  
And always followed the ways  
Of someone else's dream  
  
(Look here)  
Now everything changes  
Ain't nothing the same  
I'm having the strangest feeling, baby  
I can't remember my name  
  
Goin' round n' round n' round n' round...
