Does it matter if you're not sure  
You're never gonna see him anymore  
He's gone for good  
You might get mad at yourself  
You're doing your very best  
You can't do nothing else baby  
You've done the best you can  
There's been good times  
You know there have been reasons  
You still don't say you want somebody else  
You want somebody else  
I'm giving you just one more chance  
To recompense on my romance  
Can't believe there's been good times  
You know there have been reasons  
You still don't say you want somebody else  
You want somebody else  
  
I'm gonna stay with you baby  
Yes I will  
Stay with you baby  
Yes I will  
  
(Repeat)
