Be careful what you say,  
Loose talk could sink this ship  
Well the way that I am as weak as a lamb,  
See it on my shaky lip  
There's more to these actions,  
That you could ever know  
With the moon and the tide I'm drawn to your side  
And moving with the flow  
When it's time to choose and it's sink or swim,  
I know I'll drown this time  
When the cold wind blows and I'm falling in,  
Throw the line  
Now I'm swept,  
And I'm lost within my mind  
On a love that makes me blind  
And this feeling I just can't forget,  
Now I'm swept  
On a tide that's in my soul  
And this feeling that I have is losing me control  
And I hope it doesn't end just yet,  
Now I'm swept  
Mind over matter,  
No matter where this mind will be  
There's more to be said, oh, for games in the head  
Than anything you'll ever see  
There's safety in dreaming,  
So wrap me in things that I know  
With my head in the sand,  
I'm at your command  
And moving with the flow  
When it's time to choose and it's sink or swim,  
I know I'll drown this time  
When the cold wind blows and I'm falling in,  
Throw the line  
Now I'm swept,  
And I'm lost within my mind  
On a love that makes me blind  
And this feeling I just can't forget,  
Now I'm swept  
On a tide that's in my soul  
And this feeling that I have is losing me control  
And I hope it doesn't end just yet,  
Now I'm swept
