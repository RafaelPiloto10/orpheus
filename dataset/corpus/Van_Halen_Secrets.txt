She ain't waiting til she gets older,  
Her feet are making tracks in the winter snow,  
She got a rainbow that touches her shoulder,  
She be headed where the thunder rolls,  
Ah,ah,ah  
She got rhythm,  
Got that rhythm,of the road  
Ah,ah,ah  
She get crazy,  
Woman get crazy if she can't go  
Ah but ah,she just looking good.  
She comes like the secret wind  
She's as strong as the mountains,walks tall as a tree.  
She been there before,she'll never give in,  
She'll be gone tomorrow like the silent breeze.  
Ah,ah,ah  
She got rhythm,  
Got that rhythm,of the road  
Ah,ah,ah  
She get crazy,  
She get crazy if she can't go  
Ah but ah,she just looking good.  
You know how sometimes,you got to rush,  
You're running blind,but she jumps the gun.  
Question is,not does love exist,but when,she leaves,where she goes.  
I got a feeling she don't know either,  
Wait like the wind,watch where she blows.  
Oh,oh, got that rhythm,  
That sweet rhythm,of the road  
Oh,oh,oh she get crazy,  
Woman get crazy,if she can't go  
Oh,oh a looking good  
Ah yes!
