Goodnight, my love  
The tired old moon is descending  
Goodnight, my love  
My moment with you is now ending  
  
It was so heavenly  
Holding you close to me  
It will be heavenly  
To hold you again in a dream  
  
The stars above  
Have promised to meet us tomorrow  
Till then my love  
How dreary the new day will seem  
So for the present dear  
We'll have to part  
Sleep tight, my love  
Goodnight, my love  
Remember that you're mine, sweetheart  
  
Sleep tight, my love  
Goodnight, my love  
Remember that you're mine, sweetheart
