All of my days have been misspent  
Stuffing out the sofa and the antenna's bent  
Inside my heart's bustin' out at the seams  
I work for the impossible american dream  
  
I got a job at the grocery store  
A few bucks an hour and not much more  
The world comes in just to take things away  
They eat it all up and then they sleep into day  
  
I try not to care I would lose my mind  
Running 'round the same thing time after time  
Only two things bound to soothe my soul  
Cold beer and remote control  
  
Now once upon a time I was nobody's fool  
(once upon a fool)  
Two jobs and showing up for school  
I guess it comes apart so little by little  
You don't know your there till your stuck in the middle  
I try not to care I would lose my mind  
Running 'round the same thing time after time  
And only two things bound to soothe my soul  
Cold beer and remote control  
  
Sit down  
(sit down sit down)  
The room is dark  
(the room is dark)  
The blurry graffiti on the benches  
Across at the public park  
The plastic's black and buttoned  
(the plastic's black)  
The haze is blue  
(the haze is blue)  
And all I want is nothing to do  
  
'cause it's a long walk to the bus stop  
It's a long wait for the turning clock  
It's a two-tired car sitting up on the blocks  
And things I put aside like that pile of rocks  
  
I try not to care I would lose my mind  
Running 'round the same thing time after time  
And only two things bound to soothe my soul  
Cold beer and remote control  
  
Yes I try not to care I would lose my mind  
(all of my days have been misspent)  
Running round the same thing time after time  
(stuffing out the sofa and the antennas bent)  
And only two things bound to soothe my soul  
(inside my hearts busting out at the seams)  
Cold beer and remote control  
(i work for the impossible american dream)  
Yeah  
  
Cold beer and remote control  
(i said I guess it comes apart so little by little yeah)  
Yeah  
Beer and remote control  
(i said I guess it comes apart so little by little yeah)  
Yeah
