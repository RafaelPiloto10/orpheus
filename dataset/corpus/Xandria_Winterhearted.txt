I was a fool for what I thought was love  
And I tried my best to keep up what we had  
We had a vision, no, I had a vision  
And now I've to see that the vision is dead  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
And it's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me  
I was romantic, so silly and blind  
I told the world that true love had a name  
But all that is left now  
Is pity and shame  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
And it's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me
