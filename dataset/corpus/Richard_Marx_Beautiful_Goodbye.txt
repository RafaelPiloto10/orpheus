Baby don't you look so sad  
You know we have  
Something that should only ever make you smile  
It's not like it was something we were looking for  
We were sliding doors  
It's what it is it doesn't need to be defined  
No regrets, come to bed  
I'll set all your worries free  
Come with me, It's what you need  
Shut your mouth just let it be  
Just let it go and let it be  
Oh, Everything is meant to be a memory  
Oh, So one last time do anything you want with me  
  
And I promise I will leave you  
With a beautiful goodbye  
I won't lie but I'll apologize  
Cuz I'll never make a promise you know I won't keep  
I'll make love to you, I know you want it, too  
Whisper something sweet but no more questions please  
Drops of sweat, dripping wet  
The taste of you all over me  
You will see, It's what you need  
Shut your mouth just let it be  
Just let it... Be  
  
Oh, Everything is meant to be a memory  
Oh, So one last time do anything you want with me  
And I promise I will leave you  
With a beautiful goodbye  
  
Nothing good lasts forever... Nothing  
Oh Nothing lasts forever Nothing  
Nothing can last forever... Nothing  
Nothing lasts forever... Nothing  
  
Oh, Everything is meant to be a memory  
Oh, So one last time do anything you want with me  
And I promise I will leave you  
With a beautiful goodbye  
I won't lie but I'll apologize
