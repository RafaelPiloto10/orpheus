Everything's different  
But nothing has changed  
Are we going in circles  
It's Christmas again  
Can't you hear the sleigh bells right?  
All our voices unite  
And look up to the heavens  
See the stars shining bright  
Everybody needs a little lovin'  
Around Christmas time  
Somehow you got to know you're going to be all right  
Do you remember how it used to be  
Sitting under the Christmas tree?  
In your heart you'll  
Find the season  
We've been blessed by the children  
Black, yellow, and white  
They believe in the things  
We try to deny  
So throw down your weapons  
But continue the fight  
And let's love one another  
On this Holy night  
Everybody needs a little lovin'  
Around Christmas time  
Somehow you got to know you're gonna be all right  
Do you really remember how it used to be  
Sitting under the Christmas tree?  
In your heard you'll  
Find the season  
Oh, reach down inside your heart  
And see all the love  
Oh, in your heart you'll  
Find the reason  
Everybody needs a little lovin'  
Around Christmas time  
Somehow you got to know you're gonna be all right  
Do you really remember how it used to be  
Sitting under the Christmas tree?  
In your heart you'll  
Find the season
