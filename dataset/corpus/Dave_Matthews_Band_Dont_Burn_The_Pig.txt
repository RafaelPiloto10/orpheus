Don't burn the pig  
Throw it in the water again  
See if it float or sink  
Don't burn the pig  
  
What Will Become of Me?  
Disputed Between A Song And An Outro Of Jimi Thing  
I was falling always  
And now I'm falling this way  
What will become of me  
When I'm all far away  
  
I'm spinnning down  
I'm spinning up  
Upon this way  
Wondering what will become of me  
When I'm all far way  
  
I'm spinning down  
I'm all away  
A greater way  
  
What Will Become of Me?
