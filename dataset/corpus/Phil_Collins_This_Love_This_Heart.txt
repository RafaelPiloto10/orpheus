This love, this heart, these arms to hold  
So tight to you, I won't let go  
Can this be real, or just some dream that feels so true  
I wish you love, I wish you more  
You are all that I live for  
I'll never hurt you believe me  
My heart beats just for you  
It only beats for you  
  
I'll keep the fire alight for you  
Can't think of nothing else, what can I do  
This lonely heart of mine, it only beats for you  
It only beats for you  
  
You bring me peace, you make me smile  
You give me strength and all the while  
You ask for nothing, only love  
And my heart beats just for you  
It only beats for you  
  
I'd say all these things to you  
If you were here, but that's not gonna be  
Cos you 're not here at all  
There's only me  
But I won't stop trying  
  
I won't give up, I'll wait for you  
'Til you come back, it's all I can do  
I'll be right here, I'm going nowhere without you  
Give me the chance, just make the call  
Just say the words, I'm waiting for  
Just let this heart of mine show you  
It only beats for you  
  
Yes it only beats for you  
It only beats for you  
This love, this heart  
These arms, they're only for you  
This love, this heart  
These arms, they're only for you  
They're only for you
