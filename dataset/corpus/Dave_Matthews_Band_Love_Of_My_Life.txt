Where you are that's where I want to be  
And through your eyes are all the things I want to see  
In the night you are my dreams  
You're everything to me  
  
You're the love  
Of my life  
And the breath  
In my prayers  
Take my hand  
Lead me there  
What I need is you here  
  
I can't forget the taste of your mouth  
From your lips, the heavens pour out  
I can't forget when we are one  
You alone and I am free  
  
Everyday, every night  
You alone, are the love of my life  
  
Everyday, every night  
You, alone, are the love of my life  
  
We go dancing in the moonlight  
With the starlight in your eyes  
We go dancing 'til the sunlight  
You and me, we're gonna  
Dance, dance, dance
