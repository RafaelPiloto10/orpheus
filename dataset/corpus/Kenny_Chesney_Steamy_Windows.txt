Well I was thinkin' 'bout parking the other night  
We was out on a back road  
Me and my lady was just gettin' right  
All systems on overload  
Radio blasting in the front seat  
Turnin' out the music fine  
We were snuggled up in the back seat  
Makin' up for lost time  
  
Steamy windows  
Zero visiblity  
Steamy windows  
Comin' from the body heat  
  
You can wine and dine a lady all night  
With good intent  
But there's something about a rendezvous on a back road  
That gets mighty intense  
  
Steamy windows  
Ain't nobody can see  
Steamy windows  
Comin' from the body heat  
  
There's a sound outside the front door  
And I know it's just the wind  
But it makes us wanna snuggle just a little bit closer  
And it starts all over again  
  
Steamy windows  
Zero visiblity  
Steamy windows  
Comin' from the body heat  
  
Steamy windows  
Zero visiblity  
Steamy windows  
Comin' from the body heat  
Steamy windows...  
  
Steamy windows  
Comin' from the body heat  
  
Ain't nobody can see...
