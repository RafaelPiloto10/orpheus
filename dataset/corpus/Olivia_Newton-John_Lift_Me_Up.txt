When I'm down on my luck and I'm searching for my soul  
When I'm feeling too much and I start to lose control  
When I'm down so low that even enemies don't want to know  
You still care for me say a prayer for me and I know  
Ooo I like you hanging around  
Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Ooo you are my favourite sound  
Cause you're always down for  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't want to let you go  
When I'm lost along way and I can't face another day  
And if I stumble on the road and if I can't carry the load  
And if I lose my faith, and kindness, and generousity  
Would you hold my hand?  
Say you understand my pain  
Ooo I like you hanging around  
Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Ooo you are my favourite sound  
Cause you're always down for  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't want to let you go  
It's been a long hard road and it's only just begun my friend  
And this I know you helped me carry the load  
Cause you're always down for  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
Whell you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't want to let you go  
I don't want to let you go  
Cause you lift me up now  
Whell you're always around...  
You're my favourite sound  
Lift me up now  
You lift me up  
Lift me up now  
Yeah you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
Lift me up  
Ohh...Year...
