Well, there's two sides, to every situation  
Yes, there's two sides, two interpretations  
A laugh is a cry, hello means goodbye  
You're sayin' something baby, I don't wanna buy  
  
Well, there's two sides to every creation  
You and me babe, we're no revelation  
Well, there's darkness in our light, and there's wrong in our right  
There's sorry babe, I'm workin' late tonight  
  
Well, there's two sides, there's another side of me  
There's the one you think you live with, the one you never see  
It's never really lived, but it's never really died  
It's never really made it but it's tried  
  
Well, there's two sides to every conversation  
But with you babe, that's no consolation  
Silence is golden, let me put you on hold  
Danglin' on your love line, baby, it's growin' old  
  
Well, I don't know how to say it  
Cause I never thought I could  
God know I've tried so many times  
  
  
But there's two sides, there's another side of me  
There's the one you think you live with, the one you never see  
It's never really lived, but it's never really died  
It's never really made it, but it's tried  
  
To every creation  
We're no revelation  
One sees the wrong, and one sees the right  
The other side of me just caught a flight  
  
Goodbye
