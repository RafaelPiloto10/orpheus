I'll take you out of the wishin' well  
I thinkin' I have a plan  
Go with your bad self  
Why did you cheat yourself?  
You think you're losing  
China's not accusing  
You never gonna take a hit on the head  
Now if you don't care  
Take a ride somewhere  
  
Hey you got something  
You gotta try and buy our soul  
Hey you got something  
It goes round and round again  
Go, go, you should've never waste your lung  
Go, go, and the ride was shared  
Go limo, go limo  
  
I got you stuck in the habit trail  
You've grown to lovin' this shit  
Way out on a back shelf  
Yeah you don't know what you've done  
Look what you're doin'  
Now mama says it's ruined  
You've got a mollusk in the palm of your hand  
So it's a bad smell  
Your eyes wanna win  
  
Hey you got something  
You wanna try and buy our soul  
Hey you got something  
It goes round and round and round again  
Go, go, you're never having to waste your lung  
Go, go, and the ride was shared  
Go, go, whatever happened to Day-Glo Jones?  
Go, go, and the ride was shared  
Go limo, go limo
