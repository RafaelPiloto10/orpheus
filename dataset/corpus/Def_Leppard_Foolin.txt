Lady luck never smiles  
So lend your love to me awhile  
Do with me what you will  
Break the spell take your fill  
On and on we rode the storm  
The flame has died and the fire has gone  
Oh, this empty bed is a night alone  
I realized that long ago  
  
Is anybody out there, anybody there  
Does anybody wonder, anybody care  
  
Oh, I just gotta know  
If you're really there and you really care  
Cause baby I'm not  
  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
Won't you stay with me awhile  
  
Close your eyes don't run and hide  
Easy love is no easy ride  
Just wakin' up from what we had  
Could stop good love from going bad  
  
Is anybody out there, anybody there  
Does anybody wonder, anybody care  
  
Oh, I just gotta know  
If you're really there and you really care  
Cause baby I'm not  
  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
  
Oh, I just gotta know  
If you're really there and you really care  
'Cause baby I'm not  
  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
Not f-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
  
I'm not foolin' myself  
I'm not foolin' myself  
I'm not foolin' myself  
I'm not foolin' myself
