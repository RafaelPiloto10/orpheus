Lion Of Judah  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Messiah would come  
The earth would rejoice  
The people start to sing  
For they would behold  
As Scripture fortold  
A mighty King of Kings  
But He came as a child  
Not like they had planned  
Not like they had planned  
  
Lion of Judah  
Lamb of God  
Glorious Conqueror  
Suffering Son  
Lion of Judah  
With nails in His hands  
The Mighty Redeemer  
Was meek as a lamb  
  
No elegant robes  
No glorious throne  
No armies at His side  
Could this be the One?  
A carpenter's son?  
A man condemned to die?  
But a lion roared  
Deep inside thie Lamb  
Inside this Man  
  
Lion of Judah  
Lamb of God  
Glorious Conqueror  
Suffering Son  
Lion of Judah  
With nails in His hands  
The Mighty Redeemer  
Was meek as a lamb
