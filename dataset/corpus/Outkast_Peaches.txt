Yeah,  
That shit sho feel good  
Hey player, dis Peaches  
Coming back at ya one mo gen, wit a big whats up  
Break out your black low, and your booms phone  
As I send it out one more time  
For East Pointe, College Park, Decatur, and the swats!  
We got that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik for yo' trunk  
And it's fat like herringbone, and tight like nap booty  
So let me take you deep, straight to the point  
Cause it ain't nothing but King Shit, all day, everyday
