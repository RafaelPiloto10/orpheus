I do believe in fate cause that's how we met  
It was raining and we were soaking wet  
You took the last of cabs on an empty street  
Then you smiled at me and said 'take a seat... '  
  
I said do you believe in love at first sight?  
You said if you give me a reason I might  
Ok, well your hair is wet and your clothes are a mess  
And your makeup is all over your face...  
And still you're so...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Beautiful, so, sweet and just adorable  
You are a miracle, simply irresistible  
You are so beautiful, so, sweet and just adorable  
You are the finest thing that I've seen in my life  
You're everything that I've ever dreamed of  
  
Now it's been seven years 1 month and a day  
Since we met and I'm so happy to say  
Today we'll be man and wife and dedicate  
Our lives to the precious thing we have called love  
  
So now I'm standing here well dressed and prepared  
In a black suit that you told me to wear  
And when you're walking in, you amazing thing,  
You take my breath away...  
Cause you are so.....  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
For richer and poorer till death do us part  
In sickness, in health you are always in my heart  
Till the day when we're old and grey  
I will cherish and love you in every kind of way  
Cause you are so....  
  
[Chorus:]
