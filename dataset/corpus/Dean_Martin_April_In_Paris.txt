April in Paris, who can I run to?  
What have you done to my heart?  
  
April in Paris, chestnuts is blossom  
Holiday tables under the trees  
April in Paris, this is the feeling  
No one can ever reprise  
  
I'd never know the charm of spring  
Never met it face to face  
I never knew my heart could sing  
Never miss the warm embrace 'till  
  
April in Paris, who can I run to?  
What have you done to my heart  
  
I never knew the charm of spring  
Never met it face to face  
I never knew my heart could sing  
Never miss the warm embrace 'till  
  
April in Paris, who can I run to?  
What have you done to my heart  
My heart, my heart  
Cuore mio
