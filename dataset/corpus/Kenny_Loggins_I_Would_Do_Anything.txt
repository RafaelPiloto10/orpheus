Love, where are we going,  
And when do we reach the promise on the horizon,  
  
Out on the ocean, under a sunset,  
I was invited to come out and play a while  
with magic and move a mountain.  
  
Has anyone ever captured the sun,  
Is the eagle ever truly tame,  
Given just a little time,  
I know that you'll find a way.  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Give up the world I've made me  
And take you away,  
I swear from now on,  
The trust in my heart,  
The vision of you in my life  
  
My love,  
I will be faithful,  
but how can I make a promise  
to a place I've never been?  
  
Something has taken me off,  
and I don't know if I will survive.  
I believe that everything  
I'll ever need is here by the roadside.  
  
How can you fly,  
keeping heaven in sight,  
blinded by the light of day?  
  
Given just a little time,  
I know that I'll find a way  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Listen with all of my spirit,  
for ecstasy calling,  
You know I believe,  
Cause all I have seen,  
From the mountain,  
The view from the heart.  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Give up the world I've made me  
And take you away,  
I swear from here on,  
The trust in my god,  
The vision of you in my life  
  
Freedom is mine,  
One beat at a time,  
Where are we going,  
I just don't know yet,  
How will we make it,  
I just can't say,  
All that I know is that we've finally sailed away.  
  
Seems everyone's made a prison of love,  
But if anybody can escape,  
Given just a little time,  
I know that we'll find a way.  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Listen with all of my spirit,  
for ecstasy calling,  
You know I believe,  
Cause all I have seen,  
From the mountain,  
The view from the heart.  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Give up the world I've made me  
And take you away,  
I swear from here on,  
The trust in my god,  
The vision of you in my life  
  
In my arms, I'll pray  
I am safe, I am loved, I am free, baby  
I am safe, I am loved, I am free, baby  
I am safe, I am loved, I am free, baby  
I am safe, I am loved, I am free, baby
