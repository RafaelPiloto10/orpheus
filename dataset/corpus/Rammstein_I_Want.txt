I want to  
I want you to trust me  
I want you to believe me  
I want to feel your eyes  
I want to control every heartbeat  
I want to hear your voices  
I want to disturb the peace  
I want you to see me well  
I want you to understand me  
I want your fantasy  
I want your energy  
I want to see your hands  
I want to go down in applause  
Do you see me?  
Do you understand me?  
Do you feel me?  
Do you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
We hear you  
Can you see me?  
We see you  
Can you feel me?  
We feel you  
I don't understand you  
I want  
We want you to trust us  
We want you to believe everything from us  
We want to see your hands  
We want to go down in applause - yeah  
Can you hear me?  
We hear you  
Can you see me?  
We see you  
Can you feel me?  
We feel you  
I don't understand you  
Can you hear us?  
We hear you  
Can you see us?  
We see you  
Can you feel us?  
We feel you  
We don't understand you  
I want to
