Jealousy, night and day you torture me.  
I sometimes wonder if this spell that I'm under,  
Can only be a melody for I know no one but me,  
Has won your heart but when the music starts:  
My peace departs,  
From the moment they play that lovely strain  
And we surrender to all it's charm again.  
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy, mystery, pain.  
We dance to a tango of love.  
Your heart beats with mine as we sway.  
Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of:  
That soft word your cruel lips will never say.  
Well, I fear that the music will end,  
And shatter the spell it may lend.  
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive,  
It's only a tango you love.  
I fear that the music will end,  
And shatter the spell it may lend.  
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive,  
It's only a tango you love.  
It's only a tango that you love.
