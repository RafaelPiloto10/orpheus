Pop that pussy like you suppose to to  
Shack that ass like it - that's for Lou

Hoes get crunk for cheese, damn skippy  
Like the bar kays and pay the little whippy  
In they jazzy T's, bitches on they knees  
Tryna make a nigga pay they ass to see a breeze  
Hoes get crunk, for sho, for Gino  
Steal from the strill, these bitches is on the pole  
One on tope, but one down low  
Ask them hoes if bout to to take it to the floor, HA

This one for the thugs that ride them gold d's

Talkin bout they closed, you know how it goes  
Hit the club just to see ya little ass  
Every nigga in the club got cash  
Smokin weed, sippin hin, gettin drunk  
Pop that pussy and getta nigga crunk

You knew it all along, my pussy was hot  
Everytime you licked the cat, it was like a fuckin hot  
Now I can't getcha to leave me alone,

I thought you could fuck, but I had no luck  
Stupid ass nigga, you just fucked my day up

Spend some spend some (Come here)

Lets keep it real, lets keep it real, now here's the deal  
Some hoes be pussy poppin for a fuckin happy meal  
They phony, they direspect, they get neglect  
They all up on the stage, it the mitch match sets  
White top, pink drawers on, what in the fuck did they call you  
Need ta go to the drawin board, you don't get the free award  
What we like, juicy booty bitches, with the fat friends  
Fake hoes get off the stage, and let the real hoes represent  
  
Twurk sum, twurk sum (Come out)  
Twurk sum, twurk sum (Come out)  
Twurk sum, twurk sum (Come out)
