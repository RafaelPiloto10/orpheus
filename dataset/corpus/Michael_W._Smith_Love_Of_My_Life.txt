I am amazed  
When I look at you  
I see you smiling back at me  
It's like all my dreams come true  
  
I am afraid  
If I lost you girl  
I'd fall through the cracks  
And lose my track in this crazy lonely world  
  
Sometimes it's so hard to believe  
When the nights can be so long  
And faith gave me the strength  
And kept me holding on  
  
You are the love of my life  
And I'm so glad you found me  
You are the love of my life  
Baby put your arms around me  
I guess this is how it feels  
When you finally find something real  
My angel in the night  
You are my love  
The love of my life  
  
Now here you are  
With midnight closing in  
You take my hand as our shadows dance  
With moonlight on your skin  
  
I look in your eyes  
I'm lost inside your kiss  
I think if I'd never met you  
About all the things i'd missed  
  
Sometimes it's so hard to believe  
When a love can be so strong  
And faith gave me the strength  
And kept me holding on  
  
You are the love of my life  
And I'm so glad you found me  
You are the love of my life  
Baby put your arms around me  
I guess this is how it feels  
When you finally find something real  
My angel in the night  
You are my love  
The love of my life  
  
[Instrumental]  
You are the love of my life  
And I'm so glad you found me  
You are the love of my life  
Baby put your arms around me  
I guess this is how it feels  
When you finally find something real  
My angel in the night  
You are my love  
My angel in the night  
You are my love  
The love of my life
