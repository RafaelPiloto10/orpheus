(feat. Mack Maine)  
  
Young money mothafucka  
Uhh huh  
That's right  
Now don't you know  
Ima beast  
Eastside  
Up in tha beat  
  
[Verse:]  
Straight from the bottom of the cut  
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me  
One man with no weopon at war, but I'm an army  
My flow is capital attention lieutenant your penit pension  
And they demolished that invention  
You better get your dollars up  
And guess what, I was up  
I get my cheese like mickey mouse  
Or else you better donald duck  
Like a shooting range target  
I get all kinda bucks  
Be my shooting range target  
Nigga I got good luck  
Nigga bye bye good luck  
Got your momma shook up  
Lil bad ass nigga, who thought popeye wasn't tough  
I'm on that lala twist it up  
I'm on that syrup slow it down  
And I like four freeks too, and I aint young jock but its going down  
I buy that marijuana field, then I just smoke it down  
Big bad wolf yes I just blow it down  
No homo and to holly grove I will hold it down  
Like a circle of knives I got the sharpest flow around  
  
[Chorus:]  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know they can't fuck with me cuz I'm da center of tha world)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know they can't fuck with me cuz I'm da center of tha world)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Bitch I'm Mack Maine  
I got tha heart of a king, blood of a slave  
Feel like I been there before, my second time to the grave  
But its one life to live, that's why I'm gettin paid  
Off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised  
Spit like I need a raise  
Blaze as I gaze, at the stars and ask the lord  
Why the culprit at the pall pit  
It make me sick to my stomach  
That's why I rap, like a pregnant woman I don't spit I vomit  
So pay homage me and wayne two G's  
Like twenty hundreds  
And we keep the semi's blunted  
And we live like brothas from anotha  
So fuck with him and mack gonna react like you did me something  
That's a hint to you David  
Throwin shots at Goliath  
This the new testament, where the victor is tha giant  
So you should get your way and lose the hate  
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a females trait  
  
[Chorus:]  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know they can't fuck with me cuz I'm da center of tha world)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know)  
Future (I know they can't fuck with me cuz I'm da center of tha world)
