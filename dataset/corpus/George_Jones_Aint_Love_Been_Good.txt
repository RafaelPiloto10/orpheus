Ain't love been good to us, ain't it been good  
It's given us happiness and we're knockin' on wood  
We're livin' in sunshine like we knew that we could  
Ain't love been wonderful, oh, ain't it been good.  
  
We walk through life side by side  
We found the door to happiness open wide  
And folks who gather now right where we stand  
And love's been heaven here on earth in every ways.  
  
The world is troubled in many ways  
It seems the problem always are here to stay  
But we'll keep holdin' on till the very end  
And we'll get by no matter what shape the world is in.  
  
Ain't love been good to us, ain't it been good  
It's given us happiness and we're knockin' on wood  
We're livin' in sunshine like we knew that we could  
Ain't love been wonderful, oh, ain't it been good...
