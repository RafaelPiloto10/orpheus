Orange Blossom Special  
The Wabash Cannonball  
The Chattanooga Choo-Choo  
This hobo's seen 'em all  
I've watched the Sante Fe  
Lay her smoke against the sky  
And listen to old number three rollin'  
Through the night  
Ride the train, ride the train  
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains  
Sleepin' in a boxcar when it rains  
Ride the train, ride the train  
Southern Pacific  
The Overland Express  
And up ahead the coal cars of West  
Virginia's best  
And Oklahoma's Frisco  
The biggest one of all  
I've listened to the Silver Steed's  
Lonesome midnight call  
Ride the train, ride the train  
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains  
Sleepin' in a boxcar when it rains  
Ride the train, ride the train  
Ride the train  
Trains
