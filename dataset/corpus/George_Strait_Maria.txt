Ther'es a soft rain tappin' on your window  
There's a cool breeze blowin' off the bay  
And a warm flame dancin' with our shadows  
To music playin' far away  
I never meant to stay an hour  
I thought that I was passing through  
Another town along the highway  
I never meant to fall for you  
  
[Chorus]  
But I can't speak for you Maria  
I only know the way I feel  
When I sleep with you, Maria  
There's nothing left for dreams to steal  
  
On a Bible by the mirror  
The only treasures that we hold  
The only secrets that we're keepin'  
A watch, a chain, a cross of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the sunlight brings the mornin'  
I can't tell you what I'll do  
But I've a mind to take you with me  
And I've got heart to stay with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I sleep with you, Maria  
There's nothin' left for dreams to steal
