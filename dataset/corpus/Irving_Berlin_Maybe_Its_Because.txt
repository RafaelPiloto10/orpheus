Maybe it's because the kiss you gave me, touched my heart and went right
through.  
I can't tell you why, I only know that I fell helplessly in love with you.  
How I fell in love with you!  
I could say you're grand and therefore I care for you so.  
But there is a why and wherefore and I'd like to know.  
Maybe it's because the star I wished on, made a certain wish come true.  
Or it just should be that you were meant for me, and maybe I was meant for
you.  
Maybe it's because the song we danced to, told a story old and new.  
I can't figure out just why it came about.
