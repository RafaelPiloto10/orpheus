I don't think you notice  
When you see my face  
I guess you're waiting  
To spin me around again  
  
Wheels I guess are turning  
Somewhere inside my head  
I know that this is  
Deeper than you get  
  
But you're coming back again  
You don't mean to waste my time  
But you're coming back so  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't tell me  
How to be  
'Cause I like some suffering  
Don't ask me  
What I need  
I'm just fine  
Here finding me  
Me  
  
I've already given  
Up on getting through  
I never question  
Who I'm talking to  
  
Oh so much for nothing  
But nothing means so much  
I know it's touching  
But I've been out of touch  
  
And it's all that I can do  
I'm a sight for my sore eyes  
But it's all I am so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't think you notice  
When I can't reach out  
I guess you're waiting  
On somebody else again  
  
Oh so much for talking  
It's all been said before  
I'm hearing something  
But I wish you'd just say more  
  
But you're going off again  
When I try to just hold on  
But you're going off so  
  
[Chorus]
