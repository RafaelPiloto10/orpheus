If I had the world to make a day for you  
I'd fill each hour with praises and shower you  
If I held the sun inside my hands  
I'd shine it bright inside your heart  
  
And I'd turn my praise and focus to the thought of you  
And stand you there  
A statue in my soul forever  
  
I dreamed I saw you dancing and I joined you there  
And spun we did in the moon's warm light  
  
Know I dreamed that they take away everything that you held close and
sorrowful for  
I will love you like no man can and we will dance at the ide of love  
I'll take the moon I'll take the sun from the starry sky  
And decorate your nights with light and shadow like no other can, bright  
  
I will dream of stealing you from all the things that bother and hurt you  
You my love and only love alone  
  
If I could make another day for you  
And shadows taken all of you, and shadows taken all of you  
And I can see my heart beat louder and my face grow warm  
Each time you stand by me my only love, ray on me  
  
So if you your man and family do remember this the time we only caught short
view  
Of each other while in some it shine  
I will rake in each day and sell it to you  
And sell it to you and sell it to you my love  
  
No captain but you my love  
No king but you
