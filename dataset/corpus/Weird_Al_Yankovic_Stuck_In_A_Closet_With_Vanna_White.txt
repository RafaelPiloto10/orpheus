Doctor, every night I have the strangest dreams  
Doctor, listen to me, tell me what this means  
First I'm goin' shoppin' in my underwear  
Then all of sudden I'm floating in mid air  
My lips fall off and everybody starts to stare  
Donuts and hot dogs are flying everywhere  
  
Now Doctor, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet  
Next comes the part that I won't ever forget  
Now I'm bein' followed by these Russian spies  
They give me some velcro, and an order of fries  
Suddenly I'm bowling on the Starship Enterprise  
I fall down a hole and that's when I realize  
  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Night after night after night after night  
  
All right!  
  
Doctor, won't you tell me, am I going insane  
Was it something I ate or something wrong with my brain  
See, I'm naked in church when I meet a dinosaur  
Try to run, but my feet have been nailed to the floor  
Then a midget pushes me through a revolving door  
And I'm back in the very same place I was before  
  
Now I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Night after night after night after night  
  
And I can't bust out and I can't break free  
And it's gettin' just a little too stuffy here for me  
And I can't go home and I can't get loose  
And I try to escape but it's just no use  
  
And I can't ever leave and I can't ever win  
And we're runnin' outta air and the walls are closin' in  
And I can't go back and I can't get through  
But Vanna since you're here, why don't you let me buy a vowel from you  
  
Come on Vanna, come on!  
  
Ow, buhhh  
  
Doctor, all those crazy dreams have started again  
That's right, I even wake up screaming now and then  
See, I'm coming home from work but I forgot my address  
I'm half an hour late for my algebra test  
Then some slimy alien jumps out of my chest  
And I'm falling and falling and I guess you know the rest  
  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Night after night after night after night  
  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
N-n-n-night after night after night night night  
  
Then I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White (ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya, ya, ya-ya)  
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White  
Night after night after night after night  
  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White (ya-ya ya-ya ya-ya ya-ya)  
I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White
