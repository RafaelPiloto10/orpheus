When I am down, and, oh, my soul, so weary  
When troubles come, and my heart burdened be  
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence  
Until you come and sit awhile with me  
  
[Chorus]  
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains  
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas  
I am strong when I am on your shoulders  
You raise me up to more than I can be  
  
There is no life, no life without it's hunger  
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly  
But then you come, and I am filled with wonder  
Sometimes I think I glimpse eternity  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
  
You raise me up to more than I can be
