Time, sometimes the time just slips away  
And you're left with yesterday  
Left with the memories  
I, I'll always think of you and smile  
And be happy for the time I had you with me  
Though we go our separate ways  
I won't forget so don't forget  
The memories we made  
  
Please remember  
Please remember  
When I was there for you  
And you were there for me  
Please remember  
Our time together  
When time was yours and mine  
And we were wild and free  
Please remember please remember me  
  
Good-bye, there's just no sadder word to say  
And it's sad to walk away  
With just the memories  
Who's to know what might have been  
We leave behind a life and time  
We'll never know again  
  
Please remember  
Please remember  
When I was there for you  
And you were there for me  
And remember please remember me  
  
Please remember  
Please remember  
When I was there for you  
And you were there for me  
Please remember  
Our time together  
When time was yours and mine  
And we were wild and free  
Then remember please remember me  
  
And how we laughed  
And how we smiled  
And how this world was yours and mine  
And how no dream was out of reach  
I stood by you, you stood by me  
We took each day and made it shine  
We wrote our names across the sky  
We ran so fast we ran so free  
And I had you and you had me  
Please remember
