It's in the silences, the words you never say  
I see it in your eyes, always starts the same way  
It seems like everyone we know is breaking up  
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything I am  
I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware  
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are  
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?  
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything that I am  
Oh, there are no guarantees  
That's what you always say to me  
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch  
But what I'm trying to say to you  
I've never said to anyone  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything I am  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything I am  
You're everything I am  
With everything I am
