You're still the lady of my dreams  
You're still my high school beauty queen  
To me it's still magic when we touch  
And I have never loved you so much  
  
As right now  
As right now  
You're still my actress on the screen  
Still the leading lady in my scenes  
  
To me it's still magic when we touch  
And I've still never loved someone so much  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
  
You're still the one I'm with when I'm alone  
And you're still the lover calling on my phone  
To me it's still magic when we touch  
And I will never love someone so much  
  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now
