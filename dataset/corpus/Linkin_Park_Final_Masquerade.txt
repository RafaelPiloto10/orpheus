Tearing me apart with words you wouldn't say  
Suddenly tomorrow's moment washed away  
'Cause I don't have a reason  
And you don't have the time  
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find  
  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever but then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
  
The final masquerade  
  
All I've ever wanted, the secrets that you keep  
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak  
'Cause I can't see forgiveness,  
And you can't see the crime  
And we both keep on waiting for what we left behind  
  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever  
But then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
  
The final masquerade  
The final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over,  
The scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever  
But then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
