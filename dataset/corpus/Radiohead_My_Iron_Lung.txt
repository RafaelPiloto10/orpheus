Faith your driving me away  
You do it everyday  
You don't mean it but it hurts like hell  
  
My brain says I'm receiving pain  
A lack of oxygen from my life support  
My iron lung  
  
Were too young to fall asleep  
Too cynical to speak  
We are loosing it, can't you tell?  
  
We scratch our eternal itch  
Our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our  
Iron lung  
  
Suck suck your teenage thumb  
Toilet trained and dumb  
When the power runs out we'll just hum  
  
This this is our new song  
Just like the last one  
A total w.a.s.t.e. of time  
My Iron lung  
  
If you're frightened  
You can be frightened  
You can be, it's okay [Repeat: x 2]
