The revolution's over baby  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby  
The revolution's over baby now  
  
Reelin' and Quakin'  
Bringin' home the bacon!  
We're all getting taken for a ride  
  
Kiss your mama goodbye  
Time to let it all fly  
Don't get caught  
With your fingers in the pie  
  
The revolution's over baby  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby  
The revolution's over baby now  
  
Time to start a new one  
Different than the old one  
Something that they've never seen before  
  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby now
