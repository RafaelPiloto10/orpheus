Here I stand with head in hand  
I turn my face to the wall  
If she's gone I can't go on  
Feeling two foot small  
Everywhere people stare  
Each and every day  
I can hear them laugh at me  
And I hear them say  
  
Hey you've got to hide your love away !  
Hey you've got to hide your love away !  
  
How can I even try ?  
'cause I can never win  
Seeing them hearing them  
In the state I'm in  
How could she say to me "Love will find a way" ?  
Gather 'round all you clowns  
Let me hear you say  
  
Hey you've got to hide your love away !  
Hey you've got to hide your love away !
