(duet with The Orb)  
Written by The Bee Gees  
  
I started a joke,  
Which started the whole world crying,  
But I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no.  
  
I started to cry,  
Which started the whole world laughing,  
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.  
  
I looked at the skies,  
Running my hands over my eyes,  
And I fell out of bed,  
Hurting my head from things that I'd said.  
  
Til I finally died,  
Which started the whole world living,  
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.  
  
I looked at the skies,  
Running my hands over my eyes,  
And I fell out of bed,  
Hurting my head from things that I'd said.  
  
'Til I finally died,  
Which started the whole world living,
