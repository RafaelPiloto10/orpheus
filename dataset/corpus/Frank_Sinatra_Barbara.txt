Where there is sunrise, there is Barbara, only Barbara clothes that way,  
Where there is laughter, there is Barbara, always Barbara warm and gay.  
And when there's music, she is the song, the song I'm singing my whole life
long.  
There's no one just like her, like Barbara, only Barbara is so rare.  
Wherever she is, I'll be there.  
There's no one just like her, like Barbara, only Barbara, she's so rare,  
Wherever she is, I'll be there.
