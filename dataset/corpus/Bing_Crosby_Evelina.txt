Evelina, won't ya ever take a shine to that moon?  
Evelina, ain't ya bothered by the bobolink's tune?  
Tell me, tell me how long  
Ya gonna keep delayin'the day.  
Don't ya reckon it's wrong  
Trifflin' with April this way?  
Evelina, won't ya pay a little mind to me soon?  
Wake up! wake up!  
The earth is fair, the fruit is fine  
But what's the use o' smellin' winter water melon  
Clingin' to another fella's vine?  
Evelina, won't ya roll off that vine an' be mine?
