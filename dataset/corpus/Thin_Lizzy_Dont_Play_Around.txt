He stuck that knife right into her gut  
I want to tell you she was lucky with what she got  
But what she got was not enough  
She played around  
  
Don't play around  
I tried to tell her he was not so dumb  
I tried to warn her there was something wrong  
She wouldn't listen, she continued on  
She played around  
  
If you give your love to someone and someone treats you bad  
If you give your love to someone and someone makes you mad  
If you give your love to someone it can be so sad  
  
Don't play around  
Don't play around  
  
He left her dying in the pool of blood  
And she was crying oh my god oh my god  
But she was no good, she was no good  
She played around  
  
Don't play around  
She'd be laughing and dancing the night away  
She'd be laughing and dancing with every man that came away  
But as her life's blood slipped away  
I thought i heard her say  
Don't play around  
Don't play around
