Glamorous  
Indie rock'n'roll is what I want  
It's in my soul, it's what I need  
Indie rock'n'roll, it's time  
Two of us  
Flipping through a thrift store magazine  
She plays the drums, I'm on tambourine  
Bet your bottom dollar on me  
  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
It's all I need  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
  
In a clutch  
I'm talking every word for all the boys  
Electric girls with worn down toys  
Make it up, break it up, what do you care  
Oh what do you care?  
  
I take my twist with a shout  
A coffee shop with a cause, then I'll freak you out  
No sex, no drugs, no rock, no roll  
  
When it comes today  
  
Stay if you wanna love me, stay  
Oh don't be shy, let's cause a scene  
Like lovers do on silver screens  
Let's make it yeah, we'll cause a scene  
  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
It's all I need  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
  
In a clutch  
I'm talking every word for all the boys  
It's all I need  
Make it up, break it up, what do you care  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
  
Two of us, flipping through a thrift store magazine  
It's all I need  
Makin' up, breakin' up, what do you care?  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me...
