Dear baby, baby  
Won't you  
I go crazy, crazy  
For you  
Won't you tell me, tell me  
What to do  
I go crazy, crazy  
For you  
  
Cause the way you look at me  
I can say you set me free  
And no matter what you say  
I won't go away  
I won't go away  
  
I see your world, the world is you  
I see baby, baby blue  
Everyday is a day to get through  
Till I see baby, baby blue  
  
And the way you look at me  
I can say you set me free  
And no matter what you say  
I won't go away  
I won't go away  
  
And it takes  
Such a long time to get through this  
Such a long time to find this kiss  
And I can't forget it  
I'm not ready yet  
  
And I came such a long way  
From where you are  
Now I'm falling from this star  
And I can't forget it  
I'm not ready yet  
  
Cause the way you look at me  
I can say you set me free  
And no matter what you say  
I won't go away  
I won't go away  
  
Heal me, baby, baby won't you  
I go crazy, crazy  
For you  
Won't you tell me, tell me  
Something new  
I am crazy, crazy  
For you  
I am crazy, crazy  
For you  
I am crazy,  
Crazy for you
