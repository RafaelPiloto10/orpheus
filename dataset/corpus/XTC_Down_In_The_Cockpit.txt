Man acting like a farmer and,  
He's treated the woman like a poor cow,  
We got to treat you better from now,  
But man is just a baby and,  
He's needing your milk of kindness.  
I vow to drink as much as you will allow.  
  
All the way through history,  
Man, machine, no mystery,  
All the way through history,  
Girl have the brain to act like the weaker sex.  
  
Down in the cockpit,  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it,  
Down in the cockpit,  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it.  
  
Queen wants the castle,  
Back from the rascal,  
Queen wants the castle.  
  
The girl tribe are growing up and,  
Filling the world full with a new soul,  
To get so far they payed a high toll.  
Try not to make,  
The same mistakes,  
As man has done, or you'll fall in that hole,  
And you will see us changing our role.  
  
All the way through history,  
Man, machine, no mystery,  
All the way through history,  
Girl have the brain to act like the weaker sex.  
  
Down in the cockpit,  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it,  
Down in the cockpit,  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it.  
  
Queen wants the castle,  
Back from the rascal,  
Queen wants the castle.
