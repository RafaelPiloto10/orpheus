I messed around as a little boy  
I grew up, made the blade my new toy  
Friends said boy with what you screwin' around I said  
Don't concern yourselves and just  
Gimme another blast  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt  
Take it away, don't want no more  
Even if you say just one more  
I won't leave you alone, oh  
I grew up, went into rehab  
  
You know the doctors never did me no good  
They said son you're gonna be a new man  
I said thank you very much and  
Can I borrow fifty bucks?  
Yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah  
  
Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt  
Take it away, don't want no more  
Even if you say just one more  
I won't leave you alone  
  
'Cause I'm goin' down the steps on a white line  
Goin' down the steps on a white line  
Goin' down the steps on a white line  
Goin' down the steps on a white line  
Straight to nowhere

I grew up, made the blade my new toy  
Friends said boy with what you fuckin' around I said

Yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah  
  
Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt  
Take it away, don't want no more, no more  
Even if you say just one more  
I won't leave you alone  
  
'Cause I'm goin' down the steps on a white line  
Goin' down the steps on a white line  
Goin' down the steps on a white line  
Goin' down the steps on a white line  
Straight to nowhere
