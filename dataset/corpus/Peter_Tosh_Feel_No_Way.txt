Nobody feel no way  
It's coming close to payday I say  
Nobody feel no way  
Everyman get paid a quota's work this day  
CHORUS (2x)  
Can I plant peas and reap rice  
Can I plant cocoa and reap yam  
Can I plant turnip and reap tomato  
Can I plant breadfruit and reap potato  
CHORUS  
Can I tell lie and hear truth  
Can I live bad and love good  
Can I deliver and get down  
Can I give a dollar and want a pound  
CHORUS  
Can I be wrong and get right?  
Can I be kicked and don't fight?  
Can I drink water and get drunk?  
Can I drink whiskey and stay sober?
