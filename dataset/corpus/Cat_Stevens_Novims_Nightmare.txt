Once I had a dream, that worried me  
Like a drunken guillotine  
Lingering just above my head  
Why, why, why, why?  
Why was I born "The Nine"  
Cursed repeatedly  
Who would know if I should die.  
  
No one needed me  
Doo doo doo doo doo  
Dark and empty was the place to which I'd come  
Cold and silent was the house my name was on  
Nine rooms and a tomb in every one  
  
S'dark and empty was the place to which I'd come  
All at once my bones began to change  
I was tall and young again,  
Sweet as rain falling on the snow  
Who, who, who, who?  
Who is he, who am I, and  
What laid in between?  
  
How can I say goodbye? No one let me in  
Can't see no need for Nine no more  
Now it's too late to open the door.
