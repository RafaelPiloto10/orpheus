Somebody keep my balance  
I think I'm falling off  
Into a state of regression  
The expiration date  
Rapidly coming up  
It's leaving me behind to rank  
Always move forward  
Going "straight" will get you nowhere  
There is no progress  
Evolution killed it all  
I found my place in nowhere  
I'm taking one step sideways  
Leading with my crutch  
Got a fucked up equilibrium  
Count down from nine to five  
Hooray! We're gonna die!  
Blessed into our extinction
