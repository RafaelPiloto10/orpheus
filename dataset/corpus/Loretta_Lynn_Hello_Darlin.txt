Hello darlin' nice to see you it's been a long time  
You're just as handsome as you used to be  
How's your new love are you happy hope you're doin' fine  
Just to know it means so much to me  
What's that darlin' how'm I doing I'm doing all right  
Except I can't sleep and I cry all night till dawn  
What I'm trying to say is I love you and miss you  
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong  
Look up darlin' let me kiss you just for old time sake  
Let me hold you in my arms one more time  
Thank you darlin' may God bless you and may each step you take  
Bring you closer to the things you seek to find  
Goodbye darlin' gotta go now gotta try to find a way  
To lose these mem'ries of a love so warm and true  
And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me  
Come back darlin' I'll be waiting for you
