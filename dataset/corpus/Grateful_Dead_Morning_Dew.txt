Walk me out in the morning dew my honey,  
Walk me out in the morning dew today.  
I can't walk you out in the morning dew my honey,  
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today.  
  
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning,  
I thought I heard a baby cry this today.  
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning,  
You didn't hear no baby cry today.  
  
Where have all the people gone my honey,  
Where have all the people gone today.  
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people,  
You never see those people anyway.  
  
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning,  
I thought I heard a young man mourn today.  
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning,  
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today.  
  
Walk me out in the morning dew my honey,  
Walk me out in the morning dew today.  
I'll walk you out in the morning dew my honey,  
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway,  
  
I guess it doesn't matter anyway,  
I guess it doesn't matter anyway,  
I guess it doesn't matter anyway,  
Guess it doesn't matter anyway.
