Sitting in some hotel room  
Some place far away  
Saw a shop light screaming Christmas  
Bought your present there today  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
I'll be home on Christmas day  
I am just a thought away  
And every Christmas tree  
Reminds me where I'd rather be  
  
The drunken Santa on the corner  
Looks a little blue  
But the twinkle in his eye dear  
Looks a little like you  
  
Chorus:  
I'll be home on Christmas day  
I am just a thought away  
And every Christmas tree  
Reminds me where I'd rather be  
Home on Christmas day  
I am just a thought away  
But anywhere I'll be  
You will always be Christmas to me  
  
Something about this season  
Makes me feel a little queer  
Everybody's so dam jolly  
I wish you were here  
  
Chorus:  
I'll be home on Christmas day  
I am just a thought away  
And every Christmas tree  
Reminds me where I'd rather be  
Home on Christmas day  
I am just a thought away  
But anywhere I'll be  
You will always be Christmas to me
