Something in me, dark and sticky  
All the time it's getting strong  
No way of dealing with this feeling  
I can't go on like this too long  
  
[Repeat x2]  
This time you've gone too far  
This time you've gone too far  
This time you've gone too far,  
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you  
  
Don't talk back, just drive the car  
Shut your mouth, I know what you are  
Don't say nothing, keep your hands on the wheel  
Don't turn around, this is for real  
  
Digging in the dirt  
Stay with me I need support  
I'm digging in the dirt  
Find the places I got hurt  
Open up the places I got hurt  
  
The more I look, the more I find  
As I close on in, I get so blind  
I feel it in my head, I feel it in my toes  
I feel it in my sex, that's the place it goes  
  
[Repeat x2]  
This time you've gone too far  
This time you've gone too far  
This time you've gone too far,  
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you  
  
Don't talk back, just drive the car  
Shut your mouth, I know what you are  
Don't say nothing, keep your hands on the wheel  
Don't turn around, this is for real  
  
Digging in the dirt  
Stay with me I need support  
I'm digging in the dirt  
Find the places I got hurt  
Open up the places I got hurt  
  
Digging in the dirt  
Stay with me I need support  
I'm digging in the dirt  
Find the places I got hurt  
Open up the places I got hurt  
I got hurt  
  
Digging in the dirt, to find the places we got hurt  
Digging in the dirt, to find the places we got hurt  
Digging in the dirt, to find the places we got hurt  
Digging in the dirt, to find the places we got hurt
