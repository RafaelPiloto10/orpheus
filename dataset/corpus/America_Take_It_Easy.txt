Well, I'm running down the road  
Tryin' to loosen my load  
I've got seven women on  
My mind,  
Four that wanna own me,  
Two that wanna stone me,  
One says she's a friend of mine  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own wheels  
Drive you crazy  
Lighten up while you still can  
Don't even try to understand  
Just find a place to make your stand  
And take it easy  
Well, I'm a standing on a corner  
In winslow, arizona  
And such a fine sight to see  
It's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed  
Ford slowin' down to take a look at me  
Come on, baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is  
Gonna save me  
We may lose and we may win though  
We will never be here again  
So open up, I'm climbin' in,  
So take it easy  
Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen  
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind  
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my  
Cover, she's so hard to find  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own  
Wheels make you crazy  
Come on baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is  
Gonna save me, oh oh oh  
Oh we got it easy  
We oughta take it easy
