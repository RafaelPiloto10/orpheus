Can you hear the song moving on the wind  
Calling us home, drawing us in  
It's a wave of love that's melting all resistance  
Can you feel it, when it starts  
It's within the reach of our hearts  
It'll change the world around us if we listen  
It's the living, breathing message  
Of the mercy of our god  
  
(chorus)  
The song is alive  
Stirring hope in the soul, don't you know  
It's the heartbeat of life  
Moving us with a love  
That's never ever ever gonna die  
The song is alive  
  
It's pushing down walls, driving out doubt  
No power on earth's gonna drown it out  
And in the middle of the night his voice will lead us  
And the music plays on  
When we start to sing the song  
No nothing's gonna stop the faithful love of jesus  
It's the living, breathing message  
Of the mercy of our god  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Welling up in us, a love beyond compare  
Spilling from the lips of the believers everywhere  
  
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know  
The song is alive  
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
It's pushing down walls, it's driving out doubt  
Don't you know
