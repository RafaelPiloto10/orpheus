The lord look down from heaven  
On the children of man  
To see if there is anyone  
Who will understand  
Do you speak of righteousness  
With the violence of your hand  
Judgment will return, my friend  
To give justice to the land  
  
Mmmm mmmmmm  
Mmmm mmmmmm  
  
The vales are up on me  
I surrender myself  
I pray that you would see  
That all that is said  
Wake up my glory  
Wake my guitar  
Play me a song of mercy  
Cause the world is going too far  
  
Mmmm mmmmmm  
Mmmm mmmmmm  
  
Why should my livity  
Judged by a another man  
Why would I listen  
To the voices understand  
By the fruits of no tree  
I know who you are  
  
[Repeat x4  
Mmmm mmmmmm  
  
The lord look down from heaven

Do you speak of righteousness  
With the violence of your hand  
Judgment will return my friend  
To give justice to the land  
  
[Repeat x8]  
Mmmm mmmmmm
