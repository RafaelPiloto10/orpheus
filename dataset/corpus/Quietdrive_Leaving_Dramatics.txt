It's been holidays since I've said how I feel  
Until yesterday found my whole life was new  
I can finally see that I love you that I miss you  
That I need you certainly  
But now my essence is spinning spinning away  
  
Chorus  
And I can't keep chasing your memory  
Around and around and around and around in my head  
Waiting for you to make up your mind  
I've felt this way before and  
You seem like you know what you're doing to me  
And you never could make the simple words feel right  
  
My whole life around the way you give yourself  
I've been safe and sound in my own selfish void  
But I've finally found that I hate you I dispise you  
Please don't give it away today  
But now my essence is spinning spinning away  
  
Chorus  
  
And I'll take my time  
Put your lips to mine  
You'll never grow cold  
From fear again  
But you'll grieve the day  
That I won't stay  
And then you'll realize (Then you'll realize)  
That what we had  
Was exactly what you were looking for  
  
Chorus
