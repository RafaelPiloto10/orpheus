If never I met you  
I'd never have seen you cry  
If not for our first "Hello"  
We'd never have to say goodbye  
  
If never I held you  
My feeling's would never show  
It's time I start walkin'  
But there's so much you'll never know  
  
I keep telling you hard luck woman  
You ain't a hard luck woman  
  
Rags, the sailor's only daughter  
A child of the water  
Too proud to be a queen  
  
Rags, I really love ya  
I can't forget about ya  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
Before I go let me kiss you  
And wipe the tears from your eyes  
I don't want to hurt you, girl  
You know I could never lie  
  
I keep telling you hard luck woman  
You ain't a hard luck woman  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
Rags, the sailor's only daughter  
A child of the water  
Too proud to be a queen  
  
Rags, I really love ya  
I can't forget about ya  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
Oh yeah, bye bye, so long, don't cry  
I'm just packin' my bags, whoa, leavin' you  
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, baby, don't cry  
I gotta keep on movin', yeah movin'  
Bye, bye my baby  
Ooh, don't cry, lady, oh
