I don't even care  
No more  
That's my word  
That's for sure  
I don't even cry  
No more  
That's absurd  
I'm so cured  
  
I'm so secure  
With who I is,  
Oops, who I am  
And I'm a champion  
For sure boy  
I'm a champ  
Oh, yes I am  
  
But what  
I thought about  
When those people  
Put me down  
They can laugh  
For now  
But watch it  
When I turn  
This thing around  
I know, I believe  
Ain't nobody gonna do  
It but me  
I'm fly, no lie  
I'm the truth  
Baby ask me why  
  
I'm a champion  
I'm a champion  
  
What you say  
Don't stick  
I'm the best  
And I know it  
I know you tried  
To bring me down  
Look at me now  
Watch my smile  
  
I'm so secure  
With who I am  
And I'm a champion  
For sure  
I'm a champ  
Oh, yes I am  
  
But what  
I thought about  
When those people  
Put me down  
They can laugh for now  
But watch it  
When I turn  
This thing around  
I know, I believe  
Ain't nobody gonna do  
It but me  
I'm fly, no lie  
I'm the truth  
Baby ask me why  
  
I'm a champion  
I'm a champion  
  
Keep your head up  
They hatin'  
Cause you  
Majored in minor  
Gonna celebrate  
Like you won  
The finals  
Hold your trophy up  
In your parade  
In your honor  
And pour some champagne  
And put your glass  
To the sky  
'Cause you a champion  
You're a champion  
  
I'm a champion  
I'm a champion
