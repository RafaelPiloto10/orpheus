How can I be sure you're telling me the truth  
In this house of games you never you show your cards  
You claim madness it's become convenient  
I don't wanna hear your angry words again  
  
You hear voices taunting you to leave me  
Then you're sorry you hold me in your arms  
You have demons, nothing can control them  
Who can blame you if you're not in charge  
  
Is this love, I think not  
I wanna get off this merry-go-round  
History will repeat itself  
And I won't let you take me down  
  
Treat me like a curse then tell me I'm your savior  
I'm living with the stranger I used to know so well  
Waiting for your answer is a kind of torture  
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?  
  
You hear voices taunting you to leave me  
Then you're sorry you hold me in your arms  
You have demons, nothing can control them  
Who can blame you if you're not in charge  
  
Is this life, I think not  
I wanna get off this merry-go-round  
History will complete itself  
And I won't let you break me down  
  
I'd like to get to know you  
You could warm up your hands on my heart  
I've got so much to show you  
But for now it's just Bon D' Accord
