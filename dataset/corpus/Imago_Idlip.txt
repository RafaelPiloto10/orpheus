Neither awake or asleep  
Dwell somewhere in between  
Neither someone or something  
Be it life alone  
I walk it like a park  
Half real, half fancy  
  
A million tonight  
A million to fight  
A million to light  
A million is right  
  
Chorus:  
  
Yonder wails on my sleeve  
In the arms of make-believe  
Sleep will set you free  
In the arms of make-believe  
In the arms that let me be  
  
Abide by a dreamer's flight  
Cheater misfit on high  
Alone in the landscapes  
Periwinkle skies  
A worried pretender passes me by  
  
A million tonight  
A million to light  
A million to fight
