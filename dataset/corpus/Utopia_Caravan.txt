Moses went into the desert  
Moses came back with the law  
Jesus went into the desert  
God only knows what he saw  
Hitch up your ass and your camel  
Fill up your skin at the well  
Roll up your tent, whisper your prayers  
Are you ready to ride through hell  
Caravan moving through the night  
sleeping in the light of day  
Caravan spinning through the void  
on our way to anywhere  
Caravan time is just a joke change is all we  
understand  
Caravan life is a mirage,  
only a mirage dancing on the desert sand  
How I recall all the mountains  
How I remember the farm  
Oh how I miss the big city  
With a pretty girl on my arm  
Sell my best friend for some water  
Cut off my leg for some shade  
Sunburn these thoughts from my memory  
If I live I will be remade  
The sand is like a razor  
Slashing at my face  
Everyone's in panic but you can't see any place  
It's a sand storm, taken by surprise  
Hide beneath your wrappings and cover up your eyes  
Well I lost my kit and camel  
Maybe I will die  
Feel so lost and helpless and I think I'm gonna cry  
It's a sand storm, nothing you can do  
No one knows if it will last  
No one knows if you will make it through  
It's been so long without water  
Vultures are filling the air  
Where is that bloody oasis  
Must be around here somewhere  
Time for some strong meditation  
Time for the ultimate change  
Time to make peace with your maker  
Everything has been prearranged
