"We are gathered here tonight,  
to lay to rest Abigail LaFey,  
whom we now know  
was first born dead  
on The 7th Day of July 1777.  
Abigail must be nailed to her coffin  
with 7 silver spikes,  
1 through each arm, hand and knee,  
and let the last of the 7 be drawn through  
her mouth  
so that she may never rise and cause evil again  
Who will be the first?"  
"I O'Brian of the Black Horsemen."
