I went down to the meat rack tavern  
And found myself a big ol' healthy girl  
Now she was drinkin' alone  
Aw what a waste of sin  
So I went on over to sweet talk that girl  
Lord I moved on in  
Lord I whispered come on and move with me  
Move with me move with me move with me darlin'  
Aw don't be shy  
I'm gonna mess witcha, mess witcha, mess witcha,  
Mess witcha, mess witcha mind  
  
Well, I don't care if you tell me you're married  
Cause I can be your man when your husband ain't home  
Now if he should walk in you just tell him I'm your houseboy  
And that you just can't stand to sleep here alone...no more  
  
I want to move with you, move with you, move with you,  
Move with you darlin'  
I want to mess witcha mess witcha mess witcha  
Mess witcha mind  
  
Well now he finally walked in  
And Lord that man filled up the doorway  
Well he grabbed me by my throat  
And he bounced me down the stairs  
And Lord I swear, he broke every bone in my body  
But it was worth every second that I was there  
Cause she would whisper to me...  
  
Move with me, move with me, move with me,  
Move with me darlin'  
I'm gonna mess witcha, mess witcha, mess witcha,  
Mess witcha mind  
  
Well now I
