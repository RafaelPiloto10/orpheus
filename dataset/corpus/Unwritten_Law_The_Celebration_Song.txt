Ease Up a Little bit  
'Cause I want to want you  
If all of the moneys spent  
Well that's fine to got you  
  
By my side, let's go for a long ride  
In my car I'll drive you to my star  
Out in space won't matter where we are  
  
A celebration, about time  
A generation out of line, yea  
The revolution's in everyone  
Blame the gun  
  
Ease up a little bit  
'Cause I have to have you  
Drink up a little bit  
If your mine I'll find you
