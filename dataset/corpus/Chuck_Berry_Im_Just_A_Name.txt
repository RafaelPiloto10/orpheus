Hello, I'm just a fan who had to call you on the phone  
Someone you won't remember of the many that you own  
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone  
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown  
I know I'm only someone else in love with you in vain  
I wish I could have helped myself, but love is so much pain  
It makes me feel that there is still a chance that may remain  
That you will someday surely come and give me love again  
I knew your love would never be as deep as mine for you  
And I knew that these many nights I'd be alone and blue  
And lie awake while you forsake the only love I knew  
And never learn that you'll return and we would live it through  
Each time I dream a dream, I dream we're cuddled arm in arm  
It seems you're looking straight at me, when I see you perform  
Sometimes I think you see my face become so shy and warm  
I often wonder if you know the power in your charms  
Please, let me say I still love you before you hang the phone  
And I am proud to once have shared the beauty that you own  
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone  
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown
