I can't sleep, ain't no sleep a'coming  
I'm just lying here thinking 'bout you  
I'm in deep, falling deep into the picture  
In my mind of everything we're gonna do  
  
Over at the lake and down by the river  
You can feel it start to rise  
Wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are  
'Cause I need you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together  
With your feet up on the dashboard now  
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound  
But when you say my name in the middle of the day,  
I swear I see the stars come out  
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind,  
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down  
  
I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time  
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile  
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi  
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin' like these wheels in my head
tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The only place that I wanna be is where you are  
'Cause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far  
  
It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together  
All I really want is more than this moment right now  
'Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day,  
I swear I see the stars come out  
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes  
Oh I swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go
down  
  
I swear it's like you're waiting on the sun to go down  
Waiting on the sun to go down  
Hey, yeah oh, I'm loving thinking 'bout you  
I can't sleep, I'm just lying here thinkin' 'bout you
