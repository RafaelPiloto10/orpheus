When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.  
And in my hour of darkness  
She is standing right in front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be.  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.  
  
And when the broken hearted people  
Living in the world agree,  
There will be an answer, let it be.  
And though they may be parted there is  
Still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be,  
Let it be, let it be.  
Yeah there will be an answer, let it be.  
  
Let it be, let it be,  
Let it be, let it be.  
Yeah there will be an answer, let it be.  
  
And though the night is cloudy,  
There is still a light that shines on me,  
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.  
O, will I make up to the sound of music  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be,  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be,  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
