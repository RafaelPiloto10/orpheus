Lay your head down just for now  
Space fills your mind  
And you dream a while  
The sun floods your room as you drown  
Your lungs full of breathing  
Your true love, believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
One more time to say  
I love you always  
And keeping faith  
Letting love find a way  
  
You've let the stars suck you in  
Hold tight the night's air and breathe again  
Let go and be burnt by the moon  
Your hands full of feeling  
Your true love, believe  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
I love you to death  
Could you love me to death?  
I love you to death  
Could you love me?  
Could you love me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One more time to say  
I love you always  
And keeping faith  
Letting love find a way  
Letting love find a way  
Letting love find a way  
Letting love...
