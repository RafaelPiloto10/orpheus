You paint a rainbow of emotion  
You are the rhythm...life is the dance... yeah  
You are the queen of many faces  
How you can move me with just one glance  
I don't stand a chance  
  
All the things I love about you  
Keeps amazing me now  
All the things I love about you  
  
You're a garden of many hidden secrets  
Leaving clues to the mysteries you will reveal  
You are the eyes of intuition  
You see through illusion... you know what's real  
Just something you feel  
  
All of the things I love about you  
Ten thousand dreams you make come true  
Devil and angel, lover melted into one...  
  
All the things I love about you  
Keeps amazing me now  
All the things I love about you

Changing colors with the moon...  
Keep amazing me I never get enough  
  
You twist the truth still your're sincere  
To get your way you'll shed a tear  
Don't need a reason when you're beautiful...

Then thousand dreams you make come true  
Devil and angel, lover melted into one...  
My whole world revolves around you  
Changing colors with the moon.
