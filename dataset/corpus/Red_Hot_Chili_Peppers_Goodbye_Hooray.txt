Wooh, wooh, ha  
  
Junior paints that old cafe  
He's gotta chase those girls around  
Westbound drunk with lots to say  
But he never makes a sound  
  
Hustlers get what they deserve  
But it's always half the game  
Good things come to those who wait  
Like an expiration date  
  
See you around, I'll see you around  
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight  
I'll lead all your mind games astray  
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around  
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight  
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray  
Oh oh  
  
Curb your tongue oh scallywag,  
Because you got no flag to wave  
Save your breath for the black and white  
Every dog will have its day  
  
See you around, I'll see you around  
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight  
I'll lead all your mind games astray  
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around,  
Well, I'll play all night, hey get on top  
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray  
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around  
  
Aw yeah  
Aw yeah  
Aw yeah  
  
I'll see you around, I'll see you around  
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight  
I'll lead all your mind games astray  
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around  
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight  
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray  
  
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around  
I'll see you around, I'll see you around  
I'll see you around  
Goodbye and hooray  
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around  
Oh no no no no
