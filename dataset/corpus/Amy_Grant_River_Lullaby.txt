Hush now, my baby  
Be still love, don't cry.  
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream.  
Sleep and remember  
my lullaby.  
And I'll be with you when you dream.  
  
Drift on a river  
that flows through my arms.  
Drift as I'm singing to you.  
I see you smiling  
so peaceful and calm.  
And holding you, I'm smiling too.  
Here in my arms  
safe from all harm.  
Holding you, I'm smiling too.  
  
Hush now, my baby  
Be still love, don't cry.  
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream.  
Sleep and remember this river lullaby.  
And I'll be with you when you dream.  
I'll be with you when you dream.
