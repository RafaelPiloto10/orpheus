Gitchy goomy, gitchy gaddy, sit you laddie down on your daddy's knee,  
And ain't it a nice place to be?  
Goggin noggin, papa's rockin' like a mockin' bird in a windy tree,  
And that ain't no place for me.  
Been there one time, been there two times,  
Been there three times more than I care to be,  
But we're gonna make it through, Gitchy Goomy.  
Life is good, life is fine, life is warm,  
Life is kind, can you see it?  
Love is great, love is right,  
Keeps you warm late at night when you need it.  
Baby boy, daddy's joy, life's a toy,  
But you don't want to break it.  
Like a sweet symphony, all you need is the key, you can play it.  
Gitchy goomy, gitchy gaddy, sit you laddie down while I have my say,  
Now don't be runnin' away.  
Goggin noggin, papa's talkin'  
Don't go walkin' off like you mean to play,  
Well, you can have it your way.  
Been there one time, been there two times,  
Been there three times more than I care to say,  
But you're gonna be O.K. Gitchy Goomy.  
Life is good, life is fine, life is warm,  
Life is kind, can you see it?  
Love is great, love is right,  
Keeps you warm late at night when you need it.  
Baby boy, daddy's joy, life's a toy,  
But you don't want to break it.  
Like a sweet symphony, all you need is the key, you can play it.  
Been there one time, been there two times,  
Been there three times more than I care to be,  
Seen it one time, seen it two times,  
Seen it three times, Lord 'n' it's plain to see.  
Ah, you gonna make it through Gitchy Goomy.  
You 'n' me gonna make it through Gitchy Goomy.  
Ah, you gonna make it through Gitchy Goomy.
