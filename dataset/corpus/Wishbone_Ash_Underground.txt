Underground,  
They want us to go underground.  
Underground,  
They want us to go underground.  
You've got the right,  
You've got the right to say what you think  
You've got to fight,  
Cause they're leading us to the brink.  
  
Fireball,  
There's going to be a fireball.  
Fireball,  
There's going to e a fireball.  
Never a time,  
Never a time like this before.  
There won't be a sign,  
There was never a time like this before.  
  
Oh, oh, oh oh [Repeat: x4]  
Underground,  
They want us to go underground.  
Underground,  
They want us to go underground.  
Throw down a line,  
You've got the right to stay alive.  
You've got to fight,  
You've got to fight to survive.
