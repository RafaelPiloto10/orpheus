I sing just to know that I'm alive  
I play just to feel that I'll survive  
And if there's a second place  
Where ?????????? just the case  
I sing just to know that I'm alive  
Sugoose, Yeah Sugoose, Sugoose, Yeah Sugoose, Sugoose, Yeah Sugoose  
Well the mountains they won't move no they don't  
And the people they won't dance and they won't  
I sing, I sing, I sing, I sing,  
I sing just to know that I'm alive.
