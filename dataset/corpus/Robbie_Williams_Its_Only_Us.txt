And they want us to grow up  
We don't want to get a job  
We all need a decent rock  
Where it's all kicking off  
  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
You don't need to call it off  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
It's only us  
  
We just stopped for cheaper thrills  
Since the price went up on pills  
From Stoke-on-Trent to Beverley hills  
  
We know it's all kicking off  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
You don't need to call it off  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
It's only us  
It's only us  
  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
You don't need to call it off  
Baby it's alright baby it's alright  
It's only us  
It's only us
