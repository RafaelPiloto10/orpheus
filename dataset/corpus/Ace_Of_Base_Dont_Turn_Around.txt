If you want to leave  
I won't beg you to stay  
And if you gotta go darling  
Maybe it's better that way  
I'm gonna be strong  
I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
Just walk out that door  
Yea see if I care  
Go on and go now but  
  
Don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart  
That you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
I won't miss your arms around me  
Holding me tight  
If you ever think about me  
Just know that I'll be alright  
I'm gonna be strong  
I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
I know I'll survive  
Sure I'll make it through  
And I'll even learn to live without you  
  
Don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart  
That you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
  
I wish I could scream out loud  
That I love you  
I wish I could say to you  
Don't go  
  
As he walks away he feels the pain  
Getting strong  
People in your life they don't know what's  
Going on  
Too proud to turn around he's gone  
  
Don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart  
That you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know
