Today I read in a book that some are meant to live forever  
There's also a nightmare where our dying has no end  
If I let my will surrender and my flesh be crucified  
In his name my sins will be sublime  
Forever is a long long time  
It's said love is a gift that's given if we're true believers  
Just make your body and your soul his receivers  
In this world those golden rules  
May seem like they're made for fools  
Puppets on a string that blessing can bring  
Forever is a long long time  
Forever is a long long time  
But now the wine has turned sour after all these years of fighting  
So many wars but still his kingdom is not striking  
Pray for your enemy  
And love without agony  
Always ready for day to come  
Forever is a long long time  
Forever is a long time
