Doomed from the start  
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist  
It all kicked off, I had no choice  
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find  
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long  
Open your eyes and what do you see?  
No more laughs, no more photographs  
  
Turning slowly, looking back, see  
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed  
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to  
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again  
Running wild  
Giving it everyone, now that's all done  
  
Cause we burnt out, that's what you do  
When you have everything, it can't be true  
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long  
Open you're eyes and what do you see?  
The last stand, let go of my hand  
  
Turning slowly, looking back, see  
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed  
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to  
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again  
You go your way and I'll go my way  
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us  
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to  
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
