Time's gonna come  
You'll want me back someday  
Time's gonna come  
Want me, want me back someday  
But you are evil woman  
You don't mean me no good at anyway  
You was blind to me, baby  
I give you all I can  
You was blind to me, baby  
But still I give you all, all I had  
But you, b-b-but you are evil woman  
I'm a strong man  
You caused me so much trouble  
I don't wanna see your face no more  
You caused me so much trouble  
Don't wanna see your, your face no more  
'Cause you are the evil woman  
Don't want you hangin' 'round my door
