You're the ruler of your destiny  
Can I talk to you about a thing or two?  
It's not right that you're feeling blue  
Never ever let them get to you  
You know I've been right there where you are now  
It's all right, I'll show you how  
You can be, you can be what you wanna be  
You're the ruler of your destiny  
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
It won't take too long before you know  
There's no other way to go  
Then straight to the top of the world  
Straight to the top of the world  
It's there, in your heart  
Don't let anyone tear it apart  
You can be, you can be what you wanna be  
You're the ruler of your destiny  
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
Don't let go, there's someone here  
To see you through  
There's someone here for you  
Someone here for you  
You're the ruler of your destiny  
You can be what you want to be  
It's your life and you got the key  
Wake up, wake up, wake up now  
Gotta learn that you're in control  
Of your body, of your soul  
What matters at the end of the day  
Is if you make it shine  
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
Why don't you let your soul shine?
