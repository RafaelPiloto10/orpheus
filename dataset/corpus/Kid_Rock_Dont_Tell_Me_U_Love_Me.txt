From hard luck tricks  
To trust fund freaks  
Bathroom stalls to penthouse suites  
  
I been around  
I been around  
  
From the bottom of the barrel  
To the cream of the crop  
  
They've picked me up  
And I've watched 'em drop  
  
I been around  
I been around  
  
I sang 'em all a song or two  
About simple things  
Still I feel I'm bein' used  
Ain't a damn thing changed  
  
I'm an outlaw  
Bad Leroy Brown  
The only Cool Hand Luke left in this town  
I get my lovin' on the run  
  
I'm a low down  
Mister fly by night  
Baby slow down  
Let me show you right  
I sure don't wanna hurt no one  
  
So, don't tell me you love me  
Don't tell me you love, love me do  
Don't tell me you love me  
'Cause love's one thing that I cannot do  
And it's the only thing that I can't give to you  
  
From Hollywood hoes to backstage jive  
Jacked up trucks and Gulf Stream 5's  
I been around  
I been around  
  
From silly little girls who play them games  
To the rich and famous  
I won't say no names  
I been around  
I been around  
  
You gotta touch the stove to learn they say  
Get burnt and learn that way  
You better keep your feelings at bay  
Or honey you gonna pay  
  
I'm an outlaw  
Bad Leroy Brown  
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town  
I get my lovin' on the run  
  
I'm a low down  
Mister fly by night  
Baby slow down  
I'ma fuck you right  
I sure don't wanna hurt no one  
  
So, don't tell me you love me  
Don't tell me you love, love me do  
Don't tell me you love me  
'Cause love's one thing that I cannot do  
And it's the only thing that I can't give to you  
  
So, don't tell me you love me
