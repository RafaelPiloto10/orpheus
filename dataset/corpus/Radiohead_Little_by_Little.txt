Turn to nasty now  
The dark cell  
The pillar of my soul  
The last one out of the box  
The one who broke this spell  
  
Little by little by hook or by crook  
I'm such a tease  
And you're such a flirt  
Once you've been hurt  
You've been around enough  
  
Little by little by hook or by crook  
Never get earnest  
Never get judged  
I'm no idiot  
I should look  
  
Your clue on hold, snapped up  
Crawling with my love  
The last one out of the box  
The one that broke the seal  
  
Obligation  
Complication  
Routines and schedules  
Drug and kill you  
Kill you  
  
Little by little by hook or by crook  
Never get nervous  
Never get judged  
I'm no idiot  
I should look  
  
Little by little by hook or by crook  
I'm such a tease  
And you're such a flirt
