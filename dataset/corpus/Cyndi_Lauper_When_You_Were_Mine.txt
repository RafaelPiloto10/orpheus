When you were mine  
I gave you all of my money  
Time after time  
You done me wrong  
Just like a train  
Let all my friends come over and eat  
You were so strange  
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets  
Oh when you were mine  
I use to let you wear all my clothes  
You were so fine  
Maybe that's the reason that it hurt me so  
  
I know, that you're goin' with another guy  
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie  
I love you more mine than I did when you were mine  
  
When you were mine  
You were kindasorta my best friend  
So I was blind  
I let you fool around  
I never cared  
I never was the kind to make a fuss  
When he was there  
Sleepin' in between the two of us  
  
I know, that you're goin with another guy  
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie  
I love you more than I did when you were mine  
  
When you were mine  
You were all I ever wanted to do  
Now I spend my time  
Following him whenever he's with you  
I know that you're goin' with another guy  
I don't care because I love you baby that's no lie, ah  
I love you more than I did when you were mine  
  
Ah I love you more than I did when you were mine  
Ah oh oh whoa I love you more than I did when you were mine  
Ah oh oh whoa I love you more, I love you more when you were mine  
Ah ah oh oh oh I love you more, I love your more, I love you more, I love you
more  
  
I love you more than when you were mine  
  
Ah oh oh
