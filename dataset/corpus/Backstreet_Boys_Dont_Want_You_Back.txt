You hit me faster than a shark attack  
You saw my picture  
On the Backstreet's Back, alright  
And you were more than just a pretty face  
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed baby  
But I should have known that I would be  
Another victim of your sexuality  
But now we're done and over with  
I don't want you back  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't want you back  
'Cause you're no good for me  
I know  
That's all I can say  
Don't want you back  
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go  
I don't want you back  
  
You started going out with so-called friends  
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense  
But there were things that made me realize  
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why  
  
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I  
Don't want you back  
That's all I know  
Don't want you back  
All I can say  
Don't want you back  
You know you gotta go  
  
[Chorus]
