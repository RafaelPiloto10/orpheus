I don't know where I'm going  
But I do know where I've been  
I wonder if I'm growing  
Forever chasing wind  
I've got to keep on moving  
Destination still unknown  
The more I keep on looking  
The more I feel so alone  
  
Chorus:  
I never ask you where you're going, so don't ask me  
Where are you going?  
Not everybody knows where they're supposed to be  
Where are you going?  
So if you'll please point me in the right vicinity  
Where are you going?  
I never ask you where you're going, so don't ask me  
  
I'm not so good so far  
Fell off the beaten track  
'cause sometimes we go forward  
Must take two steps back  
  
Chorus  
(solo)  
Chorus
