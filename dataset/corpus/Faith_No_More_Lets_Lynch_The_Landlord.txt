The landlord's here to visit  
They're blasting disco down below  
says, "I'm doubling the rent  
'cause the buildings condemned  
You're gonna help me buy City Hall"  
  
But we can, you know we can  
We can, you know we can  
Let's lynch the landlord man  
  
I tell them turn on the water  
I tell them turn on the heat  
Tells me "All you ever do is complain"  
Then they search the place when I'm not here  
  
But we can, you know we can  
Let's lynch the landlord  
Let's lynch the landlord  
Let's lynch the landlord man  
  
There's rats chewin' up the kitchen  
Roaches up to my knees  
Turn the oven on, it smells like Dachau  
Til' the rain pours through the ceiling  
  
But we can, you know we can  
Let's lynch the landlord man
