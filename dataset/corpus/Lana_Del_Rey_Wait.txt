Wait a little longer, kid  
What you grow up so fast for?  
Why you're doing like I did?  
Didn't you say I got what I asked for  
But you're afraid to find out  
Wake me and climb out  
But you're always close to me  
You got a different story  
It's the same damn thing  
Got a long way, rest your feet  
I know you can do anything  
  
You are such a handsome boy  
Don't you give up your glory  
Why you wanna hit them streets?  
Didn't you ever hear my story?  
And it's fine to waste time  
But you've gotta beautiful mind  
And you're always close to me  
You're a different kid but it's the same damn thing  
And it's a long way, you better rest your feet  
I know that you want everything  
  
That's what you told me  
I still believe you  
I still see it's true  
I need you and I know you dear  
But if you've gotta make it then  
I can take it from here  
  
Wait a little longer, kid  
Didn't I never say I would miss you?  
Don't go until I come home  
Please don't go until I kiss you  
And it's hard to grow up  
But we all know it's tough  
Yea you're always close to me  
You'll have a different story,  
It's the same damn thing  
You got a long, come on and rest your feet  
I know you can do anything
