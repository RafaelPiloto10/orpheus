Let me paint you a picture or two  
Just tellin' ya what I'd like to do  
I'll get a 12-pack and sit on the beach  
And look at all the hookers that I'll never meet  
They're sayin'  
Look at me  
Look at me now  
Look at me  
Look at me  
  
Maybe I'll bleach my hair or grow it out long  
I'll buy a surfboard and lay out all day long  
Well I'm the mammoth for you to nurture  
And I just want you to think you'll be screwin' a surfer  
Loot at me  
Look at me  
Look at me  
Look at me
