I heard the knock on my door  
I heard the ring of the bell  
I got the letter but I couldn't go  
So many thoughts in my head  
So many places to be  
So many faces that I long to see  
Standing in front of me tonight  
The lights will take me where I long to be  
Just like a thousand nights before  
Somebody said to me  
Why do you do this to you  
Why sit back and relax  
Go to the islands and forget it all  
  
Slow down, you're moving too fast  
You seem afraid it won't last  
Take my advice, go straight and settle down  
Thank you for caring, but tonight the lights will take me where I long to be  
Just like a thousand nights before  
I can't explain, it gives me something  
  
Give me the lights, precious lights  
Give me lights  
Give me my hope, give me my energy  
You can turn the wrong into right  
Precious lights  
Illuminate me, carry me away  
Carry me, carry me
