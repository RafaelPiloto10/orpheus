Ask me no questions and I'll tell you  
I'll tell you no lies  
When all is said and done  
Does it really matter who's wrong or right  
Don't ask me for a reason, I can't explain  
Why we hurt one another again and again  
As I lie bleeding here I still  
I still reach for you  
  
A thousand days  
Have passed away  
A thousand days  
Were captured in her eyes  
  
Your eyes are open now but you know  
It's still hard to see inside  
When action and intention  
Are two separate things  
Now I somehow wish I could explain  
Why we hurt each other again and again  
Like someone on his dying breath  
I still reach for you  
  
A thousand days  
Have passed away  
A thousand days  
Were captured in her eyes  
  
Forever we've been  
Trapped by our hearts  
Trapped by our minds  
I'd like to leave  
I'd like to win at love  
  
But I just can't let it go  
And I just can't watch it slipping away  
And I just can't let it go  
And I just can't stand another minute  
  
Maybe now someday our shattered live  
Will mend themselves again  
But now a million miles away  
I still wish I could  
And though I somehow know, I can't explain  
Why we hurt one another again and again  
Like someone on his dying breath  
I still reach for you
