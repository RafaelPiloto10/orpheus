Well by now you know I'm insatiable  
"Cause when you step to leave I want a full repeat, yeah  
It's a miracle, you were right inside my head  
If the feeling's nice, why not do it twice?  
It is not against the law, no baby  
I slave all through the week  
And I need my release  
I work hard so when I stop  
I gotta get a little satisfaction for me  
Hit it again  
Don't care if I'm late  
The world just has to wait  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
Hit it again  
I loved it the first time  
Sent chills up through my spine  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
Deep emotion ain't got nothing to do with it  
And being in love ain't really got a thing to do with it  
I hope you understand  
But I can't worry if you don't, oh no  
If I can't double up  
It's like I didn't get enough  
Call me greedy if you want, just do it  
But it's something that will never change  
I don't get no complaints  
They know it when they ring my bell  
That this could be a thing that could take a little while, well, well  
Hit it again  
Don't care if I'm late  
The world just has to wait  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
Hit it again  
I loved it the first time  
Sent chills up through my spine  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
I declare the point to be  
Once is not enough for me  
Two time lovin' makes me smile  
One time love just ain't my style  
Repeat the love and I have found  
More the second time around  
It builds me up I love to love  
And if I can't hit it again  
It ain't natural  
Hit it again  
Don't care if I'm late  
The world just has to wait  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
Hit it again  
I loved it the first time  
Sent chills up through my spine  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby
