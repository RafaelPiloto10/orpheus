When the light comes and yu're feelin' down  
'Cause your baby's out there somewhere runnin' round.  
Don't start feeling blue and feeling lonely too,  
It's hard I know when that love ain't true.  
  
You just can't explain, but you know it's there,  
That empty feeling seems so unfair.  
What can you do when it's gone, it's gone,  
'Cause those lovin' feelings seem to hurt so long.  
  
So if you feel like cryin', go ahead and cry,  
A heartbreak will cool as time goes by.  
And it's so hard baby, it's so hard to take.  
It's so hard baby, it's so hard to take.  
  
Well you work so long every day and night,  
Tryin' every thing that seems so right.  
But when a love falls a heart must break,  
And it's so hard baby, it's so hard to take.
