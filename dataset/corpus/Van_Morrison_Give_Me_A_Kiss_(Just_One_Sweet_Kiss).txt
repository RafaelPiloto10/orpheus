Baby just one sweet kiss,  
Honey from your sweet lips  
Baby just one sweet kiss,  
Honey from your sweet lips  
That's all i want, that's all i need  
I'm satisfied  
  
Baby just one of your smiles  
You know makes it all worthwhile  
Baby just one of your smiles  
You know makes it all worthwhile  
  
We could go walking down the lane  
Together hand in hand  
But if you think  
That it's gonna rain  
We'll stay at home  
And listen to the band  
  
Baby just one sweet kiss  
Honey from your sweet lips  
Baby just one of your smiles  
You know makes it all worthwhile  
That's all i want, that's all i need  
I'm satisfied.
