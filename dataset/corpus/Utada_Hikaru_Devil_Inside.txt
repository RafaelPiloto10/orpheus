Everybody wants me to be their angel  
Everybody wants something they can cradle  
  
They don't know I burn  
They don't know I burn  
They don't know I burn  
  
Maybe there's a devil (or something like it) inside of me  
Devil (or something like it) inside  
Maybe there's a devil somewhere really deep inside me  
Devil inside of me  
Jealous angel deep inside me  
  
You don't know 'cause you're too busy reading labels  
You're missing all the action underneath my table  
I'm waiting for my turn  
Waiting for my turn  
Just waiting for my turn  
Just waiting for my turn  
  
Maybe there's a devil (or something like it) inside of me  
Devil (or something like it) inside  
Maybe there's a devil somewhere really deep inside me  
Devil inside of me  
Jealous angel deep inside me  
  
Time to make it burn  
This is how I burn  
  
Maybe there's a devil (or something like it) inside of me  
Devil (or something like it) inside  
Maybe there's a devil somewhere really deep inside me  
Devil inside of me  
Jealous angel deep inside me
