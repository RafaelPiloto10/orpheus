Appeal to the governor of Louisiana  
You may get an answer the process is slow  
Federal government too much to help him  
It's been nearly five years  
And they won't let him go  
  
[Chorus]  
Tyler is guilty the white judge has said so  
What right do we have to say it's not so  
Tyler is guilty the white judge has said so  
What right do we have to say it's not so  
  
Testify under pressure, a racist jury  
Government lawyers its all for show  
With rows of white faces  
False accusations  
He's framed up for murder  
They won't let him go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Police gun was planted  
No matching bullets  
No prints on the handle, no proof to show  
But Tyler is guilty the white judge has said so  
They show him no mercy  
They won't let him go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Appeal to the governor of Louisiana  
You may get an answer the process is slow  
Federal government too much to help him  
It's been nearly five years  
And they won't let him go  
  
[Chorus]
