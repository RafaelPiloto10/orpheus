I'm just a face in the crowd  
You probably don't know me as I don't stand out  
And I'm sure your heart doesn't beat for me, no  
  
And when you're cold and lonely there are not my arms  
You long to feel around you to keep you safe and warm  
No I'm just a face in the crowd you can't see  
  
Save a little love for me  
Save a little love for me yeah  
Save a little love for me yeah yeah  
And I will save my love for you  
My face in the crowd  
  
Don't know your name, don't know mine  
Yet I'm wearing all initials round this heart of mine  
I don't need no proof to know that you are there, yeah  
  
Hey, my heart is strong and my wings are wide  
I'm true to all my colors and I wear them all with pride  
I am your face, the face in the crowd  
  
So save a little love for me  
Save a little love for me yeah  
Save a little love for me yeah yeah  
Cause I'll save my love for you  
My face in the crowd  
  
In the twilight sometimes we meet  
Just before we wake or as we fall asleep  
I still can't see your face and I know you can't see mine  
But I can feel your heart beat, you can hear my voice  
You touch my soul and my soul touches yours  
  
We make a promise somewhere down the line  
Somewhere down the line  
  
So save a little love for me  
Save a little love for me yeah  
Save a little love for me yeah yeah  
And I'll save my love for you  
All my love, my love  
My face in the crowd  
  
Don't know the color of your skin but I felt the love that lies within  
I'm sure, I know without a doubt I'll find your face in the crowd  
I'll never let this feeling slide no world can put my faith aside  
I'm sure, I know without a doubt I'll find your face in the crowd
