Just when I had the money to spend  
And I was always thinkin' it would never end  
Then the time came, to the end of the game  
Don't you know?  
  
And just when the sky got shiny and bright  
There never seemed to be an end of the light  
But then the clouds came, it started to rain  
Don't you know?  
  
Just when it was goin'  
Just when it was goin' so good  
Just when it...  
Just when it was goin' so good  
  
Just when the highway straightend out for a mile  
An' I was thinkin' I just cruise for a while  
A fork in the road brought a new episode  
Don't you know?  
  
Just when it,  
Just when it was goin' so good  
Just when it was goin'  
Just when it was goin' so good  
  
But baby don't you worry  
I said baby don't you cry  
We're gonna get it together  
And I know you're askin' why  
  
Just when it,  
Just when it was goin' so good  
Just when it was goin'  
Just when it was goin' so good
