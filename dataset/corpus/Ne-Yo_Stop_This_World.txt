OK,  
I woke up in heaven today  
She kissed me I floated away, away  
Never felt anything so great  
Alright,  
Now I brace myself for a fight  
Something must go wrong  
Cuz it's way to right  
I'm light as a feather tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I can't feel the ground  
Someone let me down  
I never felt so high as I do now  
It's too good to be true  
I don't deserve you  
I never felt a love strong enough to  
Stop this world from spinning  
Stop this world from spinning  
  
And I see,  
Heaven when she looks at me  
In her smile is the most amazing dream  
And in her eyes I fall asleep  
And I hope,  
Hope that she can see through the smoke  
Of my imperfections into my soul  
And my heart where she has control (she has control)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Happiness like this can never last (can never last)  
Turns into the memories of the past (turns into the memories of the past)  
(Going just as fast)  
  
[Chorus]
