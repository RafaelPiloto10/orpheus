Love is like the ocean, burning in devotion  
When you go, go, go, oh no  
Feel my heart is burning, when the night is turning  
I will go, go, go, oh no  
  
Baby I will love you  
Every night and day  
Baby I will kiss you  
But I have to say  
  
No face, no name, no number  
Your love is like a thunder  
I'm dancing on a fire, burning in my heart  
No face, no name, no number  
Oh girl I'm not a hunter  
Your love is like desire, burning in my soul  
No face, no name, no number  
Oh love is like a thunder  
Oh love is like the heaven, it's so hard to find  
No face, no name, no number  
Girl I'm not a hunter  
Your love is like a river, flowing in my mind  
  
Feel your dreams are flying, dreams are never dying  
I don't go, go, go, oh no  
You're eyes tells a story, baby oh don't worry  
When you go, go, go, oh no  
Baby cause I love you  
Forever and a day  
Baby I will kiss you but I have to say
