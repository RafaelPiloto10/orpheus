Monday morning  
Eighteen years of dawning  
I say how long  
You say how long  
  
It was one dull morning  
Woke the world with bawling  
I was so sad (so sad)  
It was so bad  
  
I was of a feeling it was out of control  
I had the opinion it was out of control  
  
Boys and girls  
Go to the school and girls  
They make children  
Not like this one  
  
I was of a feeling it was out of control  
I had the opinion it was out of control  
  
I was of a feeling it was out of control  
I had the opinion it was out of control  
  
(Out of control)  
  
I fought fate  
There's blood on the garden gate  
The man said childhood  
It's in his childhood  
  
One day I'll die  
The choice will not be mine  
Will it be too late  
You can't fight it  
  
I was of a feeling it was out of control  
I had the opinion it was out of control
