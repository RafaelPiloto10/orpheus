I am just a boy working in a record store  
Yes I moved to San Francisco just to see what I could be  
I am a loser geek, crazy with an evil streak  
Yes I do believe there is a violent thing inside of me  
She is just a girl, she is doing what she can  
She dances topless  
  
When she's not playing in her band  
Such a pretty girl, happy in an ugly place  
Watching all the pretty people do lots of ugly things  
I think it's getting better for the two of us  
Yes I think it's getting better almost everyday  
I could give a damn for what those people say  
All I want to do is lose myself in your room  
All you want is just a slow fuck in the afternoon  
  
I still see those scary guys when I am all alone at night  
I kiss the ring you gave me then I swing with all my might  
I think it's getting better for the two of us  
  
I think it's getting easier for you and me to agree  
That the white men in black suits  
They are diminishing  
Yes I think they are diminishing  
Yes I think they diminish you and they diminish me  
I think they are diminishing  
  
You know sometimes I hear those people say  
Yeah she takes a bus  
  
Over to the north side of the city  
She goes to work stripping for the rich white men  
All the words they give her  
  
Make her feel so soft and pretty  
She wears them but they never seem to fit  
Yes I think it's getting better for the two of us  
Yes I think it's getting better in the worst way  
I refuse to be afraid of almost everyone  
  
Afraid of all the things they do or the words that they say  
Let's live the way we want to live and hope they go away  
I really hope they go away  
  
I really hope they find a nice place  
I hope they find it somewhere  
I hope they go away  
  
I can still hear all those people say
