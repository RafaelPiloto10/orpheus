Last night, my dear , the rain was fallin'  
I went to bed so sad and blue  
Then I had a dream of you  
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening  
Underneath the harvest moon  
I was thinking about you  
Then we met out in the moonlight  
The stars were shining in your eyes  
But another was there to  
  
I don't believe you've met my baby  
You looked at her, you looked at me  
I wondered who you were talkin' to  
I shook the hand of your stranger  
But I was shaking all inside  
I was still wondering who  
Your arm was resting on her shoulder  
You smiled at her, she smiled at you  
Her eyes were filled with victory  
She said, "my brother wants to marry"  
And then my heart was filled with glee  
I knew that you would marry me
