Hey you,  
Have you felt like this before?  
You got style but ain't got soul  
Are you happy now?  
Are you happy tonight?  
Or did punk rock get it right?  
Is there no future in sight?  
Oh is it different now? Is it different?  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on,  
Come on, come on, come on  
Where are you? Where are you?  
I'm kicking and screaming  
You're not listening  
Where are you? Where are you?  
Everything I've believed in has lied to me  
But this could be the best day of my life  
  
The best day of my life  
  
Hey you,  
Have you got everything you want?  
Or do you want more than you got?  
Is it different now? Is it different tonight?  
Or did Jesus get it right?  
Or is the devil behind the light?  
Are you happy now? Are you happy?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh sons and daughters,  
Mothers and fathers,  
Everyone's waiting for our luck to change.  
Sons and daughters,  
Mothers and fathers,  
Everyone's waiting, waiting  
  
'Cause this could be the best day  
And this could be the best day  
And this could be the best day, best day, best day  
  
Come on,  
Come on, come on, come on  
Where are you? Where are you?  
I'm kicking and screaming  
You're not listening  
Where are you? And where are you?  
Everything I've believed in has lied to me  
  
And this could be the best day  
And this could be the best day  
This could be the best day, best day, best day  
And this could be the best day  
And this could be the best day  
And this could be the best day, best day, best day of your life.
