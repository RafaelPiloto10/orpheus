Night will come and I will follow  
For my victims, no tomorrow  
Make it fast, your time of sorrow  
On his trail, I'll make you follow  
  
Quarters for the criminally insane  
The sentence read for life I must remain  
The path I chose has led me to my grave  
To try again I'd have no other way  
  
Quarters for the criminally insane  
Escape for me has fast become a game  
Soon to be, I'll leave without a trace  
Endangered species end the human race  
  
Branded in pain  
Marked criminally insane  
Locked away and kept restrained  
Disapprobation, but what have I done  
I have yet only just begun  
To take your fuckin' lives!  
  
(Night will come and I will follow  
For my victims, no tomorrow  
Make it fast, your time of sorrow  
On his trail, I'll make you follow)
