I know you're leaving  
I won't ask you to stay  
I won't hold you back  
I won't stand in your way  
If that's what you've gotta do, I understand  
It's not that easy setting you free  
But that's how it's gotta be  
And as you're walking away  
As I'm watching you go  
There's one thing I want you to know  
Just remember my heart's with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find you ever need me someday  
I'm just a heartbeat away  
Saying goodbye isn't saying were through  
Just know through it all I'm still here for you  
Light a light in the window  
When your lost in the dark, ooh  
These arms would be happy to hold you again  
If ever you miss me or when you  
Start thinking about  
All the nights that we shared  
Darling, you know Ill be there  
Just remember my heart's with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find you ever need me someday  
You walk to the door with nothing to say  
I look in your eyes and you look away  
You're leaving me now, but darling, I hope  
Hope that you'll look back someday  
And remember my hearts with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no one's there to hold when you're all alone  
Baby, take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find that you're all alone  
Just remember my heart's with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find that you're all alone
