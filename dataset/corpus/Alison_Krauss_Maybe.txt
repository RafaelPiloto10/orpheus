Yesterday the odds were stacked  
In favor of my expectations  
Flyin' above the rest,  
Never fallin' from the nest  
Tuesday came and went  
And now I'm in a little situation  
Maybe it's for the best  
I can live alone, I guess  
  
[Chorus]  
Maybe I can stand alone  
Maybe I'm strong as stone  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe he'll fly on home  
  
Forgive me if I'm keeping you apart  
From better conversation  
I'm hung up on all my doubt  
Trying to sort the whole thing out  
Tell me that I'm smart enough  
To deal with all the information  
Spinning inside my head  
Every word he ever said  
  
[Chorus: x2]
