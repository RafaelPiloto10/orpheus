It's 4 a.m., you call to spit some fire out  
But did you think that I would listen to you now?  
It's nothing new so get in line with all the rest  
And I will wait till you realize you're out of breath  
  
Can you hear the crowd?  
They all go wild  
For you and your denial  
They're watching you break down (break down)  
Hate me all you want,  
I'll be okay  
I'm half the world away  
I'm letting you go now (go now)  
  
You've got sadness twisted up with jealousy  
You show your fists to make them look like loyalty  
And I have seen what holding on can take away  
If it's the past you love then that's where you can stay  
  
Can you hear the crowd?  
They all go wild  
For you and your denial  
They're watching you break down (break down)  
Hate me all you want,  
I'll be okay  
I'm half the world away  
I'm letting you go now (go now)  
Go now (go now)  
  
Desperation kills  
But when it's on your sleeve you wear it well  
Underneath it all  
You'll always have this war inside yourself  
  
I'm letting you go now (go now)  
Can you hear the crowd?  
They all go wild  
For you and your denial  
They're watching you break down (break down)  
Hate me all you want,  
I'll be okay  
I'm half the world away  
I'm letting you go now (go now)  
Go now (go now)  
Go now (go now)  
Go now (go now)
