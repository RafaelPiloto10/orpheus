[Verse 1]  
We don't believe what's on TV  
Because it's what we want to see  
And what we want we know we can't believe  
We have all learned to kill our dreams  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I need to know  
That when I fail you'll still be here  
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds  
And we'll make money selling your hair  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care what's in your hair  
I just wanna know what's on your mind  
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old  
But because of you I might think twice  
  
[Verse 2]  
Alright, second verse  
What if my dream does not happen?  
Would I just change what I've told my friends?  
Don't want to know who I would be  
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus] (x2)
