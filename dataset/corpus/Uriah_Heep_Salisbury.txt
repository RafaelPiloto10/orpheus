Somewhere in your eyes  
That very special glow  
Something drawing me  
To where I do not know  
I never really thought  
That I would lose myself  
Now I'm going faster  
Than anybody else  
  
You move without a sound  
And touch me with your hand  
Just like the rain that fondles  
Every grain of sand  
This thing we're gonna do  
It's just for you and me  
I'm gonna make it good  
Good as it can be  
  
Your kiss is sweeter now  
Your breath is getting warm  
We must take our time  
And last it through til dawn  
I wonder will it be  
Oh, I expect it to  
There have been other girls  
No-one else like you  
  
I feel a power here  
I never felt before  
And I begin to see  
What drives us to want more  
Oh, girl of all my dreams  
Please tell me if I'm wrong  
Because I've been blue  
But we belong  
  
As time passed and all too fast  
I just knew we couldn't last  
And I guessed that the end  
Was near at hand  
Though we tried our love inside  
It just crumpled up and died  
What went wrong  
I will never understand  
  
You tell me why  
Alone again  
How could you leave me  
Alone again  
I don't want to be  
Alone again  
  
There's a line in a rhyme  
I was going to send to you  
It says, "All that is to be  
Will surely be"  
So oh, though you had to go  
'Cause you needed someone new  
Is there still a chance  
That you'll come back to me  
I want you back you see  
  
Alone again  
How could you leave me  
Alone again  
How could you leave me  
Alone again  
I don't want to be alone again  
  
Somewhere in your eyes  
That very special glow  
Something drawing me  
To where I do not know  
I never really thought  
That I would lose myself  
But now I'm going faster  
Than anybody else  
  
You move without a sound  
And touch me with your hand  
Just like the waves that fondle  
Every little grain of sand  
This thing we're gonna do  
It's just for you and me  
And I'm gonna make it good  
Just you wait and see
