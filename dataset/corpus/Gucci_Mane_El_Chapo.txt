[Intro:]  
  
[Hook:]  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
At least all the street niggas I know  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
Fully automatic slice your auto  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
3 Billion dollars in pesos  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
And when I meet him I'm a tell him bravo  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I live a life so crazy make me start smoking new ports  
And you ain't coming in I'm a serve you in the front  
Porch  
My plug he comin in I'm abouta scoop him from the  
Airport  
And ain't no room for nothin else but money in my condo  
Ballin like a bitch you think my grandmother grizelda  
These suckas they can't wait to double cross you like  
Diego  
I'm whackin niggas, taxin niggas similar to Pablo  
I'm big chained touchin every penny like I'm Castro  
Boss shit mob hits lucky Luciano  
Bricksquad records like the damn gambinos  
The shit that I done did has only been done by latinos  
Dope so good you think it came from el Chapo  
  
[Hook:]  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
At least all the street niggas I know  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
Fully automatic slice your auto  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
3 Billion dollars in pesos  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
And when I meet him I'm a tell him bravo  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Plane just touch down thanks to armado  
Best coke in the world going through your nostrils  
Plugs steady send the dope in by the boat load  
Severe niggas heads off like el loco  
A hundred bricks is nothin if you Jesus alozando  
My big toy meet me o I got it in the choke hold  
Spent a half a million last year on forgiatos  
And no I am not a catholic confessin is a no no  
So many bricks of brown and white you know we got a  
Snow roll  
Coke so clean every one brick is a combo  
A little handgun in every pocket in my cargo  
And it's a stack for a kilo if you get it in the jungle  
  
[Hook:]  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
At least all the street niggas I know  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
Fully automatic slice your auto  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
3 Billion dollars in pesos  
All I wanna be is el Chapo  
And when I meet him I'm a tell him bravo
