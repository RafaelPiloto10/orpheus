Trust me to open my mouth, now everybody knows  
Trust me, now I've let you down, I'm a big mouth I suppose.  
This was our secret, our meetings were so discreet  
I promised to keep it from the ears out on the street  
This was our secret, we were having an affair  
I couldn't keep it, now the secret's everywhere  
  
One cup runneth over, loosening a jaw  
Trust me to open my mouth, it's not a secret anymore  
We had a secret, what a terrible thing to do  
I couldn't have seen it, I was so in love so in love with you  
  
I need a gobstopper to keep my trap shut  
Got to keep my nose clean  
Why's it me that gets the bad luck?
