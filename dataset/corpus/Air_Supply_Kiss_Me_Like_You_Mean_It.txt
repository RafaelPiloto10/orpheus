Kiss me like you mean it  
Hold me like you never have before  
If you show a little feeliing  
I'll know that you can give a little more  
  
How can I take your love  
If you don't believe it  
Reach and and count those stars  
One by one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ooh, kiss me like you mean it  
Ooh, Kiss me like you mean it  
  
Now is the time when words have no answer  
And silence is not what it seems  
We can fall from the sky in the presence of angels  
Do you dream the same dream?  
  
Always the sounds of love  
And a heart never ending  
For the colors that bleed and run...one by one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Where the water is deep the reflection is wide  
We stand on the bridge looking down  
But you can't decide  
True love will never begin to see  
So hold out your hand to me  
  
[Chorus:]
