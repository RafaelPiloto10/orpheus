Let your left foot lead you,  
Let your right head speak to you,  
Let your left hand meet you,  
Let your right woman kick you.  
  
Left hand's the right hand,  
Left turn's the right turn.  
Keep turning left and you'll get there.  
  
Let your left foot lead you,  
Let your right mouth speak for you,  
Let your left eye meet you,  
Let your right man love you.  
  
Left hand's the right hand,  
Left turn's the right turn.  
Keep turning left and you'll get there.  
  
Let's get there together,  
Let's get there together,  
Let's get there, sisters,  
And let's get there, bothers,  
Let's get there, let's get there,  
Let's get there, let's get there.
