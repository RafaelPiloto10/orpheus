Aah, get the burner.  
Uh, the burner.  
Let loose the cannon  
Blood drippin', slippin' off my planet  
Man, the panic, funk mode  
Mechanical mix flows competition in my dojo  
Swing a hook, got the vertebrae, be brave  
Heat gain meltin' on my heatwave  
Power to the crowd, pandemonium  
Showin' 'em how I gets down  
  
[Chorus]  
The life of a killer is scandalous  
The life of a killer is dangerous  
The life of a killer is scandalous  
The life of a killer is dangerous  
  
Triggedy, sky-high like a kite  
God diggity, every other cloud's blue  
Puff on a, yeah, puff on a  
Bring it on, off, on, baby, one-two  
Peep in the arena, death at your doorstep  
Right around the corner is the land of regret  
When ya sweat to get down, sweat to get off and on  
Till the, nothin' normal 'bout my songs  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
LL Cool, J jazzy jewel  
Takin' dime pieces to the real school  
I got 'em on nations, buckin' like fools  
Pitbulls fightin' over streets I rule  
Catch it if you can, when it's hot ta hit'cha hand  
Throw ya skunks in the air, my funk got the flair, man  
I can do division, baby, I can do math  
Multiplying fractions, now ya know the half  
Knuckle games played, must pack steel  
Oh yes, I'm livin' like real  
To the highest extent, bloody clothes doin' battle  
Till the death of my foes, it's my show  
  
[Chorus: x2]
