Surprised?  
Yes, it's me again  
I have just returned from the island of Chandelier  
What am I doing in town?  
Well, I'm glad you asked  
I'm just passing through in search of the ever elusive Thunderbird  
I got a job as a public relations man  
Passing out handbills on Austin Street  
Merely an effort to improve my financial situation  
And ward off a case of the D.T.'s  
So farewell, my darling  
Perhaps we'll meet again  
On some sin-infested street corner in Houston Texas
