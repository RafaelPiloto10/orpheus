Butterflies inside, freaking me out  
I should be walking away but I'm pinned to the ground  
I can't get free, no-one's saving me  
Walking in the water, seeing what I can find  
Before I even knew it I was caught on the line (Yeah)  
You pulled me in, you got under my skin  
  
Every part of my body's telling me to go  
Telling me to get out  
Every part of my body's saying I should be gone  
But I'm still here  
  
I can't run away, it's a losing game  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
So I put my hands up  
I got a white flag flying  
Only you can knock me out  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
  
It's the first time in forever that I've been so scared  
You just five foot six, blue eyes, blonde hair  
When I see your face  
There's no breathing space  
In my life  
You stop deep inside  
Take me home  
Then I can go  
  
I can't run away, it's a losing game  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
So I put my hands up  
I got a white flag flying  
Only you can knock me out  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
  
Oh I can't fight it  
No I can't fight it  
  
Every part of my body's telling me to go  
Telling me to get out  
Every part of my body's saying I should be gone  
But I'm still here  
  
I can't run away, it's a losing game  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
So I put my hands up  
I got a white flag flying  
Only you can knock me out  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
  
I can't fight it  
Oh no I can't fight it
