Time...  
Time...  
Time so close that I can touch you, give me.  
Time so near that I can breathe you, give me.  
Time I don't know why I feel like surrender.  
Chains The feeling of the feelings still remains  
You're much too old to keep on playing games  
I don't know why I feel like surrender.  
And it's a strange feeling,  
strange feeling I feel inside.  
And it's a strange beating strange,  
beating in this heart of mine.  
I got to run, I got to hide.  
Another place, another time... Time  
A chill is slowly rolling down my spine  
And suddenly I lose the grip on time  
the time and the space of time.  
And it's a strange feeling...
