I met a man  
And talked about you  
He seemed like a man from Osaka I knew  
And he listened while I told him how you hurt me  
And he consoled me when he told me he'd been hurt too  
  
And he said we are inter-dependent  
And the effects on each other never ending  
And that the air has no boundaries  
I think this water that surrounds me  
Is the same water soaking through to you  
  
So what comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
What comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
  
I had some tea  
With a gal from Paris  
We talked about life, sex, love and poetry  
And you can't help it  
Your name came up again  
And she said man those kind of guys  
Really know how to steal all of the oxygen  
  
And I said we are inter-dependent  
And the effects on each other never ending  
And that the air has no boundaries  
I think this water that surrounds me  
Is the same water soaking' through to you  
  
So what comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
What comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
  
I have a friend I confide in  
He always says 'doll you got to learn not to lead with your chin'  
But you can't help it  
It all comes up again  
And then you have your fill  
And your spill reaches down as far as a flood  
  
So what comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
What comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
  
Eventually  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
Eventually  
Eventually
