Divine intoxication spills out the bores  
A self diluting fix that craves all the more  
Destructive seasoned vet,full glass of sting  
A bittersweet triumph that weighs in each day  
  
Obsession-my falsest friend  
Moderation-a fantasy that I cant win  
Devastation-a hardship loss  
Demanding-the pain of wasted years  
  
[Chorus]  
Lift me up,  
Tear me down,  
Will I last through this glorious nightmare  
  
Collapse all that sacred,prey on the weak  
Slow painful suicide that steals from each man  
Hells fire soon returns to rape the well  
Prolific doom machine that hears our words  
  
I'm fighting the will to live,  
With countless persuasions  
I'm fighting the will to live,  
The endless temptations,  
Its lifeless grip,  
That haunts us all  
  
Pulling from every direction,  
Its lifeless grip graps hold  
Yearning is now my dissension,  
Its lifeless grip graps hold  
  
[Chorus]
