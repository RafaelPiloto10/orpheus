Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus lane  
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer  
Pullin' on the reins  
Bells are ringin', children singin'  
All is merry and bright  
Hang your stockings and say your prayers  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!  
  
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus lane  
He's got a bag that's filled with toys  
For boys and girls again  
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,  
Oh what a beautiful sight  
So jump in bed and cover your head  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!  
  
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus lane  
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor  
He loves you just the same  
Santa knows were all good children  
That makes everything right  
So fill your hearts with Christmas cheer  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!  
  
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus lane  
He'll come around when the chimes ring out  
That it's Christmas morn again  
Peace on earth will come to all  
If we just follow the light  
So close your eyes and make a wish  
Cuz Santa, santa, santa, cuz Santa Claus comes tonight!
