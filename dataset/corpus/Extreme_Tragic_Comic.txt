Flowers, I sent,  
Were found dead on their arrival  
The words, I said,  
Inserted foot in my mouthful  
So when, we dance,  
My lead it ain't so graceful  
(isn't so, not ain't so)  
  
I'm a hapless romantic  
St-t-tuttering p-poet  
Just call me a tragic comic  
Cause I'm, in, in love with you  
  
And when, we dine,  
I forget to push in your seat  
I wear, the wine,  
Spilling hearts all over my sleeve  
A stitch, in time,  
Proposing down on my knees  
(splitting between the seams)  
  
I'm a hapless romantic  
St-t-tuttering p-poet  
Just call me a tragic comic  
Cause I'm, in, in love with you  
  
Nobody, can know the,  
Trouble I've, seen  
Nobody, can know the,  
Trouble I, get into,  
When I'm with you
