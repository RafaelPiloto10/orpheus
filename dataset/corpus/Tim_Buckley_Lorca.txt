Let the sun sing in your smile  
Let the wind hold your desire  
Let your womans voice run through your veins  
Let her be your blood don't feel ashamed  
  
She's your home when no one wants you  
She'll give you life when you're so tired  
She'll ease your fears ah when you're a stranger  
She's born to give faith to you  
Oh, just to you  
  
You're just a man on death's highways  
It's life you owe you're here to praise it  
If love flows your way then be a river  
And when it dries just stand there and shiver  
  
Oh, let the sun sing in your smile  
Let the wind hold your desire  
And let your womans voice run through your veins  
Let her be your blood don't feel ashamed  
It's her life you owe  
I owe you love
