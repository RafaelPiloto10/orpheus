I will not lie, I will not lie. I will not lie, I will not lie for you.  
  
Every time I see you fooling around on him,  
I can't help but remember that he calls me his friend.  
It's only right for me to tell you when it's the wrong thing to do.  
It's only right that you should know  
If he comes to me, I will not lie for you, no, I won't lie for you.  
  
It's hard enough to see him stumbling blind,  
I refuse to see him lose you and me at the same time.  
It's only right for me to tell you when it's the wrong thing to do.  
It's only right that you should know  
If he comes to me, I will not lie for you, no, I won't lie for you.  
  
To come here as your friend and have you come on like my lover,  
like to bring things to an end between myself and my brother.  
If it was any other man I would not interfere  
But if you come on to me again, I don't see how to stand clear.  
It's only right for me to tell you when it's the wrong thing to do.  
It's only right that you should know-  
if he asks me, I will not lie for you, mama, I won't lie for you.  
  
If it was any other man I would not interfere  
But if you come on to me again, I don't see how to stand clear.  
It's only right for me to tell you when it's the wrong thing to do.  
It's only right that you should know  
If he asks me, I will not lie, I will not lie, I will not lie, I will not lie
for you.  
  
No, I won't lie for you, little girl, I won't lie for you.  
No, I won't lie to him for you, I will not lie for you.
