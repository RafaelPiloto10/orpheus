In the night I'm calling you!  
Be my guide help me through!  
In the night I call your name  
You're the light in times of shame!  
The songs I sing  
All my love I bring for you!  
  
I always try to make things better  
Everything that has gone wrong  
Mighty plans in the right direction  
But very little has been done  
Everyday when I try to get forward  
I find myself another mile back  
Help me fighting!  
Help me breathing!  
Why am I falling down instead?  
  
Every useful minute seems to be the thought of you  
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do  
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but's true!  
  
In the night  
Sometimes I cried after all I lied to you  
  
Free from ourselves and free from this world we may find  
The freedom we search  
'Cause all that we need is inside!  
The hours we waste we may not get back for a while  
And when it gets dark  
No chance will be there for a try  
  
When I wake up early in the morning  
I catch a book and jump inside  
I fill my head with a million wonders  
And try to fill the night with light  
The moment when I get things clearer  
I see another mountain to climb  
And always when I think I'm nearer  
I realize there is no time  
  
In the night  
This song I sing, all my love I bring for you!
