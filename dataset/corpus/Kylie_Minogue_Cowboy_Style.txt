Shed my skin since you came in,  
Where do you end and I begin?  
Awoke my senses yet you stopped time,  
You took me to a deeper high,  
The essence of my hopes and fears,  
Creation of my muddled dreams  
  
Cowboy Style,  
With a peaceful smile,  
You are from the temple  
Won't you stay a while  
  
Found my voice to have my say,  
You take me close to far away,  
And now I find and now I feel,  
The ordinary is surreal,  
Peace and terror all in one,  
My future life has just begun  
  
Cowboy style,  
With a peaceful smile,  
You are from the temple  
Won't you stay a while  
Won't you stay a while  
  
Won't you stay a while  
  
I am frightened I'm aroused,  
I'm enlightened to the now  
  
Cowboy style  
Cowboy style  
  
Cowboy style,  
With a peaceful smile,  
You are from the temple  
Won't you stay a while
