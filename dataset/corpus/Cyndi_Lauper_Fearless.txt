Sometimes I'm afraid when you go  
Sometimes I'm afraid when you come home  
Underneath it all...  
I think I'm afraid when there's nothing wrong.  
  
But if I was fearless...  
Could I be your reckless friend  
And if I was helpless...  
Could you be the one comes rushing in.  
  
There's something that I never told  
When I find myself slipping off of my pedestal  
I'm a fierce believer afraid to fall.  
  
But if I was fearless...  
Could I be your reckless friend  
And if I was helpless...  
Could you be the one comes rushing in.  
  
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark  
I can't find the light in my heart  
I can see my hand pushing away  
Hard as I can  
  
But if I was fearless...  
Could I be your wreckless friend  
And if I was helpless...  
Could be the one comes rushing in.  
  
Sometimes I'm afraid when you go...
