Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man, yeah,  
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?  
Honey, you know I did!  
And each time I tell myself that I, well I've just had enough,  
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough.  
  
I said come on, come on, come on, come on and take it,  
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby,  
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah.  
Hey! Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, yeah.  
You know you got it if it makes you feel good,  
Oh yes indeed.  
All right!  
  
You're out on the street looking good, honey,  
Deep down in your heart I said you know that it ain't right,  
Never never never never never never hear me when I cry at night.  
Honey, I cry all the time!  
And each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain,  
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again.  
  
I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it!  
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby.  
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah,  
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, yeah.  
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good, hey!  
  
Now all right!  
  
Now come on, come on, come on, come on and take it,  
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby.  
Break another little bit of my heart, honey, yeah.  
Hey! Have another little piece of my heart now, baby,  
You know you got it if it makes you feel good.  
Hey! Hey! Have another little piece of my heart now, baby,  
Break it, break it, break it, yeah.  
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby,  
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good.
