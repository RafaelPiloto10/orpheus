I wake up crying after tossin' and turnin'  
And a yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby oh, my love since you went away  
Haven't spent a happy day  
I wake up crying after sobbin' and sighin'  
And a wonderin' just what went wrong  
Pretty baby well I know I was good to you  
Why'd you go and make me blue  
I need your arms to hold me tight now  
I need your lips to kiss me goodnight  
I'm so unhappy on my own  
Don't don't leave me sad and lonely  
(Oh, now, now, now, well, well, well, now baby)  
I tell you I wake up crying after tossin' and turnin'  
And a yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby, why don't you please come back to me  
And save me from this misery I want you to save me  
Ah save me baby  
Mhh
