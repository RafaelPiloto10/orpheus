Could this be the land of the free?  
Could this be the land of the free?  
Let salvation's waves crash on these shores again  
And the tide of Your great love come rushing in.  
Could this be the land of the free?  
  
Did you feel the mountains tremble,  
Did you hear the oceans roar,  
When the people rose to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the risen one?  
  
Did you feel the people tremble,  
Did you hear the singers roar,  
When the lost began to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the saving one?  
  
And we can see that, God, You're moving.  
A mighty river through the nations  
When young and old return to Jesus.  
Fling wide, you heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord.  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play,  
Let the streets resound with singing.  
Songs that bring Your hope, and  
Songs that bring Your joy.  
Dancers who dance upon injustice.  
  
Did you feel the darkness tremble,  
When all the saints join in one song,  
And all the streams flow as one river,  
To wash away our brokenness?  
  
And here we that, God, You're moving,  
A time of jubilee is coming,  
When young and old return to Jesus.  
Fling wide, you heavenly gates,  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord.  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play,  
Let the streets resound with singing.  
Songs that bring Your hope, and  
Songs that bring Your joy.  
Dancers who dance upon injustice.
