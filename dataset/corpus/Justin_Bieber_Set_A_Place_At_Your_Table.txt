Things seemed strange this morning  
As I packed my bags for school  
The smiles I'm used to seein' just weren't there

To my mother down the hallway  
Above the whispers all that I could hear... Was  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
I was feeling kinda helpless  
About the words that I just heard  
Could it be the family 2 doors down  
They said a couple months of bad luck  
Had them up against the wall  
And though it may seem small  
I know there's something I can do...  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
Make room at your table  
For your friends and family  
Take the time to share your day  
Just laugh talk and eat  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
... There's a little hope for you and i
