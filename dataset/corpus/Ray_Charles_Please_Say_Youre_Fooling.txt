You say you're leaving me  
For someone new  
Please say you're teasing me  
Say it's not true  
  
Say it, come on  
And say you're fooling  
Whoa, say it's a lie  
Whoa, say you're fooling me, baby  
Don't say goodbye  
  
Whoa, if our romance is really done  
Don't you know my heart  
Will never see the sun  
  
To me, you're everything  
That is sweet and divine  
Don't keep me wandering, baby  
If you're still me  
  
Say it, come on  
And say you're foolong  
Whoa, say it's a lie  
Whoa, say you're fooling me, baby  
Whoa, don't say goodbye  
(Don't say goodbye)
