The circus is coming to see you.  
The elephant smiles.  
Everybody can hear you say that's out of style.  
My brother is friendly for reasons, if I am the same.  
Just for four hundred seasons we all live in rain.  
  
So I laugh in your face.  
Your only one race.  
Yes I laugh in your face and I'm right.  
You lie just like the rest.  
But there's nobody best.  
So I laugh in your face and I'm right.  
  
I'll pull out your plug so your small.  
You'll slide down the drain.  
On the steps of St. Peter's you all look the same.  
  
So I laugh in your face.  
Your only one race.  
Yes I laugh in your face and I'm right.  
You lie just like the rest.  
But there's nobody best.  
So I laugh in your face and I'm right.
