I wish I could push a button and make the pain all go away  
I wish I had the magic words but I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the wasted years and throw them all away  
  
And it might sound easy for me to say  
You are going to find a way to fix what's broken  
Fix what's broken  
  
You say you like people with fire, but you don't like it when you get burned  
Broke about a thousand hearts, now you don't like it when it's your turn  
  
You wonder when you're going to figure out all the lessons that you need to
learn  
And it might sound simple for me to say you will learn someday that  
All you need is love  
  
All those big dreams that were so important, they don't mean anything now  
All you need is love  
  
All those hard times when people hurt you, they don't mean anything now  
All you need is love  
  
Love is all you need to fix what's broken  
Love is all you need to fix what's broken  
  
You turn sunshine into chaos everywhere you go  
Now your girl has got a brand new life with a guy you used to know  
She got tired of the drama you make when life gets too slow  
  
And it might sound simple for me to say you will heal someday now  
All you need is love  
  
All those big dreams that were so important, they don't mean anything now  
All you need is love  
  
All those hard times when people turned on you, they don't mean anything now  
All you need is love  
  
All those happy endings that never happened, they don't mean anything now  
All you need is love  
  
Love is all you need to fix what's broken  
Love is all you need to fix what's broken  
Love is all you need  
Now, enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
  
The time is going to come when you stop feeling sorry for yourself  
Yeah, you were broken when you were young and you never got over it  
You were damaged when you were young, and now you take it out on everyone  
  
The time is going to come when you say that enough is enough  
The time is going to come when you stop beating yourself up  
Stop beating yourself up  
Stop beating yourself up  
  
The time is going to come when you see that all you need is love  
All you need is love  
All you need is love, love, love, love, love, love  
The time is going to come when you see  
All you need is love  
All you need is love  
Love is all you need to fix what's broken  
Love is all you need to fix what's broken
