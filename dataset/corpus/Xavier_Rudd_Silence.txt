Silence beating down  
Silence all around  
Well I'm peaceful  
At least for now  
Silence beating down  
  
Here other people they won't see me sad  
And if I'm happy they won't share my happiness  
For this is peacefulness that won't be shared  
For it's time for the spirit  
It's time unsaid  
This peacefulness that won't be shared  
For it's time alone  
  
Silence beating down  
Silence all around  
And I'm peaceful  
At least for now  
Silence beating down  
  
Here other people they won't see me sad  
And if I'm happy they won't share my happiness  
For this is peacefulness that won't be shared  
For it's time for my spirit and me to spend  
This is peacefulness that won't be shared  
For it's time alone
