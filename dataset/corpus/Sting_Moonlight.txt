In the moonlight  
When the shadows play  
When the thought of what could happen  
Takes your breath away  
Sighs and whispers  
Quiet laughter in the air  
Unspoken invitations everywhere  
  
In the moonlight  
All the words you say  
Make it relatively easy  
To be swept away  
In the half light  
Can we trust the way we feel  
Can we be sure that anything is real?  
  
Stars keep secrets as they wander indiscreetly  
While the echoes of a song go drifting by  
We must be careful not to lose our way completely  
Or the magic that we seek here  
We can't be sure will be here  
  
In the morning  
With the moon away  
And if in each other's arms  
Is where we're meant to stay  
  
In the love light  
When our eyes have grown accustomed to the daylight  
We'll see what waits for us to share  
For all the things we've dreamed of in the moonlight  
Will be there
