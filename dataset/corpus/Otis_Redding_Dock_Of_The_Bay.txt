Sittin' in the mornin' sun  
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes  
Watchin' the ships roll in  
Then I watch 'em roll away again  
  
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide, roll away  
Sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Wastin' time  
  
Left my home in Georgia  
Headed far for Frisco Bay  
I had nothin' to live for  
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way  
  
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide roll away  
Sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time  
  
Looks like nothin's gonna change  
Everything, everything remains the same  
I can't do what ten people tell me to do  
So I guess I'll remain the same  
  
I'm sittin' here restin' my bones  
And this lonliness won't leave me alone  
It's Two thousand miles I roamrd  
Just to make this dock my home  
  
Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide roll away  
Oooo - wee, Sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Wastin' time...
