If you knew me would you save that seat for me  
If you knew me would you finally let me free  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
If you loved me would you hold onto my hand  
If you loved me would you finally understand  
That we're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
What you need, what you need I need too  
What you are, what you are I am too  
'cause we're all the same under a different name  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
If you knew me would you lift me from the ground  
If you loved me would you even hear me make a sound  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
What you need, what you need I need too  
What you are, what you are I am too  
'cause we're all the same under a different name  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers
