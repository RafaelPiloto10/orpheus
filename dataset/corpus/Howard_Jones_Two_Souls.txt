Whatever happened to the value of our love  
I've seen you change  
I've seen it coming slowly, these changes  
You're not the same  
  
It's not too late to start over  
It's not too late to turn around  
What are the things important to you?  
Can't be the money  
Well I got news for you  
  
Two souls (should be two souls together)  
Two souls (in the life that we planned)  
But you're working obsession is squeezing me  
Out of your world  
  
I'd rather live in a doll's house in a small street  
Where it always rains  
You kid yourself you're working all for me  
But older kids play with bigger trains  
  
It's not too late to start over  
It's not too late to turn 'round  
It's like we live in separate worlds  
Can't buy the lost time  
I want my share of you  
I want my share of you  
  
Two souls (should be two souls together)  
Two souls (in the life that we planned)  
But you're working obsession is squeezing me  
Out of your world  
  
Can't buy the lost time  
I want my share of you  
I want my share of you  
  
Two souls (should be two souls together)  
Two souls (in the life that we planned)  
Out of your world
