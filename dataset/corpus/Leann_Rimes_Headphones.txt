I love to sit and watch you work the room  
You could have anyone you want to  
But I know you're going home with me  
Just when I think I've got you figured out  
You spin me faster than the speed of sound  
But I know you know it makes me want you more  
(Makes me want you more)  
  
Boy you're turning me on  
I wanna be the bed that you'll be laying on  
I wanna be yours  
Your anything and everything, I wanna be that song  
That's coming through your headphones  
  
Just like the purple lake in your tattoo  
That's how close I wanna be to you  
I'm in your skin, I'm playing in your head  
(Playing in your head)  
  
Am I turning you on  
I wanna be the bed that you'll be laying on  
I wanna be yours  
Your anything and everything, I wanna be that song  
That's coming through your headphones  
  
I let my world revolve around you  
I whisper sweet things in your ear  
I've never loved but I'm about to  
Can't you feel us going there  
  
Am I turning you on  
I wanna be the bed that you'll be laying on  
I wanna be yours  
Your anything and everything, I wanna be that song  
That's coming through your headphones
