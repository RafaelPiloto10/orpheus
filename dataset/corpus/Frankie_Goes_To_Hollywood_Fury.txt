Life goes on day after day  
Hearts torn in every way  
  
So ferry 'cross the Mersey  
'cause this land's the place I love  
And here I'll stay  
And here I'll stay  
  
People they rush everywhere  
Each with their own secret care  
  
So ferry 'cross the Mersey  
'cause this land's the place I love  
And here I'll stay  
And here I'll stay  
  
I'm sorry I left me car's at home  
Well you're late as well, that's three times on the run  
If you're late again the supervisor said  
We're gonna put you on ? J-B sign
