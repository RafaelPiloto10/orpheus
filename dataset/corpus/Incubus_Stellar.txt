Meet me in outer space  
We could spend the night  
Watch the earth come up  
I've grown tired of that place  
Won't you come with me?  
We could start again  
  
How do you do it?  
Make me feel like I do  
How do you do it?  
It's better than I ever knew  
  
Meet me in outer space  
I will hold you close  
If you're afraid of heights  
I need you to see this place  
It might be the only way  
That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you  
  
How do you do it?  
Make me feel like I do  
How do you do it  
It's better than I ever knew  
You are stellar
