She smelled like flowers, she tastes like toffee  
She kissed me slowly, she held me softly  
Got too close and she backed up off me  
And left me stoned cold sober, just like black coffee  
Just like black coffee  
  
She told me that she'd always be thinkin' of me  
She said she wanted me to know that she really did love me  
She said she never put no one else above me  
Except her monkey, she's like a junkie, just like a junkie,  
Just like a junkie  
  
It was April 25th, it's up around 80  
Found a spot out in the park where the grass is shady  
She said her mom's from Jamaica, her father's from Haiti  
She's such a pretty lady, she's such a lady  
  
She smelled like flowers, she tastes like toffee  
She kissed me slowly, she held me softly  
Got too close and she backed up off me  
She left me stoned cold sober, just like black coffee  
Just like black coffee, just like black coffee  
Just like black coffee
