Tell me  
Just what you want me to be  
One kiss  
And boom you're the only one for me  
So please tell me  
Why don't you come around no more?  
Cause right now  
I'm crying outside the door of your candy store  
  
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that  
It started with a kiss  
Now we're up to bat  
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain  
I'm telling you my babe  
It's all in the game of?  
  
Love is  
Whatever you make it to be  
Sunshine  
Instead of this cold lonely sea  
So please baby  
Try and use me for what I'm good for  
It ain't saying goodbye  
It's knocking down the door of your candy store  
  
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that  
It started with a kiss  
Now we're up to bat  
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain  
I'm telling you my babe  
It's all in the game of love  
It's all in this game of love  
  
You roll me  
Control me  
Console me  
Please hold me  
You guide me  
Divide me  
Into me  
  
So please tell me  
Why don't you come around no more?  
Cause right now  
I'm dying outside the door of your loving store  
  
It just take a little bit of this, a little bit of that  
It started with a kiss  
Now we're up to bat  
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain  
I'm telling you my babe  
It's all in the game of love  
It's all in the game of love  
It's all in this game of love  
Let's play the game of love  
  
Roll me  
Console me  
Please hold me  
I'm out here on my own  
On my own
