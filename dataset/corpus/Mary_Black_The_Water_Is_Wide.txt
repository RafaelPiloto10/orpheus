The water is wide, I can't cross o'er  
Ad neither have I wings to fly  
Give me a boat that can carry two  
And we shall row, my love and I  
  
II  
For love is gentle, and love is kind  
The sweetest flower when first it's new  
But love grows old and waxes cold  
And fades away like morning dew

III  
There is a ship and she sails the sea  
She's loaded deep as deep can be  
But not as deep as the love I'm in  
I know now how I sink or swim
