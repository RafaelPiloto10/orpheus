It's just a television wonderland  
It's one more fairytale about a rich bitch  
Lying by the swimming pool  
Life is so cool  
Easy living when you make the rules  
Last Friday was the first time  
It only took about a half a minute  
On the stairway  
It was child's play  
The odds turn out even when you give up believing in the  
  
Cold law, steel claw  
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door  
Well I say no way  
Don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay  
I don't know who's right or who's wrong  
It doesn't really matter when you're lying in the gutter  
It's a see saw  
A long battle with the cold law  
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw  
  
The politicians have forgotten this place  
Except for a flying visit in a black Mercedes  
No election  
They cross the line  
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime  
If they could see what's going on around here  
So many people hanging onto the edge  
Crying out for revolution  
Retribution  
The odds turn out even  
When you give up believing in the  
  
Cold law, steel claw  
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door  
Well I say no way  
Don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay  
I don't know who's right or who's wrong  
It doesn't really matter when you're lying in the gutter  
It's a see saw  
A long battle with the cold law  
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw  
  
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy  
Sometimes I do a line, makes me laugh  
Makes me want to take a joyride  
On the high tide  
Sometimes I'm contemplating suicide  
Meanwhile Eddy is on the west coast  
I know he's making out with some sweet senorita  
Up in Frisco  
You and I know  
The odds turn out even  
When you give up believing in the  
  
Cold law, steel claw  
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door  
Well I say no way  
Don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay  
I don't know who's right or who's wrong  
It doesn't really matter when you're lying in the gutter  
It's a see saw  
A long battle with the cold law  
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw
