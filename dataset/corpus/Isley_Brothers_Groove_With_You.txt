Oh, I've been thinking of you  
And you've been thinking of me.  
Oh, I'll give all that I have  
If you'll give all that I need.  
And oh, oh, oh, lets be fair.  
And I think its time we cleared the air.  
I've been watching you, you've been watching me.  
You know I've been wantin to groove with you.
