HARRY:  
Watching you get dressed  
Messes with my head  
Take that bag off your shoulder  
  
Come get back in bed  
We've still got time left  
This don't have to be over  
  
NIALL:  
And you say  
"It's hard to keep a secret"  
Girl don't leave me all alone in this hotel  
  
And these shades  
Can hide us from the streets yeah  
One weekend I promise that I'll never tell  
  
LIAM:  
You should probably stay, probably stay  
A couple more days  
Come on let me change your ticket home  
  
You should probably stay here with me  
A couple more days

Don't go  
It's not the same when you go  
And it's not good to be all alone  
  
So you should probably stay here with me  
A couple more days  
Come on let me change your ticket home  
  
ZAYN:  
Don't play innocent  
I know what you meant  
When you said you'd come over

Are we way past that  
Playing hard to get  
We did that when we were younger
