I'm amazed at the way you do,  
You do the things that they want you to.  
Can't you see there's a turning tide?  
It's going to turn into a landslide.  
The ground will fall from your feet,  
You got to do before you feel the heat.  
It's "heads I win, tails you lose" -  
There's no escaping any way you chose.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  
Something's blowing up in the air.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  
There's a rainstorm coming, beware.  
Oh, it's a tragedy it had to come to this.  
There's no way out, so don't you try to resist.  
The thunder cloud hanging overhead,  
It's going to break and cause a landslide.
