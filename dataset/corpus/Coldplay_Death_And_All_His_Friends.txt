All winter we got carried away  
Over on the rooftops, let's get married  
All summer we just hurried  
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry  
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry  
  
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry  
And don't worry  
  
Try  
Try  
Try  
Try  
  
No I don't want to battle from beginning to end  
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge  
I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends  
  
No I don't want to battle from beginning to end  
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge  
I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends.  
  
And, in the end, we lie awake, and we dream of making our escape.  
And, in the end, we lie awake, and we dream of making our escape.
