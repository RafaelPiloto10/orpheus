The best we can agree on  
Is it could have been worse  
What happened to your old  
Benevolent universe?  
You know, the one with stars  
That revolved around you  
Beaming down full of promises  
To bring good news  
  
You used to feel that way  
The saddest words you could ever say  
But I know you'll remember that day  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
  
The worst thing about it all  
Is that you've never been right  
And I'm still not really sure  
What started that fight  
But I still get this feeling  
There's more trouble ahead  
So never mind the bad news  
Let's have the good news instead  
  
You used to feel that way  
The saddest words you could ever say  
But I know you'll remember that day  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
And the most beautiful words...  
  
Some would said they never fear a thing  
Well, I do (Well, I do)  
And I'm afraid enough for both of us  
For me and you (me and you)  
Time, if nothing else, will do its worst  
So do me that favor  
And tell me the good news first  
The good news first  
  
You used to feel that way  
The saddest words you could ever say  
But I know you'll remember that day  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
The most beautiful words I could ever say
