I'm looking at you but I'm talking to myself  
Looking straight at you but I'm talking to myself  
Talking to myself  
Cause I still can remember  
Words that didn't sound so well planned  
What is wrong with me?  
You don't have to pretend to understand  
  
Every moment, I am thinking to myself  
It seems so different, I am thinking to myself  
Thinking to myself  
And I don't want to face it  
Why is everything so past tense?  
What is wrong with me?  
This just don't seem to make any sense  
  
And I'm looking at you but I'm talking to myself  
Looking straight at you but I'm talking to myself  
  
It wasn't over, I was hoping to myself  
We've got forever, I was hoping to myself  
Hoping to myself  
And for a shred of a second  
I thought we could still change our fate  
What is wrong with me?  
I can see it's already way too late  
  
Cause you're looking at me but you're talking to  
Yourself  
Looking straight at me but you're talking to yourself  
And I'm looking at you but I'm talking to myself  
Looking straight at you but I'm talking to myself
