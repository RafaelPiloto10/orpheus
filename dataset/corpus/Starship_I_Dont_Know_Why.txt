Take me back in time, just before the warm sunrise  
With your love inside of mine, you make my body shine  
All the lonely rules were broken, one magic night  
  
I don't know why  
But I feel like a child today, and I want that feeling to stay  
I don't know why  
But I know it's the only way, whenever I hear you say  
Come and hold me  
  
I can see your face in my mind when your body moves so near  
Love is crossing every line and all time just disappears  
All the shut? doors were opened one magic night  
  
I don't know why  
But I feel like a child today, and I want this feeling to stay  
I don't know why  
But I know it's the only way, whenever I hear you say  
Come and hold me  
  
Yeah  
I don't know why  
But I feel like a child today, and I want this feeling to stay  
I don't know why  
But I know it's the only way, whenever I hear you say  
I'm comin' home to you baby  
  
I feel like a child today  
I don't know why  
Stay now
