I tempered the storm  
Though your faith was small  
I prayed while you slept  
And the night waged war  
We stood at the fire  
And we walked on sea  
And we drank of the wine  
That was made of me  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't turn your eyes from me  
For my love won't be undone  
Don't hide your face from me  
For my light has surely come  
Surely come, surely come  
  
I carried that cross  
And I felt your pain  
I took up your crown  
And I wore your shame  
And death was a fire  
And its teeth were grim  
But I left it behind  
Along with all your sins  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Don't turn away from me  
For my love won't be undone  
Don't hide your face from me  
For my light has surely come  
Surely come, surely come  
  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Heaven is closer than you know  
Lift up your voice and sing  
Know that My love won't let you go  
And I won't forsake you  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Heaven is closer than you know  
Know I'll never leave you  
  
So lift up your voice and sing  
Know that My love won't let you go  
And My light has surely come  
Surely come, surely come  
  
And I'm closer than you know  
And I'm closer than you know  
  
[Bridge]  
Lord I hear you I know You're there  
Closer now than my skin and bones could bare  
Breathing deep within me  
You are always with me  
I can see you where eyes can't stare  
Brighter now than the sun could ever dare  
Breathing all around me  
God I know you're with me here  
(God I know that you are here)  
  
For I am yours and you are mine  
And my soul knows well  
You are here  
You are here  
And my soul will praise you  
And my soul will praise Your name  
Singing Holy is your name  
Jesus  
Jesus
