I ask at miss  
I ask never strong to fly ball  
I'll never, so little fork, if  
Are the love, listen  
  
Or what you need us  
Or what you need us  
See me late us all with me  
Oh, what you need us all of the skies as you need for life?  
Oh, I feel alright  
Feel me late us all  
  
Oh, what you need us?  
Save the curtain falls  
Feel me late us all  
Sve the curtain falls  
  
I ask at miss  
I ask never strong to fly ball  
I'll never, so little fork, if  
Are the love, listen  
  
Oh, what you need us?  
Save the curtain falls  
If the fail all the sail  
Save the curtain falls  
Or what you need us  
Save the curtain falls  
Feel me late us all  
Save the curtain falls  
  
I'm a car of the sail  
As I want for all your own sky or fill  
At school, at noise fail us all  
If every send and or what you need us  
Save the curtain falls  
Feel me late us all  
Save the curtain falls  
  
I'm every fall  
I fill are won't never sick at the sand  
Are you listening?  
Are you're wonder?  
I'm at school all at last  
  
I ask at miss  
I ask never strong to fly ball  
I'll never, so little fork, if  
Are the love, listen
