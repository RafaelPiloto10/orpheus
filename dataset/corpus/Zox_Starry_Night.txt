Lying on my back I feel you breathing  
Sucking down the ghosts into your sleep  
There's something in your spine that makes me nervous  
Black that swells between us grows more deep  
Cut the world in chords  
Making melodies from words  
And I'm confused again  
Take all this abuse cause I ain't got much to lose  
  
It's a starry starry night out here on hope street  
But hope gives way to hunger when you're poor  
With pockets full of promises and poems  
I know that you ain't worth much anymore  
Spoke in broken time  
Twisted rhythms, crooked rhymes  
And I'm confused again  
Paint my world in blue  
Cause I've never liked to lose  
  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
  
Standing in the half light of the morning  
I watch the shadows lace across my shoes  
There's something in your voice that makes me nervous  
If I can tell we're lying, why can't you?  
The song that's in my head  
Is playing backwards in this bed  
And I'm confused again  
Seems like I have to choose  
It feels like either way I lose  
  
Cause I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
Well I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
  
Spoke in broken time  
Crooked rhythms, twisted rhymes  
And I'm confused again  
Either way I choose  
I know I'm gonna lose  
  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
(I don't think I want to spend another night with you)  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
(I don't think I want to spend another night with you)  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
(I don't think I want to spend another night with you)  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
(I don't think I want to spend another night with you)  
Come On!
