Any day, you'll be gone, oh yeah  
Any day, you'll be gone  
  
Any day now  
I will hear you say goodbye my love  
Then you'll be on your way  
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown  
Any day now, I'll be all alone  
I know that, hey, I know that  
  
Any day now  
When the clock strikes go, you'll call it off  
And then my tears will flow  
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town  
Any day now, love will let me down  
Cause you won't be around  
No baby now, yeah  
  
I know I shouldn't want to keep you  
If you don't want to stay  
Until you're gone forever  
I'll be holding on for dear life  
Holding you this way  
And I'm begging you to stay  
  
Any day now  
When your restless eyes meet someone new  
And to my sad surprise  
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town  
Any day now, I won't last for long  
Cause any day, you'll be gone  
Then any day, you'll be gone  
I know, I know that  
  
You'll be gone, you'll be gone, you'll be gone  
Yeah, mercy, any day now  
Any day, you'll be gone  
Mercy, yeah  
Any day, you'll be gone
