Whenever my soul is lonely  
Whenever I'm feeling blue  
I start thinkin' 'bout my blue eyed darlin'  
And my heart starts pinin' for you  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to hear that high lonesome sound  
Cause my sweet baby ain't around  
When my life's got me down  
I want to hear that high lonesome sound  
  
When I'm lost in this ocean of darkness  
Not knowing which way I should turn  
And my eyes are filled with sadness  
Of knowing you'll never return
