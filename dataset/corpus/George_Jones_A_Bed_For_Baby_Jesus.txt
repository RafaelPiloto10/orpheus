Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
That's the song my little three year old sang as I kissed her forehead  
Then very sincere and to my surprise  
A few small tears filled up in her eyes.  
  
And then she said Daddy, where did baby Jesus lay  
And I said Honey, little Jesus had to sleep on the hay  
Then in her prayers that night I heard her softly say  
Jesus, I'll take care of you, come live with me today.  
  
My little girl said Daddy, take my money and buy a little bed  
And put a blanket on Him and kiss His little head  
You know baby Jesus need a place where He can stay all night  
And you can let Him have my room Daddy, that'll be alright.  
  
Well, she drifted off to sleep with a smile on her face  
Just for certain that she'd solved the baby Jesus case  
No one else could help Him on that cold, dark night  
But now my little daughter had made everything alright.  
  
Away in a manger, now He has a bed  
Where the little Lord Jesus can lay down His sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay  
Now the little Lord Jesus don't have to sleep on the hay.  
  
(Away in the manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus layed down His sweet head...)
