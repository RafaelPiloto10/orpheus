She left her neighborhood  
In which everyone was filthy rich  
She left her parent's home  
And strained with a vagabond  
Who made piles of love she never heard  
And she believed his every word  
  
She left no forwarding address  
Just took her youth and happiness  
As with the boy she vanished in  
The secret sweetness of their sin  
  
Oh, young girl  
Oh, young girl of sixteen  
Child of spring-time  
Still green  
Lying there by the road  
  
He told her, "love demanded space"  
So they roamed from place to place  
Although she realized she'd sinned  
She grew caution to the wind  
As she followed him around  
While he slowly dragged her down  
  
So overpowering was her love  
The it had made a captive of  
The young girl's heart and soul and mind  
In other words: love drove her blind  
  
Oh, young girl  
Oh, young girl of sixteen  
Child of spring-time  
Still green  
Laying there by the road  
  
Too much emotion for a girl  
She let her heart become her world  
What world that God has never rocked  
For a sunder we are taught  
Had she been wise and she'd have known  
She could feed him love alone  
  
She should of known the day would come  
When he would quit her just for crumbs  
He needed fresh young meat to love  
And left her heart and mind to starve  
  
Oh, young girl  
Oh, young girl of sixteen  
Child of spring-time  
Still green  
Lying there by the road
