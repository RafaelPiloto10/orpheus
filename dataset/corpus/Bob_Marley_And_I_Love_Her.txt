I give her all my love  
That's all I do  
And if you saw my love  
You'd love her, too  
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree  
  
She gives me everything  
And tenderly  
The kiss my lover brings  
She brings to me  
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree  
  
A love like ours  
Will never die  
As long as I  
Have you near me  
  
Bright as the stars that shine  
Dark as the sky  
I said I know, I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
  
And I love her, oh yessiree, yessiree  
  
Yeah, a love like ours  
Will never die  
As long as I  
Have you near me  
  
Bright as the stars that shine  
As dark as the sky  
I said I know, I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree, yessiree  
  
I love her  
Yes, this love of mine will never die  
Simply 'cause I love her  
I want the world to know that I love her
