Not a lot of time to think today  
It's almost over now  
Didn't need it anyway  
Guess I knew somehow  
  
I feel love around me  
And the feeling grows  
As your love surrounds me  
How was I to know  
That straight out of nowhere  
You'd come to me  
  
Out of the blue  
Into my heart  
You came to me  
Out of the blue  
Into my heart  
  
Never know what life can bring your way  
You never learn  
Over night, from day to day  
Where our love's concerned  
  
It was so hard to hold on  
But I never let go  
For so long, so hard to take  
How was I to know  
That right out of nowhere  
You'd come to me  
  
Out of the blue  
Into my heart  
You came to me  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart  
Ooh girl it was you  
You came out of the blue  
Into my heart  
You came to me  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart  
  
You came to me  
Out of the blue, into my heart  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart  
Ooh girl it was you  
You came out of the blue  
Into my heart  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart  
  
You came to me  
Out of the blue  
And into my heart  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart
