Tonight down here in the valley  
I'm lonesome and oh, how I feel  
As I sit here alone in your cabin  
I can see your mansion on the hill  
  
Do you remember when we parted?  
The story to me you revealed  
You said you could live without love, dear  
In your loveless mansion on the hill  
  
I've waited all through the years. love  
To give you a heart true and real  
'cause I know you are living in sorrow  
In your loveless mansion on the hill  
  
The light shines bright from your window  
The trees stand so silent and still  
I know you're alone with your pride, dear  
In your loveless mansion on the hill
