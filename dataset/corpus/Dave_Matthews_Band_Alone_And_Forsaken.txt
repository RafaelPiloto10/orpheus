Born in the springtime when blossoms unfold  
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold  
Our life was in flower as summer grew on  
And life like the leaves now has withered and gone  
  
The roses have died, there's alone  
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore  
The grass in the valley is starting to die  
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
Please understand  
  
Oh, where have you gone, where can you be  
How you forsaken some others like me  
You promised to honor, to love and obey  
As each vow was a plaything that you threw away  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
  
Please understand  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
Please understand  
  
The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray  
A hound in the distance beginning to bey  
I wonder, I wonder - what she's thinking of  
Forsaken, forgotten - without any love  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
Please understand  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
Please understand  
  
Alone and forsaken  
Alone and forsaken  
Alone and forsaken
