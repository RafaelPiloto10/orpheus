It must have happened sometime in the night  
No one saw the stone be rolled away  
When the grave saw morning light  
The skeptics and friends all had to say  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
My soul is like a tomb in constant night  
Till one day the stone was rolled away  
Then my heart saw morning light  
And no one alive can explain it away  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
Now, now won't you see  
What I'm trying to say?  
If you believe, it could happen today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
It's a miracle, what a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, what a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
(It's a miracle)  
You know it's really a miracle  
A miracle, a miracle  
(It's a miracle)  
You know it's really a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
(It's a miracle)  
You know it's really a miracle  
A miracle, a miracle  
(It's a miracle)  
You know it's really a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away
