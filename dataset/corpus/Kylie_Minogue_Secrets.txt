Still don't know how he got my number  
Thought I'd got him out of my life  
But I agreed to see him just one time  
Never thought I'd fall for him twice  
  
Ohh, you've gotta hear my confession  
I believe it's long overdue  
I can't think of living without you  
I'd understand if that's what you'd want to do  
  
[Chorus]  
There are  
Secrets that you never know  
Secrets in a private room  
Secrets that I kept from you  
Pillow talk in the afternoon  
  
Never wanted to hurt you  
Didn't really want to deceive  
I was so afraid if I told you  
Your broken heart would force you to leave  
I think I knew what I was doing  
By falling into his arms again  
I wish I'd seen right through him  
But I'm telling you 'cause I'm so ashamed  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Ohh, you've gotta hear my confession  
I believe it's long overdue  
I can't think of living without you  
I'd understand if that's what you'd want to do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Secrets, secrets, secrets  
Pillow talk in the afternoon  
  
[Chorus until fade]
