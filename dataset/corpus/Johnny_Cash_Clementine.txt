(Oh my darling Clementine)  
She knew that Cody was the man she wanted but she had waited nearly all her
life  
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye  
Then he'd be back to take her for his wife (don't you worry) Clementine  
Cody saddled up and left his darling then rode to town to celebrate his plan  
He told 'em this would be his last carousing  
  
I'm gonna settle down boys if I can (with my darling) Clementine  
Someone said it must have been past midnight when Cody had to face a jealous
man  
Another story goes that no one really knows  
But it seems there was a dancehall girl called Nan (don't you tell) Clementine  
We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room  
Then there was a silence in the place  
  
Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down  
They found Cody lying on his face (softly calling) Clementine  
So buddies make a monument to lay down at his head  
Sure you hate to leave your pal behind  
  
Mother help your daughter put her wedding dress away  
Cause Cody won't be riding back this time (to his darling) Clementine
