I made a mistake, yes, I did, yes, I did  
Made a mistake, yes, I did, yes, I did  
Now I'm so far from her, but it was me and my fate  
Who lost because of my mistake  
  
My trusting her has gone much too late  
I've sent away the girl I love  
I said, I've sent away the girl I love  
She well gone, people crying  
  
Said, my bold heart been dying  
Who is it who made that mistake?  
Who is it who made that mistake?  
Oh, what a fool I've been tonight  
  
The girl I love is out of sight  
Now I'm so far from her, but it was me and my fate  
Who lost because of my mistake  
My trusting her has gone much too late  
  
Oh, what a fool I've been tonight  
The girl I love is out of sight  
Now I'm so far from her, but it was me and my fate  
Who lost because of my mistake, my, my mistake  
Who lost because of my mistake
