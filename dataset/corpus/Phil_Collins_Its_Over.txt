(released as b-side of 'dance into the light' single, 1996)  
  
With a young man, with his heart on his sleeve  
Had the body of a man, and a trust of a child  
He never meant to hurt anybody  
  
But he broke some hearts along the way  
  
Ooh, it's all over  
Ooh, it's all done  
Ooh, it's all over  
Or, has it just begun?  
  
All that he spoke came right from his heart  
Though some had been hurt by the things he had said  
Go walking in the long grass to find his peace  
Sometimes it'd grow so tall he'd lose his way  
  
Ooh, now it's all over  
Ooh, it's all done  
Ooh, it's all over  
Or, has it just begun?  
  
Ooh, it's all over  
Ooh, it's all done  
Ooh, it's all over  
Or, has it just begun?
