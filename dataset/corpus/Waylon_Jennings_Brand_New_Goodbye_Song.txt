Baby, go down to the drugstore, buy me a guitar string  
And be sure to wear your coat, girl, 'cause it might rain  
'Cause honey, you know that rain is bad for my guitar strings  
Put on your warm coat honey, it's gonna be cold tonight  
Put on the one that's warm and long  
'Cause you're just before hearin' my brand new goodbye song  
Baby, I've tried your doctors, they just couldn't make me well  
The higher I tried to climb, the further I fell  
Guess it must have blew my mind sniffing the fumes of Hell  
Put on your warm coat honey, it's gonna be cold tonight  
Put on the one that's warm and long  
You're just before hearin' my brand new goodbye song  
Baby, throw away my pillow just before you turn the light  
All you'll have next to you now will be the night  
I'll be somewhere wrong, you'll be somewhere right  
Put on your warm coat honey, it's gonna be cold tonight  
Put on the one that's warm and long  
You're just before hearin' my brand new goodbye song
