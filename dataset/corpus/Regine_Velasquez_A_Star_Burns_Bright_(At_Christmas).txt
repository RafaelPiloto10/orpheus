A star burns bright (At christmas)  
  
A star burns bright  
In the sky tonight  
Shines for every boy and girl  
Across the world tonight  
  
Be it near or far  
No matter where you are  
There's a wish for every child  
Upon that guiding star....  
  
It's a wish for peace on earth  
And goodwill to us all  
From the children of the world  
Peace on earth and good will to man  
Merry Christmas to all your friends  
  
So reach out a hand  
For as one we'll stand  
To send a hope for peace  
To every troubled land.  
  
For a star burns bright (A star burns bright)  
In the sky tonight (In the sky tonight)  
With a wish for every child  
To follow that guiding light  
  
It's a wish for peace on earth  
And goodwill to us all  
From the children of world  
  
Merry Christmas to us all  
From the children of the world  
Peace on earth and goodwill to man  
Merry Christmas to all our friends
