Ooh, oh  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for a place to go  
Where they play the right music  
Getting in the swing  
You come in to look for a king  
  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing queen feel the beat of the tambourine, oh yeah  
  
You can dance, you can jive  
Having the time of your life  
Ooh, see that girl  
Watch that scene dig in the dancing queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another  
Anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing queen feel the beat of the tambourine, oh yeah  
  
You can dance, you can jive  
Having the time of your life  
Ooh, see that girl  
Watch that scene dig in the dancing queen  
  
Dig in the dancing queen, oh yeah  
Dancing queen  
(Dance with me, I want to be your partner)  
Dancing Queen  
(Dance with me, I want to be your partner)  
Dancing queen  
(Dance with me, I want to be your partner)  
Dancing queen  
Dig in the dancing queen  
Dancing queen  
(Dance with me)  
Dance with me  
(Dance with me)  
Dig in the dancing queen  
Dancing queen ['till fade)
