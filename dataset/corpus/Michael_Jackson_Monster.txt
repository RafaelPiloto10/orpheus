You can look at them climbing up the walls  
You can look at them climbing out the bushes  
You can find them when their letters 'bout to fall  
He'll be waiting with his camera on focus  
Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster  
When you look up in the air, there's a monster  
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster  
  
Too bad, Hollywood  
(Has got you jumping like you should)  
Too bad  
(Has got you bouncing off the wall,  
Got you drunk enough to fall)  
Too bad  
Hollywood  
Just look in the mirror,  
And tell me you like  
Don't you, don't you like it?  
  
Monster  
He's a monster  
He's an animal  
Monster (yeah)  
He's a monster  
He's an animal  
  
He's coming at ya, coming at ya rather too fast  
On the ceiling momma got you in a zigzag  
And you're running, and you're running just to escape it  
But they're coming for the money so they take it  
Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster  
When you look up in the air, there's a monster  
Oh, when you see them in the street there's a monster, monster, monster  
  
Too bad, Hollywood  
(Has got you jumping like you should)  
(Has got you bouncing off the wall)  
(Got you drunk enough to fall)  
Too bad  
Hollywood  
Just look in the mirror,  
And tell me you like what you see

(Everybody wanna be a star)  
  
Why are they, never satisfied  
With in all you give  
You give them your all  
They're watching you fall  
And they eat yourself  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Catch me in a bad mood, flippin'  
You'll take a whippin'  
Animal, hannibal, cannibal addition  
Tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision  
Fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin'  
Shiver a second,  
Now, now, now, now what is it  
Funeral's, cemeteries, don't worry it's time to visit  
Broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I'm kidding  
Its home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden  
All hell, run tell, the King has risen  
Two thousand and ten Thriller, there's nothing iller, it's killer  
There vision, the missin' the pack, this is that,  
This the bomb, ring the alarm  
MJ number 1, it's goes on and on  
Its goes on and on  
We get to crippin', its running in the early morn'  
Keep on dreaming there's nowhere to run  
You can drive but you done  
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come.  
  
Too bad, Hollywood  
(Has got you jumping like you should)  
(Got you bouncing off the wall,  
(Got you drunk enough to fall)  
Too bad  
Hollywood  
Just making it clearer, and tell me  
Don't you, don't you like it?  
  
Monster
