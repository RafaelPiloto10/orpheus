Dozens of girls would storm up  
I had to lock my door  
Somehow I couldn't warm up  
To one before  
  
What was it that controlled me?  
What kept my love life lean?  
My intuition told me  
You'd come on the scene  
  
Lady, listen to the rhythm of my heartbeat  
And you'll get just what I mean  
Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!  
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!  
  
Just one look at you, my heart grew tipsy in me  
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me!  
I love all the many charms about you!  
Above all I want these arms about you  
Don't be a naughty baby  
Come to daddy, come to daddy, do!  
My sweet embraceable you!  
  
Just one look at you, my heart grew tipsy in me  
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me!  
I love all the many charms about you!  
Above all I want these arms about you  
Now don't be a naughty baby,  
  
Come to daddy, come to daddy, do!  
My sweet embraceable you!
