From Justus  
Why is it never enough  
No matter what I do?  
I gave it all that I've got  
And it's always too few  
  
And now you're asking for more  
Why do I hesitate?  
Cause I know in the end  
That it's always too late  
And not enough for you  
  
I've often heard you say  
You've got to seize the day  
That when your life is gone,  
Oh how it's gone for so long  
  
But there are often times  
When life is not so kind  
And there are those around  
Who need your feet on the ground  
  
And it's not enough  
It's never enough  
I don't stand a chance  
To fill your sweet lovin' cup  
Cause it's not enough  
It's never enough  
It's not enough for you  
  
Oh, I long for all those years  
Wasted alone with these endless tears  
  
And it's not enough  
It's never enough  
I don't stand a chance  
To fill your sweet lovin' cup  
  
Cause it's not enough  
It's never enough  
  
It's not enough for you  
It's not enough  
It's never enough  
I don't stand a chance  
To fill your sweet lovin' cup  
Cause it's not enough  
It's never enough  
It's not enough for you  
For you
