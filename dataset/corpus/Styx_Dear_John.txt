Dear John I knew you  
About as well as anyone  
We were the wild ones  
So sure those days would never end  
Now they're only memories my friend  
  
Dear John I'll see you  
Some day again  
  
I swear I saw you  
On a crowded street today  
I almost called your name  
Thinking of all those yesterdays  
Heaven help me  
How I miss my friend  
  
Dear John I'll see you  
Some day again  
  
There'll be a celebration  
When all will be revealed  
We'll have a reunion  
High on a hill  
  
Dear John how are you  
God know it's heaven where you are  
Find some peace there  
May it never end  
  
Dear John my heart knows  
We'll meet again  
Dear John I'll see you....  
Some day again
