Get up, stand up, stand up for your right (3 times)  
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight  
  
Preacher man don't tell me heaven is under the earth  
I know you don't know what life is really worth  
Is not all that glitters in gold and  
Half the story has never been told  
So now you see the light, aay  
Stand up for your right. come on  
  
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right  
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight  
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right  
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight  
  
Most people think great god will come from the sky  
Take away ev'rything, and make ev'rybody feel high  
But if you know what life is worth  
You would look for yours on earth  
And now you see the light  
You stand up for your right, yeah!  
  
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right  
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight  
Get up, stand up. life is your right  
So we can't give up the fight  
Stand up for your right, lord, lord  
Get up, stand up. keep on struggling on  
Don't give up the fight  
  
We're sick and tired of your ism and schism game  
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name, lord  
We know when we understand  
Almighty god is a living man  
You can fool some people sometimes  
But you can't fool all the people all the time  
So now we see the light  
We gonna stand up for our right  
  
So you'd better get up, stand up, stand up for your right  
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight  
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right  
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight.
