We're not in love  
Anymore.  
I'm like a rich man  
Gone poor.  
All my treasures are stolen.  
Yeah, all my treasures are stolen.  
My baby,  
My baby,  
My baby,  
My baby,  
Yeah my baby is gone.  
Without your heart  
Anymore  
I'm like a room  
With no door.  
Now when I walk and crawl,  
Now when I walk and crawl,  
But my baby,  
Yeah, my baby,  
But my baby,  
My baby,  
My baby is gone.  
We're not in love  
Anymore.  
I'm like a rich man  
Gone poor.  
All my treasures are stolen.  
Yeah, all my treasures are stolen.  
Oh my baby,  
Yeah, my baby  
Oh my baby,  
Yeah, my baby,  
My baby  
My baby,  
Oh oh, my baby  
Oh my baby,  
My baby,  
My baby is gone  
Oh yeah
