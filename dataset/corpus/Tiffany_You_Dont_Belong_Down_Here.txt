Sky rise so haunting on the other side of the street  
Two thin white lines between where you are and where you should be  
I know sometimes when you fly you think you're larger than life  
But then you come crashing down and you're asleep on the ground  
A king without his crown  
Chorus:  
You don't belong down here  
You don't belong down here  
You don't belong down here  
Anymore, not ever  
This park is an island in a sea of despair  
In the heart of the city of angels who aren't even there  
I see you praying for hope while you keep worshipping dope  
The devil right by your side and I see death in your eyes  
Will you live or do you have the will to die  
CHORUS  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
I want to do things before they become  
The things I should have done in my life  
CHORUS  
We don't belong down here  
You don't belong down here  
You don't belong and we don't belong  
We don't belong down here  
We don't belong down here  
We don't belong  
No one belongs down here anymore  
Not ever
