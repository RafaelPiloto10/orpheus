Picked you up and let you down and  
I never said a word  
But I'm different now and I'm glad that you're my girl  
Mess you 'round and upset you  
I hurt you most of all  
But I'm different now and I'm glad that you're my girl  
  
Fun lasts for seconds, love lasts for days but  
But you can't have both  
And I'm different now but I'm glad that you're my girl  
  
Because I know I done some things  
That I should never have done  
But I'm different now and I'm glad that you're my girl
