In America you'll get food to eat  
Won't have to run through the jungle  
And scuff up your feet  
You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day  
It's great to be an American  
Ain't no lions or tigers-ain't no mamba snake  
Just the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake  
Everybody is as happy as a man can be  
  
Climb aboard, little wog-sail away with me  
Sail away, sail away  
We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay  
Sail away, sail away  
We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay  
  
In America every man is free  
To take care of his home and his family  
You'll be (as) happy as a monkey in a monkey tree  
You're gonna be an American  
Sail away, sail away  
We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay  
Sail away, sail away  
We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay
