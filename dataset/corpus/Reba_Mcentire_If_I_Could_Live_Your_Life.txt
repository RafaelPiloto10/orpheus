You jet from coast to coast  
Dressed in designer clothes  
When you appear somewhere  
Your chauffeur drives you there  
I would think twice  
If I could live your life  
  
You see your friends at the store  
Your sister lives next door  
You kiss your babies goodnight  
Your husbands there at your side  
I'd love to give it a try  
If I could live your life  
  
If I could trade places with you  
Hear the roar of the crowd  
And the church bells in a quiet town  
Just for one moment in time  
I wonder what this world would be like  
If I could live your life  
  
Saw your picture in 'People' today  
And I see you're in PTA  
Your livin' everyone's dream  
It isn't all that it seems  
Wouldn't it all be nice  
If I could live your life  
  
If I could trade places with you  
Hear the roar of the crowd  
And the church bells in a quiet town  
Just for one moment in time  
I wonder what this world would be like  
If I could live your life  
  
If I could live your life, if I could live your life
