You ain't never fell as far as when you fall in love  
Except the fall you take when you've been loved and given up  
When you have your heart and soul rubbed into the dirt  
An eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper will take away the hurt  
  
Give me an eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper  
And I'll start feeling I forgot her  
Get a little loose and lose her memory  
And I won't think I'm close to dying  
Because it dries up all my crying  
An eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper always sets me free  
  
It ain't easy losing love although it's turned out bad  
All at once you're turning off old feelings you once had  
But I found a helping hand right here in my hand  
And eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper will help me take 'em out  
  
Give me an eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper  
And I'll start feeling I forgot her  
Get a little loose and lose her memory  
And I won't think I'm close to dying  
Because it dries up all my crying  
An eighty-proof bottle of tear-stopper always sets me free
