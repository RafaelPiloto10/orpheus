Many souls are driftin' on the troubled sea of sin  
The under tow of evil has pulled so many in  
Tonight the troubled ways of sorrow fill our hearts with pride  
And we're so blind that we can't see the beacon in the night.  
  
The beacon in the night is always shinin'  
And darkest clouds can have a silver linin'  
Just set your torch for glory then don't turn left or right  
Heavens shore is lighted by the beacon in the night.  
  
When the mist of wickedness conceals the beacon's light  
And you're driftin' through the fog somewhere out in the night  
The one who whispers peace be still and calms the raging sea  
He is the beacon in the night, He'll rescue you and me.  
  
The beacon in the night is always shinin'  
And storm clouds can have a silver linin'  
So set your course for glory and don't turn left or right  
Be guided straight to Heaven by the beacon in the night
