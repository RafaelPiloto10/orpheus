You're flying like a fly  
In a sky blue sky  
You'll be important to the important people  
When you die  
And I'll settle for a medal  
Johnny Appleseed  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're a breath of insulation  
In my draftic attic brain  
You're sweeter than the sweet  
Cream ladies buzzed on sugar cane  
And so the vultures are migrating  
To a nastier migraine  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
I'm first lieutenant to you I am  
Johnny Appleseed  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
You're so cherry  
I'm first lieutenant to you I am  
Johnny Appleseed  
Etc...
