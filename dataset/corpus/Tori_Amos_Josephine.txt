Not tonight josephine.  
In an army's strength therein  
Lies the denouement. From  
Here you're haunting me. By  
The Seine so beautiful, only  
Not to be of use, impossible.  
So strange, victory, 1200 spires  
The only sound, moscow burning.  
Empty like the Tuileries. Like a dream  
Vienna seems, only not to be of use- impossible.  
In the last extremity, to  
Advance or not to advance, I  
Hear you laughing  
Even still you're calling me  
"not tonight, not tonight  
Not tonight"  
Josephine
