Starlight, starbright  
Wishing on the first star of the night  
I wish I may  
I wish I might  
Make all your dreams  
Come true tonight  
  
As your drift  
Off to sleep  
Angels guard the memories you keep  
Now close your eyes  
And dream away  
And you'll awaken on Christmas day  
  
Starlight, starbright  
Shining on my little one tonight  
I wish I may  
I wish I might  
Make all your dreams  
Come true for you tonight
