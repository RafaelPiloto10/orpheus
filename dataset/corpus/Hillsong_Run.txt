You were God from the outset  
Powerful and creative  
You who saw us here before You called  
All the stars and the earth to existence  
  
You are God You are holy  
History is Your story  
You who was and is  
And who forever will be  
God we live for Your glory  
  
So we will run  
All together our hearts aflame  
With a fire that can't be tamed  
Our God all glory to Your Name  
Jesus  
  
You are God You are freedom  
You're alive now within us  
You who saw us here before  
You conquered the grave  
And delivered on the promise  
  
We will run  
Our surrender to bring You fame  
Our desire that You be praised  
Our God all glory to Your Name  
Jesus
