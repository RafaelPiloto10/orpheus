We been runnin' away from  
Somethin' we both know  
We've long run out of things to say  
And I think I better go  
  
So don't be getting' excited  
When you hear that slammin' door  
'Cause there'll be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin'  
  
And we've been hidin' from somethin'  
That should have never gone this far  
But after all it's what we've done  
That makes us what we are  
  
And you been talkin' in silence  
If it's silence you adore  
Oh there'll be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Well there'll be one less set of footsteps on your floor  
One less man to walk in  
One less pair of jeans upon your door  
One less voice a'talkin'  
  
But tomorrow's a dream away  
Today has turned to dust  
Your silver tongue has turned to clay  
And your golden rule to rust  
If that's the way that you want it  
That's the way I want it more  
There'll be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There'll be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin'
