You know I like my chicken fried  
Cold beer on a Friday night  
A pair of jeans that fit just right  
And the radio on  
  
Well I was raised underneath the shade of a Georgia pine  
And that's home you know  
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine  
Where the peaches grow  
And my house it's not much to talk about  
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground  
And a little bit of chicken fried  
  
Cold beer on a Friday night  
A pair of jeans that fit just right  
And the radio up  
I like to see the sunrise  
See the love in my woman's eyes  
Feel the touch of a precious child  
And know a mother's love  
  
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most  
Not where you live, what you drive or the price tag on your clothes  
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I've come to know  
So if you agree have a drink with me  
Raise you glasses for a toast  
To a little bit of chicken fried  
  
And cold beer on a Friday night  
A pair of jeans that fit just right  
And the radio up  
I like to see the sunrise  
See the love in my woman's eyes  
Feel the touch of a precious child  
And know a mother's love  
  
I thank god for my life  
And for the stars and stripes  
May freedom forever fly, let it ring.  
Salute the ones who died  
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice  
All the things we love  
Like our chicken fried  
  
And cold beer on a Friday night  
A pair of jeans that fit just right  
And the radio up  
I like to see the sunrise  
See the love in my woman's eyes  
Feel the touch of a precious child  
And know a mother's love  
  
Getcha a little chicken fried  
And cold beer on a Friday night  
A pair of jeans that fit just right  
And the radio up  
I like to see the sunrise  
See the love in my woman's eyes  
Feel the touch of my precious child  
And know a mother's love
