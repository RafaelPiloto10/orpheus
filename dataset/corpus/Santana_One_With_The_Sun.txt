You in time with music of the universe  
Doctor of mother earth  
We are all one  
We are all one with the sun  
  
Reflecting words to say  
Silently I want to be  
With symphonies of stars  
You came singing through my soul  
I see you in the golden sunset  
Glowing through my soul  
We are all one with the sun  
  
In the summertime we went to the sea  
How smooth plate how calm against  
These skies dancing in your eyes.
