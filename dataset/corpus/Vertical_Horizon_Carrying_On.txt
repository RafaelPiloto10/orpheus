The waves on the shore, can't be ignored  
Soon they're all around you  
The cavalry fail, they've all gone  
But you're holding on  
Somehow is not what you asked for  
  
Why do you cry in the morning  
When the line is just forming  
I know you think I'm just carrying on  
When I've been where you're going  
And it's not worth knowing  
Burning the days I'm just carrying on  
  
The search for the way, to harvest the pain  
'Cause all of is contagious  
Knowing your head, no control of what you let go  
Sometimes, it's not what you dreamed of  
  
Why do you cry in the mornig  
When the line is just forming  
I know you think I'm just carrying on  
When I've been where you're going  
And it's not worth knowing  
Burning the days I'm just carrying on  
  
And after all that you've forgotten  
You still don't understand  
You think the world broke it's promise  
But it just slipped right through your hands  
  
Tell me why do you cry in the morning  
When the line is just forming  
I know you think I'm just carrying on  
But I've been where you're going  
And it's not worth knowing  
Burning the days I'm just carrying on  
  
Oh carrying on  
  
The waves on the shore  
Can't be ignored
