[Chorus:]  
  
You supply the night,  
Baby, I'll supply the love  
You supply the night,  
Baby, I'll supply the love  
  
I see a horseman in the sky,  
It makes me turn and wonder why  
I hear the same old fourteen reasons,  
Must be the changing of the seasons  
  
I met the girl across the sea,  
She saved my life and came with me  
A tender night of dark persuasion,  
Could be my first and last occasion  
  
Baby, I'll supply the love,  
baby, I'll supply the,  
I'll supply the love
