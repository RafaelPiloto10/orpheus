Now and then I must admit  
I hide behind my shallowness  
I must confess I don't begin to say enough  
I'll tell you of my lessons learned  
But I may never quite express  
  
That God blessed me far beyond  
What I deserve  
I often miss the chance to show my  
Faith in Him  
By failing to convey what I have seen  
And then I wonder while I face eternity  
How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede  
For me  
  
[Chorus:]  
What's He gonna say about me  
When He weighs the works that  
I have done  
Against the words that I have  
Failed to speak  
What's He gonna say about me  
When the chaff is sifted from the wheat  
Will there be evidence that I believed  
What's He gonna say about me  
  
After this lifetime will come  
The thankfulness that I forget  
I will regret when I see clearly who He is  
Then I'll know all I should have said  
So I must choose to not neglect  
But resurrect the praise for all He is to me  
I often miss the chance to show my faith in Him  
By failing to convey what I have seen  
And then I wonder while I face eternity  
How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede  
For me, oh  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
If I confess Him before men  
He will confess me before the  
Father in heaven  
  
[Chorus:]
