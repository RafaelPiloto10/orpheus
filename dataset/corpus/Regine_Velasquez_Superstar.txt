Long ago, and, oh so far away  
I fell in love with you  
Before the second show.  
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear,  
But you're not really here.  
It's just the radio.  
Don't you remember you told me  
You loved me baby?  
You said you'd be coming back this way  
Again baby.  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby.  
I love you, I really do.  
Loneliness is such a sad affair,  
And I can hardly wait  
To be with you again.  
What to say, to make you come again?  
Come back to me again,  
And play your sad guitar.
