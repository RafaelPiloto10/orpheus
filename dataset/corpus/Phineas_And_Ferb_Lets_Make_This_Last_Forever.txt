I need a kick drum,  
A guitar now,  
And a bass line,  
Gonna show you how,  
  
How to rock  
How to dance  
How to get down,  
And all I need is a piano in my track now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Throw your hands  
Throw your hands  
Throw your hands  
Throw your hands up  
(Whoa, whoa)  
  
Cause you can't  
Cause you can't  
Cause you can't  
Cause you can't stop  
(Whoa, whoa)  
  
Can you hear me (hey)  
Do you feel it (hey)  
If you're with me go  
1-2-3  
'Cause we're here  
And we're now and we're all together  
So let's make this last forever  
  
Turn the amps up  
Turn the lights down  
Brush yourself off  
I'm a show you how  
  
How to rock  
How to dance  
How to get down,  
Everybody on the floor now  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Lets make this last forever(3x)  
  
Of all the stars in the sky tonight  
Compared to us  
Well they don't shine quite as bright  
  
[Chorus: X2]
