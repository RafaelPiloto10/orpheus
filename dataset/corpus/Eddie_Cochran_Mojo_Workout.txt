I got my mojo workin', well my mojo workin'  
Well now my mojo workin', well my mojo workin'  
Well now my mojo workin', but it just won't work on you  
You grab your little girl and you spin her around  
You grab both hands and you holler out loud  
You turn and you turn till you're back to back  
You move your feet and then you don't look back  
You do the mojo workout, well the mojo workout  
You do the mojo workout till you just can't work no more  
Shuffle right on back and you hold on tight  
A-hoppin' and a-boppin' from a left to right  
Snap your fingers and turn all around  
You do a little chicken and you holler out loud  
You do the mojo workout, ah work out now  
  
Just one more thing that you gotta learn to do  
You stomp and you romp and you do the goochie-goo  
You wiggle and you turn and away you go  
That's the way you do the mojo  
You do the mojo workout, I mean the mojo workout  
You do the mojo workout till you just can't work no more  
I got my mojo workin', ooh my mojo workin'
