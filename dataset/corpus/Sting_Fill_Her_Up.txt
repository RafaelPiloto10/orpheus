Mobil station where I stand  
This old gas pump in my hand  
My boss don't like me, got a face like a weasel  
Oil on my hands and the smell of diesel  
Here comes a big shot from the city  
V8 engine, she runs so pretty  
'Fill her up son, unleaded  
I need a full tank of gas where I'm headed'  
Up in the front seat a pretty red head  
'We're going to Vegas we're gonna get wed'  
'So fill her up son, don't be staring  
That's a real diamond she be wearing'  
I'm gonna take my baby one day  
I'm gonna fill her up and head west  
I'm going find some money all right  
See those tail lights heading west  
I got no money to invest  
Got no prospects, no education  
I was lucky getting a job at this gas station  
That old cash box on the top shelf  
The boss is sleeping, I'll just help myself  
Let's consider this as just a loan  
I can sort it out later on the phone  
I'm gonna pick my girl up tonight  
I'm gonna fill her up and head west  
I'm gonna show her all the bright lights  
We're gonna say we lived 'for we come home  
And as I head through the woods on the way back  
The evening sun is slanting through the pine trees real pretty  
It's like I walked into a glade of heaven  
And there's music playing  
This money is cold in my hand  
And a voice somewhere is saying  
'Why would you wanna take that stolen thing  
And what real happiness can it bring?'  
You're gonna fill her up with sadness  
You're gonna fill her up with shame  
You're gonna fill her up with sorrow  
Before she even takes your name  
You're gonna fill her up with madness  
You're gonna fill her up with blame  
You're gonna live with no tomorrow  
You're gonna fill her up with pain  
You're gonna fill her up with darkness  
You're gonna fill her up with night  
You gotta fill her up with Jesus  
You gotta fill her up with light  
You gotta fill her up with spirit  
You gotta fill her up with grace  
You gotta fill her up with heaven  
You got the rest of life to face  
You gotta fill her up the right way  
You gotta fill her up with care  
You gotta fill her up with babies  
You gotta fill her up and swear  
You're gonna love that girl forever  
You're gonna fill her up for life  
You're gonna be a loving husband  
She's gonna be your loving wife  
You gotta fill her up with gladness  
You gotta fill her up with joy  
You gotta fill her up with love  
You gotta fill her up with love
