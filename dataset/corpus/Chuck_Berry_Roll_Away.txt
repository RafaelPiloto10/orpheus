Oh, well, look-a here what a good day we got today  
Why don't we get in the car, baby, and find some game to play  
Just let the top down now and get in and let us roll away  
  
Hey diddle, diddle, the dude told a riddle  
And the chick jumped over the seat  
So he kept her laughing, just to see such sport  
Because the dude thought the jump was neat  
  
Oh, well, look-a here what a good day we got today  
Why don't we jump in the car, baby, and go find some place to play  
Come on let the top down, get in and let's roll away  
  
A little country boy came to blow his horn  
The dude was in the meadow and the chick was in the corn  
Where was the dude that was driving the car  
Underneath the corn stalk playing guitar  
  
Oh, well, look-a there what a good day they got today  
Hey, djumping in the car and going to find some place to play  
And let the top down, baby, get in and let's roll away  
  
The little boy peeped and saw a big heap  
But he couldn't tell hide nor hair  
So he left the crack and they finally came back  
But they forgot and left the guitar there  
  
Oh, well, well, well, what a good day we got today  
Why don't we get back in the car, baby, and talk about the games we play  
Let's just let the top up, put her in and just roll away
