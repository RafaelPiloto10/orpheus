Teddy's rolling now most every night  
Skatin' backwards at the speed of light  
He's changed in a thousand little ways  
He's changed yes indeed  
You know he's movin' on metal yes he's  
Hanging tight with the Jack of Speed  
  
Sheena's party there's a case in point  
That right wing hooey sure stunk up the joint  
He's gone he walks through the old routines  
But he's gone guaranteed  
He may be sittin' in the kitchen, but he's  
Steppin' out with the Jack of Speed  
  
You maybe got lucky for a few good years  
But there's no way back from there to here  
He's a one way rider  
On the shriek express  
And his new best friend is at the throttle more or less  
  
He can't hear you honey, that's alright  
Pack some things and head up into the light  
Don't stop, he'll be callin' out your name  
But don't stop when you hear him plead  
You better move now little darlin' or you'll be  
Trading fours with the Jack of Speed
