Can you tell the moment?  
Spring becomes the summer  
Maybe it's a moment  
Only known to a tree  
  
Even as we're watching  
Blades of grass are growing  
Leaps and bounds, so tiny  
That our eyes cannot see  
  
And how does a bud  
Decide it's a rose  
Perhaps there's a time  
When it somehow knows it  
  
Can you tell the moment?  
If there's such a moment  
When you just become  
What you were not before  
  
Is there any sign or warning  
Or do you awake one morning  
Knowing that you must have turned  
A special corner?  
  
Maybe in an April shower  
Something tells a bud to flower  
What is it that tells you  
You're a child no more
