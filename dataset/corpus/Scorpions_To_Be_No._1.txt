Give me a job  
The one I havn't got  
Don't write me off at anytime  
Don't ever leave me unsatisfied  
I don't want to come in a second  
I just want to come  
Don't want to be the last in line  
Don't want to be just left behind  
  
And in the evening when I come home  
It is time to throw my dog a bone  
That's when I wear my shirt that says  
In capital letters In capital letters  
  
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one  
(He's got no job, got no blow got no Monica to go to)  
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one  
(He's a superstar, wunderbar, out of touch too much)  
  
Don't tell me I'm small  
An inch too short  
I might not be your size but I'm sure great  
And definitely underpaid  
So give me a job  
The one I haven't got  
Don't tell me I'm too poor to join the club  
To hang out with the big shots  
  
And in the evening when I come home  
It is time to give my dog a bone  
That's when I wear my shirt that says  
In capital letters In capital letters  
  
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one  
(He's got no job, got no blow, got no Monica to go to)  
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one  
(He's a V.I.P. wannabe, all he ever wants is)  
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one  
Isn't it fun fun fun yeah to be number one  
(He's a V.I.P. wannabe all he ever wants is)  
To be number one  
  
And in the evening when I come home  
It is time to throw my dog a bone  
That's when I wear my shirt that says  
In capital letters In capital letters  
  
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one  
(He's got no job, got no blow got no Monica to go to)  
Isn't it fun fun fun yeah to be number one  
(He's a superstar, wunderbar, out of touch too much)  
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one  
Isn't it fun fun fun fun to be number one  
To be number one

To be number one  
To be number one

(He's got no job, got no blow got no Monica to go to)
