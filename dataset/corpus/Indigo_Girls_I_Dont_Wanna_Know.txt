Well you followed me this far  
Did you find out what's inside  
Can you tell me what I'm doing  
Is it something I should hide  
I don't know for sure  
I don't wanna find out what I left there for  
  
I'm not scared and I'm not lonely  
Saving all my money or my breath  
I'm not looking for an answer  
Or anyone to second guess no  
  
You told me all your secrets  
And I filled you up with lies  
Now I'm living honestly  
Because I said goodbye  
I can't go home anymore  
I don't wanna find out what I left there for  
  
I'm not scared and I'm not lonely  
Saving all my money or my breath  
I'm not looking for an answer  
I'm not asking anyone to second guess  
  
I was losing all my senses  
I was losing all control  
It was getting so offensive  
Now you want me back for more  
And I just won't go  
  
If you think you know the answers  
You've got a lot of gall  
Cause it gives you satisfaction  
Knowing nothing at all  
I don't care anymore  
And I don't wanna find out what I left there for  
What I left there for  
  
I'm not scared and I'm not lonely  
Saving all my money or my breath  
I'm not looking for an answer  
I'm not asking anyone to take a second guess no  
  
I'm not scared and I'm not lonely  
Saving all my money or my breath yeah  
I'm not looking for an answer  
I'm not asking anyone to take a second guess no  
Take a second guess yeah  
Take a second guess yeah  
(Hey)  
Take a second guess yeah  
(Hey)  
Take a second guess yeah  
Take a second guess  
(I can't talk to you)  
Take a second guess  
(Yeah, yeah I know)  
Take a second guess  
(Well I gotta go okay)  
Take a second guess  
Take a second guess  
(Over one billion served)  
Take a second guess  
Oh yeah
