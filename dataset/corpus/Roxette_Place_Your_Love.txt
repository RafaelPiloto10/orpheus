Sunday  
Sick o' my tears  
Monday morning  
I could've felt much better.  
  
Tuesday  
You're in my way  
I wish you would type my heart a letter.  
  
Place your love  
In my world  
It's for you  
It's made for you  
I need time  
A lot o' time  
To get you off my mind  
To get you off my mind.  
  
Wednesday  
Nuthin's OK  
Thursday afternoon  
I wish I was sleepin'.  
  
Friday and Saturday sun  
Gettin' up early but I can't get nuthin' done.  
  
Place your love  
In my world  
It's for you  
It's all made for you  
I need time  
A lot o' time  
To get you off my mind  
To get you off my mind.  
  
Maybe you'll come here  
Maybe you'll disappear  
Maybe the clouds I fear will turn to flowers in the air  
These cool vibrations  
They're hitting me all the time  
You've got me diggin' and divin' in the garden of my mind.  
  
It's a high  
To watch you fly  
Across the sky  
All the time  
To watch you all the time.
