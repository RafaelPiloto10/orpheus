Coming hard core looking like a gangster bitch,  
Trying to front like you ain't rolling filthy rich  
Laguna Hills you were born and raised.  
But you're claiming South Central is where you spent your days.  
Coming out hard talking crazy shit,  
Knowing in your mind that you really don't fit.  
Standing up straight with a gangster lean,  
Talking gangster slang about what you seen.  
  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again.  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again.  
  
You better think twice before you come at me  
Right through your dome I can clearly see  
Hey little dog, you gonna bark all day?  
Cause toe to toe, in the ring, is where I play.  
So you better step back and check yourself,  
Stop fronting and just be yourself  
Cause no one cares what set your claiming,  
Till someone grabs their gun and starts their aiming at you!  
  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again.  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again  
  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again.  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again  
  
Third verse:  
Cause it ain't about how hard you are  
Try using your brain and you will go far.  
Be true to the color that you were born with  
Not the color that you're adorned with,  
So keep it real and always be true and be yourself in all that you do.  
Stand up tall and get some respect  
And always remember, keep yourself in check  
  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again.  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again  
  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya  
Tripping out cause ya got no clout  
  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again.  
Take a chance kid,  
Take a chance.  
Take a chance kid,  
Don't fall down hard again
