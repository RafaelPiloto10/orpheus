I'm the man in the box  
Buried in my shit  
Won't you come and save me  
Save me  
  
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?  
Jesus Christ, deny your maker  
He who tries, will be wasted  
Feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut  
  
I'm the dog who gets beat  
Shove my nose in shit  
Won't you come and save me  
Save me  
  
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?  
Jesus Christ, deny your maker  
He who tries, will be wasted  
Feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut  
  
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?  
Jesus Christ, deny your maker  
He who tries, will be wasted  
Feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut
