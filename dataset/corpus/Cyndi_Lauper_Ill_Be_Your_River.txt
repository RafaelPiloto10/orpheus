You like the flame and you are drawn by desire  
Watching and waiting in line for your turn  
I've learned to walk with my back to the fire  
I like the heat but I don't want to get burned  
  
And if you need water  
I'll be a river  
Like a wave I will come over you  
You need someone to fall into  
I'll be a river  
And my love will carry you through  
  
Here stands a fortress built with great walls of silence  
Ready to crumble at the slightest word  
Finding the right one is becoming a science  
I'd like to scream but I ain't gonna be heard  
  
And if you need water  
I'll be a river  
Like a wave I will come over you  
You need someone to fall into  
I'll be a river  
And my love will carry you through
