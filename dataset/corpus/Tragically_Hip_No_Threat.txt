Got a window-washer's head  
For an unmakeable bed  
For loneliness  
The past is no place to  
Rest your weary arms 'cept at sevens at yer sides  
Your face a campaign debt, reflected sky  
You die to your fans one window at at a time - that's right!  
  
Gotta a window-washer's eye  
For an untuckable sky  
For lonely design  
The past is no place to  
Try, but I'll get my mind's armies moving at full-stride  
Singing in one voice, preoccupied  
And with nothing to say, I'll sing it bright - that's right!  
  
I am here  
It's only me  
I ain't freed nobody yet  
It's just me  
I'll just be a sec  
I'm a cleaner, I'm no threat, no threat, no threat  
I'm a reader, I'm no threat.  
  
Who sings lonely?  
Everyone sings lonely  
It doesn't sound so bad  
Who is free?  
Everybody's freed from the tired of being sad  
So sad  
  
How will I know?  
How will I know if I'm helping?  
Moreso, how will she know if I'm helping?  
If I'm not in the saddle, I'm nothing - that's right!  
  
I am here  
It's only me  
I ain't freed nobody yet  
It's just me  
Clearing spider-webs  
I'm a listener, I'm no threat  
I am here  
Failed and failing breath  
I'm a listener, I'm no threat, no threat, no threat  
I'm a watcher  
I'm no threat  
No threat  
No threat
