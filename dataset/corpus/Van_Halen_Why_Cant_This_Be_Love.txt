Whoa, here it comes  
That funny feelin' again windin'  
Me up inside  
Every time we touch  
Hey, I don't know  
Oh, tell me where to begin  
Cause I never ever  
Felt so much. Hey!  
  
And I can't recall any love at all  
Oh baby, this blows 'em all away  
  
It's got what it takes  
So tell me why can't this be love?  
Straight from the heart  
Oh tell me why  
Can't this be love?  
  
I tell myself,  
"Hey! Only fools rush in"  
Only time will tell  
If we stand the test of time  
All I know  
You've got to run to win and  
I'll be damned if  
I'll get hung up on the line. Hey!  
  
No, I can't recall anything at all  
Oh baby, this blows 'em all away  
  
Woo! It's got what it takes  
So tell me why can't this be love?  
You want it straight from the heart  
Oh, tell me why  
Can't this be love?  
  
Woo! It's got what it takes  
So tell me why can't this be love?  
Straight from the heart,  
Oh tell me why  
Can't this be love?  
  
Baby, why can't this be love?  
Got to know why can't this be love?  
I wanna know why can't this be love?
