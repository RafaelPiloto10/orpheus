It's just a theory  
There's a possibility I am wrong  
It's just a theory  
But I would stake my life  
Lay my money down  
That you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
  
It's just a theory  
A particular set of assumptions  
It's just a theory  
An educated guess  
A conclusion not forgone  
That you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
  
Oh nothing's new under the sun  
I will postulate  
Ask for your consideration  
Ask you out on a date  
Although it can't be sure  
Why not act on a hunch  
Oh why not search for proof  
Why not go out for lunch  
And in theory, I could propose  
And in theory you could affirm  
Oh that you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
Oh that you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
  
It's just a theory  
A series of tests should be run.  
It's just a theory although not fully assessed  
An idea whose time has come  
That you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
That you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one
