You were planning to stay in, you had it carefully planned  
Your coat was hanging in the hall, your hat was in your hand  
You walked over to your woman, your pale distracted love  
Who was trying to put the wrong hand into the wrong glove  
  
Are you leaving, dear? Are you leaving, dear?  
Are you leaving, dear? Are you leaving, dear?  
  
So you start reading all her books, all her magazines  
Just to get a better understanding  
Your brain feels like it's dead  
Your eyes are hanging out your head  
You were hoping for something less demanding  
Well what you see staring out at you from a photo book  
A man with an eyepatch and a bent, bloody hook  
You wished to God that you never went and took a look  
Cause it's in that moment that you know that  
  
She's leaving you  
Yeah she's leaving you  
  
Well now she's taking you to bed  
Her legs wrapped round your head  
You're losing her to some crazy kind of motion  
You keep coming up for air  
You look around and stare  
Find you're swimming into completely different oceans  
You're wondering if she's thinking about some other man  
She says, "C'mon, baby, you know you are my loverman"  
You're going nuts you don't know exactly what to say  
She says, "Don't worry, baby, this is just my little way  
  
Of leaving you"  
Oh, man, she's leaving you  
  
Guitar solo!  
  
She keeps saying, "Hey, don't hate me"  
She keeps saying, "Hate is just some kind of failure of the imagination"  
She keeps saying things like this  
Now she's giving you a kiss  
Now she's got you dragging her to the station  
The sun just slipped out of the sky, this is a black letter day  
Her train is moving down the platform, and is drawn away  
You're crying buckets, she gives her glove a wave  
She says "Oh c'mon, baby, that's no way to behave  
  
When I'm leaving you"  
Oh yeah, she's leaving you  
Oh yeah, she's leaving you  
Yeah, she's leaving you  
She's leaving you  
Yeah, she's leaving you  
Yeah, she's leaving you  
Yeah, she's leaving you
