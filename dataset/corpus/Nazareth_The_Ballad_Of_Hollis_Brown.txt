Hollis Brown he lived, on the outside of town  
Hollis Brown he lived, on the outside of town  
With his wife and five children  
In his cabin broken down  
  
He looked for work and money, and he walked a ragged mile  
He looked for work and money, and he walked a ragged mile  
Your children are so hungry  
That they don't know how to smile  
  
Your baby's eyes look crazy and they're tuggin' at your sleeve  
Your baby's eyes look crazy and they're tuggin' at your sleeve  
You walk the floor and you wonder why  
With every breath you breathe  
  
The rats have got your flour, bad blood it got your mare  
The rats have got your flour, bad blood it got your mare  
Is there anyone that knows  
Is there anyone that cares  
  
You prayed to the Lord above to please send you a friend  
You prayed to the Lord above to please send you a friend  
Your empty pockets tell you  
That you ain't got no friend  
  
Your baby's a cryin' louder now it's poundin' on your brain  
Your baby's a cryin' louder now it's poundin' on your brain  
Your wife's screams are a stabbin' you  
Like dirty, drivin' rain  
  
Your grass is turnin' black and there's no water in your well  
Your grass is turnin' black and there's no water in your well  
You spent your last lone dollar  
On them seven shotgun shells  
  
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls  
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That's hangin' on the wall  
  
Your brain it is a bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand  
Your brain it is a bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That you're holdin' in your hand  
  
There's seven breezes blowin' around the cabin door  
There's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door  
Seven shots ring out  
Like the oceans pounding roar  
  
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm  
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm  
Somewhere in the distance  
There's seven new people born.
