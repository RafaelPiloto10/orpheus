There's a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air  
If you listen carefully now you will hear  
This could be the first trumpet  
Might as well be the last  
Many more will have to suffer  
Many more will have to die  
Don't ask me why  
Things are not the way they used to be  
I won't tell no lie  
One and all got to face reality now  
  
Though I try to find the answer  
To all the questions they ask  
Though I know it's impossible  
To go living through the past  
Don't tell no lie  
There's a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air  
Can't keep them down  
If you listen carefully now you will hear  
Such a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air  
  
This could be the first trumpet  
Might as well be the last  
Many more will have to suffer  
Many more will have to die  
Don't ask me why  
There's a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air  
I won't tell no lie  
If you listen carefully now, you will hear  
There's a natural mystic  
Blowing through the air
