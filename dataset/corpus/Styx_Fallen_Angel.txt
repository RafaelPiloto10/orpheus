Hell nobody's perfect  
One hundred percent  
No saint, no Pope, no King no Queen  
No President  
  
But our hunger for heroes  
Has made us blind  
We seek salvation  
From the cup of human kind  
  
But every time we hear the voice  
Of some new Abraham  
We wake too late to realize  
It was just another scam  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall  
  
I said nobody's perfect  
From head to toe  
Not Einstein or Elvis or Lenin or Marx  
Or Marilyn Monroe  
  
Cause it's mostly illusion  
In flesh and bone  
An image, a look, a song or a book  
That we all claim for our own  
  
But even in the best of us  
There lies beneath the skin  
The tragic flaw in nature's law  
That's bound to do us in  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall  
  
Pretty faces up on the silver screen  
Flawless bodies on covers of magazines  
They all look perfect to us  
So rich and cool and bored  
But hold the presses boys  
They've checked into Betty Ford  
  
Turns out nobody's perfect  
From "A" to "Z"  
It's best to follow your heart  
Then to follow me  
Cause I'm only a singer  
Playin' a song  
And I've just been making it up  
As I went along  
  
See I met a man who told me once  
"Sincerity's the key  
And once you learn to fake it  
Son you're gonna be home free"  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall
