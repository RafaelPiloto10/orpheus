Strum me hard, strum me fast,  
Fears sure built into every wall.  
Looking hard through the glass,  
Fears sure built in with every waltz.  
  
Looking out at the rain  
Looking in through the storm.  
Treading the waves,  
Come in from harm.  
How could you regret your other words  
Hoping for thrills oh free as a bird  
  
Strum me hard, strum me fast,  
Fears sure built into every wall.  
Looking hard through the glass,  
Fears sure built in with every waltz.  
  
There's a knock at the door,  
I get up oh let you in.  
Travelled and stained,  
Soaked to the skin.  
Welcome my darling, you got here at last  
Come and sit by the fire oh forget what's past.  
  
So sad, so sad,  
So sad, so sad.  
  
Strum me hard, strum me fast,  
Fears sure built into every wall.  
Looking hard through the glass,  
Fears sure built in with every waltz.  
  
Looking out at the rain  
Looking in through the storm.  
Looking back, looking forward,  
Flying up, flying down oh  
What have you found?  
  
So sad, so sad  
What have you found?  
So sad, so sad  
What have you found?  
So sad, so sad  
What have you found?  
So sad, so sad
