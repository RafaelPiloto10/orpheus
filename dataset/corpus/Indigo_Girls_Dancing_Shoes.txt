Dancing shoes  
On the wall above your bedside  
Saw it all as we performed our pirouette  
Fleshes fused  
As the flicker of the candles  
Threw upon the wall a single silhouette  
  
Tu es dans ma coeur et dans ma tete  
  
Dancing shoes  
We have loved on distant beaches  
Where the winter never reaches  
There we fell  
Dying swan  
On the dawn you danced before me  
Though your eyes were dark and stormy  
I stood still  
  
Qui peut dire le faux et le reel  
  
Dancing shoes  
Though the distances divide us  
Theres a paradise inside us  
We can't lose  
Me and you  
Dance a pas de deux  
Forever  
And I pray you never  
Shed your dancing shoes
