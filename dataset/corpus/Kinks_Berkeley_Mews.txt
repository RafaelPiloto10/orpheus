The leaves of brown came falling through the view,  
In Berkeley Mews I first met you,  
I staggered through your chilly dining room,  
In Berkeley Mews I first met you.  
  
Your kitchen sink was cluttered up,  
So I couldn't shut her?? Up forlornly??  
I brewed another cuppa up  
And tried to sneak out early in the morning.  
  
I thought you had much better things to do,  
In Berkeley Mews I first met you,  
You drowned my conversation with champagne,  
And Berkeley Mews was not the same.  
  
I thought you were an intellect,  
But now that I reflect, you left me reeling.  
You made me drink a toast  
And when you finished I was looking at the ceiling.  
  
The flood of tears I've wept thinking of you,  
Remind me of that night in Berkeley Mews.  
You know that you left me broken hearted,  
Berkeley Mews.
