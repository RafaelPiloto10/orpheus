Every secret, every shame  
Every fear, every pain  
Live inside the dark  
But that's not who we are  
We are children of the day.  
  
So wake up sleeper  
Lift your head  
We were meant for more than this  
Fight the shadows, conquer death  
Make the most of time we have left.  
  
We are the light of the world  
We are the city on the hill  
We are the light of the world  
We gotta, we gotta  
We gotta let the light shine.  
  
Let the light shine  
Let the light shine.  
  
We are called to spread the news  
Tell the world the simple truth  
Jesus came to save  
There's freedom in his name  
So let it all breakthrough.  
  
We are the light, we are the light  
We are the light  
To let your light shine brighter.  
  
We are the light, we are the light  
We are the light, Jesus.  
  
We are the light, we are the light  
We are the light  
We will lift you high and  
Shine, shine, shine.  
  
We gotta shine, we gotta shine  
Let the light shine  
Let the light shine.
