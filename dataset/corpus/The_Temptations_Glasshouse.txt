If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don't throw no stones  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don't throw no stones  
  
We're all made  
With feet of clay and some dreams  
We're born alone  
And we die alone  
Why can't we live  
In between  
  
I don't care  
What goes on in your house  
When you close the door  
If you stop lookin' in my bedroom window  
I'll stop lookin' in yours  
  
My girl came home and she caught me with Alice  
And she threw me out the door  
Now, now now,  
But the real reason that she was so mad  
Is that she was with Alice before!  
Say what?  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
No don'tcha throw no stones  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don'tcha throw stones  
  
Sweet talkin'  
Bar hoppin'  
Pill poppin'  
Wife swappin'  
Swappin  
Swappin  
Sweet talkin'  
Bar hoppin'  
Pill poppin'  
Wife swappin'  
Swappin  
Swappin  
  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don't throw no stones  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don't throw no stones
