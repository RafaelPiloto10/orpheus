They say people out in Hollywood  
Live their life out in black and white  
They're livin' out a Technicolor dream  
Next day, they're a star overnight  
  
Not like in New York  
Man, it's tougher  
Not like in London town  
Boy, you suffer  
  
Nobody give a break  
When you're down on your luck  
Everybody's on the take  
When you're down on your luck  
You can't make a mistake  
When you're down on your luck  
  
People out in Hollywood  
They got a lot of class  
You see the boys struttin' down the boulevard  
Tryin' to make a pass'  
  
Not like in New York  
It's high rise, it's concrete and complex  
Not like in ol' London town  
It reigns down on its subjects  
  
Nobody give a damn  
When you're down on your luck  
Nobody understands  
When you're down on your luck  
Lady Chance, she won't dance  
When you're down on your luck  
  
People out in Hollywood  
They can make it to the stars  
They can reach the screen  
Drive around in big expensive convertible cars  
  
Not like in New York  
All you've got is Broadway  
Not like in the West end of London  
You can't make it no way  
  
Nobody give a damn  
When you're down on your luck  
Nobody understands  
When you're down on your luck  
Lady Chance, she won't dance  
When you're down on your luck  
  
You've got to strut your stuff  
When you're down on your luck  
You can't take it easy, it ain't good enough  
When you're down on your luck  
Everybody's on the make  
When you're down on your luck  
  
Nobody give a fair deal  
When you're down on your luck  
Nobody understands my Uncle Sam  
When you're down on your luck  
I'm ready for the dance  
When you're down on your luck  
  
I gotta make a dollar holler  
When you're down on your luck  
When you're down on your luck
