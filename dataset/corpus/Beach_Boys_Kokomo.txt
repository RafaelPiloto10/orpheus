Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I want to take ya  
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama  
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go, Jamaica  
  
Off the Florida Keys, there's a place called Kokomo  
That's where you want to go to get away from it all  
Bodies in the sand, tropical drink melting in your hand  
We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band  
Down in Kokomo  
  
[Chorus]  
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I want to take you to  
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama  
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go  
Ooh I want to take you down to  
Kokomo, we'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow  
That's where we want to go, way down in Kokomo.  
  
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique  
  
We'll put out to sea and we'll perfect our chemistry  
And by and by we'll defy a little bit of gravity  
Afternoon delight, cocktails and moonlit nights  
That dreamy look in your eye, give me a tropical contact high  
Way down in Kokomo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Port au Prince, I want to catch a glimpse  
  
Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo  
Now if you want to go and get away from it all  
Go down to Kokomo  
  
[Chorus]  
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I want to take you to  
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama  
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go  
Ooh I want to take you down to
