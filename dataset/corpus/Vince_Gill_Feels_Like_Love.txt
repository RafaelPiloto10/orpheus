Look what my heart has gotten into  
The sweetest gift I ever knew  
It's even better than my favorite shoes  
Look what my heart has found in you  
  
[Chorus]  
Feels like sunshine, feels like rain  
Lord it feels like love finally called my name  
I want to jump and shout I want to sing and dance  
Lord it feels like love wants a second chance  
  
Look what my heart can clearly see  
How much I crave your company  
A true companion I will always be  
Look what my heart has done to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Looks like my heart has become  
The safest place for us to run  
I'll be here for you when the day is done  
Looks like my heart has found someone  
  
[Chorus]
