Pardon me boy is this the Chattanooga Choo Choo  
Track twenty nine boy you can give me a shine  
I can't afford to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo  
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare  
(You leave the Pennsylvania Station 'bout a quarter to four  
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore  
Dinner in the diner nothin' could be finer than to have your ham and eggs in
Carolina)  
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar  
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far  
Shovel all the coal in gotta keep a rollin' ooh ohh Chattanooga there you are  
There's gonna be a certain party in the station  
Satin and lace I used to call funny face  
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam  
So Chattanooga Choo Choo won't you choo choo me home  
(Chattanooga Choo Choo won't you choo choo me home)
