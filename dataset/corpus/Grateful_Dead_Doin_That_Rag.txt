Sitting in Mangrove Valley chasing lightbeams  
Everything wanders from baby to Z  
Baby, baby, pretty, young on Tuesday  
Old like a rum drinking demon at tea  
  
Baby, baby, tell me what's the matter  
Why, why tell me, what's your why now?  
Tell me why will you never come home?  
Tell me what's your reason if you got a good one  
  
Everywhere I go  
The people all know  
Everyone's doin' that rag  
  
Take my line go fishing for a Tuesday  
Maybe take my supper, eat it down by the sea  
Gave my baby twenty, forty good reasons  
Couldn't find any better ones in the morning at three  
  
Rain gonna come but the rain gonna go, you know  
Stepping off sharply from the rank and file  
Awful cold and dark like a dungeon  
Maybe get a little bit darker 'fore the day  
  
Hipsters, tripsters,  
Real cool chicks, sir,  
Everyone's doin' that rag  
  
You needn't gild the lily, offer jewels to the sunset  
No one is watching or standing in your shoes  
Wash your lonely feet in the river in the morning  
Everything promised is delivered to you  
  
Don't neglect to pick up what your share is  
All the winter birds are winging home now  
Hey Love, go and look around you  
Nothing out there you haven't seen before now  
  
But you can wade in the water  
And never get wet  
If you keep on doin' that rag  
  
One eyed jacks and the deuces are wild  
The aces are crawling up and down your sleeve  
Come back here, Baby Louise,  
And tell me the name  
Of the game that you play  
  
Is it all fall down?  
Is it all go under?  
Is it all fall down, down, down  
Is it all go under?  
  
Everywhere I go  
The people all know  
Everybody's doin' that rag
