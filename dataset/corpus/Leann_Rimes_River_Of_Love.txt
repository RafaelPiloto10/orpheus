My heart's been thirsty  
My spirt's runin' dry  
And I think I feel a drop of rain.  
I see the lightning  
Strikin' the sky  
Sometimes a stone can bring a change  
Now your love comin' back  
Like the water all around me  
This feelin' here inside  
Is risin' like a tide to the sea  
  
Take me away on the river of love  
I want to go where you go  
Take me away on the river of love  
Just let me roll with the flow  
On the river of love  
  
Now I don't worry 'bout  
What's round the bends  
As long as you're by my side  
My destination is right where I am  
I'm just enjoyin' the ride  
  
When I needed your love  
It rained down from above me  
Now I'm over my head  
And I can feel it set me free  
  
Take me away on the river of love  
I want to go where you go  
Take me away on the river of love  
Just let me roll with the flow  
On the river of love  
  
Oh yeah, on the river of love.  
Oh yeah, on the river of love.
