In the bleak mid-winter frosty wind made moan  
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone  
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow  
In the bleak mid-winter, long ago  
  
Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain  
Heav'n and earth shall flee away, when He comes to reign  
In the bleak mid-winter a stable-place sufficed  
God The Lord Almighty, Jesus Christ  
  
Enough for him whom cherubim worship night and day  
A breastful of milk and a manger full of hay  
Enough for him whom angels fall down before  
The ox and ass and camel which adore  
  
What can I give Him poor as I am?  
If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb  
If I were a wise man I would do my part  
Yet what I can I give Him, give my heart
