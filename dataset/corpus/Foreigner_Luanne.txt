Luanne, luanne  
Why do you run and hide?  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
I wait around for you after school  
You slip away and I don't see you  
Don't know what I'm gonna do  
If you can't see how much I need you  
We met, one day, and then, you ran away  
I've searched the whole town looking for you  
I know you're there somewhere  
Luanne, luanne  
Why do you run and hide?  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
I write letters that I never send  
I keep the words to whisper to you someday  
I don't know where and I don't know when  
Luanne I'm gonna get to you someway  
I want to feel your love so close to me  
Give me just half a chance  
To prove myself, I need to  
Luanne, luanne  
Why do you run and hide?  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
These days true love is so hard to find  
Someday I know you're gonna be mine  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, ooh  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne  
Why do you run and hide?  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't need to run and hide  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne  
I wanna be beside you, can't you understand?  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne  
Give me a little love, I know you can  
Luanne, luanne  
Can't you hear me calling?  
Luanne
