One heart can make a difference  
One choice can change it all  
One voice can travel the distance  
And be heard all around the world  
  
Would you make a sacrifice  
If you knew that it was right?  
Well the answers there if you look inside  
Will you run and hide or will you fight the fight?  
  
Cause there's a power inside you  
And there's a battle to be won  
And every victory has a beginning  
The way it always has begun  
With the power of one  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
One day, you'll realize it  
That one hope is all you need  
One dream that we can all share  
One dream we all believe  
  
And we will make that sacrifice  
Just becasue we know it's right  
And we will face the answer that's there inside  
We won't run and hide  
We're gonna fight the fight  
  
There's a power inside you (inside you)  
There's a battle to be won (be won, be won)  
Every victory has a beginning  
The way it always has begun  
With the power of one  
With the power of one  
  
Yeah  
  
We'll look inside  
We won't run and hide  
No, we'll fight the fight  
  
There's a power inside you (can you feel the power,  
can you feel it, feel it)  
There's a battle to be one (battle to be won)  
Every victory has a beginning  
The way it always has begun  
With the power of one
