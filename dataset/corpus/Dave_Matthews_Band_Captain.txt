Crazy as I may,  
Make my way through this world,  
Oh, it's for no one but me to say,  
What direction I should turn in now.  
  
Cause I am the captain of this ship,  
Wanting eyes and kissing lips.  
The same as it was,  
And will remain until I'm done and gone.  
  
Strange, but it seems,  
There's mutiny brewing inside of me now.  
I don't want your pity,  
Just the promise that I'll be alright.  
  
Cause I am the captain of this ship,  
Curious hands and fingertips.  
The same as it was,  
And will be until I'm gone.  
  
Oh, I know I'm a dreamer,  
Still think it's strange?  
I won't be here for long.  
Oh, I know that I feel,  
Oh, wait and go again, again.  
  
Oh, look, I'm buried,  
Like a cancer eating away inside of me.  
I don't want your pity,  
Only the promise that I'll be okay now.  
  
But I am the captain of this ship,  
Curious hands and fingertips.  
The same as it was before here,  
Here, back after all.  
  
Why should I be hypnotized,  
By the promise of a long life?  
Why should I hold hope,  
In tiny, tiny dribbles that glide by?  
Why should I lean on everything... upon  
I won't be here long....  
  
Oh, I know I'm a dreamer,  
Still seems a truth.  
I won't be long for here.  
Oh, it's so, but I think I lay this,  
On now your lips.  
I'm drowning.  
  
I am the captain of... oh... but, I'll be okay after all
