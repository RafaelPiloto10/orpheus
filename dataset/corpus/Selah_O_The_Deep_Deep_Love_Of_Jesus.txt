O the deep, deep love of Jesus, vast unmeasured, boundless, free  
Rolling as a mighty ocean, in its fullness over me  
Underneath me, all around me, is the current of Thy love  
Leading onward, leading homeward to Thy glorious rest above  
O the deep, deep love of Jesus, spread His praise from shore to shore  
How He loveth, ever loveth, changeth never, evermore  
How He watches o'er His loved ones, died to call them all His own  
How for them He intercedeth, watcheth o'er them from the throne  
O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 'tis a heav'n of heav'ns to me  
And it lifts me up to glory, for it lifts me up to Thee, yeah  
[Incomprehensible]  
And it lifts me up to glory
