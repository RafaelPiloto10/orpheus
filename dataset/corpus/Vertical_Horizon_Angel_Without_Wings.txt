We started out so brand new darling  
But now it seems that nothing can change your mind  
I have seen your city lights  
But have you seen my country skies  
  
Watch the world go twirling by  
  
And perhaps it's common fears  
Or uncommon hearts  
That makes us insincere  
And torn apart  
  
But when will I learn  
Love is just my fantasy disguised  
  
[Chorus]  
An angel without wings can hardly fly  
And love without a dream it will not survive  
  
But now I can see  
I am lucky just to have a heart  
Discovery will knock you on your knees  
And lonely tears can only hope to freeze  
Yeah, they'll freeze and fall on down  
  
And so our sun is sinking low  
And your spirit's close behind  
But there's something you should know now  
(You know you're on my mind)  
That you're on my mind  
  
But where are you now  
When will you share your winter nights  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No it won't survive  
(No, it won't survive)  
No it won't survive
