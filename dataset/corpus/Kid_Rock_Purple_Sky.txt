We kept apart and connected by the same stretch of road  
Neglected the truth and refused to grow old  
It started a stream but then the levee fell  
When the rainmaker had some extra sends to sell  
  
I just wanna drink 'til I'm not thirsty  
I just wanna sleep 'til I'm not tired  
I just wanna drive 'til I run out of highway  
Into the purple sky  
  
Well, I just thought I'd call and see what's going on  
Did the hills all flatten out since I've been gone?  
Are the fields all painted up in red and blue?  
Are you thinking of me the times I'm thinking of you?  
  
I just wanna drink 'til I'm not thirsty  
I just wanna sleep 'til I'm not tired  
I just wanna drive 'til I run out of highway  
Into the purple sky  
  
But if I'm gonna live until I'm 50  
I'm gonna need you by my side  
'Cause I don't wanna dance without you with me  
Into the purple sky  
  
Livin' like a soulless pirate somewhere lost at sea  
Wondering if I ever make it home, will you come back to me  
Could we dream up a reason for a rendezvous?  
I'm back in town and I got nothing to do  
We could drive all day with the top let down  
We could stay in tonight or we could wreck this town  
  
I just wanna drink 'til I'm not thirsty  
I just wanna sleep 'til I'm not tired  
I just wanna drive 'til I run out of highway  
Into the purple sky  
  
But if I'm gonna live until I'm 50  
I'm gonna need you by my side  
'Cause I don't wanna dance without you with me  
Into the purple sky  
  
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, huh, huh  
Into the purple sky  
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, huh, huh  
Into the purple sky  
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, huh, huh  
Into the purple sky  
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, huh, huh  
Into the purple sky  
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, huh, huh  
Into the purple sky
