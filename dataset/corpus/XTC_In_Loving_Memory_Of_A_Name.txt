Boom goes my heart  
Dancing around your daisies  
Church bells will start  
Sat on you reading your ages  
I drift away  
In loving memory of a name  
  
Covered in moss  
You may have died for your country  
Forgotten not lost  
You're laid to rest where you're wanted  
I stare awhile  
In loving memory of a name  
  
England can never repay you  
You gave your life to be buried alongside  
The place you loved  
The sermons attended when you were young  
Still echo round these churchyard walls  
  
Heroes and rogues  
Together surrounded by nature  
Lump in my throat  
Sat in the land of your maker  
I drift away  
In loving memory of a name
