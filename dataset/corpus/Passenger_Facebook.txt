Looking at pictures,  
On Facebook.  
Of your ex-girlfriend,  
At three in the morning.  
  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped.  
  
Getting so drunk,  
You fall over.  
Singing up at lamp-posts,  
At two in the morning.  
  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped.  
  
'Cause it's so pure,  
You can hardly taste it.  
Oh, it's so pure,  
You can hardly taste it.  
  
Going to parties.  
With friends  
Who are friends of friends.  
At one in the morning.  
  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped.  
  
Eleven o'clock in the pub,  
Drinking everything in sight.  
But still not getting drunk.  
  
No, never helped anyone,  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped.  
  
Oh, it's so pure,  
You can hardly taste it.  
Oh, it's so pure,  
You can hardly taste it.  
  
So just hold on,  
When the party's over.  
And all your friends  
Are going home with their girlfriends to their dog or beds.  
  
Yeah, just hold on,  
When the party's over.  
And you can't help the world's spinning.  
'Cause heartbreak goes  
Straight to your head.

Never helped anyone,  
Never helped me.
