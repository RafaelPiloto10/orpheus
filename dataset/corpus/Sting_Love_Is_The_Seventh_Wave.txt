In the empire of the senses  
You're the queen of all you survey  
All the cities all the nation  
Everything that falls your way  
There is a deeper world than this  
That you don't understand  
There is a deeper world that this  
Tugging at your hand  
Every ripple on the ocean  
Every leaf on every tree  
Every sand dune in the desert  
Every power we never see  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Swelling in the world  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Listen to me girl  
Feel it rising in the cities  
Feel it sweeping over land  
Over borders, over frontiers  
Nothing will its power withstand  
There is no deeper wave than this  
Rising in the world  
There is no deeper wave than this  
Listen to me girl  
All the bloodshed all the anger  
All the weapons all the greed  
All the armies all the missiles  
All the symbols of that fear  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Rising in the world  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Listen to me girl  
At the still point of destruction  
At the center of the fury  
All the angels all the devils  
All around us can't you see  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Rising in the land  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Nothing will withstand  
I say love is the seventh wave
