End of October  
The sleepy brown woods seem to  
Nod down their heads to the Winter.  
Yellows and grays  
Paint the sad skies today  
And I wonder when  
You're coming home.  
  
Woke up one morning  
The wind through the window  
Reminded me Winter  
Was just 'round the bend.  
Somehow I just didn't  
See it was coming  
  
It took me by surprise again.  
And I hear you're in San Francisco  
Living with your sister who's a mother to be.  
And her husband's way down in Georgia  
And I'm still in old Tennessee  
  
Wishing you'd come home to me.  
Life here is easy  
I'm sure you recall  
How it's so warm and breezy  
In the Summer and the Fall.  
  
But Winter's upon me  
And I've got no heat here  
And I miss your fire so sweet, Dear  
I miss your fire so sweet.  
And I hear you're in San Francisco  
Living with your sister who's a mother to be.  
  
And her husband's way down in Georgia  
And I'm still in old Tennessee  
Wishing you'd come home to me.  
End of October  
The sleepy brown woods seem to  
Nod down their heads to the Winter.  
  
Yellows and gray  
Paint the sad skies today  
And I wonder when  
You're coming home  
I wonder when you're coming home.
