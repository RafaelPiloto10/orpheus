You see the world in black and white  
No color or life  
You think you'll never get it right  
But you're wrong, you might  
  
The sky could fall, could fall on me  
The parting of the seas  
But you mean more, mean more to me  
Than any color I can see  
  
All you ever wanted was love  
But you never looked hard enough  
It's never gonna give itself up  
All you ever wanted to be  
Living in perfect symmetry  
Nothing is as down or as up  
As us  
  
You see the world in black and white  
Nothing to bright  
You see no meaning to your life  
Yes you try  
Yes you try  
  
And all you ever wanted was love  
But you never looked hard enough  
It's never gonna give itself up  
And all you ever wanted to be  
Living in perfect symmetry  
Nothing is as down or as up  
  
And don't you want to see it come soon  
Floating in a big white balloon  
Or given your own silver spoon  
  
Don't you want to see it come down  
Enough of throwing your arms around  
And saying not a moment too soon  
  
Cause I feel low  
Cause I feel low  
Ooh  
Yeah I feel low  
Oh no  
Ooh  
Cause I feel low  
Cause I feel low  
Ooh  
And I feel low  
Oh no  
Ooh
