I got to run to keep in hidin'  
And I'm bound to go on ridin'  
I've got one more silver dollar  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I don't own the clothes I'm wearin'  
Some old bed I'll soon be sharin'  
I got one more silver dollar  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I got past the point of carin'  
And the road goes on forever  
I got one more silver dollar  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider
