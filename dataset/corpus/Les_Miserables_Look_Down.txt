[1832. The teeming, squalid streets of Paris. Beggars, urchins, prostitutes,
students, etc.]  
  
Beggars  
Look down, look down, and see the beggars at your feet  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down and see  
The sweepings of the streets  
Look down, look down,  
Upon your fellow man!  
  
Gavroche  
How do you do? My name's Gavroche  
These are my people, here's my patch  
Not much to look at, nothing posh  
Nothing that you'd call up to scratch  
This is my school, my high society  
Here in the slums of Saint Michele  
We live on crumbs of humble piety  
Tough on the teeth, but what the hell!  
Think you're poor?  
Think you're free?  
Follow me, follow me!  
  
Beggars  
Look down, and show some mercy if you can  
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man  
  
[An old beggar woman finds a young prostitute occupying her patch.]  
  
Old Beggar Woman  
What you think yer at?  
Hanging round me pitch?  
If you're new around here, girl  
You've got a lot to learn  
  
Young Prostitute  
Listen you old bat  
Crazy bloody witch  
'Least I give my customers  
Some pleasure in return  
  
Old Beggar Woman  
I know what you give!  
Give 'em all the pox!  
Spread around your poison  
Till they end up in a box  
  
Pimp  
Leave the poor old cow,  
Move it, Madeleine  
She used to be no better  
Till the clap got to her brain  
  
Beggars  
When's it gonna end?  
When we gonna live?  
Something's gotta happen now or  
Something's gonna give...  
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come  
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come  
  
Enjolras  
Where the leaders of the land?  
Where are the swells who run this show?  
  
Marius  
Only one man - and that's Lamarque  
Speaks for these people here below  
  
Beggars  
See our children fed  
Help us in our shame  
Something for a crust of bread  
In Holy Jesus' name  
  
Urchin  
In the Lord's Holy name.  
  
Beggars  
In his name, in his name, in his name...  
  
Marius  
Lamarque is I'll and fading fast!  
Won't last the week out so they say  
  
Enjolras  
With all the anger in the land  
How long before the judgement day?  
Before we cut the fat ones down to size?  
Before the barricades arise?  
  
Gavroche  
Watch out for old Thenardier  
All of his family is on the make  
Once ran a hash-house down the way  
Bit of a swine and no mistake  
He's got a gang  
The bleeding layabout  
Even his daughter does her share  
That's Eponine, she knows her way about  
Only a kid, but hard to scare  
Do we care?  
Not a cuss!  
Long live us, long live us!  
  
Beggars  
Look down, look down, and show some mercy if you can  
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man!
