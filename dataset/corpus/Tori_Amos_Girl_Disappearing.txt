From in the shadow she calls  
And in the shadow she finds a way finds a way  
And in the shadow she CRAWLS  
Clutching her faded photograph my image UNDER her thumb  
Yes with a message for my heart  
Yes with a message for my heart  
  
She's been everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
  
And in the doorway they stay  
And laugh as violins fill with water  
Screams from the BLUEBELLS can't make them go away  
We'll I'm not seventeen but I've cuts on my knees  
Falling down as the winter takes one more CHERRY TREE  
  
She's been everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
  
Everyone else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Rushin' rivers thread so thin limitation  
Everyone else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Dreams with the flying pigs turbid blue and the drugstores too safe  
in their coats anda in their do's yeah  
Everyone else's girl maybe one day maybe one day one day one day  
She'll be her own  
Smother in our hearts a pillow to my dots  
  
And in the mist there she rides  
And castles are burning in my heart  
And as I twist I hold tight  
And I ride to work every morning wondering why  
"Sit in the chair and be good now"  
and become all that they told you  
the white coats enter her room  
and I'm callin' my baby callin' my baby callin' my baby callin'  
Everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own
