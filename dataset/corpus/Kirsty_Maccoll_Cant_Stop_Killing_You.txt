He blew into town like a paper sack  
In a stolen car with a shotgun in the back he said  
She can't run now, she can't hide  
I'm gonna get her back for her lies lies lies  
  
He taught her how to pout  
And he taught her how to tease  
And he taught her how to beg  
When she fell down to her knees he said  
Your face is different  
But you're really all the same  
I have to teach you a lesson again and again  
  
See I feel no pleasure  
And I feel no pain  
So what else can I do?  
I can't stop killing you  
  
When you're out there in the dark  
I'll come rushing through your brain  
When you wake up in the morning  
I'll be coursing through your veins  
When you're swimming in the water  
I'm the hand that drags you under  
I'm the lightning that strikes you  
Just before you hear the thunder  
I can't stop killing you  
  
Well she woke up in the bathroom  
With her face upon the floor  
She said I don't know what I'm doing here  
But I've been here before  
And the fixit man had fixed her  
'Cause he's such a little hitler  
And he loves the feel of power  
That she gives him through her terror  
I can't stop killing you  
  
Well she looked into the mirror  
And she smoked her cigarette  
And she wondered where she'd go now  
To find a place she could forget  
All the things he said he'd do  
I can't stop killing you  
  
When you're out there in the dark  
I'll come rushing through your brain  
When you wake up in the morning  
I'll be coursing through your veins  
When you're swimming in the water  
I'm the hand that drags you under  
I'm the lightning that strikes you  
Just before you hear the thunder  
I can't stop killing you
