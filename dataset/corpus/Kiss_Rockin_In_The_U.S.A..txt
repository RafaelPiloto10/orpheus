I'm flyin' in a 747, I'm passing by the pearly gates  
And I'm comin' real close to Heaven  
And my guitar just can't wait, it just can't wait  
  
In France really had the chance, yeah, there was plenty romance  
I've been to England too, there wasn't much to do  
One thing I know is true, what I would rather do is  
  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
Nowhere else I'd rather stay  
Rockin' and a-rollin', rockin' and a-rollin'  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
  
Germany was really neat, Japan had lots to eat  
And Denmark was great, but I just can't wait, rockin' in the U.S.A.  
  
Rockin' in the U.S.A. (rockin' in the U.S.A.)  
Nowhere else I'd rather stay (rockin' in the U.S.A.)  
Rockin' and a-rollin' (rockin' and rollin')  
Rockin' and a-rollin' (rockin' and rollin')  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
  
Rockin' in the U.S.A. (rockin' in the U.S.A.)  
Nowhere else I'd rather stay (rockin' in the U.S.A.)  
Rockin' and a-rollin' (rockin' and rollin')  
Rockin' and a-rollin' (rockin' and rollin')  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
  
Rockin' in the U.S.A. (rockin' in the U.S.A.)  
Nowhere else I'd rather stay (rockin' in the U.S.A.)  
Rockin' and a-rollin' (rockin' and rollin')

Rockin' in the U.S.  
U.S.A.
