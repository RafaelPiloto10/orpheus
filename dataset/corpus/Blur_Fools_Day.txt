Wake up straight, caught out by the sun.  
On the first day of April.  
Out of bed, thought there was a plane crash.  
But I'm sure that I was  
Dreaming  
TV on, of course caffeine.  
A science of submission again  
Another day, on this little island, just a bell hangs on.  
  
Porridge done, I take my kid to school past the pound shop, Woolworth's  
Under bridge, where the subway the daytime, and the Westway flies by  
Then on my bike, down the Ladbroke Grove, to the forthcoming dramas  
A studio, and a love of all sweet music, we just can't let go  
Let go, let go, let go, let go  
  
So meditate, on what we've all become, on a cold day in springtime  
Civil war, is what were all born into, raise your left hand, right, sing.  
Don't capitulate to the forces of the marketplace, they've long departed  
Consolidate, the love we have together, on a cold day in springtime.
