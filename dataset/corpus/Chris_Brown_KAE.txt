[Verse 1]  
Every time, every time you tell me you gon' change  
You're never right, it's probably best we go our separate ways  
If you look in my eyes, you gotta know it's true  
Told me a million lies but I still try to make due  
Baby, I gave you time and always more  
Baby, you got what you want and now I'm paying for it  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official  
Talking all that shit, it don't mean  
Fuck around and go missing, oh  
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine  
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes  
Stranger in my eyes  
You're a stranger in my  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'mma be okay, my path is gonna get clearer  
Live in the moment, keeping you in my back mirror  
What you gonna do when nobody's at home? Yeah  
Shoulda thought of that when you turned so cold babe  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official  
Talking all that shit, it don't mean  
Fuck around and go missing, oh  
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine  
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes  
Stranger in my eyes  
You're a stranger in my  
  
[Bridge]  
We were meant to fall, fall right out of love  
And I can't even say that you were there for me girl  
We were meant to fall, fall right out of love  
And I can't even say that you were there for me, yeah yeah girl you  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official  
Talking all that shit, it don't mean  
Fuck around and go missing, oh  
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine  
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes  
Stranger in my eyes  
You're a stranger in my
