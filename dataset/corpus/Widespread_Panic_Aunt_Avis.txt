Help me mama, for I have grinned  
Save me daddy from where I'm goin'  
Call out to me from the ages beyond  
Help me remember how to be good  
  
How to continue when I feel I really shouldn't  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I feel I really shouldn't  
  
Help me granddaddy to see the swans  
Strike me granny with your golden pump  
Teach me now what I could never learn before  
  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I feel I really shouldn't  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I feel I really shouldn't  
  
Teach me Great Uncle to hear the talk  
Show me Aunt Avis with your ageless chalk  
Scratch it out for me on my cloudy retina  
  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I know I really shouldn't  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I know I really shouldn't  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I feel I really shouldn't
