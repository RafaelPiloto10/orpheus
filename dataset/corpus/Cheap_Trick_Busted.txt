Ooh what you fell into  
It's really nothin' new  
Well it's the same thing every day  
I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time  
With what I do and say  
I've tried and tried to right my wrongs  
And turn ?em all around  
Turn ?em around, turn ?em around, turn'em around  
  
Busted  
Busted for what I did  
I didn't think it so wrong  
Busted  
Busted for what I did  
I didn't think it so wrong  
Busted  
Busted for what I did  
I didn't think it so wrong  
I didn't, I didn't think it so wrong, well  
  
Well I made a big mistake  
But baby that's the breaks  
I can't erase what's done is done  
Don't have the best of luck  
I think enough's enough  
And my mind is on the run  
Time to go, time to show  
We'll turn it around  
Turn it around, turn it around, turn it around
