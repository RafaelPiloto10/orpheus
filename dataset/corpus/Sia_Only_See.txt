"Only See"  
  
You and you alone  
You and you alone have the power to be the master of your life  
  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
  
You alone  
  
Granted you're taking me for a sucker  
When I am not  
Gradually, we'll patch up mends and I'll make you see  
What I've got  
Apparently you're taking me for a slip on  
You've gotta tie me up  
Eventually you will tamper mends I'll make you see  
I am enough  
  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
  
Obviously you're taking me for what suits you  
When I don't  
With slow ease I'll show you disgraced, you were on my knees  
You know I won  
Foolishly you're taking me for a sleeper  
When I'm quite away  
Evidently we've not through been me, your intense scene  
And you'll now break  
  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
You only see what you want to see  
You only see what you want to  
  
You and you alone  
You and you alone
