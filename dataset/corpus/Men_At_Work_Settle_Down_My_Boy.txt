Settle down, an eat your peas and gravy, my boy  
Settle down, settle down my boy settle down  
Stop wasting all your time with running around the town  
Settle down, settle down my boy settle down  
  
Knuckle down and find a job and take some responsibility  
Settle down, settle down my boy settle down  
The future's something you should be thinking about  
Settle down, settle down my boy settle down  
  
Look around for a wife to start a family, my boy  
Settle down, settle down my boy settle down  
Listen toy our father and he'll tell you the same as me  
Settle down, settle down my boy settle down  
  
Your words would go in one ear and out the other side  
Don't say my head was empty and I had things to hide  
  
And you better put something away for your old age  
So settle down, settle down my boy settle down  
Settle down, settle down my boy settle down uh huh huh
