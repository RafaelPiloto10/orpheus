(are. Nielsen)  
  
You must be dreamin'  
You think I love you  
You must be dreamin'  
To think I love you  
  
I'll never do it again  
There I've said it again  
Really mean it this time  
Goin' down down down down  
  
[Chorus:]  
You must be dreamin'  
To think I love you  
You must be dreamin'  
To think I love you  
  
Yeah you had me once  
Oh once and maybe twice  
Gonna break your heart  
Let you down down down down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
When I (take it up) again  
Now I'm out on a limb  
I know I'll never do it again  
There I've said it again  
Really mean it this time  
  
Oh my God god  
Down down down down down  
  
You must be dreamin  
To think I love you  
  
Gotta get out of here  
If I'm gonna last  
I know I'm losin' fast  
I'm goin' down for the count  
  
Couldn't face the day  
I couldn't face another night  
I'm sick of this shit  
You bring me down down down  
  
When I (take it up) again  
Now I'm out on a limb  
I know I'll never do it again  
There I've said it again  
Really mean it this time  
Goin' down down down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You must be dreamin'  
You must be dreamin'  
You must be dreamin'
