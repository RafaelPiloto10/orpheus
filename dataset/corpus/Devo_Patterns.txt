Patterns all around you  
Patterns everywhere  
Patterns of behavior  
Sometimes seem unfair  
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?  
  
Patterns unfamiliar  
Patterns lead you through (to)  
Patterns of discovery  
Tracing out the clues  
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?  
Stuck in your mind  
  
In this land where stability is hard to find  
You can rearrange the patterns so unkind  
Don't bother asking why a pattern never cries  
Old patterns never die they just go on and on  
  
Patterns multiplying  
Re-direct our view  
Endless variations  
Make it all seem new
