He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck,  
And he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck.  
And his teeth were gone, but what the heck,  
I thought that he walked on water.  
  
He said he was a cowboy when he was young.  
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun.  
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,  
And I thought that he walked on water.  
  
[Chorus]  
If the story's told, only heaven knows.  
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo.  
And although his wings, they were never seen.  
I thought that he walked on water.  
  
Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop,  
And said, "son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot."  
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot.  
Then I'd flop down beside him.  
  
And he was ninety years old in sixty-three  
And I loved him and he loved me.  
And lord, I cried the day he died,  
  
Cause I thought that he walked on water.  
  
[Chorus]
