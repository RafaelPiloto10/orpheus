You wore out a brand new trunk  
Packin' and unpackin' all of your junk  
Your daddy's mad, done got peeved  
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave  
This ain't right and that is wrong  
Just keep naggin' me all the day long  
It's gotta stop, I don't mean please  
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave  
You're gonna change your way of livin'  
Change the things you do  
Stop doin' all the things that you oughten too  
Your daddy's gone mad, he's done got peeved  
You're gonna change or you're gonna have to leave  
Every time you get mad  
You pack your rags and go back to dad  
Tell him lies he don't believe  
You're gonna change or I'm a-gonna leave  
Only way to keep a woman happy  
Make her do what's right  
Love her every mornin', bawl her every night  
Your daddy's mad, he's done got peeved  
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave
