She's got here eyes open wide  
She's got the dirt and spit of the world  
She's got her mouth on the metal  
The lips of a scared little girl  
  
I got a angel in the lobby  
He's waiting to put me in line  
I won't ask forgiveness  
For my faith has gone dry  
  
She's got her Christian prescriptures  
And death has crawled in her ear  
Like elevator music of songs  
That she shouldn't hear  
  
And it spins around  
1, 2, 3,  
And we all lay down  
4, 5, 6,  
Some do it fast  
Some do it better in smaller amounts  
And it turns around  
1, 2, 3,  
And we all lay down  
4, 5, 6,  
Some do it fast  
Some do it better in smaller amounts
