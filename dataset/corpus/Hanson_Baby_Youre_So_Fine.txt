When I see you, uh huh, my heart fills with flames  
When I met you, uh huh, my body went lame  
Now that I know you, uh huh, I just wanna scream  
And, baby, don't you know you've got a special quality  
A special quality  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, I'm so glad you're mine  
Baby, you're so fine, oh  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, how I love you, baby  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh yeah  
The sun would rise for you  
Oh, it will not for me  
The sun would set for you  
Oh, how you set my heart free  
The sun would rise for you  
Oh, it will not for me  
The sun would set for you  
Oh, how you set my heart free  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, I'm so glad you're mine  
Baby, you're so fine, oh  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, how I love you, baby  
Baby, you're so fine  
You've got me crazy  
You're so fine in my mind  
All of the time  
You're so fine  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, how you blow my mind  
Baby, you're so fine, oh  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, how I love you, baby  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, baby, you're so fine, fine  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, how you blow my mind  
Baby, you're so fine  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, I'm so glad you're mine  
Baby, you're so fine  
Now this ball-and-chain it can't be love  
I was so lonely inside  
Life was so dark until you saved my soul  
But you made everything all right  
All right  
Baby, you're so fine  
Oh, I'm so glad you're mine  
Baby, you're so fine
