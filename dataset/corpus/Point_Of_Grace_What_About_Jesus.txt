Last night I hit rock bottom, finally saw right through myself  
Wasn't long 'till I called mamma, I wouldn't wanna call no one else  
And I knew exactly what she'd say  
But I wanted to hear it anyway she said  
  
What about Jesus? What about Jesus?  
He's the answer you've been searching for  
'Cause it's a long road, if you're walking it alone  
Without Jesus, Jesus  
  
We said goodbye and I went out driving  
Running like I always do  
Until I found that lonely back road  
That wooden cross where I lost you  
And I swore I'd never pray again  
But mama's words were running through my head  
  
I've asked so many questions  
Since my world came crashing down  
But the one that really matters  
Just keeps on ringing out, over every doubt  
  
What about Jesus? What about Jesus?  
He's the answer you've been searching for  
Oh, what about Jesus? What about Jesus?  
He's the answer you've been searching for  
'Cause it's a long road, when you're walking it alone  
Without Jesus, Jesus  
  
Opened up my grandma's Bible that she gave to me when I turned 16
