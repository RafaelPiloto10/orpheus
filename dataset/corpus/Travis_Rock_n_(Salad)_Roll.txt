Said you were a friend  
How did you do that?  
Said you'd be there till the end  
Now you're treatin' me like a cat  
Flaps flap  
  
You're a rock and salad roll  
Born to lose control  
You're livin' your life  
On the edge of the bowl  
  
Said you were a fool  
How did you do that?  
Sold your sold your sold your soul  
Now your stuck like the pull in the rat  
Traps trap  
  
You're a rock and salad roll  
Born to lose control  
Now you remind me  
Ah stubbin' my toe  
Oooh  
  
You're a rock and salad roll  
Born to lose control  
You're livin your life  
On the edge of the bowl  
  
Oh bless my soul
