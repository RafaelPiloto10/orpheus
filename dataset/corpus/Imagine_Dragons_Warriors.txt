As a child, you would wait  
And watch from far away.  
But you always knew that you'd be the one  
To work while they all play.  
  
And you, you lay, awake at night and scheme  
Of all the things that you would change,  
But it was just a dream!  
  
Here we are, don't turn away now,  
We are the warriors that built this town.  
  
Here we are, don't turn away now,  
We are the warriors that built this town.  
From Dust.  
  
The time will come, when you'll have to rise  
Above the best, and prove yourself,  
Your spirit never dies!  
Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne  
Above, don't weep for me  
Cause this will be the labor of my love  
  
Here we are, don't turn away now,  
We are the warriors that built this town.  
  
Here we are, don't turn away now,  
We are the warriors that built this town.  
From Dust.  
  
Here we are, don't turn away now,  
We are the warriors that built this town.  
  
Here we are, don't turn away now,  
We are the warriors that built this town.  
From Dust.
