Eh eh eh eh eh eh oh  
  
Say you want to walk away  
You ain't got nothing to say  
Well I salute you (eh)  
Go on out the door now you take care  
  
No more tears to shed  
What you expecting me to beg  
Well I'm not I'm done  
So when you leave  
Just close the door behind you  
  
'Cause...  
I'm feeling kind of taller than you (lately)  
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you (lately)  
I feel kind of better than you  
And I know just what to do (yeah)  
  
I feel like doing my hair  
I'm feeling like calling some of my friends  
I feel like going to a club  
And partying  
  
'Cause am I soldier girl in this world  
I stand alone, I can be strong  
I walk for miles and made it home  
It's good to know without you I made it  
  
Soldier girl in my world, took the fall now I stand tall  
For the pain and all I made it through and now I'm vow to say to you  
Salute  
  
Eh eh eh  
Eh eh eh  
Salute  
Eh eh eh  
Eh eh eh  
  
You think you know everything  
See you think that your shit don't stink, well it do  
Yeah, and when it comes to me you don't have a clue  
It took me all of these years, to realize that you don't belong here  
  
I can do better  
You say, "I'll never do better"  
Yeah right whatever  
  
'Cause  
I'm feeling kinda taller than you (lately)  
I'm feeling kinda stronger than you (lately)  
I feel kinda better than you  
And I know just what to do  
  
I feel like doing my hair (my hair)  
I'm feeling like calling some of my friends (some of my girlfriends)  
I feel like going to a club  
And partying  
  
I'm a soldier girl in this world  
I stand alone, I can be strong  
I walk for miles and made it home  
It's good to know without you I made it  
  
Soldier girl in my world, took the fall now I stand tall  
For the pain and all I made it through and now I'm vow to say to you  
Salute  
  
Eh eh eh  
Eh eh eh  
Salute  
Eh eh eh  
Eh eh eh  
  
"So don't call it a comeback, no... I've been here for years"  
Through all of the drama and the pain and all of the tears  
It's time to stop this roller coaster, say I want to get off  
And start moving mountains, swimming seas, and climbing over  
  
I'm a soldier girl in this world  
I stand alone, I can be strong  
I walk for miles and made it home  
It's good to know without you I made it  
  
Soldier girl in my world, took the fall now I stand tall  
For the pain and all I made it through and now I'm vow to say to you  
Salute  
  
Eh eh eh  
Eh eh eh  
Salute  
Eh eh eh  
Eh eh eh

Go on out the door, take care...
