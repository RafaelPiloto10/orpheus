She said she wanna be a superstar  
  
So I showed her the finer things in life  
  
And every time they throw up into sparks  
  
He apologizes for thing you like  
  
So maybe baby it's not what you planned  
  
Or maybe baby girl you need a superman  
  
She needs somebody to save her  
  
She don't wanna be alone  
  
Sick of the bad guys  
  
You need a hero (you need a hero)  
  
Yeah I wanna be wherever you are  
  
Girl you need a hero  
  
Yeah I wanna be wherever you are  
  
She says she wanna be all up in Hollywood  
  
And if he was to leave her  
  
Me and you probably could  
  
She told me she's crazy for me  
  
Said baby we could be wherever you want  
  
And right about the time is when he starts calling her up  
  
She's all in a rut ohhhh  
  
She needs somebody to save her  
  
She don't wanna be alone  
  
Sick of the bad guys  
  
You need a hero (you need a hero)  
  
Yeah I wanna be wherever you are  
  
Girl you need a hero

And all I can say is call out my name now put on a game

With my heart and soul  
  
If ever you're alone  
  
Girl I can be your hero  
  
She needs somebody to save her  
  
She don't wanna be alone  
  
Sick of the bad guys
