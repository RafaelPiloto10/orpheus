I'll never say 'Never again' again  
'Cause, see, I'm in love again  
Head over heels in love again  
With you  
I'll never say 'Never kiss you' again  
'Cause see, I'm kissing you again  
That's just the thing I'd say it  
I'd never do  
I walked away and said goodbye  
I was hasty, wasn't I?  
I missed you, so I thought I'd die  
But it's all over now, throw my hat in the sky  
I'll never say 'Never again' again  
'Cause see, I am in love again  
Head over heels in love again  
With the same sweet you  
Oh, never be in a rush to say goodbye  
You may regret it, by and by  
Why did we ever fall?  
Say goodbye to love  
Must have been insane  
What was I thinking of?  
Here we are, back together  
Happier than before  
All I can do is promise  
For evermore  
I'll never say 'Never', never again  
Here I am in love again  
Head over heels, I'm in love again  
With you  
Never say 'Never kiss you', never again  
Here I am, kissing you again  
That's just the thing I'd say  
That I'd never do  
I walked away and said goodbye  
I was hasty, wasn't I?  
I missed you, so I thought I'd die  
But it's all over now, throw my hat in the sky  
I'll never say 'Never again' again  
'Cause, see, I am in love again  
Head over heels in love again  
With the same sweet you
