If I'm lucky, you will tell me that you care,  
That we'll never be apart  
If I'm lucky, this will be no light affair,  
It's forever, from the start  
  
If I'm lucky, there'll be moonbeams all around,  
Shining bright as day  
You will hold my hand and you'll understand,  
All I cannot seem to say  
  
If I am lucky, there will be a time an' place  
You will kiss me, we'll embrace  
In that moment, every wishful dream I ever knew  
Will come true  
  
If I'm lucky, I will go through the years with you  
If I am lucky, there will be a time an' place  
You will kiss me, we'll embrace  
In that moment, every wishful dream I ever knew  
Will come true  
  
If I'm lucky, I will go through the years with you
