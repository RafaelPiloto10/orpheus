Get out that wig - I know you  
Put on those shiny pointed shoes  
We'll have a strange night  
Corsage - long gown - all the rest  
That ain't what we call dressed  
For a strange night  
  
You're gonna lose who you are  
We could take it pretty far  
Can there ever be any harm  
  
No one will know you  
You won't show  
Feels wild like we used to  
Just tonight that the feeling's right  
We'll wear a disguise that won't  
Show through  
  
We'll go out in the old red car  
You can sit in the bakc seat and play  
Your guitar  
If the blue lights flash while we're rockin  
Don't you worry I'll do the talking  
And tell it right  
  
You're gonna lose who you are  
We could take it pretty far  
Can there ever be any harm  
  
No one will know you  
You won't show  
Feels wild like we used to  
Just tonight that the feeling's right  
We'll wear a disguise that won't  
Show through  
  
Let's just stop at random places  
Just to see the look on their faces  
What a strange sight  
Put on that wig, I know you  
I know what you like to do  
Have a strange night
