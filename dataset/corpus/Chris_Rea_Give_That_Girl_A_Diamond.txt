Time to get up  
She shines her light where just before  
There was only  
A cold wind blowing  
She understands what makes me smile  
And lets me know that  
Without showing  
I need to tell her, need to show her  
How deep she goes  
  
Inside of me  
She is the stone that breaks the hard shell  
And rings out the loudest bell  
With whispered words that scream out  
All the peace in me  
  
Give that girl a diamond  
Yeah give that girl a diamond  
And say it's from me  
A blue reflected light  
Way past the darkest place  
My only private night  
Of fearful dreams  
She is stone that stabs my shield of steel  
The peace that she makes me feel  
With whispered words  
I need to tell her  
Need to show her  
How deep she goes  
Inside of me  
  
Give that girl a diamond  
Give that girl a diamond  
And say it's from me
