Babe, I'm gettin' the message it's finally comin' through  
After the show I'll get a hold of you  
Baby, I've got your number and I remember your name  
And I've got a feelin' I know why you came  
  
[Chorus]  
So let's get in some good trouble tonight  
Get ourselves in deep  
We can stay awake and dance all night  
We can always sleep  
Don't let them tell you it's a mortal sin  
'Cause I know it's alright  
And if your mama asks you where you've been  
You've been in some good trouble all night  
  
I'll be here again next year, and there you'll be again  
And I'll barely know half the places I've been  
But I can almost remember, so it was almost real  
I never know how I'm going to feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Good trouble all night  
Good trouble's all right
