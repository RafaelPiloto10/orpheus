Heaven,  
You say it could be heaven...  
But I don't really know...  
Lovers come and go...  
When hot gets a little cold.  
  
Infatuation is just the great anticipation  
Of starring in that picture show  
Let's wait until the credits roll...  
When hot gets a little cold.  
  
I could get carried away but not anymore...  
What was it I heard you say you love me 'cause I'm strong  
I hope that you're not wrong.  
  
Heaven, you say it could be heaven,  
Well I don't really know...  
I'll try not to let it show  
When hot gets a little cold...  
When hot gets a little cold...  
When hot gets a little cold...
