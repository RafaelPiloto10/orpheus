I knock off with a lot on my mind  
From a long hard day  
Pull in at home, see you and find  
My stress slipping away  
Then you run to my arms  
and give me a kiss  
And nothing else matters  
When you hold me like this  
  
(Chorus)  
Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man  
To win your heart all over again  
Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste  
Nothing but you  
I'm in the mood to close the door  
Make love tonight like never before  
Rush after rush, like waves on the shore  
Girl, I'm in the mood  
All day long I'm so strong  
Then I hear you speak  
I'm drawn to your fire, your signs of desire  
Girl, you make me weak  
I go drifting away  
Like a leaf in the wind  
I'm under a spell  
Your touch put me in  
Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man  
To win your heart all over again  
Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste  
Nothing but you  
Yeah, I'm in the mood to close the door  
Make love tonight like never before  
Rush after rush, like waves on the shore  
Girl, I'm in the mood
