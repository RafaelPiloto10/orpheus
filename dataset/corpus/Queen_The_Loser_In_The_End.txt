Mama's got a problem  
She don't know what to say  
Her little baby boy  
Has just left home today  
She's got to be the loser in the end  
She's got to be the loser in the end  
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend  
She's Ma on whom you can always depend ooh  
  
She washed and fed and clothed and cared  
For nearly twenty years  
And all she gets is Goodbye Ma  
And the night times for her tears  
She's got to be the loser in the end  
She's got to be the loser in the end  
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend  
She's Ma on whom you can always depend ooh  
  
So listen mothers everywhere  
To just one mothers son  
You'll get forgotten on the way  
If you don't let them have their fun  
Forget regrets and just remember  
It's not so long since you were young  
  
You're bound to be the loser in the end  
You're bound to be the loser in the end  
They'll chose their new shoes  
That's not far to bend  
You're Ma on whom they can always depend ooh ooh
