IT'S GONNA RAIN  
Writer Sonny Bono  
  
  
It's gonna rain outside  
I can tell by the clouds  
In the sky whoa, whoa  
Uh-uh oh uh-uh  
You used to come  
And see me baby all the time  
People see you walking down the street  
They say you were mine  
We use to love each other baby  
Ah that's all  
Well I can still remember  
Your skin so soft  
It's gonna rain outside  
I can tell by the clouds  
In the sky whoa, whoa  
Uh-uh oh uh-uh  
You would come and see me  
Baby gave you all I had to give  
Sometimes when you left me  
I didn't know if I was gonna live  
Used to watch the suns come up  
And the moons go down  
We used to take off our shoes  
And stamp our feet in the ground  
Oh yeah
