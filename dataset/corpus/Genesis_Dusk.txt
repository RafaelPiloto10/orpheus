See my hand is moving  
Touching all that's real  
And once it stroke the love's body  
Now it claws the past  
  
The scent of a flower,  
The colors of the morning,  
Friends to believe in,  
Tears soon forgotten,  
See how the rain drives away, another day  
  
If a leaf has fallen  
Does the tree lie broken?  
And if we draw some water  
Does the well run dry?  
  
The sigh of a mother,  
The screaming of lovers,  
Like two angry tigers,  
They tear at each other  
See how for him lifetime's fears disappear  
  
Once a Jesus suffered,  
Heaven could not see him.  
And now my ship is sinking,  
The captain stands alone.  
  
A pawn on the chessboard,  
A false move by God will now destroy me,  
But wait, on the horizon,  
A new dawn seems to be rising,  
Never to recall this passerby, born to die.
