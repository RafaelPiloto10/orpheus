Watch the master plan, the pastures span through the streets  
Flipped the beat, move the sheep, like the shepherd  
It's a new day, my crew stay forever strivin'  
Give thanks 'cause we alive and been through the gutter  
Now we see the horizon  
  
It's clear to me now  
Used to be confused, took a lot of years to see how  
Now we movin' planets, take the average mind and expand it  
You take for granted like we're always gonna be disadvantaged  
  
But soon come, it soon come, ya soon done  
Ya start run, you stumble, we catch one  
In the rhythm, Santana lick the guits with precision  
Not accidental, intentional, conscious decision  
  
To Zion, we're marchin' through with African Mayans  
Conquerin' Babylon with the heart of a lion  
Behold and watch yesterday come back around  
And the walls of Jericho come a tumblin' down  
  
Tell me, how long has it been  
Is everything, everything alright my friend  
You see, time is passin'  
People askin' how come none of this ain't lastin'  
  
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel  
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real  
Oh, do you like the way that's going down?  
Do you like the way that it's going down?  
  
Ooh, do you like the way  
How long, how long will we wait, to sit down and communicate?  
See, everything is relative, if you want to get then give  
Can't we all just build and live, can't we, can't we?  
  
Oh, do you like the way that it's going down baby?  
Going down baby, going down, wait a minute
