Said it's sad, said it was a shame  
Bet you thought I caught a boat to Bombay  
On the line just to let you know  
I will be around  
  
Underneath the bridge to nowhere  
Like I'm livin' out a game of solitaire  
Goin' up to a better day  
I will be around  
  
Hey world, it's me  
I still have the heart, still have the dream  
  
Come on, people  
We've got to come together  
It's you and me  
Hope will make us stronger  
Freedom it rings  
Do you hear it calling  
Reach out and touch  
And love will take us higher  
  
Somebody threw a brick at my vision  
Tried to sabotage my mission  
Either way, I believe  
I will be around  
  
I want to know, people are you with me  
Open up your heart and just believe  
Take a step, let me hear you say  
I will be around  
  
Hey world, it's me  
I still have the heart, still have the dream  
  
For He knows the plans He has for you  
A plan to prosper and not to harm you  
To give you a future, and a hope
