When you leave me please tell me goodbye  
Please don't go without telling me why  
Cause I would rather be hurt and confused  
I don't wanna read your mind so tell me the truth  
  
Is it anything that I say  
Or is it everything that I do  
Tell me baby cause  
I don't wanna be far from you  
  
I'm trying to make you see  
That you belong to me  
Tell me you'll stay forever  
I love for a while won't do  
I know that this much is true  
I just want to love you  
  
If you need me I'll be by your side  
Always know that I don't have too much pride  
Just remember that I am you long to  
Look into my eyes and you'll find  
It'll always be you  
  
Is it anything that I say  
Or is it everything that I do  
Tell me baby cause  
I don't wanna be far from you  
  
I'm trying to make you see  
That you belong to me  
Tell me you'll stay forever  
I love for a while won't do  
I know that this much is true  
I just want to love you  
  
The time you know my love is for real  
(the time you know is now I feel)  
The time you know for sure  
That I will always care for you  
(I will always care for you)  
  
I'm trying to make you see  
That you belong to me  
Tell me you'll stay forever  
I love for a while won't do  
I want forever with you  
I just wanna be with you
