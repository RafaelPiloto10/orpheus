Them crazy, them crazy  
We gonna chase those crazy  
Baldheads out of town  
Chase those crazy baldheads  
Out of town  
I and I build a cabin  
I and I plant the corn  
Didn't my people before me  
Slave for this country  
Now you look me with a scorn  
Then you eat up all my corn  
We gonna chase those crazy baldheads  
Chase them crazy  
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town  
Build your penitentiary, we build your schools  
Brainwash education to make us the fools  
Hate is your reward for our love  
Telling us of your God above  
We gonna chase those crazy  
Chase those crazy bunkheads  
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town  
Here comes the conman  
Coming with his con plan  
We won't take no bribe, we got to stay alive  
We gonna chase those crazy  
Chase those crazy baldheads  
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town
