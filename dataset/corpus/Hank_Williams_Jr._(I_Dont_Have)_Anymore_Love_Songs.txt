There's been some things that I've wanted to say a long time.  
Never have I spent a day without you on my mind.  
And I've tried a lot of songs and I need to try one that's new.  
But I don't have anymore love songs to try on you.  
  
We just can't ever get it together it seems.  
You'are arm's don't hold me the way that they do in my dreams.  
And it's hard to make up things that you never do.  
And I don't have anymore love songs to make up about you.  
  
I don't have anymore love songs to write for you.  
Too many I wrote before have never come true.  
And it's hard to make up lines for things you don't do.  
And I don't have anymore love songs to sing for you.  
  
And it's hard to make up things that you never do.  
And I don't have anymore love songs to sing for you.
