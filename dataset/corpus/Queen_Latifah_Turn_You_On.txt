Did I make you hot? Tell me  
  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I can see it in your eyes  
You wanna get down with Queen La  
Lace Latifa, I can see ya eyes on my body parts  
The friendship's slippin' 'cause it ain't me you hittin'  
Why you trippin'?  
  
Wishin' you could get a taste from the black Queen  
It captivates the mass when I slide on the scene, yo  
We ain't gettin' down like that  
You took a hug to the next level, try to spit that  
  
Counterfeit, nice shit put on the act trick  
Try to get a quick kiss and you got snapped quick  
I tried to be nice and play it all smooth  
Well I guess done has somethin' to prove  
  
So I had to move, getaway like a fugitive  
Didn't wanna do the kid 'cause I knew the kid  
Didn't really wanna do no harm  
I don't know what I did but I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I took you out, I was only tryin' to be nice  
Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
All the ladies in the place know how it go  
When you show a lil' kindness, cats wanna flow  
Want some mo' neck shit, some mo' sex shit  
Well, you tell 'em from the door, it's strictly friendship  
  
Didn't mean to turn you on  
Why apologize? I ain't do nothin' wrong  
You knew what the deal was, what the real was  
You was confused with the levels of love  
  
I seen you in the club with your eyes on me  
All night lookin' asinine, up under the strobe light  
More thin ice, there's still ?  
When it break through I don't think we could be friends  
  
If you sayin' you a playa, baby, live like one  
You play yourself like a bomb, never gettin' none  
And say beggin' for some and never get it  
If I turned you on, I guess you gotta live with it  
  
I took you out, I was only tryin' to be nice  
Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
So what you mad now, got a attitude now  
'cause I had to pull your foul?  
Frontin' big Willie style when you're a major joke  
Pagin' me so much till my pager smoked  
  
Got your Eskimo kiss and shit  
Your nose's too brown, how you get chicks to trip  
Well I ain't the one, I could buy you and your whip  
Hold your head 'cause I've got so many hits, what?  
  
I took you out, I was only tryin' to be nice  
Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
And I took you out  
I was only tryin' to be nice  
Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
And I took you out  
I was only tryin' to be nice  
Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on
