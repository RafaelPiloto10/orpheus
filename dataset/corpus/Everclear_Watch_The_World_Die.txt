I am still living with your ghost  
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast  
I don't want to be your down time  
I don't want to be your stupid game  
With my big black boots and an old suitcase  
I do belive ill find myself a new place  
I don't want to be tha bad guy  
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore  
I just want to see some palm trees  
I will try to shake away this disease  
  
We can live beside the ocean  
Linger far behind  
Swim out past the breaker  
Watch the world die x2  
  
I am still dreaming of your face  
Hungry and hollow from the pain you took away  
I don't want to be your good time  
I don't want to be your fallback crutch anymore  
Walk right up you brand new day  
Your same horizon in my own wearedway  
I don't want to be tha bad guy  
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore  
I just want to feel some downside  
I just want to find some place to be alone  
  
We can live beside the ocean  
Linger far behind  
Swim out past the breaker  
Watch the world die x4  
  
Oh!  
Yeah, watch the world die  
Yeah, yeah watch the world die  
Wooah, yeah, watch the world die  
Yeah watch the world die
