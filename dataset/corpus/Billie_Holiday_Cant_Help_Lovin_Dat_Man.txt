Oh listen, sister  
I love my mister man and I can't tell you why  
there ain't no reason why I should love that man  
It must be sumpin' dat de angels done plan  
De chimbley's smokin'  
De roof is leakin' in  
But he don't seem to care  
He can be happy  
With jes' a sip of gin  
I even loves him when his kisses got gin  
  
Fish got to swim and birds got to fly  
I got to love man till I die  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine  
Tell me he's lazy  
Tell me he's slow  
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe, I know  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine  
When he goes away  
that's a rainy day  
And when he comes back dat day is fine  
The sun will shine  
He can come home as late as can be  
Home without him ain't no home to me  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine
