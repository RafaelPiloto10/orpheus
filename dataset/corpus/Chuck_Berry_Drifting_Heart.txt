Who set my heart  
Ever - drifting?  
You, from the start never lifting  
I fight it but it downs me  
Despite the joy around me  
I can't free myself from sorrow  
All through the day it's a wonder  
Fall will the night, still I wonder  
If I'm the only  
Or are you as lonely  
Come home to me tomorrow  
Why should the past so change  
How you feel!  
Oh but I ask you  
"Forgive, if you will"  
These lonely hours are  
So hard to bear  
I don't deny that I was unfair  
You paid enough to be gay  
Who made me love you this way?  
So give me the chance  
To renew our romance  
For this time I know it will stay  
Oh yes, this time I know it will stay
