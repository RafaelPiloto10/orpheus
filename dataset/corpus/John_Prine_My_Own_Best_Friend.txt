I'm beginning to like you  
But, you know that ain't right  
'Cause you'll just twist and twist and twist  
Till I'm all crooked inside  
You'll take all you gave me  
Like it never was there  
And I think that I might, no, I know  
Yes, I will help you there  
'Cause, I've done it before and I'd do it again  
'Cause it's the only time  
That makes me feel like I'm  
My own best friend  
I'm a victim of friction, I got too close to see  
Yeah, we sparked in the dark and God hung a light on me  
The lamp gets real heavy, it hangs from my heart  
And it comes and it goes till I can't tell the difference apart  
But I've done it before and I'd do it again  
'Cause it's the only time  
That makes me feel like I'm  
My own best friend  
So many people say, it will never work out that way  
You can't stand the heat  
While you're watching your heart  
Just melt away in the basement on a rainy day  
There's motel in Shreveport  
Don't ask me where, please  
They check in, they check out  
By the light of the color T.V.s  
The maid calls you honey  
She makes your bed slow  
And she speaks, of the sheets that don't fit  
But you know that she knows  
I've done it before and I'd do it again  
'Cause it's the only time  
That makes me feel like I'm  
My own best friend, my own best friend  
My own best friend, my own best friend
