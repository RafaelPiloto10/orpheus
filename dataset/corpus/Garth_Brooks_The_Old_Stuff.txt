Oh I said a little prayer tonight before I came on stage  
I came walking past the drivers and the locals on the union wage  
I asked the good lord up in heaven, let me treat the music right  
Then I prayed that Detroit goes wild tonight  
  
Seven pickers and all our gear in a rental van  
Playing music, never sleeping and working on a neon tan  
We played the barn down in Sanford, Florida  
For Bev Roberts out in Camden Park  
We plugged it in up east at Bull Run and the place went dark  
  
Back when the old stuff was new  
Back before the buses and the hard working boys in the crew  
Well it was one big party but the business called it payin' our dues  
Back when the old stuff was new  
  
Oh the stories we could tell if it weren't for the code of the road  
About the buckboard bear creek cowboys and the grizzly rose  
You know the weather turned bad in Scottsdale  
A tornado nearly stole the show  
But we just danced in the rain and listened to the thunder roll  
  
Back when the old stuff was new  
Hats off to the KC, Opry and the Ella gurus  
It was one big party, Uncle Joe you know we owe it to you  
Back when the old stuff was new  
  
No rules, young fools, comin' from the old school  
Taking on the world alone  
Next date, can't wait, tearing up the interstate  
Every place we played was home  
Balls out, no doubt this is what it's all about  
Beggin' for a place to play  
Swingin' with our low friends, prayin' that it never ends  
Wouldn't trade a single day  
  
Back when the old stuff was new  
Back before the buses and the hard workin' boys in the crew  
It was one big party, but the papers called it payin' our dues  
Back when the old stuff was new  
  
Hey it's still one big party  
You can call it whatever you choose  
You make me feel like the old stuff is new
