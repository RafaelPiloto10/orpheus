Oh, when you walk by every night  
Talking sweet and looking fine  
I get kinda hectic inside  
Mmm, baby I'm so into you  
Darling, if you only knew  
All the things that flow through my mind  
  
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
It's so deep in my daydreams  
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby  
  
Images of rapture  
Creep into me slowly  
As you're going to my head  
And my heart beats faster  
When you take me over  
Time and time and time again  
  
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
It's so deep in my daydreams  
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby  
  
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
It's so deep in my daydreams  
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby  
  
I'm in heaven  
With my boyfriend  
My laughing boyfriend  
There's no beginning  
And there is no end  
Feels like I'm dreaming  
But I'm not sleeping  
  
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
It's so deep in my daydreams  
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby  
  
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
It's so deep in my daydreams  
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby  
  
Sweet sweet fantasy baby  
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
