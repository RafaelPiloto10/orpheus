8 o'clock get up get outta bed  
I feel like a truck ran over my head  
Another day of stress and sorrow  
Skip breakfast, 'cause I gotta go  
Ain't got no time to take it slow  
And I will do my hair tomorrow  
  
I can't take it no more  
Oh no no no  
Is this what I'm living for?  
  
But my Uncle John from Jamaica  
Keeps on calling every day  
Just buy a ticket and take a  
Summer Holi-Holiday  
  
6 o'clock my job is still not done  
The life I'm living ain't no fun  
Too many days of stress and sorrow  
My boss just won't give me a break  
And this is more than I can take  
  
Think I will quit this job tomorrow  
  
But my Uncle John from Jamaica  
Keeps on calling every day  
Just buy a ticket and take a  
Summer Holi-Holiday  
  
But my Uncle John from Jamaica  
Keeps on calling every day
