You know that I'll be waiting  
To hear your footsteps saying  
That you'll be coming home for Christmas.  
  
Please say you won't forget me  
That every moment's empty  
But only 'til you're coming home for Christmas.  
  
If I only had wings  
Then I would fly to you  
Through all the snowy weather  
We'd be together  
No one makes me feel the way you do.  
  
You know that I'll be waiting  
To hear your footsteps saying  
That you'll be coming home  
  
Home for Christmas.
