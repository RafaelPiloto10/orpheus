I'm coming out  
I'm coming  
I'm coming out [Repeat: x4]  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm coming out  
I want the world to know  
Got to let it show  
I'm coming out  
I want the world to know  
I got to let it show  
  
There's a new me coming out  
And I just had to live  
And I want to give  
I'm completely positive  
I think this time around  
I am gonna do it  
Like you never do it  
Like you never knew it  
Oh, I'll make it through  
  
The time has come for me  
To break out of the shell  
I have to shout  
That I'm coming out  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I've got to show the world  
All that I want to be  
And all my billities  
There's so much more to me  
Somehow, I have to make them  
Just understand  
I got it well in hand  
And, oh, how I've planned  
I'm spreadin' love  
There's no need to fear  
And I just feel so glad  
Every time I hear  
  
[Chorus]
