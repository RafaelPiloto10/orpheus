If you love somebody  
Put a light in the air  
From the hood to the stakes  
Fry your finger in the air  
Flo Rida up in here  
Wyclef up in here  
  
If I could I would pull it up and rewind  
To the time when it was just me and you  
Oh how we were inseparable  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
To the time before you went away  
Wish I could go back to yesterday  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
  
I try sticking to the rivers that I'm used to  
But these tears got me searching for an inner tube  
Witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose  
Don't wanna drown in my hurt cause it's critical  
I pop champagne, but still it's a damn pain  
BD I love you my sister died but it never changed  
My last love that we just ditched in my brain  
Give up the fortune and the fame to hear you say my name  
The ghetto rough while the doff try purple rain  
Lord knows I wish death never had a name  
Our last breath that it never had a relevate  
Wyclef, Flo Rida here to tell it man  
To the left, move, hurt for suffering  
I lose myself when I think about my people's slain  
If I could I'd rewind this whole thing  
  
If I could I would pull it up and rewind  
To the time when it was just me and you  
Oh how we were inseparable  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
To the time before you went away  
Wish I could go back to yesterday  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
So I sit down and I had try  
Are you living up in this life?  
I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
  
If I could take yesterday and place it in my palms  
I anticipate the day like a school prom  
Promise tomorrow what you think till you lose some  
Big will I know heaven got the futon  
Face good with the man paid your dues done  
Wack your shows in Japan with me getting drunk  
We had plans, plans change the new sun  
The lord never leave us lonely when you lose one  
If I could change the past, my people wouldn't past  
I wish life was TiVo and you could bring it back  
I wish it all was remote and how the day be said  
I were IP use it like its pixel flap  
Pull up the hood times, pull up the good times  
Everyday be forever when I'm putting down  
Showing off that's the truth nah  
  
If I could I would pull it up and rewind  
To the time when it was just me and you  
Oh how we were inseparable  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
To the time before you went away  
Wish I could go back to yesterday  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
So I sit down and I had try  
Are you living up in this life?  
I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
  
If I had the gift be here I'd cure your mom from cancer  
Take the Breena and stuck em up all with answers  
Take the crack feen turn her into the prom queen  
Have her graduate suma ku la day  
But she so high that she's riding on drug assist  
Growing up like the women from the exorcist  
Her heart stopped in the ambulance  
  
If I could I would pull it up and rewind  
To the time when it was just me and you  
Oh how we were inseparable  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
To the time before you went away  
Wish I could go back to yesterday  
If I could I'd pull it up and rewind  
So I sit down and I had try  
Are you living up in this life?  
I know if I could I'd pull it up and rewind
