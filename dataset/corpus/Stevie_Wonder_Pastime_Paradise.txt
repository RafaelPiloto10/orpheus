They've been spending most their lives  
Living in a pastime paradise  
They've been spending most their lives  
Living in a pastime paradise  
They've been wasting most their time  
Glorifying days long gone behind  
They've been wasting most their days  
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise  
  
Tell me who of them will come to be  
How many of them are you and me

They've been spending most their lives  
Living in a future paradise  
They've been spending most their lives  
Living in a future paradise  
They've been looking in their minds  
For the day that sorrows gone from time  
They keep telling of the day  
When the Savior of love will come to stay  
  
Tell me who of them will come to be  
How many of them are you and me

Living in a pastime paradise  
They've been spending most their lives  
Living in a future paradise  
They've been spending most their lives  
Living in a future paradise  
We've been spending too much of our lives  
Living in a pastime paradise  
  
Let's start living our lives  
Living for the future paradise

Living for the future paradise  
Shame to anyone's lives  
Living in the pastime paradise
