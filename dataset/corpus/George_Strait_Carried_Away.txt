I don't take my whiskey to extremes  
Don't believe in chasin' crazy dreams  
My feet are planted firmly on the ground  
But darlin' when you come around  
  
[Chorus]  
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes  
Before I even realize the ride I'm on  
Baby I'm long gone  
I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you  
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day  
I get carried away  
  
It might seem like an ordinary night  
Same ol' stars same ol' moon up high  
But when I see you standin' at your door  
Nothin's ordinary anymore  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Carried away
