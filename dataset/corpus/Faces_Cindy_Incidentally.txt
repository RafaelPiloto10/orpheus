Oh Cindy ain't you noticed  
That several of your friends have moved on  
And the street outside is just a little too quiet  
And your local papers run out of news  
I'm not persuading you or disengaging you  
But Cindy you and me we got to move  
  
Can you refuse, no time to lose  
We'll hit the high road early this morning  
So don't be late, don't hesitate  
This dream can pass just as fast as lighting  
And oh Cindy incidentally baby I ain't putting you on  
  
Can you refuse, with nothing to lose  
We'll hit the high road early this morning  
So don't be late, don't hesitate  
This dream can pass just as fast as lighting  
  
Oh Cindy don't you worry  
'Cause between us we can make it through  
There ain't nothing no no nothing  
In the world I can do without you  
So Cindy get your coat on  
Leave the rent with the gent up in the penthouse  
Turn your music so loud let's attract a big crowd  
We'll drink a round to this town and bid goodbye
