[Chorus]  
Behind the smile that I portray  
I am saddened every day  
My eyes are sore with endless nights of crying  
I hope that you don't feel this way  
  
My heart fills with tears when you pass me by  
You won't look me in the eye  
Don't you think that it's a crying shame  
We must play these silly games  
The pain in my heart that shows we're apart  
Is growing stronger day by day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you think that I have done you wrong  
I won't try to change your mind  
But try to think of the love that we once had  
And maybe things won't seem so bad  
The memories of those times are vivid in my mind  
And yet they slip away as time goes on  
  
Take me back tonight  
Hold me close and tight  
Forever I will be true  
Behind the smiles that we portray  
There is nothing hidden away  
Our eyes are sore because we are crying  
I hope we'll always feel this way
