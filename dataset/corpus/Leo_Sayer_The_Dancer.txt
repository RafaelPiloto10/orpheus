Jeanette was a dancer  
I suppose I knew her well  
Her feet danced miracles  
I was lost within her spell  
  
Jeanette knew a singer  
Was the leader of some band  
Looked just like a boy  
And stood just like a man  
  
And it rains all down the avenue  
Yes it rains all down the avenue  
  
Just for you  
Just for you  
Just for you boy  
Just for you  
  
The kids in the back street cry  
You hear their voices in your brain  
The world is full of hungry souls  
Behind the window panes  
  
Little Jenny on the high wire  
Slow motion as she fell  
Sometimes I think the wire is me  
The tragedy as well  
  
And it rains all down the avenue  
Oh yes it rains all down the avenue  
It rains all down the avenue  
  
Just for you  
Just for you  
Just for you boy  
Just for you  
Just for you boy  
Just for you  
  
I work on the west side  
Jeanette I pulled your strings  
I stood upon the pavement  
I never owned a thing  
And still I am the singer  
I know my song so well  
  
The rain falls through my eyes  
And lands below the shell  
And it rains all down the avenue  
Yes it rains all down the avenue  
Oh yes it rains all down the avenue  
  
Just for you boy  
Just for you  
Just for you boy  
Just for you
