I wait for sundown on the fire escape  
And watch the passing cars downstairs  
I'm high above Korean groceries  
A sublet castle in the air  
  
It's down to cigarettes and rosaries  
Christ, I wish someone would call me  
Johnny Thunders on the radio  
Ah but "you can't put your arms  
  
Around a memory"  
Maybe I could find a better way  
But all I need is to feel connected now  
Do you remember me  
  
I sang that song you like  
I sang that song for free  
Now someone else sounds like me  
As I make my way downtown  
  
Downtown  
Oh yeah  
Downtown  
See the old men on the Bowery  
  
Take the night train to the stars  
You can find me in the usual place  
Inside the Temple Bar  
I hear that Sally's got a gift for me  
  
I hear she found it on St. Mark's  
These days they all just talk like poetry  
And shoot their mouths off shooting sparks  
Maybe I could find a better way  
  
But all I need now is to feel connected  
Do you remember me  
I sang that song you like  
Way back in eighty-three  
  
Number one  
High as a kite  
As I made my way downtown  
Downtown  
  
Oh yeah  
Downtown  
They've got paper cups for charity  
Kools, pills and broken teeth, and dope  
  
But I'll take another dry martini  
And a chance on hope  
And now someone else waits for me  
And I got to get downtown  
  
Downtown  
Oh yeah  
Downtown  
I'm going way downtown  
  
Oh yeah  
I'm gonna see the man  
I'm going way downtown  
See the man  
  
Going down yeah  
I'm gonna see the man  
Going downtown  
Do you remember me
