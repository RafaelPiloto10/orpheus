Three days of spirits  
Tell me now  
I'm here like a spell  
That's bearing me to drive  
  
Tell me now  
That there are three days in a week  
Tell me now  
To make it so  
Make it so I can't speak  
Make it so I can't speak  
Well I'm here like a spell  
That's bearing me to drive  
  
Eyes of blue  
Sea of red  
Take me to  
Where I've never been dead  
Where I've never been dead  
Hey, it's between myself and me  
It's a very lonely place  
Between myself  
It's lonely  
Between myself  
It's a lonely  
Place  
Crimson red  
Yourself  
Back up to me
