If you ever get the traveling blues  
And need a place to rest your shoes  
There's someone here to welcome the new  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
  
If knowing this should make you feel low  
And you're feeling the need for someone to know  
I love to hear your welcome hello  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
  
There's so many sights  
Those bright city lights  
Will help you try to find your way  
It's a big, big world  
And you're a big, big girl  
So hury up and don't be late  
  
But if you ever want to come on home  
There's no need in you being alone  
All you've got to do is phone  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
  
Mmmm, there's so many sights  
Those bright city lights  
Will help try to find your way  
It's a big, big world  
And you're a big, big girl  
So hurry up and don't be late  
  
But if you ever want to come on home  
There's no need in you being alone  
All you've got to do is phone  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
So happy to know that you're alive
