They say I won't make it to the top of the hill  
Won't take the fruit of a tree  
And everybody says I'm out for the kill  
  
They're all laughing at me  
They're all laughing at me  
  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel  
And they're all laughing at me  
  
They say I'm a danger to the public and all  
I only wish they would see  
I'm just a product of a screwed-up world, but they're all...  
  
They're all laughing at me  
But they're all laughing at me  
  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel  
But they're all laughing at me  
  
Never ever wash my old blue jeans  
And brush the smile off my face  
But still I'm a member of the...  
  
Human race, human race, human race, human race  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel  
And they're all laughing at me  
I'm a rebel
