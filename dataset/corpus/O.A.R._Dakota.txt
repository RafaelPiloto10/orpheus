I had a dream about you  
It was December in the afternoon  
You're something pretty and cool  
Signing records as you're passing through  
  
You saw everyone as an angel  
But what about the thieves?  
Who don't know what do  
And don't know who to be  
You saw everyone as an angel  
But what about the thief?  
Who took away from you  
He took away from you  
  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on, walking on, walking on your way  
  
Behind the archway lies a thief  
Awaiting double fantasy  
He's something evil underneath  
Outside Dakota died the symphony  
  
I think everyone has a devil waiting in the wings  
When you don't know what to do  
And you don't know who to be  
You saw everyone as an angel  
But what about the thief?  
Who took away from you  
Took away from you  
  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on your way  
If you just kept walking on, walking on, walking on your way  
  
Maybe this is just a nightmare  
And I will wake up  
We all will wake up  
Maybe this is just a nightmare  
December afternoons they took away from you
