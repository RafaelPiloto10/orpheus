Here comes the wise man  
And there goes the fool  
You see that burnt out world that he is living in  
I don't need to look for the rules  
Here comes the donkey  
Chained to a ten ton plough  
He'll never make that hill in a million years  
Whip crack beating down  
  
He loves his brother but he'd sell him for a fistful of gold  
He needs a slave for his vision of the promised land  
No I don't believe a word  
Take me any way the wind blows  
You'll never know just what you want to do  
Or where you want to go i think it's time  
That you found what the world is waiting for  
I think it's time To get real  
  
Here comes the wise man  
And there goes the fool  
You see that burnt out world that he is living in  
I don't need to look for the rules  
  
Here comes the donkey  
Chained to a ten ton plough  
He'll never make that hill in a million years  
Whip crack beating down  
  
Anytime you want it then it's there  
All you gotta do is stop it  
On the corner and ask  
Say hey you don't live today  
Stop the world  
Stop the world  
I'm getting off  
I'm getting off  
Can't get enough  
I'm getting off
