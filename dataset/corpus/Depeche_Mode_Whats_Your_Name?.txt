Sometimes watch you walk the street at midnight  
Sometimes i can feel you in the air  
Looking good knew you would  
All the time i understood  
  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
You're so pretty  
  
Everybody seems to look your way now  
(everybody seems to look your way)  
Everybody wants to know your name  
(hey, hey, what's your name)  
Feeling bright just tonight  
Hear them say you're out of sight  
  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
You're so pretty  
  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
You're so pretty  
  
All the boys we got to get together  
All the boys together we can stand  
We can go never know  
All the things we need to show  
  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
You're so pretty  
  
Hey you're such a pretty boy (you're so pretty)  
Hey you're such a pretty boy (you're so pretty)  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
You're so pretty (p-are-e, double-t-y)  
  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
Hey you're such a pretty boy  
You're so pretty
