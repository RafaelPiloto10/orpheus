We're in the building  
Where they make us grow  
And I'm frightened by  
The liquid engineers  
Like you.  
  
My Mallory heart  
Is sure to fail  
I could crawl around the floor  
Just like I'm real  
Like you.  
  
The sound of metal  
I want to be  
You  
I could learn to be a man  
Like you.  
  
Plug me in  
And turn me on  
Oh everything is moving.  
  
I need my treatment  
It's tomorrow they send me  
Singing 'I am an American'.  
Do you?  
  
Picture this  
If I could make the change  
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall  
Did you?  
  
And who are you  
And how can I try  
Here inside I like metal  
Aren't you  
  
All I know  
Is no-one dies  
I'm still confusing love with need.
