How do you feel now? I want to know  
Clear as crystal, I can see your face  
In my glass of water, I can see your face  
How do you feel know? I want to know  
Does your love burn like a summer's day  
Or is it still on hold in an ice cube tray?  
  
Clear as crystal  
How do you feel now? I want to know  
  
Clear as crystal, I can see your face  
In my glass of water? I can see your face  
Winter has passed now, did you ever know?  
Is your love forming like the springtime  
Or is it still a snowdrop in the snow so fine?  
Clear as crystal  
  
Clear as crystal, I can see your face  
In a glass of water, you can see your face  
How do you feel know, I want to know  
Now I can see you so crystal clear  
  
Crystal clear
