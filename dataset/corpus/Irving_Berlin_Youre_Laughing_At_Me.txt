I love you which is easy to see  
But I have to keep guessing how you feel about me  
You listen to the words that I speak  
But I feel that you listen with your tongue in your cheek  
  
You're laughing at me  
I can't get sentimental  
For you're laughing at me I know  
  
I want to be romantic but I haven't a chance  
You've got a sense of humor, and humor is death to romance  
  
You're laughing at me  
Why do you think it's funny  
When I say that I love you so?  
  
You've got me worried and I'm all at sea  
For while I'm crying for you  
You're laughing at me
