Going to Terry Town  
Everybody knows me there  
I've been away too long  
In a concrete world  
Where no one cares  
  
So you say that  
You gotta be lonely  
It's a sign that  
Can never change  
  
I'll paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
I'll make the sun come  
Through for you, girl  
You know I will  
(You know I will)  
  
If you believe in love  
Take my hand and come along  
Lonlieness never ends when you're  
Living where you can't belong  
  
Set your mind for  
A chance to be happy  
Let your heart find  
A way to love  
  
I'll paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
I'll make the sun come  
Through for you, girl  
You know I will  
(You know I will)  
  
I'll paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
I'll make the sun come  
Through for you, girl  
You know I will, I will  
  
I'll paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
I'll make the sun come  
Through for you, girl  
You know I will  
You know I will  
  
Oh, I'll paint a  
Patch of blue on the  
Weather beaten skies for you...
