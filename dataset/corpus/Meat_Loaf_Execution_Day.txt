I stare in the mirror, my eyes refuse to blink  
Sympathy for me, hell I can't even think  
Send for the iceman, my temperature is startin' to rise  
I've heard it before 'n I know the truth from the lies  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it any wonder heaven's racked with thunder  
And all of my dreams go under like the fallin' rain  
Execution day, execution day (execution day, execution day) execution day  
Execution day  
  
Voices like locusts keep smothering me  
Twisting and turning my senses like a cyclone at sea  
Don't touch me now, won't let you crucify me  
You ain't no damn jury, you can't pass no sentence on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whose blood on whose hands, where's the promises they preached for this land  
Standin' there with bibles clutched in their hand  
Whose blood on whose hands, whose blood on whose hands  
(Whose blood, whose hands)  
  
Execution day, execution day  
  
Father my hands are shakin', I see the light, it's breakin'  
Show me the way to set my soul free, I hope it rains on me  
Let it rain on me  
  
Execution day, execution day
