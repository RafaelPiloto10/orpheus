And I'm, I'm over-joyed  
And I'm, I'm over-loved  
And I'm feeling lucky like a little boy  
Who's hiding under cover  
And looking to discover  
Every way to play the part inside this darkened cave  
The meaning of life, well it starts at the nightlight  
Close your eyes and I hope you see mine  
And I've, well I've seen a thousand things in one place  
But I stopped my counting when I saw your face  
Erasing memory, well I feel as though I've never seen a face before  
Until I saw your eyes  
And they're smiling back at me through my tears  
I've been counting all these years, oh  
Suddenly the thousand things I've seen were nothing more than dreams of  
Of you and me  
You and me  
Quietly at a standstill now  
Fortunately you will, well you'll kiss me, I will  
I will kiss you back  
Oh the fact of the matter is  
And I don't know what the latter is, oh no way  
See, I've always wanted to kiss you  
But I, I always wanted to run from you  
Because I've always wanted to miss you  
And I, I always wanted to come for you  
"Well I love my comfort foods," you said  
While you always say, "How do you do?"
