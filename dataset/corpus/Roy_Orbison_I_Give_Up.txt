I'm losin my mind completely  
From you telling lies so sweetly  
Breaking my heart too neatly  
I give up  
You told me that you once loved me  
And you placed yourself above me  
Now I know you never loved me  
I give up  
I give up I'm through with trying  
I give up I'm through with your lying  
I give up I'm through with you  
I give up I've done all I can do  
I don't want to share tomorrow  
I don't want your love to borrow  
My life is filled with sorrow  
I give up  
I give up I'm through with trying  
I give up I'm through with your lying  
I give up I'm through with you  
I give up I've done all I can do  
I don't want to share tomorrow  
My life is filled with sorrow  
I don't want your love to borrow  
I give up
