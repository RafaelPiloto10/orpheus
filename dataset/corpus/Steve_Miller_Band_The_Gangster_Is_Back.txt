Look out, the gangster's back  
I done traded in my old horse for a brand new Cadillac  
I'm gonna play some blues  
Cause I know you like that  
Gonna get real loose  
And do the jumpback jack  
When I walk into a bar  
Girls from near and far  
Say I'm the gangster  
Listen while a play for you  
A crazy little thing called guitar blue  
Red, black, yellow, or white  
It don't matter mamas  
You're all outta sight  
Don't get too heavy  
Now don't get uptight  
Cause the gangster's here to turn on your light  
You're my horse and you never win a race  
And I dig you mama and your real crazy legs  
When I walk into a bar  
Girls from near and far  
Say I'm the gangster  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Go gangster (do do do do do)  
Go gangster (do do do do)  
Go gangster (do do do do do)  
Go gangster (do do do do)  
I'm a gangster  
Started long time ago  
Down in Texas where the guitars grow  
Folks down there got all shook up  
When I cut myself loose and did my stuff  
Now it's ready, set  
Ready, set go  
Time for the gangster to start the show  
Well, I'm lookin' for women  
I'm on the road again  
You know the gangster don't lose  
He always win  
When I walk into a bar  
Girls from near and far  
Say I'm the gangster  
You better look out the gangster's back
