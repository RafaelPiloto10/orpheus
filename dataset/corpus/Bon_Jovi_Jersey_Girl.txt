I got no time for the corner boys  
Down in the street making all that noise  
Or the girls out on the avenue  
'Cause tonight I wanna be with you  
Tonight I'm gonna take that ride  
Across the river to the Jersey side  
Take my baby to the carnival  
And I'll take her on all the rides  
  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
You know all my dreams come true  
When I'm walking down the street with you  
  
Sha la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl  
  
You know she thrills me with all her charms  
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms  
My little girl gives me everything  
I know that some day she'll wear my ring  
So don't bother me man I ain't got no time  
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine  
'Cause nothing matters in this whole wide world  
When you're in love with a Jersey girl  
  
Sha la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl  
  
I see you on the street and you look so tired  
I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired  
When I come by to take you out to eat  
You're lyin' all dressed up on the bed baby fast asleep  
Go in the bathroom and put your makeup on  
We're gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom's  
I know a place where the dancing's free  
Now baby won't you come with me  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
Nothing matters in this whole wide world  
When you're in love with a Jersey girl
