It's not my destiny to be the one that you will lay with  
So many reasons why I have to go but want to stay here  
Sometimes I want a taste but then I don't know what I'm saying  
You are the angel and I am the one who is praying  
  
There is another love that I would rather be obeying  
I see the ecstasy and already I'm anticipating  
I feel a deeper peace and that deeper peace is penetrating  
I've got the magic in me, I am complete is what I'm saying  
  
I'm flying up so high, my purple majesty displaying  
I've reached a higher place that no one else can make a claim in  
  
I'll take you there my friend  
I'm reaching out my hand, so take it  
We are the angels, and we are the ones that are praying  
  
Peace, shalom, peace, shalom  
Peace, peace  
Peace, shalom, peace, shalom  
Peace, peace
