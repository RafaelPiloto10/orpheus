It's time to admit you love me  
The flush of your cheek betrays  
I hear a sigh in your voice  
Your every word conveys  
  
It's time to admit you love me  
I feel the weight of your gaze  
The smile that's mine alone  
Your starry eyes sparkle ablaze  
  
It's such a simple thing  
How hard can it be  
These few words  
Endear you to me  
  
It's time to admit I love you  
And lift the worry from your brow  
Rest your head upon my shoulder  
There's nothing to be afraid of now
