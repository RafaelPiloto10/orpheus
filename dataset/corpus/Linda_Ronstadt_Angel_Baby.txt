It's just like heaven  
Being here with you  
You're like an angel  
Too good to be true  
But after all I love you I do  
Angel baby, my angel baby  
When you are near me  
My heart skips a beat  
I can hardly stand on  
My own two feet  
Because I love you I love you I do  
Angel baby, my angel baby  
Ooh I love you, ooh I do  
No one could love you like I do  
Oh  
Oh Oh Oh  
Please never leave me  
Blue and alone  
If you ever go  
I'm sure you'll come back home  
Because I love you I love you I do  
Angel baby, my angel baby  
Ooh I love you, ooh I do  
No one can love you like I do  
Oh  
Oh Oh Oh
