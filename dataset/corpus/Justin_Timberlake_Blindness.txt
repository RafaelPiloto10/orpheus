Why can't I see you?  
Stuck in black and white  
You're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you?  
I've been struck by blindness  
  
I close my eyes cause you've been gone  
Such a long time I fantasize  
You close so long fantasy  
Began to see it altered my mind  
Am I crazy?  
When I open my eyes  
Then world was gone  
Reached out when I heard you call my name  
But all I felt was cold  
  
Tell me why can't I see you?  
I'm stuck in black and white  
You're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you?  
I've been struck by blindness  
  
If I close and concentrate  
You illuminate your body slide  
And I let you do the worst mistake  
It's clear as day  
But I can't wrap my mind around it baby  
And when I open my eyes  
Then world is gone, long gone, long gone  
Reached out when I heard you call my name  
But all I felt was cold  
  
Tell me why can't I see you?  
I'm stuck in black and white  
You're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you?  
I've been struck by blindness  
  
Oh, tell me why can't I see you?  
It's like I'm stuck in black and white  
And you're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you? yeah  
I've been struck by blindness  
Why can't I see you?  
In black and white  
You're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you? Yeah  
I've been struck by blindness  
Blindness, blindness  
Blindness, blindness  
Blindness, blindness
