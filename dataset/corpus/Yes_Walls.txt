Don't you know it's my way out  
To be on my own  
When I feel like crying out I do it best alone  
Can you give me love and  
Protection to shield my heart  
All the fear I feel from doubt  
Is tearing me apart  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to love, I want to give  
I want to find another way to live  
Another shout, another cry  
And the walls come tumbling down  
  
Don't you know there's now way out  
Your pain's your own  
And the more we scream and shout  
The more we feel alone  
I can feel my anger rising  
Am I to blame?  
And I'm not gonna keep it inside me  
Do you feel the same?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm calling you
