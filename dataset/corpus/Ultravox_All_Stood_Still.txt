The lights went out (The last fuse blew).  
The clocks all stopped (It can't be true).  
The program's wrong (What can we do?).  
The printout's blocked (It relied on you).  
The turbine cracked up.  
The buildings froze up.  
The system choked up.  
What can we do?  
Please remember to mention me,  
In tapes you leave behind.  
Chorus :  
We stood still.  
We all stood still.  
Still stood still.  
We're standing still.  
The screen shut down (There's no reply).  
The lifts all fall (A siren cries).  
And the radar fades (A pilot sighs).  
As the countdowns stall (The readout lies).  
The turbines cracked up.  
The buildings froze up.  
The system choked up.  
What can we do?  
Please remember to mention me,  
In tapes you leave behind.  
(Chorus)  
The black box failed (The codes got crossed).  
And the jails decayed (The keys got lost).  
Everyone kissed (We breathe exhaust).  
In the new arcade (Of the holocaust).  
The turbine cracked up.  
The buildings froze up.  
The system choked up.  
What can we do?  
Plese remember to mention me,  
In tapes you might leave behind.  
(Chorus - Repeat 2 times).
