When the weather is fine  
And the clouds have gone by  
I go up in the air  
Waving people good-bye.  
In my flying machine  
I go up  
I go down  
I go round and round  
Round and round and round.  
People on the ground  
Have gathered all around to admire  
There's a feeling inside me  
That gives me the urge to go higher.  
But I know what goes up  
Will eventually fall  
So I won't take no chances  
While I'm having a ball  
In my flying machine  
I go up  
I go down  
I go round and round  
And round and round.  
I can race with the birds  
I can fight with the wind  
I can fly on my head  
I can dance in a spin.
