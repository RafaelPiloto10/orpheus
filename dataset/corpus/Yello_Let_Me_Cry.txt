Sunday night  
I was riding on the a train  
Reading the newspaper  
A woman was trying to convince a man  
That she hadn't done it  
  
All these years  
I haven't seen you  
Love is still the same  
Now you must believe me  
Now I play no game  
I know I loved you  
When I left you  
Couldn't tell you why  
Too sad today  
Too sad for tears  
Let me cry  
  
You only just caught that train  
Breathless  
And then, you smiled at me  
We left, on canal street, and uh  
Had a drink at  
Remember the name of the place?  
  
All these years  
I haven't seen you  
Love is still the same  
Now you must believe me  
Now I play no games  
I know I loved you  
When I left you  
Couldn't tell you why  
Too sad today  
Too sad for tears  
Let me cry  
  
Yes, I do remember  
The name of the place  
Three roses
