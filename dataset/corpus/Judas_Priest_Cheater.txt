I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair  
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there  
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep  
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep  
  
She was a cheater  
  
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door  
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44  
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do  
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you  
  
You are a cheater  
  
They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way  
When you do this upon me, you have no say  
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do  
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through  
  
You are a cheater  
  
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one  
There's no neater, come on here and meet her  
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her
