Hold me, there's too much tension  
Degrade me, I'm fucking hungry  
Help me, I'm fucking cornered  
Degrade me, you might be right  
  
Lightning fucking around in my head  
Fierce, dangerous, pathetic, fucked up  
People freaking every day  
White lights inside  
What do you want, fuck  
  
Cold naked man, picked off his scabs and  
Fed them to the pigeons  
Help him, he's fucking cornered  
Degrade him it might be fun  
  
Lightning fucking around in my head, etc  
Hold me, something's happening  
Help me, somebody help me  
Hold me, I'm fucking hungry  
Help me, I'm right here, who are you?  
  
Naked man you say you saw  
Fed them, to the pigeons  
Help him, he's fucking cornered  
Grade him, it might be fun  
  
Lightning fucking around in my head, etc...  
Help me, I'm fucking hungry  
Help me, I'm fucking up  
Hold me, some fucking help
