You look like who you say you are  
So scoot over let me drive your car  
Roll down the glass and give me some wind  
lock all the doors I'm on the loose again alright!  
  
I haven't sat behind a wheel like this  
since that job in 1956  
Can't wait till I can do it again  
can't keep my nose clean livin' in sin alright!  
  
I had a friend down in Alcatraz  
he had the money and machine guns stashed  
We busted out June 21  
we gonna rob, steal totin' our guns alright!
