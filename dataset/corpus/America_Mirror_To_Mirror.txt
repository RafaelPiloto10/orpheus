I haven't seen forever  
Don't even know her name  
I call on dreams and other schemes  
To try and win that game  
Now that it's over, darling  
Look into my eyes  
Seein' your own reflection  
Much to your surprise  
We're seein' mirror to mirror  
Face to face  
We look but we cannot see  
Mirror to mirror  
Seems to trace  
What happened to you and me  
And though we tried in earnest  
The distant silence yells  
We call on wings and other things  
To try and break that spell  
Now that it's over, darling  
Truth in the common cause  
We stare at our own indifference  
By seeing the other's flaws  
We're seein' mirror to mirror  
Face to face  
We look but we cannot see  
Mirror to mirror  
Seems to trace  
What happened to you and me  
Oh, mirror to mirror, mirror to mirror  
Mirror to mirror, what's come over me  
As we look inside, there's nowhere to turn  
There's nowhere to hide  
Now that it's over, darling  
Look into my eyes  
Seein' your own reflection  
Much to your surprise  
We're seein' mirror to mirror  
Face to face  
We look but we cannot see  
Mirror to mirror  
Seems to trace  
What happened to you and me  
Oh, mirror to mirror, mirror to mirror  
Mirror to mirror, what's come over me  
Mirror to mirror, mirror to mirror  
Mirror to mirror, what's come over me
