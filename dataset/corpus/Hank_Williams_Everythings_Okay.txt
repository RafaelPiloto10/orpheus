I went to the country just the other day  
To see my uncle Bill and sorta pass the time away  
I asked him how he'd been since last, I'd passed his way  
He rubbed his chin, here's what he had to say  
  
My wife's been sick, the young ones, too  
And I'm darn near down with the flu  
The cow's gone dry and them hens won't lay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died  
The bees got mad and they left the hive  
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The porch rotted down that's more expense  
The darned old mule he tore down the fence  
The mortgage is due and I can't pay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans  
The darn rabbits they got the turnip greens  
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
My land's so poor so hard and yeller  
You have to set on a sack of fertilizer to raise an umbreller  
And it rains out here nearly every day  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The wells gone dry and I have to tote the water  
Up from the spring about a mile and a quarter  
My helper, he quit for the lack of pay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The house it leaks it needs a new top  
When it rains it wets everything we got  
The chimney fell down just yesterday  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The corn meals gone and the meat's run out  
Got nothin' to kill to put in the smokehouse  
The preacher's comin' Sunday to spend the day  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The canned stuffs spoiled else the jar's got broke  
And all we got left is one old Billy goat  
We're gonna have a new baby about the first of may  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
My crop it rotted in the ground  
I asked for another loan but the banker turned me down  
But we're still a-livin' and we're prayin' for better days  
So after all, everything's in pretty good shape
