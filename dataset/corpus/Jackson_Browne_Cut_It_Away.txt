Cut it away, somebody cut away this desperate heart  
Cut it away and help me find my way back to the start  
Yeah, before I knew what I was looking for  
Yeah, when we were lovers and nothing more  
  
I wanted you and I did everything that I could do  
To capture you I let you see the part of me  
You'd want to see a fantasy  
I'm finding now I don't know how  
To make it good I wish I could  
  
Cut it away this crazy longing for something more  
Cut it away the question I don't have an answer for  
Why I hunger for something I can't see  
Cut it away the dream I wanted life to be  
  
I know I've got to let you go  
I know you should have left a long time ago  
  
Protected by the night two cities lay  
Two hearts, two lives connected by our sight  
World's away, two hearts, two lives inspected by the light  
Two hearts, two cities in decay  
Two lives repair them as we might  
Two hearts just go on crumbling, now come on  
  
Cut it away I want to cut away this thing inside  
Cut it away this thing that hid from you and schemed and lied  
I know I've got to let you go  
I know you should have left a long time ago  
  
Cut it away, somebody cut away this desperate heart  
Cut it away before it tears my whole life apart  
I love you, I love you still, I do  
I always will
