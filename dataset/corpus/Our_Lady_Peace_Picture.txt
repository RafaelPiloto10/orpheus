Waiting by the telephone,  
Breathing through a giant rubber hose.  
God only knows  
Photographs of you and me,  
Pictures of the friends,  
You used to know,  
Where did they go?  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't take my picture down  
Don't erase everything that we had.  
Don't think I'd let you down  
I might be gone, but we'll meet again  
Can't find you  
So I'll call your name  
  
Riding on the satellite  
Sun faded and sweaty, but that's all right,  
'Cause I'm still alive  
I'm stranded in this memory,  
Your mouth is wide open, you can't scream  
Oh you can't scream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Please pick up the phone,  
Please pick up the phone,  
Please pick up the phone,  
Please pick up the phone,  
I wanted you to know,  
I wanted you to know,  
I wanted you to know,  
I wanted you to know.  
  
[Chorus]
