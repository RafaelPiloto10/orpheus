Turn on... I'm in a??? Fast??? Baby  
I??? Much, you know  
??? Take it??? Fast  
  
Some people been driving to fast,  
Some people still having a gas,  
But if there's one thing you gotta conceed,  
You gotta know who's driving you car,  
You get to fifth gear with your foot on the floor,  
Or else you're starring in "A Cruise Too Far".  
  
Turn on, tune in, cop out.  
Let it flow now mama,  
Let it flow become a woman.  
  
Some people been wasting their time,  
Some people expanding their minds,  
But if you've known love like the jokers before,  
Then you're likely to be home on the range.  
No more the Cowboy gosta flaunt his wares,  
He's been grazing on a different plain.  
  
It's easy to see why there's a thousands of people  
Are regularily turning it out,  
It's easy to find when you mess with your mind  
That you've gone beyond a resonable doubt...
