It's been a long day in the field for us all  
Catching balls and dropping balls  
It's been a long life in this world  
Catching hearts and dropping hearts  
Like hearts were meant to bounce  
Like hearts were meant to bounce  
I'm sure  
  
The wave that you just missed  
Could've been the big one  
The one that took you there  
The sunshine fills the air  
  
It's been a night shift of a life for us all  
Gaining friends and losing friends  
It's been a cleaner's sort of hours  
That's why we buy our flowers  
Cos when you smell of shit you love flowers  
  
And the wind that broke your kite  
Could've been the big one  
To take you out of sight  
Keep you snug at night  
  
And it's hard to know just why  
Why when you take shit  
Should you give shit?  
  
And the wind that broke your kite  
Could've been the big one  
To take you out of sight  
Keep you snug at night  
Keep you snug at night
