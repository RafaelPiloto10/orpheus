Brown skin in the kitchen,  
China white Washrag and the dollars,  
On the table Keep it quiet, quiet  
  
They come and go through the back door  
Who's keepin' score Who's keepin'  
Pension, weren't no mention,  
Medicaid? Sorry, and the g-men,  
Got the word in Gettin' wise, Goodnight  
  
Pistol blew the whistle On the plan, Mexican  
And the river made of dollars Made of sand  
  
They come and go through the back door  
Who's keepin' score Who's keepin'  
Pension, weren't no mention,  
Medicaid? Sorry, and the g-men,  
Got the word in Gettin' wise, Goodnight
