By the time you read this letter  
I'll be gone  
I'm not the man I was when I left home  
By the time you see my face  
I will have aged  
Much more than the passing of the days  
  
This many miles might as well be the moon  
It's a desolate place and I'm missing you  
My heart can't believe what my eyes they have seen  
God knows what's pulling us through  
In a world gone insane, I've whispered your name  
I'm missing you  
  
Sometimes in the quiet of the night  
I reach for you as if you're by my side  
When everything around me seems all gone  
The thought of holding you keeps me hangin' on  
  
This many miles might as well be the moon  
It's a desolate place and I'm missing you  
My heart can't believe what my eyes they have seen  
God knows what's pulling us through  
In a world gone insane, I've whispered your name  
Oh,I'm missing you  
In a world gone insane, I whisper your name  
I'm missing you
