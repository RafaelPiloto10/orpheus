I've tried and tried to run and hide  
To find a life that's new  
But where I go, I always know  
I can't escape from you.  
  
A jug of wine to numb my mind  
But what good does it do  
The jug runs dry and still I cry  
I can't escape from you.  
  
These wasted tears are souvenirs  
Of a love I thought was true  
Your memory is chained to me  
I can't escape from you.  
  
There is no end, I can't pretend  
That dreams will soon come true  
A slave too long to a heart of stone  
I can't escape from you.
