Now you ask me if I will go with you  
Well I'd like to but I don't know if it's right  
Are you looking for someone to care for you  
Or just someone to love you tonight  
  
Well I don't want to be a one night stand  
So if that's what you got planned  
Baby before we go you better let me know  
I don't want to be a one night stand  
  
It been so long since I've had some loving  
And your kisses make me wish that you were mine  
Now it'd be so easy for me to fall for you  
And let myself have a good time  
  
Well I don't want to be a one night stand  
So if that's what you got planned  
Baby before we go you better let me know  
I don't want to be a one night stand  
  
Well I don't want to be a one night stand  
So if that's what you got planned  
Baby before we go you better let me know  
I don't want to be a one night stand  
  
Well I don't want to be a one night stand  
So if that's what you got planned  
Baby before we go you better let me know  
I don't want to be a one night stand
