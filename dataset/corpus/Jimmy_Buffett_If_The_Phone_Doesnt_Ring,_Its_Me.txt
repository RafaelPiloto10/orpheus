Jimmy Buffett, Will Jennings, Michael Utley  
There are oceans of feelings between us  
Currents that take us and sweep us away  
That's why we seldom have seen us  
In the light of a cold hard day  
  
Lots of new friends with the same old answers  
Open your eyes, you might see  
Of our lives were that simple  
We'd live in the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me  
  
If the phone doesn't ring  
You'll know that it's me  
I'll be out in the eye of the storm  
If the phone doesn't ring  
You'll know that I'll be  
Where someone can make me feel warm  
It's too bad we can't turn  
And live in the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me  
  
I've had good days and bad days  
And going half mad days  
I try to let go but you're still on my mind  
I've lost all the old ways  
I'm searching for new plays  
Putting it all on the line  
  
Lots of new friends with the same old problems  
Open your eyes, you might see  
If our lives were that simple  
We'd live in the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me  
  
If it takes all the future  
We'll live through the past  
If the phone doesn't ring, it's me
