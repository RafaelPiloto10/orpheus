You want me to leave, you want me to stay  
You ask me to come back, you turn and walk away  
You want to be lovers, and you want to be friends  
I'm losing my patience, you're nearing the end  
  
One of these days you're gonna reach out and find  
The one that you count on has left you behind  
Don't want to be no martyr, with no one, no say  
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late  
  
Treat me right, treat me right  
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light  
  
Do you think I'm a fool, well you better think twice  
I've had enough baby, it's time you realized  
That you can't have it both ways, it's no way to live  
You've done all the takin', it's your turn to give  
  
One of these days you're gonna reach out and find  
The one that you count on has left you behind  
Don't want to be no martyr, with no one, no say  
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late  
  
Treat me right, treat me right  
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light  
Oh, treat me right  
  
You want me to leave, you want me to stay  
You ask me to come back, you turn and walk away  
You want to be lovers, and you want to be friends  
I'm losing my patience, you're nearing the end  
  
Treat me right, treat me right  
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light  
Oh, treat me right  
  
[Repeat: x5]  
Treat me right, treat me right
