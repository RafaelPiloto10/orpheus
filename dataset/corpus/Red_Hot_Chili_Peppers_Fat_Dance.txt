Soft, she's off and left, now I'm a coming  
I'm feeling in the ghetto 'cause that's my trouble  
  
I met her on the school yard and  
She was such a cool card  
She took me for a fool  
Because I acted like a bodyguard  
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love  
She was just the cutest thing  
My god that I have ever seen  
Tearin up my seraton and messing  
With my dopamine  
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love  
Just about the time  
That I was feeling fine again  
She walked into the room  
Wearing nothing but a cardigan  
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love  
She knew what she was doin'  
When she told me no she would  
Never let the perfect message  
In and get the perfect screwin'  
Oh Yohanna love oh oh

Number three reasons why I'm in your house  
Hot butter melts across your mouth  
Dancing and a dancing, And a dancing machine  
Somebody move, Somebody scream  
  
Yeah  
  
One reason why I got you floored  
A-woman is that you can do the move-a-more  
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor  
Keep it moving 'cause I need the hardcore  
I need the hardcore  
I need the hardcore  
I need the hardcore  
Hardcore
