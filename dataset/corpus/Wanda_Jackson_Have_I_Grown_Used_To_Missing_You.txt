I haven't cried a tear all day and the hurtin's gone away  
Have I finally grown used to mssing you  
In the lonely hours tonight will I long to hold you tight  
For have I finally grown used to missing you  
  
For I must not let go of the greatest love I'll know  
Is there still a change that you'll come back to me  
It would be more than I could take and I know my heart would break  
If I've really grown used to missing you  
  
Oh I must not let go...  
Have I finally grown used to missing you
