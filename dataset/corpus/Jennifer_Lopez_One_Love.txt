Took a shot, with the bad boy from the block  
Picked my love right from the start  
Mister wrong, he plays his part  
Back to the beginning, now round two  
Try my luck with something new  
We danced until we said, "I do"  
My luck is bad, no more us, two  
No me and you  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it too much to ask  
For a real love,  
Something that'll last?  
Is there one love?  
Only once in a lifetime?  
It's so hard to find  
The perfect one to call mine  
Is there one love?  
Somebody that compliments me?  
And makes me wanna never leave?  
Made just right for me?  
Is there one love, one love,  
One love, one love?  
  
It's take three, could there be a part for me?  
Came and swept me off my feet  
Went nowhere but kept the ring  
Once again I'm lonely  
Number four, he sang to me but I'm not sure  
So worn out, but love just saw  
Made me wanna try once more  
And I couldn't say no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What's wrong with the girl  
Who wanted everything  
Good love, real trust, true meaning?  
Who truly completes me?  
I'm good on my own, but I have to know  
  
Is there one love  
Only once in a lifetime?  
It's so hard to find  
The perfect one to call mine  
Is there one love?  
Somebody that compliments me?  
And makes me wanna never leave?  
Made just right for me?  
  
Is there one love, one love,  
One love, one love?  
Is there one love, one love,  
One love, one love?  
Is there one love?
