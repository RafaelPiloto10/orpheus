Three, five, zero, one, two, five go!  
  
I was there in the back stage  
When the first light came around  
I grew up like a changeling  
To win the first time around  
I can see all the weakness  
I pick all the faults  
Well I concede all the faith tests  
Just to stick in your throats  
  
Thirty one G, thirty one G, thirty one G  
  
I hung around in your soundtrack  
To mirror all that you've done  
To find the right side of reason  
To kill the three lies for one  
I can see all the cold facts  
I can see through your eyes  
All this talk made no contact  
No matter how hard we tried  
  
Thirty one G, thirty one G, thirty one G  
  
I can still hear the footsteps  
I can see only walls  
I slid into your man-traps  
With no hearing at all  
I just see contradiction  
Had to give up the fight  
Just to live in the past tense  
To make believe you were right  
  
Thirty one G, thirty one G, thirty one G  
  
Three, five, zero, one, two, five
