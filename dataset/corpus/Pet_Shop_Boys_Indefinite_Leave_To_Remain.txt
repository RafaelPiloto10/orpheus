I was lost  
For so long  
Feels like it's taken  
Half my life  
To find  
Where I belong  
  
[Chorus]  
Seeing you here  
You're my nation  
This is my application  
Give me hope  
Keep me sane  
Give me  
Indefinite leave to remain  
  
All the worlds  
That I saw  
I went so far away  
And still wanted you more  
  
It may sound superficial  
But can we make it official?  
Give me hope  
Keep me sane  
Give me  
Indefinite leave to remain  
  
Tell me where I stand  
What do you envision?  
One way or another  
Give me your decision now  
  
Is it time  
To proceed?  
Will you give me a chance  
And the status I need?  
  
[Chorus]
