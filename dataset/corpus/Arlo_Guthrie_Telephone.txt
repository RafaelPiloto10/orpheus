Every morning just as soon as it's light  
Get out of bed and I'm feeling alright  
Make me some coffee and I sit down alone  
The rest of the day I'm on the telephone  
Hang up, hold on  
You got a dime so you come on so strong  
Save your money and let me be  
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me  
I got a phone in my bedroom and one in the barn  
A phone in my car and one in the yard  
A phone on my saddle for when I'm out on the range  
A phone in my pocket for when I'm down at the grange  
Hang up, hold on  
You got a dime so you come on so strong  
Save your money and let me be  
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me  
Now with devaluation all over the land  
The whole wide world has got more money in their hand  
They'll be calling me up from Peking and Nome  
I'm going to rip out my telephone
