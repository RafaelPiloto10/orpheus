Saved by Your mercy,  
Found in Your grace,  
Totally surrendered to Your embrace,  
And there's nothing more than You.  
  
See Your perfection,  
I'm lost in Your peace.  
Your faithfulness sings over me,  
And Your love is the light of my soul.  
  
And I lift my eyes to You,  
Creator of the world.  
  
And I stand in awe of You,  
Of Your glory,  
And I live to worship You,  
Son of God, King of heaven.  
  
And the angels round Your throne,  
Cry out holy,  
To the One who is to come,  
Hear us sing hallelujah.  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
