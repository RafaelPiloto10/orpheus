I've been tongue tied  
A little shy  
But you're the reason why  
I've been nervous  
Inside  
But you're the reason why  
Because  
  
(Chorus:)  
I'm just sitting here thinking  
Thinking about you  
Thinking about your every move  
As you can see  
Lately  
You've been on my mind  
All the time  
  
You got me frozen  
With your smile  
Staring in your eyes  
  
It's just a crush  
I know this  
But I know it's  
Hopeless  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh yeah  
You're pretty much  
Always on my mind  
On my mind, yeah  
I think about you  
Constantly  
I'd love it if you'd  
Love me  
But  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
All the time  
Yeah
