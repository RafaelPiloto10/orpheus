So I see you' ve got a problem  
Do you wanna take it outside  
I' m not the fighting type  
But go ahead make my day  
You gonna fight me physically  
I' m gonna fight you spiritually  
I' m gonna fight you truthfully  
If I tell the truth boy  
You hate me for it  
And if I tell you lies  
You call me a good man  
I' ve got news for you boy  
Let me tell you this  
Listen to me  
  
Chorus:  
This is my game  
I' m gonna play it my way  
  
You call yourself  
The voice of the voiceless  
But the only time you use your voice  
Is when you criticise  
What other people have done  
We read in the Bible and  
Understand what it says  
They shall not judge yeah  
But why do you do it Rasta  
Call me a fake  
Call me anything you wanna  
Call me boy  
  
But what I do is - Jah work  
This is the people' s work boy  
You want me to say  
All the things that you believe in  
I' m not your puppet  
I' m not your puppet listen to me  
I' ve got news for you  
  
Chorus till fade
