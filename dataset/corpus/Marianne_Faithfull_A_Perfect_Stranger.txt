Someone who isn't like you and to waste it all.  
Someone to be around,  
Someone to have me hold when the deal goes down.  
Didn't I say it would happen this way in the end?  
Didn't I say it would happen this way in the end?  
  
A perfect stranger is what it seems,  
A perfect stranger, a crazy dream,  
A crazy dream.  
  
Find myself a perfect stranger to do for now,  
Someone who isn't like you but knows why and how.  
Someone to walk away,  
Someone who knows the time to leave or to stay.  
Isn't it sad, baby, we never have it that way?  
Isn't it sad, baby, we never have it that way?  
  
A perfect stranger is what he seems,  
A perfect stranger, a crazy dream,  
A crazy dream.  
  
Find myself a perfect stranger to take me there  
Someone who isn't like you but know why and where  
Soemone who's not afraid  
Someone who's blind to all the promises made.  
  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it...
