So now it's getting late, for those who hesitate, got no one,  
But they don't understand and no one hears the sound,  
It's like a waterfall, it's an illusion.  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are,  
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair,  
But you know as you hold back the power there without the friends  
And lovers you could never go on living.  
  
Across the waterfall that's falling evermore down on you,  
Cascading through the days, and flowing on it's way,  
That's how it has to be, just an illusion.  
  
[Chorus]
