Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop  
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'  
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the sea will split and the ships will hit  
And the sands on the shoreline will be shakin?  
And the tide will pound and the wind will sound  
And the mornin? will be a breakin?  
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path  
And the seagulls, they'll be a smilin?  
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused  
Will not be understood as they're spoken  
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night  
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean  
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts  
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline  
And the sun will respect every face on the deck  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold  
For your weary toes to be a touchin'  
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again  
That the whole wide world is watchin'  
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes  
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'  
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then they'll raise their hands sayin', we'll meet all your demands  
But we'll shout from the bow, your days are numbered  
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned there in the tide  
And like Goliath they'll be conquered
