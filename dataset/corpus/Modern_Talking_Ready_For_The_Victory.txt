Ready for the party, 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 go  
Go, go, go, ready for the victory, go, go, go  
  
You're in our hearts,  
Just from round to round  
And you will be the champion,  
The king without a crown  
Like a fireball (like a fireball)  
You never never give up (never give up)  
Hear the engine call (hear the engine)  
Waiting for a start (waiting, waiting)  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't you see, we're ready for the victory  
It's clear, you're the hero just for you and me  
I feel, we're in the pole position team  
Oh can't you see, it's like a dream  
From Australia, to USA  
And from Italy, to Germany  
And from San Marino, to Canada  
He is our biggest star  
  
Ready for the party, 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1  
Oh you cannot lose, if you have a lucky hand  
And you will be the hero, you have many friends  
Oh dreams we cannot buy (cannot buy),  
But you will win again (win again)  
Nobody does it better (does it better),  
Through passion and through in  
  
[Chorus]
