Makin' our moves, turnin' the wheel  
Trying to hide the things we feel  
Playin' the game, passin' the blame  
It isn't enough to pretend to make out  
Our hearts are hard in our own hands  
We hold all the cards  
It has to be you, has to be me  
Has to be everyone together  
It has to be you, has to be you  
We're all trying to make it better  
Has to be you, has to be you  
We're so blind that we can't see  
That it has to be you, has to be me  
Isn't it sad, isn't it strange  
We say we need re-arrange  
But never ourselves always somebody else  
Another defence, another excuse  
Pointing the finger where we choose  
We just don't believe it's ourselves we deceive  
It has to be you, has to be me  
Has to be everyone together  
It has to be you, has to be you  
We're all trying to make it better  
Has to be you, has to be you  
We're so blind that we can't see  
That it has to be you, has to be me  
See how we live, each to his own  
Everyone scared to be alone  
Still we go on as tho' nothing was wrong  
It has to be you, has to be me  
Has to be everyone together  
It has to be you, has to be you  
We're all trying to make it better  
Has to be you, has to be you  
We're so blind that we can't see  
That it has to be you, has to be me
