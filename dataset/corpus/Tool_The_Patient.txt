A groan of tedium escapes me,  
Startling the fearful.  
Is this a test? It has to be,  
Otherwise I can't go on.  
Draining patience, drain vitality.  
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.  
  
But I'm still right here  
Giving blood, keeping faith  
And I'm still right here.  
  
Wait it out,  
Gonna wait it out,  
Be patient (wait it out).  
  
If there were no rewards to reap,  
No loving embrace to see me through  
This tedious path I've chosen here,  
I certainly would've walked away by now.  
Gonna wait it out.  
  
If there were no desire to heal  
The damaged and broken met along  
This tedious path I've chosen here  
I certainly would've walked away by now.  
  
And I still may, (sigh), I still may.  
  
Be patient.  
I must keep reminding myself of this.  
  
And if there were no rewards to reap,  
No loving embrace to see me through  
This tedious path I've chosen here,  
I certainly would've walked away by now.  
And I still may.  
  
Gonna wait it out.
