He lives inside my mouth  
And tells me what to say  
When he turns the trains  
On he makes it go away  
The hands are cracked and dirty and  
The nails are beetle wings  
When he turns the trains on he  
Unties all of the strings  
  
Tell me something beautiful  
Tell me something free  
Tell me something beautiful  
And I wish that I could be  
  
Then I got my wings and I never even knew it  
When I was a worm, thought I couldn't get through it  
  
Come, come  
Toys all smell like children  
And scab-knees will obey  
I'll just have to kneel on broomsticks  
Just to make it go away  
  
(the inauguration of the worm)  
  
Then I got my wings and I never even knew it,  
When I was a worm, thought I couldn't get through it  
  
Because today  
Is black  
Because there is no turning back  
Because your lies have watered me  
I have become the strongest weed  
  
The taste of metal  
Dis integrator  
Three holes upon the leather belt  
It's cut and swollen  
And the age is swollen  
There's no one here to save our self  
  
This is what you should fear  
You are what you should fear  
  
This is what you should fear  
You are what you should fear  
  
This is what you should fear  
You are what you should fear
