[Chorus]  
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive  
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise  
To fly  
To fly  
  
Uh yo, yo,  
I wish today it will rain all day  
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away  
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me  
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away  
Angel away, yeah strange in a way  
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away  
They got their guns out aiming at me  
But I become Neo when they aiming at me  
Me, me, me against them  
Me against enemies, me against friends  
Somehow they both seem to become one  
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood  
They start coming and I start rising  
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising  
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh yo, yo  
Everybody wanna try to box me in  
Suffocating every time it locks me in  
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in  
But I will remain where the top begins  
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line  
I am not a girl that can ever be defined  
I am not fly, I am levitation  
I represent an entire generation  
I hear the criticism loud and clear  
That is how I know that the time is near  
So we become alive in a time of fear  
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare  
Cry my eyes out for days upon days  
Such a heavy burden placed upon me  
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's  
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Get ready for it  
Get ready for it  
Get ready for it  
I came to win  
Get ready for it  
Get ready for it  
Get ready for it  
  
[Chorus]
