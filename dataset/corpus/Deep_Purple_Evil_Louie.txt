Some say the state of Texas  
Could accommodate the entire  
Human population  
Five point six billion versions of  
The truth under one roof  
Some revelation  
Take a bit of this give a  
Bit of that  
Put it in a blender pull it  
Out a hat  
There's no going back it's a lie  
It's a fact  
Has the cat got your tongue  
Been too long in the sun  
There's dust on your tracks  
There's no going back  
  
Come to think of it's a  
Load of monkeys  
Every time you listen to your  
Sun kissed lover's words  
Evil Louie is tomorrow's sadness  
It's a game of madness in a  
Perfect world  
  
Some would say French cuisine's  
More appealing  
Than a cold drink  
Burgers and fries  
Some have said that a  
Pillar of society  
An upright citizen's incapable of  
Lust and crime  
Tale a bit of this  
Give a bit of that  
Put it in a blender pull  
It out a hat  
But he don't stand a change  
With his pants around his ankles  
Has the cat got your tongue  
Been too long in the sun  
There's dust on your tracks  
There's no going back
