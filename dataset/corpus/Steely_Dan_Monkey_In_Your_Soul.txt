I got one and you want four  
It's so hard to help you  
I can't keep up with you no more  
And you treat me like it's a sin  
But you can't lock me in  
You want me here with you right to the end  
No thank you my friend  
I fear the monkey in your soul  
  
Won't you turn that bebop down  
I can't hear my heart beat  
Where's that fatback chord I found?  
Honey don't you think it was wrong  
To interrupt my song?  
I'll pack my things and run so far from here  
Goodbye dear  
  
I fear the monkey in your soul
