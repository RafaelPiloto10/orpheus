Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things  
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything  
I'm having a good time haters tryna ruin it,  
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doin' it  
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, Larry time  
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,  
I I I tried to told you, drizzy still ain't nothin' nice  
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life  
Okay now we outta here  
Toodles to you bitches  
And if you dolled up  
I got the voodoo for you bitches, yeah  
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble  
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double  
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of  
But I never ever trip  
Just peace happiness and love  
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug  
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does, ah!  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm about whatever man  
Fuck what they be talkin' about,  
They opinion doesn't count,  
We the only thing that matters (ooh)  
So we do it how we do it  
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it  
I be up all night,  
Whole crews in here  
Cause I don't really know who I'm a lose this year (ow)  
Man I love my team.  
Man I love my team  
I would die for them niggas, ow  
  
Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her I'm a get her  
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter  
I got that kinda' wait wait fixate!  
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?  
That was just a keep sake  
Bought the president the Louie presidential briefcase  
Never been a cheapskate  
We got the Hawks I ain't talkin' about the peach state  
Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweep stakes  
(ha ha ha ha)  
Fuck I look like hoe  
I look like yes and you like no  
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed.  
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed  
M M M6 from a M-2  
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu  
But I collect 100 thou at the venue  
And pop bottles with the team young money til the death of me  
  
I'm about whatever man.  
Fuck what they be talking about,  
They opinion doesn't count,  
We the only thing that matters (ow)  
So we do it how we do it  
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it  
I be up all night,  
Whole crews in here  
Cause I don't really know who I'm a lose this year (ow)  
Man I love my team  
Man I love my team  
I would die for them niggas, ow  
  
I mean we can't even rock them shoes if it ain't gotta comma on the price tag  
I mean, I mean but then again who who looks at the price tag  
  
Oh yeah we in this bitch  
Ow, ow, ow  
Oh yeah we in this bitch  
Ow, ow, ow  
  
[Chorus: x2]
