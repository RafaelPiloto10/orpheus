You drive a pretty car, you know how fine you are  
And nobody needs to say it, no way  
They love the clothes you wear, they compliment you  
And I just love the way you play it  
  
But the only thing you dream of  
Money can't buy for you, oh  
And in my dreams I'll make your wish come true  
  
For the girl who has everything, I bring you love  
I bring you love  
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough  
Of my love  
  
Why do you run and hide, say what you feel inside  
(Say what you feel)  
Why must you always fake it, oh yeah  
Girl you need to understand  
Your heart's safe within my hands  
I promise I'll never break it, oh  
  
I know that you still dream of  
What money can't buy for you  
And in my dreams I'll make your wish come true  
  
For the girl who has everything, I bring you love  
I bring you love (I bring you love)  
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough  
Enough of my love  
  
If you just let me try  
(My baby listen)  
I'll help you find  
(What you've been missing)  
Oh yeah, you gotta listen to your heart  
And not your mind  
Oh baby yeah  
  
For the girl who has everything, I bring you love  
(I bring you love) I bring you love, yeah  
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough  
Of my love  
  
(For the girl who has everything)  
Oh girl, you want my love, I'm gonna give it to you  
(I bring you love)  
('Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough)  
Of my love
