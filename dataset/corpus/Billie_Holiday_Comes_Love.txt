Comes rain, put your rubber on your feed  
Comes a snow, you can get a little heat  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes a fire, you know what to do  
Blow a tire, buy another shoe  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Don't try hiding, cause there isn't any use  
You start sliding when you're heart turns on the juice  
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day  
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes a heatwave, you can hurry to the shore  
Comes the, you can hide behind the door  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes the measles,  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
That all brother, if you've ever bin in love  
That all brother, you know where I'm speaking of  
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake  
Comes depression, you may get another break  
Comes love, nothing can be done
