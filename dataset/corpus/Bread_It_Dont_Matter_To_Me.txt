It don't matter to me  
If you really feel that  
You need sometime to be free  
Time to go out searching for yourself  
Hoping to find time to go to find  
  
And it don't matter to me  
If you take up with someone  
Who's better than me  
'Cause your happiness is all I want  
For you to find your piece of mind  
  
Lotta people have an ego hang up  
'Cause they want to be the only one  
How many came before it really doesn't matter  
Just as long as you're the last  
Everybody's moving on and try to find out  
What's been missing in the past  
  
And it don't matter to me  
If your searching brings you back together with me  
'Cause there'll always be  
An empty room waiting for you  
An open heart waiting for you  
Time is on my side  
'Cause it don't matter to me  
  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter to me  
  
'Cause there'll always be  
An empty room waiting for you  
An open heart waiting for you  
Time is on my side  
'Cause it don't matter to me
