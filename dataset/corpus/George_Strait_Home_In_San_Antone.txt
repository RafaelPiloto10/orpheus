Haven't got a worry  
Haven't got a care  
I haven't got a thing to call my own  
Though I'm out of money  
  
'm a millionaire  
I still have my home in san antone  
When I greet my neighbor with a "hi why'all"  
I'm wealthy as a king upon a throne  
  
You can have your mansion or your cottage small  
I'll just take my home in san antone  
  
Traveling around the country  
On my merry way  
I've been to crowds and felt I was alone  
But when I feel like braggin'  
I just up and say  
I'm a native son of san antone  
  
There's a sweet somebody by the alamo  
Someday she's going to be my very own  
And we'll buy a high chair in a year or so  
For our little home in san antone
