Well, I ain't been home for so doggone long  
I almost forgot where I come from  
Ain't got no money but I still ain't a bum  
I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
A back last summer down by the sea  
I seen a pretty girl in  
I snapped my fingers, said son of a gun  
She's almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Some people wonder how I live  
Sometimes I pick, sometimes I give  
People say I'm a bum  
I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
I met a pretty girl up in Chicago  
She said, honey baby, I love you so  
She begged me to stay and not act like a bum  
I've been almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Friends ask me why I don't take a wife  
Settle down to a married life  
They say it's good as most and it's better than some  
I say I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Some people wonder how I live  
  
Just the other night out in Tucson  
I had a little date with a great big blonde  
I took her home, she said didn't we have fun  
Hmm, almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
When it's time for the final date with  
Old Saint Pete's at the pearly gate  
He'll say I hope you're ready for your time's come  
I'll say I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Some people wonder how I live
