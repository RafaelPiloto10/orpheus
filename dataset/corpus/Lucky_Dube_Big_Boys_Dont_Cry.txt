If we both believe in Reincarnation,  
Maybe we will have a  
Chance in the next life.  
You felt something for me  
And I was so deeply in love with you.  
But we both said nothing  
Till we ran out of time  
Sometimes I cry,  
I said I cry  
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside  
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside  
But I cry,  
I said I cry  
Sometimes I cry  
And I remember the days  
When love was so far away from me,  
The only time I knew about love was  
When mommy and daddy told me they loved me,  
And I Didn't know that today it would be  
Me having got to say I love you  
But I remember that  
Chorus  
Big boys don't cry  
And sometimes  
I cry  
I said I cry.  
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside  
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside  
But I cry  
I see your beautiful face  
Everytime I close my eyes,  
You reach out for me I reach out for you  
But in real life we cannot meet Oh!!!!!  
That is why I cry,  
I said I cry  
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside  
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside  
But I cry  
And I remember the days  
When love was so far away from me,  
The only time I heard about love was  
When mommy and daddy told me they loved me,  
And I didn't know that today it would be  
Me having got to say I love you,  
But I remember that  
Chorus till fade...
