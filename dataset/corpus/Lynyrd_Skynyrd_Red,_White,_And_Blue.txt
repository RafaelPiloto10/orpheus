We don't have no plastic L.A. Frynds,  
Ain't on the edge of no popular trend.  
Ain't never seen the inside of that magazine GQ.  
We don't care if you 're a lawyer, or a Texas oil man,  
Or some waitress busting ass in some liquor stand.  
If you got Soul  
We hang out with people just like you  
  
[Chorus]  
My hair's turning white,  
My neck's always been red,  
My collar's still blue,  
We've always been here  
Just trying to sing the truth to you.  
Yes you could say  
We've always been,  
Red, White, and Blue  
  
Ride our own bikes to Sturgis  
We pay our own dues,  
Smoking camels, drinking domestic brews  
You want to know where I have been  
Just look at my hands  
Yeah, I've driven by the White House,  
Spent some time in jail.  
Momma cried but she still wouldn't pay my bail.  
I ain't been no angel,  
But even God, he understands.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah that's right!  
My Daddy worked hard, and so have I,  
Paid our taxes and gave our lives  
To serve this great country  
So what are they complaining about  
  
Yeah we love our families, we love our kids  
You know it is love that makes us all so rich  
That's where were at,  
If they don't like it they can just  
Get the hell out!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, red, white, and blue  
Red, white, and blue  
Oh, oh, red, white, and blue
