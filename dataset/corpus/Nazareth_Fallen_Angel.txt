If you've never had no one  
Take the word of a fallen angel  
If you never been no where  
Take the word of a fallen angel  
If you've ever been lonely  
Take the word of a fallen angel  
  
You know you're not the first to fall  
And you know you won't be the last  
In flight, you never think you can  
Can be the one who's gonna crash.  
  
When you think you can't go on  
Look around for a fallen angel  
When you feel you're the lost one  
Look around for a fallen angel  
When you're hurtin' for someone  
Look around for a fallen angel  
  
You know you're not the first to fall  
And you know you won't be the last  
In flight, you never think you can  
Can be the one who's gonna crash  
  
Don't you think it's time to show  
Don't you think it's time we know  
What's in your heart  
  
There's a lesson to be learned  
Take the word of a fallen angel  
There's a song for every heart  
Take the word of a fallen angel  
When you find out where you are  
Don't you know you're a fallen angel  
If you've never had no one.
