Chorus  
All I want for christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth see my two front teeth  
Gee if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you a merry christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Sissel sitting on a sissel  
Every time I try to speak  
All I do is a whistle  
  
Chorus  
  
Good old Santa and his reindeer  
They used to bring me lots of toys and candy  
I call for hamster ramster honnor and blitzer  
None of them can understand me  
  
Chorus
