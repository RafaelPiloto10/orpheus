I'm just a scarecrow  
with out you  
baby please don't disappear  
I beg your pardon dear  
  
I gotta a bottle full of trumpet  
a hat box full of drum  
I beg your pardon dear  
  
I got upset  
I lost my head  
I didn't mean  
the things I said  
You are the landscape  
Of my dreams  
Darlin' I beg your pardon  
  
I'd give your Boardwalk  
And Park Place  
And all of my hotels  
I beg your pardon dear  
  
Please don't go back to St. Louis  
Can't you tell that I'm sincere  
I beg your pardon dear
