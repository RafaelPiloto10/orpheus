Ooh, you got big muscles rippling  
Underneath your shirt  
I'm so glad to meet you, baby  
Tell me, what do you do for work?  
  
Me? I'm just a housewife  
So sad and all alone  
Desperate for a strong man  
To help me fix my home  
  
I know I must look a sight  
In this, this flimsy little dress  
Won't you try your very best  
To save a damsel in distress?  
  
I've got tasty treats to tempt you  
Come and sit down on my couch  
I'm sure it won't take long  
To figure all my problems out  
  
My home, it needs attention  
It's such a big old mess  
Take out your trusty tool  
And save this damsel in distress  
  
Now, you need no invitation, baby  
Just walk in and shut the door  
Follow the red rose petals  
That I've left scattered on the floor  
  
I'll be upstairs waiting  
With a list of honey-do's  
Customized and tailor-made  
For a, a handy man like you  
  
You know I'd be so grateful  
If you'd come relieve my stress  
Won't you heed my SOS  
And save a damsel in distress?  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
So sweet  
I got the need if you're willing to please  
Trust me  
I make it so good that you won't wanna leave  
  
I got tasty treats to tempt you  
Come and sit down on my couch  
I'm sure it won't take long  
To figure all my problems out  
  
My home, it needs attention  
It's such a big old mess  
Take out your trusty tool  
And save this damsel in distress  
  
Now what's a girl to do?  
I'm just a, a damsel in, in distress, yeah  
Oh, little old me, baby  
What you want for dinner, baby?  
Oh, yeah
