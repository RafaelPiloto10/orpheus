Fire walkers feel no pain from the coals  
Ruled by passion beyond their control  
Vengeance is king in the zone of Red Vision  
Sparks fly and tempers flair  
You see the enemy everywhere  
Hate shines like burning bridges in your eyes  
In love and war we stand alone  
Trustin' nothin' but our own, Red Vision  
  
Anger sharpens your point of view  
Fans the fire in and around you  
Fahrenheit in the realm of your senses  
In love and war we stand alone  
Trusting nothing but our own, Red Vision  
  
Mind like a steel trap, heart like a prison  
With tears of rage, we burn in our Red Vision  
  
Once again, I'll walk the coals  
Tiptoe through the minefields of your soul  
I've come to take you home  
  
Red Vision  
Red Vision  
Red Vision  
Red Vision  
  
Oh, Red Vision.......
