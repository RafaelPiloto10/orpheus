If you think I want the life you choose to live  
I don't think I want the love you've got to give  
If you think my goals could be so trivial and small  
Then, I don't think you know me at all  
Born between the covers of your fashion books  
You think you can make it, girl, on just your looks  
But you could never bring me up  
Between us stands a wall  
No, I don't think you know me at all  
Believing in the promise painted in your smile  
I've chased what I was running from, girl, all my life  
I've known you a hundred times in memories I recall, but  
I don't think you know me at all  
I don't think you know me at all.
