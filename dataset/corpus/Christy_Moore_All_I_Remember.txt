I was lured by the rocking horse  
Sweets and the bualadh bos  
Fifty wild boys to a room  
Sing lamh, lamh eile, the dish ran away with the spoon  
Black shoes and stockings for those who say don't  
Blue is the colour outside  
God made the world  
The snake tempted Eve and she died  
Wild Christian brothers sharpening their leathers  
Learn it by heart, that's the rule  
All I remember is dreading September and school  
CHORUS  
And they made me for better or worse  
The fool that I am or the wise man I'll be  
And they gave me their blessings or curse  
It wasn't their fault I was me ...  
Not the one that you see  
The priest in confession condemns my obsession  
With thoughts that I do not invite  
I mumble and stutter  
He slams down the shutter  
Goodnight - (Good night to you too, Father)  
Stainless as steel  
Lord, you know how I feel  
Someone shoot me while my soul is clear  
I don't think I'll last  
But my vow to abstain was sincere  
Arch-confraternity men to the fight  
Raise up your banners on high  
Searching for grace  
Securing my place  
When I die  
CHORUS  
Oh God, he kept a very close eye on me  
Hung round my bed in the darkness, he spied on me  
Caught me in the long grass so often, he died on me....  
Ballrooms of romance in Salthill or Mallow  
I stood like John Wayne by the wall  
Lined up like cattle, we waited to do battle and fall  
You can't wine and dine her in an old Morris Minor  
So ask her before it's too late  
I danced on girls' toes - accepted rejection as my fate  
Drink was my saviour, it made me much braver  
But I couldn't hold it too well  
I slipped on the coach and ruined my approach as I fell
