I knew we wanted something more  
My heart is ready to shine  
Like it's never done before, ooh  
I love the way you make me fly  
One shot, this is the moment  
We've all been waiting for, ooh  
  
Are you with me, come closer  
Are you ready to discover  
  
Every moment gets better  
When I feel this much for you tonight  
Every moment gets better  
Come again even closer and closer  
  
Closer, closer  
  
I want to savor it all tonight  
One shot, we make it stand  
No matter where we go, ooh  
I love the way you take your time  
One smile, this is the moment  
We've all been waiting for, ooh  
  
Are you with me, come closer  
Are you ready to discover  
  
Every moment gets better  
When I feel this much for you tonight  
Every moment gets better  
Come again even closer and closer  
  
Every moment gets better  
When I feel this much for you tonight  
Every moment gets better  
Come again even closer and closer  
  
Closer, closer  
  
Oh who, oh who (4x)
