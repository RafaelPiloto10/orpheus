This one's called  
Now for you  
Downtown samba  
  
Canal Street's where we dance  
We do the rhumba, samba  
The city's hot, we're almost naked  
It's a scandal  
Night's still young  
We do the samba with the congo warrior  
  
Downtown samba  
Downtown samba  
  
Hey you over there  
You shouldn't dance alone  
Watch me come on closer  
Cause I am the one  
To dance with you  
All night long  
I'm dancing like a mambo  
Go go go for sambo  
Dancing, dancing, dancing  
Tango  
Over there, mister  
Come see, you'll see  
So dance the tango, tango
