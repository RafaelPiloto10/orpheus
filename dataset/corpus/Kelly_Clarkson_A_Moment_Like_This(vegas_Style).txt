What if I told you it was all meant to be,  
Would you believe me  
Would you agree  
It's almost that feeling we've met before  
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy  
When I tell you love has come here and now  
  
A moment like this,  
Some people wait a lifetime,  
For a moment like this  
Some people search forever  
For that one special kiss,  
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me,  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this.  
  
And everything changes  
But beauty remains,  
Something so tender I can't explain,  
Well I maybe be draming,  
But till I awake,  
Can we make this dream last forever  
And I'll cherish all the love we share.  
  
For a moment like this,  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this  
Some people search forever  
For that one special kiss,  
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me,  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this.  
  
Could this be the greatest of them all  
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall,  
So let me tell you this,  
Some poeple wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this.  
  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this  
Some people search forever  
For that one special kiss  
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me,  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this.  
  
Ohh ohhh a moment like this  
Ohh this painful search forever(oh yeah yeah)  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this... A moment like this..
