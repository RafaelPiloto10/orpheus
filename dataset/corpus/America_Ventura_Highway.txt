Chewing on a piece of grass  
Walking down the road  
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here Joe?  
Some people say this town don't look  
Good in snow  
You don't care, I know  
  
Ventura Highway in the sunshine  
Where the days are longer  
The nights are stronger  
Than moonshine  
You're gonna go I know  
  
'Cause the free wind is blowin' through  
Your hair  
And the days surround your daylight  
There  
Seasons crying no despair  
Alligator lizards in the air  
  
Wishin' on a falling star  
Watchin' for the early train  
Sorry boy, but I've been hit by  
Purple rain  
Aw, come on Joe, you can always  
Change your name  
Thanks a lot son, just the same  
  
Ventura Highway  
In the sunshine  
Where the days are longer  
The nights are stronger  
Than moonshine  
You're gonna go I know  
  
'Cause the free wind is blowin' through  
Your hair  
And the days surround you daylight  
There  
Seasons crying no despair  
Alligator lizards in the air
