Standing in the half light, wondering if you can  
There stands the priest of sinners, consolation in his hands  
Though he prays he won't need it, he keeps it by his side  
Waiting for the face up and the answer in her eyes  
All while the music's playing a backdrop serenade  
There's only one point of view  
To be doing the things, things that lovers should do  
  
Disco-queens in dancestep, moving face to face  
All tangled up in neon don't think it's some disgrace  
The blue western denim, the east coats razor edge  
The European fashion, the leathers and re-threads  
All while the music's playing a backdrop serenade  
There's only one point of view  
To be doing the things, things that lovers should do
