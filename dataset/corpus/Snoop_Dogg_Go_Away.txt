[Snoop]  
Let cho' mind not be confused  
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes  
New fools, you fools, these fools, all y'all  
Talking bad about me, and my motherfucking dawg  
He ain't tripping, I ain't tripping, but y'all niggas still dissing  
To me, some of these suckers'll never get it  
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip  
And DoggHouse in your mouth, now tell me how you living  
Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga Ren is "The Villain"  
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chilling  
Now as time flies by I see the game getting mo' reala  
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?  
I always tend to come with it  
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it  
I'm too young to retire, I'm having fun wit it  
See when you learn what to do with it, I'll be done with it  
Come with it  
  
[Chorus: Snoop (KoKane)]  
Go (just go away) go a-way!  
Niggas can't be trusted  
(Just come back another day)  
Niggas be on bitch shit  
(Just go far, a-way)  
Niggas get it twisted  
Just go a-way  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Now she said she don't like a G  
Well listen here bitch, get the fuck from 'round me  
You thought you was bout to get a drink on me?  
I put hands on you bitch like Suga Free  
I always let a bitch know her boundaries  
Same with a nigga, I treat him like a flea  
You claim to be, you aim to be in my spot  
Motherfucker, you will get popped  
Not, knowing who you fucking with, niggas be on bitch shit  
Nigga we be fucking quick, nigga we ain't talking shit  
When the heat's spit, niggas be on bitch shit  
Trying to get somewhere, covering up they biscuit  
And then he in the club, all up on my dilznick  
But when I leave, you niggas pulling trick shit  
But it's cool, cause niggas gonna miss this  
Cause I'ma keep it all business, what is this?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
I said let yo' mind not be confused  
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes  
You fools, these fools, new fools, all y'all  
Talking bad about me, and my motherfucking dog  
He ain't tripping, I ain't tripping, but y'all niggas still dissing  
Look here bitch, some of these niggas'll never get it  
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip  
And DoggHouse in your mouth, now tell me how you livin  
Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga Ren is "The Villain"  
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chilling  
Now as time fly I see the game getting mo' reala  
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?  
I always tend to come with it  
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it  
Too young to retire, I'm having fun wit it  
When you learn what to do with it I'll be done with it  
Come with it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Yeah I'm bout to go far away  
So far you might not see me  
My nigga Meech on the beat  
We taking over this motherfucker, ha ha!  
And they thought we fell off  
Fell all up in your motherfucking ass  
Bitch!  
KoKane, aw that's funky right there  
Putting it back on the map  
Let me hear some dog  
As we take your mind  
To a dimension you never thought existed  
  
[Chorus]
