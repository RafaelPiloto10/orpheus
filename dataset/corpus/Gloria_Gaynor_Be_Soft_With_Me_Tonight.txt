I like you soft ways, I know she's gone  
But here I am and I'm prepared to stay  
You don't have to hide inside your mind  
Put up a fight, I'll love you make it right  
'Cause if your heart needs some attention, I think you know I can be found  
And I can ease the tension whenever I'm around  
Come on, be soft with me tonight  
I know you need a love that's true  
And I can supply it  
Come on, be soft with me, don't fight  
You know how much I need you too  
And I won't deny it, oh no  
  
You wanna a girl that's strong  
That isn't wrong, I understand  
I'm here to help your plan  
I just wanna please but you unease  
Won't let you down  
Your dreams won't touch the ground  
So don't pretend she didn't matter  
I know your heart feels insecure  
I'll help you to forget her  
My love will be the cure  
Come on, be soft with me tonight  
Let it be me you're thinking off  
Ooh baby, baby, c'mon be soft with me tonight (Don't fight)  
You know how much I need you love  
Oh, be soft with me tonight  
Let it be me you're picking out  
Oh, come on, be soft with me, don't fight  
You know how much I need your love  
Oh now, be soft (Be soft with me tonight)  
Come on, come on, be soft, be soft  
And don't fight  
Be soft with me tonight
