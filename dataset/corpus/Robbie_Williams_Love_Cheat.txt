It's the end of the night  
I want to know you  
Get the phone, call a cab and take you home yeah  
I think there's something you should know  
I'll send my boys an order through Interflora  
Tell you lies like "I love you" and "I adore you"  
I think there's something you should know  
  
I'm a Love Cheat  
And you look so sweet  
Can take you home where I live  
Lay you by the fire  
Love me, lady  
I'm a liar  
  
The curtain's closed  
And the night is fun  
I think it's time for me to not be home alone  
I think I'll put the cat out and give the dog a bone  
I hardly know you but I like your figure  
Suppose I'll read about you in The Mirror  
I think there's something everybody should know  
  
I'm a Love Cheat  
And you look so sweet  
Can take you home where I live  
Lay you by the fire  
Love me, lady  
I'm a liar  
  
I'm a Love Cheat  
And you're looking so sweet  
Can take you home where I live  
Lay you by the fire  
Love me, lady  
I'm a liar  
  
You love me  
You love me  
You love me  
You need me  
I'm a liar  
You want me  
You need me  
You want me  
And I'm a liar
