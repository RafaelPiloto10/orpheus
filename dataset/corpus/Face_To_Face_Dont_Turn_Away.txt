god knows i've tried i've waited in spite of myself there's nothing to hide i
need you like no one else i'm sick of trying to figure out where i went wrong
i can't believe these words you say don't you turn away from me i can't say
another word i haven't said before don't you turn away from me don't ask for
my apologies i don't have anymore god knows i'm tired of lies and denials from
you it's down to the wire i've given myself and that's all i can do i'm sick
of trying to figure out where i went wrong i can't believe these words you say
don't you turn away from me i can't say another word i haven't said before
don't you turn away from me don't ask for my apologies i haven't anymore
