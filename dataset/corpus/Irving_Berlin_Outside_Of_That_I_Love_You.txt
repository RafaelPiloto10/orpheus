What makes you think I'm crazy about you?  
What makes you think I can't do without you?  
I've looked you over carefully  
And if I never see you again, it's soon enough for me  
I hate the ground you walk upon  
I hate the phone you talk upon  
I hate 'most ev'rything that you do  
I hate that funny little mouth you drink with  
That peanut on your shoulders that you think with  
I hate the rouge upon your lips  
The polish on your finger tips  
I hate your eyes of heavenly blue  
I hate the way you sigh, honest I do  
Outside of that, I love you  
  
[Female version:]  
I hate the way you comb your hair  
I hate the flashy clothes you wear  
I hate the patent shine on your shoe  
I hate the closet that you keep your clothes in  
I hate the handkerchief you blow your nose in  
I hate the smell of your cigar  
The way you lean against a bar  
I hate the jokes you tell that are blue  
I hate that fancy tie, honest I do  
Outside of that, I love you
