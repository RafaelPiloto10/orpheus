Can you see your reflection  
False strength, hollow protection  
Run from pain and rejection  
The truth stabs again  
Till the skin is broken  
And the cut is open  
And the words once spoken  
Just fade away  
  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
  
Big head leads to confusion  
Strong heart pumps up delusion  
Tough talk, one voice communion  
Medicate the pain  
Justify your ego  
Living with denial  
And the thoughts so vile  
Won't fade away  
  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
  
It's coming  
You're falling  
You're on your own with no one left to blame  
  
Can't sleep 'cause you've made your own bed  
The sentence of the helpless  
Sink deep to the trial in your head  
The court of the selfish  
Why? Tell me why? Can't evade or escape the reality  
  
A true lie and a broken promise  
A Judas and a doubting Thomas  
A tragedy just to keep you honest  
Guilty always fall  
  
Through the trap door  
Fear the trap door  
Through the trap door  
The trap door, the trap door  
  
No fear, too scared to look up  
Can't win, nothing but bad luck  
Clock ticks, your time to face up  
You can't run for long  
When your world is broken  
Your trap door is open  
The very words you choke on  
Just fade away  
  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
Too late, standing on the trap door  
Too late, standing on the trap door
