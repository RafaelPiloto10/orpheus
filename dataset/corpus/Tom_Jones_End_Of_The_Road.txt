Well the way is dark  
The night is long  
I don't care if I never get home  
I'm waiting at the end of the road  
Well the stars may not shine  
  
Neither the moon  
What the heck we don't want no moon  
I'm waiting at the end of the road  
You can jump in my Ford and give it some gas  
Pull out the front, don't give me no sass  
Take your foot slap it on the floor  
When you get ahead we'll rock some more  
  
Oh! the way is dark  
The night is long  
I don't care if I never get home  
I'm waiting at the end of the road  
  
You can jump in my Ford and give it some gas  
Flip out the front, don't give me no sass  
Take your foot slap it on the floor  
When you get ahead we'll rock some more  
  
Well the way is dark  
The night is long  
I don't care if I never get home  
I'm waiting at the end of the road
