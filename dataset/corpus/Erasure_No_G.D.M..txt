Want to be a great dark man  
Being but a lesbian  
You are perfect, you are sheer  
If you are a red-haired queer  
  
That's life, one dice  
C'est la vie, ma cherie  
But it really doesn't matter  
  
No G.D.M., no great dark man  
No G.D.M., no great dark man  
  
There won't be a great dark man  
If I am a red-haired queer  
You are perfect, you are sheer  
If you are a red-haired queer  
  
C'est la vie, pale sniff  
C'est la vie, ma cherie  
But it really doesn't matter  
  
Yellow teeth between pink lips  
Eye-line shadow with a crazy look  
Jewel behind the lobe of ear  
Rouge on my face hides my beard  
Long violet fingernails  
I adore those magic tails  
  
I don't mind, I don't mind  
No G.D.M., no great dark man  
No G.D.M., no great dark man
