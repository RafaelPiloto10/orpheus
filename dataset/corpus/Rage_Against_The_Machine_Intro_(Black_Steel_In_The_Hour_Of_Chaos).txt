[Intro:]  
[Zack:] Hey check this out right about now....  
I wanna introduce a brotha... Who came all the way outta here  
From Long Island, New york. And he's one of the fathers of  
Revolutionary music in our time period. He was a huge influence  
On us and we wanna bring him out right now. So check it out, we  
Got a man by the name of Chuck D, from Public Enemy. Yeah.  
[Chuck D:] Wassup, wassup! Zack: Yo....  
[x5]  
  
[Chuck D:] "I got a letter from the government  
The other day  
I opened and read it  
It said they were suckers  
They wanted me for their army or whatever  
Picture me given' a damn - I said never  
Here is a land that never gave a damn  
About a brother like me and myself  
Because they never did  
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...  
It occured to me  
The suckers had authority  
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell  
How long has it been?  
They got me sittin' in the state pen  
I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before  
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor  
I'm not a fugitive on the run  
But a brother like me begun - to be another one  
Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all  
To criticize me for some crime - never the less  
They could not understand that I'm a Black man  
And I could never be a veteran  
On the strength, the situation's unreal  
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel"  
  
Yeah!
