Put your lips close to mine  
As long as they don't touch  
Out of focus, eye to eye  
Till the gravity is too much  
And I'll do anything you say  
If you say it with your hands  
And I'll be smart to walk away  
But you're quick sand  
  
This slope is treacherous  
This path is reckless  
This slope is treacherous  
And I, I, I like it  
  
I can't decide if it's a choice  
Getting swept away  
I hear the sound of my own voice  
Asking you to stay  
And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along  
Forever going with the flow but you're friction  
  
This slope is treacherous  
This path is reckless  
This slope is treacherous  
I, I, I like it  
  
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night  
And I will get you get you alone  
Your name has echoed through my mind  
And I just think you should think you should know  
That nothing safe is worth the driving  
And I will follow you follow you home  
I follow you follow you home  
  
This hope is treacherous  
This day dream is dangerous  
This hope is treacherous  
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I  
  
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night  
And I will get you get you alone  
Your name has echoed through my mind  
And I just think you should think you should know  
That nothing safe is worth the drive  
And I will follow you follow you home  
I'll follow you, follow you home  
I'll follow you, follow you home  
I'll follow you, follow you home  
  
This slope is treacherous  
I, I, I like it
