Passing through the storm -  
Led by demons - walk between the  
World of men and gods -  
Cast no shadows - draw no light.  
I rape the priestess on pagans night.  
  
I taste the serpents poison  
On the lips of the one I love.  
She brings this gift of witchcraft.  
I wear the cat-skin gloves.  
  
Apples of youth when I wrought  
Mischief, hung in a tree to rot  
In the sun. -  
Reborn in the middle of the  
Final orgy - a gift of slavery  
To the chosen one.  
  
Suicide Suicide don't you know  
Me - call to the Master - he will  
Come. - He will bring our  
Resurrection - cloacked in darkness -  
He has won.  
  
Smoke of my sacrifice. -  
Journey to the Isle of the  
Blessed. -  
Grant my soul your glory.  
At night time - I'm your guest.  
Only I know why -  
  
Each dawn I die.  
  
Smoke of my sacrifice. -  
Journey to the Isle of the  
Blessed. -  
Grant my soul your glory.  
At night time - I'm your guest.  
Only I know why
