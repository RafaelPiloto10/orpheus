[Mary J. Blige]  
All my love is all I have  
All my life I look for you  
  
[Fabolous]  
I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now  
But I can barely be found  
And I rarely be round  
But when I do, the jury be drowned  
And you can see how clear the Pile Vase, and the Canaries be now  
The top on the 5 series be down  
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now  
Although there was a time I would barely see fowls  
But I'm gettin' a multi-million dollar yearly fee now  
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now  
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now  
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now  
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds  
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now  
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round  
Everybody staring unnecessarily now  
But there's no tints on my lights, so you can clearly see now  
  
[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]  
All my love is all I have  
And my dreams are very special  
All my life I looked for you  
And today your dream come true  
You need me and I need you  
Lovin' us is very special  
Lovin' life and life and livin'  
Your very special  
  
[Fabolous]  
Y'all can never be built like me, even if Y'all look at my blueprint  
But since Y'all watches look like its movement  
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint  
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent  
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint  
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints  
I stay away from anythin' that look like a nuisance  
But y'all gotta peep this rookie's improvement  
I tip it with you and  
Cause most dudes was doin' verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents  
All I do is try to teach and look to influence  
But it look like the students are playin' hooky, and truin'  
And some say that we lookin' like new gents  
But money talks, and it don't look like Y'all fluent  
And Y'all done seen how this young'n look in the new pints  
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way  
Even though I feel like the same old John J.  
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray  
When I eat, I order the same old entree  
When I ride, I let the same old songs play  
And when I work, I do the same old long days  
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way  
They know where we came, from the name they call me  
I already know what these lames is gonna say  
And I already seen what games they gonna play  
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way  
And when you die, Y'all crackers gonna blame it on strays  
  
[Mary J. Blige]  
Cause love is life, and life is livin'  
Your very special  
[harmonizing]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Me and Fab are very special  
Me and Fab are very special
