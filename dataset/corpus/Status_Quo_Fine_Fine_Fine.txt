I never knew of heartache  
'Til I messed with you  
I sure do sitting here  
And feeling all the pain  
I just can't sleep now  
'Cause I'm hoping that you'll keep  
Another heartache for my heart again  
  
My mama taught me  
How to read from the good book  
My papa taught me  
How to win and lose a game  
They went down smiling  
'cause they left me all they had  
Plus another heartache for my heart again  
  
[Chorus:]  
But now it's fine, fine, fine  
'Cause you're with me all the time  
There to care and share the things I do  
And now it's fine, fine, fine  
'Cause you're with me all the time  
Everywhere and even nowhere too  
  
I use to make the late nights  
On a cheap weekend  
But all the women there were  
Just a crying shame  
I heard them saying  
That they didn't think I'd stop  
For another heartache for my heart again  
  
[Chorus]  
But now it's fine, fine, fine  
'Cause you're with me all the time  
There to care and share the things I do  
And now it's fine, fine, fine  
'Cause you're with me all the time  
Everywhere and even nowhere too
