I don't gamble, I don't fight  
I don't be hangin' in the bars at night  
Yeah I used to be a fighter but  
Now I am a wiser man  
  
I don't drink much, I don't smoke  
I don't be hardly mess around with no dope  
Yeah I used to be a problem but  
Now I am a careful man  
  
[Chorus]  
But if you used to want to see a commotion  
You shoulda seen the man that I used to be  
I was trouble in perpetual motion  
Trouble with a capital "T"  
Stayin' out late, havin' fun  
And shot off every single shot in my gun  
Yeah I used to be a lover but  
Now I'm an older man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But if you used to want to see a commotion  
You shoulda seen the man that I used to be  
I was trouble in perpetual motion  
Trouble with a capital "T"  
Stayin' out late, havin' fun  
And shot off every single shot in my gun  
Yeah I used to be a terror but  
Now I am a tired man  
Yeah I used to be a terror but  
Now I am a tired man
