We go out to a party somewhere  
The moment we walk in the door  
People stop and everybody stares  
She don't know what they're staring for  
  
She don't know she's beautiful  
(never crossed her mind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
(no she's not that kind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
Though time and time I've told her so  
  
There she goes just walking down the street  
And someone lets a whistle out  
A girl like her she just can't see  
What the fuss is all about  
  
And she don't know she's beautiful  
(never crossed her mind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
(no she's not that kind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
Though time and time I've told her so  
  
Mornin' comes and her hairs all a mess  
That's when she thinks she looks her worst  
It's times like this she don't know why  
I can't take my eyes off her  
  
And she don't know she's beautiful  
(never crossed her mind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
(no she's not that kind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
Though time and time I've told her  
  
She don't know she's beautiful  
(never crossed her mind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
(no she's not that kind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
Though time and time I've told her  
  
She don't know she's beautiful  
(never crossed her mind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
(no she's not that kind)  
She don't know she's beautiful  
Though time and time I've told her
