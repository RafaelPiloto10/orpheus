I've got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
  
Long goodbyes, stolen glances  
Can't explain all that's happened in our past  
I'm tired of creating lies to be alone  
I'm living wrong, we're living wrong  
  
More and more you make me  
Afraid to come around  
You take the pleasure out of being in love  
And being down and down and down and down and down  
For the one who's there for me  
All I really want to be is free, yeah  
  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
  
You don't know why, haven't got a clue  
In the dark about why I am leaving you  
You can't expect me to go on this way  
No, I cannot stay, I will not stay  
  
More and more you make me  
Realize what I have home  
What's taboos exciting  
But sometimes it just gets old  
Sometimes it just gets old  
For as long as I am me, boy  
All I really want to be is free  
  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free
