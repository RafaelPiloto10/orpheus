Momma loved us, every one  
Every daughter, every son  
She gave herself so happily  
That's just the way she was, you see  
From dawn to dark she'd find a chore  
And work it 'til it was no more  
And every day until she died  
In the evening, momma cried  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  
Her little girl was snatched away  
She was there and then just gone one day  
And momma blamed herself, I'd say  
But all of us had debts to pay  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  
I did my best to cheer her pride  
That day that something broke inside  
I swore I'd find her and I tried  
In the evening, momma cried  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone
