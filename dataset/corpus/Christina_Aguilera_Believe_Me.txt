Oh, yeah  
Mmm  
Yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh  
Oh yeah  
  
I was alone just because  
I wasn't like them  
They made me excluded, so cruel, and  
Then there was you  
You stood by me, ignored their words  
You became my best friend so true, oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
You believed in me  
When no one else did  
You gave me the strength to  
Move on, my friend  
You will always be  
The one I remember  
To give my thanks to  
For my success  
  
They just did not understand  
What I was going through  
My situation, they didn't care, no  
You tried to take a stand for me  
When I just could not  
Take it any longer  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I, oh, as I look back  
I can see how childish they were  
And you, oh, you showed me that  
We were so much more than they were  
I hope they can see their mistakes now  
And not do it to another  
But if they don't, I hope that person  
Finds someone like you  
  
Oh  
You believed in me  
When no one else did  
Yeah, oh, no, oh, yeah, oh  
  
You will always be  
The one I remember  
Will always be the one I remember, oh, no  
For my success  
For my, for my success, oh  
  
You believed in me  
When no one else did, oh, yeah  
Oh, the strength to move on, yeah  
The one I remember, oh  
With all my heart, yeah
