I know that it would make you cry to find that I have gone didn't even say
goodbye  
You'll hate me for a while because I promised love and left you just regret  
I know that I could never be the kind of man that you have in your mind of me  
Though you said we must part it would break your heart  
But you're young and you'll forget  
  
You're young and I know time will help you find a perfect man to really love
you  
And not a man like me who's like the wind and must be free  
But a man who's worthy of you  
  
For I could never settle down to just one way of life  
One woman and one town so sad to part this way  
You'll be glad someday for you're young and you'll forget  
You're young and I know time
