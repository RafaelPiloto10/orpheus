Ah yeah!  
There's a red house over yonder,  
That's where my baby stays  
Lord, there's a red house over yonder  
Lord, that's where my baby stays  
I ain't been home to see my baby  
In ninety nine and one half days  
  
Wait a minute, something's wrong here  
The key won't unlock this door  
Wait a minute, something's wrong, lord, have mercy  
This key won't unlock this door,  
Something's goin' on here  
I have a bad bad feeling  
That my baby don't live here no more  
  
Well, I might as well go back over yonder,  
Way back up on the hill  
That's something to do  
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder,  
Way back yonder cross the hill  
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more  
I know her sister will  
Yeah.
