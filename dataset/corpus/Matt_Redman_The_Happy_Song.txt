I could sing unending songs of how you saved my soul  
I could dance a thousand miles because of your  
Great love  
My heart is bursting Lord  
To tell of all you've done  
Of how you changed my life and wiped away my past  
I want to shout it out  
From every rooftop sing  
  
For now I know that God is for me not against me  
Everybody's singing now, cause we're so happy  
Everybody's dancing now, cause we're so happy  
If only I could see your face  
See you smiling over us  
And unseen angels celebrate  
The joy is in this place
