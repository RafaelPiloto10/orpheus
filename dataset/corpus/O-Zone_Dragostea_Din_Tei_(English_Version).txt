Hello, Salute, it's me, your Duke  
And I made something that's real  
To show you how I feel  
  
Hello, Hello, it's me Picasso  
I will paint my words of love  
With your name on every wall  
  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Whoa I whoa I aaa  
Whoa I whoa I whoa I aaa  
Every word of love I used to say  
  
Now I paint it everyday  
  
I sold my strings, my songs, and dreams  
And I bought some paints to match the colors of my love  
Hello, Hello, it's me again, Picasso  
I will spray my words of my love  
With your name on every wall  
  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Whoa I whoa I aaa  
Whoa I whoa I whoa I aaa  
Every word of love I used to say  
Now I paint it everyday  
  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Hey, little lover stay  
Or all my colors fade away  
Every word of love I used to say  
Now I paint it everyday
