If you were mine, boy! There would no be no moon or sun, because I'm truly  
In love with you and me and my girls don't know what-to-do oh oh oh  
See it wasn't that cool, we was just chilin at the pool  
And my homegirl said girl, is there any why we can for a twirl  
But things got kinda heavy so we jumped into my new chevy and  
That's when I seen the new boy from the team Hey, man it's me  
Direct contact aint a thing I could do, I'm too shy but you make me wanna  
Cry but that's not what I'm used too, if you were mine, boy! There would be  
No moon or sun, because I'm truly in love with you and me and my girls don't  
Know what-to-do oh oh oh, should I make contact? No, don't do that  
So I'll probably leave until my heart says I can't take no more, never felt  
Like this before. Direct contact ah ah ah no more.
