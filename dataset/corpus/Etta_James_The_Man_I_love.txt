When the mellow moon begins to beam  
Every night I dream a little dream  
And of course Prince Charming is the theme  
The he, for me.  
Although I realize as well as you  
It is seldom that a dream comes true,  
To me it's clear  
That he'll appear.  
  
Some day he'll come along, the man I love  
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love  
And when he comes my way,  
I'll do my best to make him stay.  
  
He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand  
And in a little while, he'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word.  
  
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,  
Maybe Monday, maybe not  
Still I'm sure to meet him one day  
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.  
  
He'll build a little home just meant for two  
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?  
And so, all else above,  
I'm waiting for the man I love.
