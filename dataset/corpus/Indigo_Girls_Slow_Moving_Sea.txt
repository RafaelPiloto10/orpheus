If you ever feel you'll lose your dreams  
Or your hope seems too far gone  
Ill bring the distance to your door  
You couldn't ask for any more  
  
You were around when I needed a friend  
You were the means you were the end  
Youll be the one I'll turn to now  
There's gonna be some hard times coming down  
  
Without you the world would be so crowded  
Without you the moon would be so clouded  
Without you I can be anyone  
Anyone at all but myself  
  
If ever your candle wont blow out  
Or your sorrow seems so interrupted  
Well I'll be the first to bring the darkness down  
Ill be the silence at your side  
  
Without you the music couldn't move me  
The words would ring true  
But the tune would feel so empty  
Without you I can be anyone  
Anyone at all but myself  
But myself  
  
Wish I was a slow moving sea  
Moving away from the land so cautiously  
Id find me an island to surround  
Just like you did as I was feeling down  
As I was feeling down  
  
Without you the world would be so crowded  
Without you the moon would be so clouded  
Without you I can be anyone  
Anyone at all but myself  
Oh but myself  
  
Wish I was a slow moving sea  
Wish I was a slow moving sea  
Love is like a slow moving sea  
Keeping in touch with eternity  
Wish I was a slow, slow, slow, slow moving sea  
Love is like a slow moving sea
