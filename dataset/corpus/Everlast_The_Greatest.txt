Don't throw no roses on my grave, boo  
Death's not a soldier, it's more like an angel  
You got no where to run, no one to pray to  
Jesus and Moses ain't comin' to save you  
(The greatest, the the the greatest)  
  
I float like a butterfly, I sting like a hornet  
They won't let me have it  
Not even if no one else want it  
And if I try to take it  
They want to break me down and strip me naked  
They write a brand new rule and break it  
They lie, they cheat, they steal, they fake it  
  
But I'mma make it, Lord I can take it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Cut the drama boy, save it for your mama  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
I can't sweat it, know I got to get it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Without no doubt, my name will survive  
(The greatest the the greatest man alive)  
(The greatest man)  
(The greatest, the the)  
  
I'mma make it, Lord I can take it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Cut the drama boy, save it for your mama  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
I can't sweat it, I know I got to get it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Without no doubt, my name will survive  
(The, the greatest man alive)  
  
(The greatest, the the greatest man)  
(The the, the greatest man alive)  
(The, the the greatest, the the the greatest man)  
(The greatest man alive)  
  
I'mma make it, I know that I can take it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Cut the drama boy, save it for your mama  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
I can't sweat it, I know I gotta get it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Without no doubt my name will survive  
(The greatest man, the greatest man alive)  
  
It only gets harder  
It always seems so far away  
The sky's getting darker  
Another storm is on the way  
(The the greatest, the the the greatest)  
Another storm is on the way  
(The the the the greatest, the the greatest)  
(The greatest man alive)
