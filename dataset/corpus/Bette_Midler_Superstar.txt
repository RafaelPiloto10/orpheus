Long ago and oh, so far away  
I fell in love with you  
Before the second show  
  
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear  
But you're not really here  
It's just the radio  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?  
Said you'd be coming back this way again maybe?  
Baby, baby, baby, baby oh baby  
I love you, I really do  
  
Loneliness is such a sad affair  
And I can hardly wait  
To sleep with you again  
  
What to say to make you come again  
Come back to me again  
And play your sad guitar  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?  
Said you'd be coming back this way again maybe?  
Baby, baby, baby, baby oh baby  
I love you, I really do
