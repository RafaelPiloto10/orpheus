Verse:  
I'm gonna mix a potion up  
Make a special drink for you  
Mmmm hmmm  
Just a little sip and you're never gonna know what hit you  
Yeh  
When I'm through  
Aww yeh  
  
Pre:  
Now I'm not talkin' bout movies  
Don't need no happy end  
I just wanna make you love me  
And stay through thick and thin  
I'm just gonna use some magic  
Might feel a little drunk  
And if you try to leave me  
I'll lock you in the trunk  
  
Chorus:  
I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you  
My voodoo's so addicting  
3 silver spoons of brandy wine  
Just a frog and a little thyme and  
Baby you'll be mine  
With my voodoo love  
Aw yeh  
With my voodoo love  
Aw yeh  
  
Verse 2:  
Boy I really knew you were the one  
The moment that I saw your eyes  
Mmm hmmm  
Strong and wise and sweet and quiet  
Yeah you're just my type  
Mmm hmmm  
  
Pre 2:  
Now I'm not talkin' bout movies  
Don't need no happy end  
I just wanna make you love me  
And be my shiny prince  
I'm just gonna use some magic  
Might feel a little high  
But we'll be so enchanted  
And you'll feel so alive  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bridge:  
I always get  
Just what I want  
And boy I really want you now  
So just say yes  
Can't second guess the power of my voodoo love  
  
[Chorus: X2]
