Baby, baby I want you  
Baby, and I need you  
I'm still in love with you  
Even though you're not with me  
You never once left my mind  
I guess I'm still in love with you, oh, oh  
You seem so unreal to me  
Why can't I set you free  
Instead I carry you around in my mind  
Late at night I try walkin'  
Never feel much like talkin'  
I'm too busy thinkin' 'bout the good ole' times  
Good ole' times  
  
(Still in love) I remember (with you, baby)  
I'm still in love with you, yeah, didn't you know it  
(Still in love) even a blind man can see it  
(With you, baby) yeah (still in love) I'm in love with you  
Still in love, in love, in love, in love, with you, baby  
Oh, baby, still in love with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you  
Still in love, yeah, with you, baby  
My baby, still in love with you, oh  
Life ain't worth livin,' no reason to give my love  
'Cause I'm still in love with you, yeah  
No matter where you go, no place is too far  
Just call my name and I'll be there, oh, baby  
(Still in love) still in love (with you, baby)  
With you, baby (still in love with you)  
Oh, yeah, yeah (still in love)  
  
This girl is in love with you  
(With you, baby) don't you forget it  
(Still in love with you) remember, remember me  
(Still in love) don't you forget it, no  
(With you, baby) no, no  
I'm the one that is in love with you (still in love)  
In love, in love (with you) in love, in love  
In love, in love, in love, in love, oh  
(Still in love) remember me, boy
