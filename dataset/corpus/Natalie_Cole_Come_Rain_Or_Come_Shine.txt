I'm gonna love you  
Like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain  
And deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things  
But don't ever bet me  
Cause I'm gonna be true  
If you let me  
  
You're gonna love me  
Like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together  
Unhappy together  
And won't it be fine?  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine
