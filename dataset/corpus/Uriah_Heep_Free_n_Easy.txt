Ain't it strange  
That when you're lonely  
And your friends they're not around  
So you make your big decision  
Get your feet back on the ground  
  
When you're down  
And no one wants you  
And you wonder who you are  
When your friends  
They don't desert you  
When you make it you're a star  
  
But I'm gonna stay  
Free and easy  
I know just what I am  
I'm gonna be free and easy  
  
Well, I've been through  
All the heartaches  
And I've been through all the pain  
But when you're up and riding high  
Everybody stakes their claim  
  
I'm gonna be free and easy  
I know just what I am  
I'm gonna be free and easy  
  
I'm gonna be free and easy  
I know just who I am  
I'm gonna be free and easy
