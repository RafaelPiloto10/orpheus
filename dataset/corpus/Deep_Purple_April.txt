April is a cruel time  
Even though the sun may shine  
And world looks in the shade as it slowly comes away  
Still falls the April rain  
And the valley's filled with pain  
And you can't tell me quite why  
As I look up to the gray sky  
Where it should be blue  
Grey sky where I should see you  
Ask why, why it should be so  
I'll cry, say that I don't know  
  
Baby once in a while I'll forget and I'll smile  
But then the feeling comes again of an April without end  
Of an April lonely as a girl  
In the dark of my mind I can see all too fine  
But there is nothing to be done when I just can't feel the sun  
And the springtime's the season of the night  
  
Grey sky where it should be blue  
Grey sky where I should see you  
Ask why, why it should be so  
I'll cry, say that I don't know  
I don't know
