Ah, it's a happy time inside my mind  
When a melody does find a rhyme  
Says to me I'm comin' home to stay  
Oh, Lord, home to stay  
I'm comin' home to stay  
Home to stay  
  
Ah, lord, it's just the same old story  
Something about love for glory  
A nickel and a dime a dozen  
Fame  
Ah, it's such a shame  
Ah, the way they use your name  
Ah, you know it's such a shame  
When it's only mine to sing a song  
Hoping that you'd cross along my way  
Before I have to move along  
Ah, now move along  
Ah, but I'll be back again  
Ooh back again  
  
Ah, it's a happy time inside my mind  
When a melody does find a rhyme  
Says to me I'm comin' home to stay  
Oh, Lord, home to stay  
I'm comin' home to stay  
Home to stay  
  
Sleep late now mama  
Let the mornin' sun warm your bed  
While I'm away  
While I'm away
