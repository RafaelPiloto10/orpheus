The villagers are out tonight  
Uptight and bored  
They're pushing you  
Underground  
On wintry days they stand and gaze  
Outlines in black and ignorant  
villagers  
Dark shadows house a sleepy malice  
In the backbrain  
Of every body you meet  
Man is the village animal  
United by the glue  
  
Of our loathsome qualities  
We are sneaking peeping toms  
In revolt against each other  
The villagers are most insane  
They live to die anonymous  
And muted to  
villagers  
  
In revolt against the other  
But not against the rules  
So in the space age the village idiot rules  
On TV for all to see while some good men  
Walk the streets  
  
The villagers  
You can't get lost you can't get lost  
In the village of space you can't get lost
