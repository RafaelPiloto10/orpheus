Standin' beside of the ocea-ean, lookin' out across the water  
Everything is beautiful, but I still don't feel like I oughta  
Things we wante-ed, not so long ago  
I got 'em all now babe, but I ain't got you no more-ore  
  
Still I remember  
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say  
When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away  
  
I remember everythi-ing, the dresses you used to wear-ear  
You were so light and graceful, you seemed to float right through the air-air  
And me, I looked so funny dancing but you loved me anyhow  
Now I wish I could find somebody to love me like that now  
  
But I remember  
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say  
When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away  
  
Standin' beside of the ocean, lookin' out across the bay  
I should look for companionship but it just gets in my way-ay  
All the lights are flickering, out along the shore  
And I see people dancin' there but I just don't dance no more  
  
Oh I remember  
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say  
When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away  
  
Let me see you dance, let me see you da-a-ance  
Ohhhh baby let me see you da-ance  
I can still see you da-ance, I remember you dancin'  
Ohhhh baby let me see you dance  
Come on let me see you dance  
Let me see you, let me see you, da-ance, da-ance, da-ance
