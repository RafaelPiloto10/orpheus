Looking back over my life  
I can see where I have caused you strife  
But I know, oh yes, I know  
I'd never make that same mistake again  
  
Looking back over my deeds  
I can see signs a wise man heeds  
And if I just had the chance  
I'd never make that same mistake again  
  
Once my cup was overflowing  
But I gave nothing in return  
Now I can't begin to tell you  
What a lesson I have learned  
  
Looking back over the slate  
I can see love turn to hate  
But I know, oh yes, I know  
I'd never make that same mistake again  
  
Once my cup was overflowing  
But I gave nothing in return  
Now I can't begin to tell you  
Oh, what a lesson I have learned  
  
Looking back over the slate  
I can see love turn to hate  
But I know, oh yes, I know  
I'd never make that same mistake again
