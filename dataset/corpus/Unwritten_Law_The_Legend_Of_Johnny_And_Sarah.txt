Johnny  
Was just a kid I knew  
And maybe  
He didn't have a clue  
But he's gone  
You know it's just a shame  
And she's the one to blame  
  
Sarah  
Not just the girl next door  
She's well known  
I don't go there no more  
But johnny  
Johnny found out to late  
And now she's the one to blame  
Yeah he's gone just as quick as he came  
  
Well now something  
Had gotten into him  
He shouldn't have been  
Where the whole town had been  
On Sarah  
She was his only one  
Poor johnny she's everyone's to  
  
And sometimes  
I'll see her round town  
She never grows old  
She still gets around  
And I know  
I know her intent  
And Sarah will ride again  
Oh yeah she's gonna ride till the end
