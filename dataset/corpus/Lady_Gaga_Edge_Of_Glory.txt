There ain't no reason you and me should be alone  
Tonight yeah baby, tonight yeah baby  
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight  
  
I need a man that makes it right when it's so wrong  
Tonight yeah baby, tonight yeah baby  
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong tonight  
  
It's time to feel the rush to push the dangerous  
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you  
Where we'll both fall far in love  
  
I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth  
Out on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment with you  
  
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge,  
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge  
  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you  
I'm on the edge with you  
  
Another shot before we kiss the other side  
Tonight yeah baby, tonight yeah baby  
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight alright, alright  
  
Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames  
Tonight yeah baby, tonight yeah baby  
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight alright, alright  
  
It's time to feel the rush to push the dangerous  
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you  
Where we can both fall far in love  
  
I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth  
Out on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment with you  
  
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge,  
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge  
  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you  
  
I'm on the edge with you  
I'm on the edge with you  
I'm on the edge with you  
  
I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth  
Out on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment with you  
  
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge,  
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge  
  
I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hangin' on a moment with you  
I'm on the edge with you  
I'm on the edge with you  
I'm on the edge with you  
I'm on the edge with you
