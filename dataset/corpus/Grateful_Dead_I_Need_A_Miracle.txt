I need a woman 'bout twice my age  
A lady of nobility, gentility and rage  
Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw  
We'll go right through the book and break each and every law.  
  
I got a feeling and it won't go away, oh no  
Just one thing then I'll be OK  
I need a miracle every day.  
  
I need a woman 'bout twice my height  
Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night.  
Her secret incantations, a candle burning blue  
We'll consult the spirits maybe they'll know what to do.  
  
And it's real and it won't go away, oh no  
I can't get around and I can't run away  
I need a miracle every day.  
  
I need a woman 'bout twice my weight  
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her freight  
Find her in a sideshow leave her in l.a.  
Ride her like a surfer running on a tidal wave.  
  
And it's real, believe what I say, yeah  
Just one thing I got to say  
I need a miracle every day.  
  
It takes dynamite to get me up  
Too much of everything is just enough  
One more thing I just got to say  
I need a miracle every day,  
I need a miracle every day,  
I need a miracle every day, (got to be the only way)  
I need a miracle
