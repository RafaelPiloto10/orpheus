I know you don't love me no more  
No, no more, and I don't  
(Don't) want to be hurt anymore  
Anymore, yeah, yeah  
I've loved so hard, everything I did was no joy, if I can't  
Love you right, baby, I don't have to love you at all  
  
I know you don't want me no more, no more  
No, no more  
And it had to be someone loving you more  
Lovin' you more  
Ain't no use in me cryin' now, all because you have put me down  
If you don't want me no more, baby, ain't no use in me hanging around
