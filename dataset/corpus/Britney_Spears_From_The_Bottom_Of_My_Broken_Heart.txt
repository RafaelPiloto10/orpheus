"Never look back," we said  
How was I to know I'd miss you so?  
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind  
Where do I go?  
  
And you didn't hear  
All my joy through my tears  
All my hopes through my fears  
Did you now, still I miss you somehow  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know  
You were my first love,  
You were my true love  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love, I never knew love  
'Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
"Baby," I said,  
"Please stay. Give our love a chance for one more day"  
We could have worked things out  
Taking time is what love's all about  
  
But you put a dart through my dreams  
Through my heart  
And I'm back where I started again  
Never thought it would end  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know  
You were my first love,  
You were my true love  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love, I never knew love  
'Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
You promised yourself  
But to somebody else  
And you made it so perfectly clear  
Still I wish you were here now  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know  
You were my first love,  
You were my true love,  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love, I never knew love  
'Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
"Never look back," we said,  
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
