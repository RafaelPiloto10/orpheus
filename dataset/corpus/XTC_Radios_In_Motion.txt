There's a message up in China  
That they getting in Japan  
Bouncing off an ocean liner  
Make em shake em in Siam  
All the kids are complaining  
That there's nowhere to go  
All the kids are complaining  
That the songs are too slow  
All I'm saying is you're deaf  
To the fact that there's...  
Radios in motion  
Atmosphere to ocean  
Radios in motion  
Gets you out of your red white and blues  
When we move then so do you'se  
There's a message in Milwaukee  
That they're getting in Moscow  
Everybody walkie talkie  
Everybody learning how  
All the kids are complaining (etc...)
