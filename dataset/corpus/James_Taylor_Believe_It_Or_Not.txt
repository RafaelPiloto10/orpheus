Believe it or not, I've been waiting for you to come through, love of my life.  
Believe it or not, I've been waiting for you to come through, love of my life.  
And though the hour grew later and later, I would hold on for one more
heartbeat.  
While my friends around me were calling, "today, today, today, today."  
  
As strange as it seems, I remember your face from before, believe it or not.  
Before you and I were washed up on this alien shore, as strange as that seems  
Though the hour grew later and later, still I'd hold on for one more
heartbeat.  
While my friends around me were calling, "today, today, today, today."  
  
Today the world seems brighter. Light and bright and right somehow.  
I could not have held on tighter, waiting for the past to come to pass, no.  
  
Once in a dream I've seen myself through your eyes, this you should know.  
Wading the stream that flows in between you and I, once in a dream.  
And though the hour grew later and later, I would hold on for one more
heartbeat.  
While my friends around me were calling, "today, today, today, today."
