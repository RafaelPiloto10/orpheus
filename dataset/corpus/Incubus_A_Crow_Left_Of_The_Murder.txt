Unlearn me  
Ditch what I read  
Behind what I heard  
  
Look. Find. Free.  
Yet! Do You get it yet?  
Do You get it?!  
  
From here on it's instinctual  
Even straight roads meander  
Every piece contains a map of it all!  
It all!  
  
Evidence  
In the march of the ants  
Pulse of the sea  
  
Look. Find. Free.  
Yet! Do You get it yet?  
Do You get it?!  
  
From here on it's instinctual  
Even straight roads meander  
Every piece contains a map of it all!  
It all!  
  
Out of the line (and) indivisible  
A crow left of the murder  
Every piece contains a map of it all!  
It all!  
  
Everything I wanted to know  
Everything I wanted to see  
  
Unlearn Me  
Do You get it yet?  
Look, Find, Free  
Do you get it yet?
