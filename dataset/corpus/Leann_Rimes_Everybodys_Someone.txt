And every day begins the same  
Get up, go out, come back again  
Same old same old  
  
A thousand faces pass you by  
You never look into there eyes  
You feel so ordinary  
They feel so ordinary  
  
Hey everybody's someone  
No matter where you come from  
There's light in every single star  
You're more than who you think you are  
Hey everybody's someone  
And when it's hard to hold on  
Remember you are not alone  
This house is everybody's home  
  
And every day we seem to chase  
The perfect smile the perfect face  
Same old same old  
  
For every one who gets to shine  
A million more are left behind  
They feel so ordinary  
You feel so ordinary  
  
Hey everybody's someone  
No matter where you come from  
There's light in every single star  
You're more than who you think you are  
Hey everybody's someone  
And when it's hard to hold on  
Remember you are not alone  
This house is everybody's home  
  
From a king to a common man  
We're all part of a greater plan  
  
There's light in every single star  
You're more than who you think you are  
  
Hey everybody's someone  
And when it's hard to hold on  
Remember you are not alone  
This house is everybody's home
