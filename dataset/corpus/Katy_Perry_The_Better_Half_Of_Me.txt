I took advantage of you a stepping stone to my pedestal  
When you had enough of it  
I said fine good luck replacing this  
Cause I seem strong and independent self sufficient, confident  
And I'm like mercury rising to the top so selfishly  
  
The better half of me was you  
I'm like a hive without a bee without you  
I gotta find ya gotta, remind ya  
That two is better than one  
  
So please accept my apology cause I'm feeling  
Like a branch without it's tree  
It took me a fall to really see  
That your the catch I wanna keep  
  
'Cause I get weak thinking about you  
Living without you life has no value  
Baby come back to me  
'Cause you're the only missing piece  
  
'Cause the better half of me was you  
I'm like the hive without it's bee without you  
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya  
That two is better than one  
  
Ooh it took a little earthquake  
To appreciate the stability you've given me  
So consistently  
  
The better half of me was you  
I'm like a bird without it's wings without you  
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya  
That two is stronger than one  
  
The better half of me, oh it's you  
I'm like a heart without it's beat without you  
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya  
I promise you that I'm gotta try to  
I'm gonna love ya cause two is better than one
