As I was walking down the street  
Down the street, down the street  
A pretty girl I chanced to meet  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And he knees was a knockin' and her shoes was a rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And her knees was a knockin' and her shoes was a rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon
