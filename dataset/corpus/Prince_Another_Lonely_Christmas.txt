Last night I spent another lonely Christmas  
Darling, darling, you should've been there  
Cause all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
  
Remember the time we swam naked  
In your father's pool?  
Boy he was upset that night  
But boy was that ever cool  
  
Remember the night we played poker for money  
And you robbed me blind  
Remember how you used to scream so loud  
Cause you hated that number nine  
  
Hey, I saw your sister skating on the lake  
This afternoon  
Good Heaven how she's grown  
She swoons the boy skaters she's so tall  
  
But of all your father's children  
All your father's children, baby  
You know, you are the finest of them all  
You are brighter than the northern star  
  
Last night I spent another lonely Christmas  
Darling, darling, you, you should've been there  
You see, of all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
Yeah  
  
My momma used to say  
Always trust your lover  
Now I guess that only applies to her  
  
Cause baby you promised me  
Baby you promised me you'd never leave  
Then you died on the twenty fifth day of December  
Oh baby  
  
Last night I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas  
Darling, baby, you, you should've been there  
Cause all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
Yeah  
  
Your father said it was pneumonia  
Your mother said it was strep  
But the doctor said you were dead  
And I, I say its senseless  
  
Every Christmas night for seven years now  
I drink banana daquaris 'til I'm blind  
As long as I can hear you smilin' baby  
You won't hear my tears  
Another lonely Christmas is mine  
Yeah, mine  
Yeah  
Another lonely Christmas is mine  
  
Last night, yeah, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas  
Darling, darling, you should've been there, yeah  
Cause all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
  
Another lonely...
