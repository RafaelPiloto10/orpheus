Don't make me over  
Now that I can't  
Make it without you  
Don't make me over  
I wouldn't change  
One thing about you  
  
Don't pick on the things  
I say,  
The things I do  
Just love me with all my faults,  
The way that I love you  
I'm begging you  
  
Don't make me over  
Now that I'd do anything for you  
Don't make me over  
Now that you know how I adore you  
  
Just take me inside your arms  
And hold me tight  
And always be by my side,  
If I am wrong or right  
I'm begging you  
  
Don't make me over  
Don't make me over  
Now that you've got me  
At your command  
  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do  
  
Just take me inside your arms  
And hold me tight  
And always be by my side,  
Even if I am wrong or right  
I'm begging you  
  
Don't make me over  
No, don't make me over  
Now that  
You've got me at your command  
  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do  
Accept me for what I am babe  
Accept me for the things I do  
  
Don't make me over  
Don't make me over  
Accept me for what I am  
Accept me for the things I do
