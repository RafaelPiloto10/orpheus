Here we come, walkin'  
Down the street.  
We get the funniest looks from  
Everyone we meet.  
  
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees  
And people say we monkey around.  
But we're too busy singing  
To put anybody down.  
  
We go wherever we want to,  
Do what we like to do  
We don't have time to get restless,  
There's always something new.  
  
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees  
And people say we monkey around.  
But we're too busy singing  
To put anybody down.  
  
We're just tryin' to be friendly,  
Come and watch us sing and play,  
We're the young generation,  
And we've got something to say.  
Any time, Or anywhere,  
Just look over your shoulder  
Guess who'll be standing there  
  
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees  
And people say we monkey around.  
But we're too busy singing  
To put anybody down.  
  
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees  
And people say we monkey around.  
But we're too busy singing  
To put anybody down.  
We're just tryin' to be friendly,  
Come and watch us sing and play,  
We're the young generation,  
And we've got something to say.  
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees  
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees  
  
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,  
You never know where we'll be found.  
So you'd better get ready,  
We may be comin' to your town.
