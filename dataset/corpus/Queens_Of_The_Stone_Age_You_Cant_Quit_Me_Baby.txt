It's a mistake, but who knows  
Followed you home, crawled in your window  
This life is a trip when you're psycho in love  
And I know  
  
Followed your friends, you were not there  
Slashed and I cut, I bled in the sink  
Heard what you said and you're laughing maybe  
Slashed and I cut, and I do it for you  
I want you to notice when I'm not around  
Wherever you are  
  
You're solid gold  
I'll see you in hell  
You're solid gold  
I'll see you in hell  
You're solid gold  
I'll see you in hell  
You're solid gold  
I'll see you in hell
