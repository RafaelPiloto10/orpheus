His wisdom flowed from Heaven's Book  
Just like threaded pearls  
Just like threaded pearls  
He left his self to flee to God  
And God sent him back to us  
  
He was born to be the beloved  
A will of the Divine  
He was born to be the beloved  
He was born to guide  
  
He prayed all his nights alone  
And stars and angels sighed  
And in the day, he lead the way  
With blazing words so bright  
  
He was born to be the beloved  
A will of the Divine  
He was born to be the beloved  
He was born to be kind  
  
He taught the people to worship  
Bowing to one God, bowing to one God  
His mercy stretched from east to west  
To every man, woman and child  
  
He was born to be the beloved  
A will of the Divine  
He was born to be the beloved  
Nature sublime  
  
He opened up the doors of love  
For every heart parched with thirst  
He was a mercy to the words  
And unto the human births  
  
He was born to be the beloved  
A will of the Divine  
He was born to be the beloved  
He was born to guide
