Words by Marilyn and Alan Bergman, Music by Michel Legrand  
From the 1971 film, "Summer Of '42" starring Jennifer O'Neill  
Legrand won an Oscar for his score.  
  
The summer smiles, the summer knows  
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes  
The summer smoothes the restless sky  
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie  
The summer knows, the summer's wise  
She sees the doubts within your eyes  
And so she takes her summer time  
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger  
Twists the world 'round her summer finger  
Lets you see the wonder of her arms  
And if you've learned your lessons well  
There's little more for her to tell  
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall  
  
And if you've learned your lesson well  
There's little more for her to tell  
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall
