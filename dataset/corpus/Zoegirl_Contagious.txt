I got a new way of thinking  
I finally figured it out  
It's coming from a different perspective  
I wanna tell you what it's about  
And I'm all right now (all right now)  
Cause it's You I've found  
Yeah, Your love's contagious and I've caught it  
Can't wipe this smile off my face, it's something I can't explain  
Yeah, Your joy's outrageous and I got it  
I'm leaving worries behind, it's something I can't describe  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
I got a new motivation  
I never knew how good it could be  
It's better than a standing ovation  
And nothings gonna take it from me  
And I'll be fine (I'll be fine)  
Cause You're by my side  
Yeah, Your love's contagious and I've caught it  
Can't wipe this smile off my face, it's something I can't explain  
Yeah, Your joy's outrageous and I got it  
I'm leaving worries behind, it's something I can't describe  
It's contagious  
It's outrageous  
You can put it in your pocket for another day  
You can hide it in a box or keep it locked away  
But when it's in your heart you'll find  
You don't have to wonder why  
You won't need a vision  
You won't need a sign  
It's something I can't define  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Yeah, Your love's contagious and I've caught it  
Can't wipe this smile off my face, it's something I can't explain  
Yeah, Your joy's outrageous and I got it  
I'm leaving worries behind, it's something I can't describe  
Yeah, Your love's contagious and I've caught it  
Can't wipe this smile off my face, it's something I can't explain  
Yeah, Your joy's outrageous and I got it  
I'm leaving worries behind, it's something I can't describe  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
