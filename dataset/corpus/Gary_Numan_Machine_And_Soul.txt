She likes film  
Pictures too  
A friend of mine  
Something new  
  
She likes girls  
Lives my dreams  
Eats my face  
She says 'Time to make me scream'  
  
No crying  
She don't like tears  
My one chance  
Is corruption  
  
(So get up  
So get up and dance)  
  
She likes pain  
'E please Bob'  
Some heroes  
But she don't like God  
  
She likes rock  
MTV  
Sex machines  
She says 'Time to make me bleed'  
  
No romance  
No surprise  
My one chance  
Is perversion  
  
So this is  
My secret  
So this is  
A new way to hide  
  
So this is  
My nightmare  
And you're my  
Solution  
  
No memories  
Nostalgia  
My one chance  
Is slow motion  
  
So this is  
The big lie  
So this is  
My reason to leave  
  
So this is  
My future  
And you're my  
Corruption  
  
She likes speed  
Low fast cars  
Love and hate  
Rock and roll stars  
  
She likes cream  
Long goodbyes  
Someone to watch  
And she says 'Time to make me cry'  
  
I'm nervous  
She scares me  
My one chance  
Is emotion  
  
So this is  
Religion  
So this is  
Something to believe  
  
So this is  
God's disease  
So this is  
A new kind of cure  
  
So this is  
A new world  
And you're my  
Machine and soul
