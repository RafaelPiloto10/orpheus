I dreamed a dream in times gone by  
When hope was high and life worth living  
I dreamed that love would never die  
I dreamed that God would be forgiving  
  
Then I was young and unafraid  
And dreams were made and used and wasted  
There was no ransom to be paid  
No song unsung no wine untasted  
  
But the tigers come at night  
With their voices soft as thunder  
As they tear your hope apart  
As they turn your dream to shame  
  
And still I dreamed she'll come to me  
That we would live the years together  
But there are dreams that cannot be  
And there are storms we cannot weather  
  
I had a dream my life would be  
So diff'rent from this hell I'm living  
So diff'rent now from what it seemed  
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed
