Just keep the motor runnin' this won't take very long  
By the time the police get here we'll be already gone  
We've got to leave 'em hangin' we can't leave 'em no clues  
Just take the money and run  
Lord I love robbin' banks Lord I love robbin' banks  
I always tell the teller thanks Lord I love robbin' banks  
  
I like to holler stick up when I walk through the door  
It lets 'em know their safe just isn't safe anymore  
I like to see their faces when I show them my gun then take the money and run  
Lord I love robbin' banks...  
[ guitar ]  
Five'll get you ten she'll push the burglar system  
Ten'll get you twenty years on some prison farm  
The first thing that I do is make 'em lay on the floor then take the money and
run  
Lord I love robbin' banks...  
Lord I love robbin' banks...
