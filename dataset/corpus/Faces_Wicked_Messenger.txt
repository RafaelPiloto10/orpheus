There was a wicked messenger  
From Eli he did come  
With a mind that multiplied  
The smallest matter  
When questioned who had sent for him  
He answered with a thumb  
For his tongue it could not speak  
But only flatter  
He stayed behind the assembly hall  
It was there that he made his bed  
Often times he could be seen returning  
Until one day he just appeared  
With a note in his hand which read
