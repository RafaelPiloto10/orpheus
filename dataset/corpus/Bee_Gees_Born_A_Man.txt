When I was just a little boy, when I didn't know  
My daddy put me n his knee and showed me the way to go  
He said "a woman will do her best to make a fool out of you  
So be a man and stand the test and see what you can do"  
  
I'm glad I am born a man  
I'm glad I am born a man  
  
If you got what it takes my boy  
You can always choose  
Work it out before it's too late my boy  
Make sure you never lose  
  
I'm glad I am born a man  
I'm glad I am born a man  
  
Born a man  
  
Every woman wants her man to live and learn on her land  
Where I go, baby you go  
Arrangement, man and wife  
  
I'm glad I am born a man  
I'm glad I am born a man  
  
Born a man
