[Intro: cool Keith]  
Yeah... yo Don, gimme a little bit of that chicken  
That smooth chicken, a little bit of that gravy  
And I want some... old hot jazz biscuits  
With a little bit of that blues butter  
Bring in the snare  
  
[Verse One: cool Keith]  
They never understood, many people were so slow  
My funky type of rhyme, and my style is pyscho  
Complex wrecks wrecks, my style go X X  
I move around off beat, creatin more styles  
Showin white boys, other kids my black styles  
I kick lyrics like shoes right in your face  
Walk up on a carJack of Spades, pluck the ace  
I get slow-er, down in, on in  
Flowin like I used to be on Critical Beatdown  
I drop styles on ears the public bite em  
Not many went to school, so the dummies wouldn't write em  
They say yo Keith, yo cool, you usin big words  
I went to college, I'm even more stupid herb  
Back on the scene to put a lesson out  
Even if I have to pull a black Smith and Wesson out  
I grab a hammer stick a nail in that little crack  
Tame the monkey show the hummingbird how to act  
I get atomic, hypo-galactical  
Word to mom I'm in my own world  
Galaxy raised! Powerful  
  
[Chorus:]  
Raise it up (8X)  
Verse Two: Ced G  
Yo, yo money grip money grip, now this ain't no ego trip  
Yo money grip money grip, now this ain't no ego trip  
Now back in the days and we used to use elevation  
And then the people said
