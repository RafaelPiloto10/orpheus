How deep is your love  
How deep is your love  
I really need to learn  
''cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down  
When they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me  
Do, do, do, do  
How deep is your love  
  
I know your eyes in the morning sun  
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain  
And the moment that you wander far from me  
I wanna feel you in my arms again  
  
And you come to me on a summer breeze  
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave  
And it's me you need to show  
  
Chorus:  
How deep is your love  
How deep is your love  
I really need to learn  
''cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down  
When they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me  
  
I believe in you  
You know the door to my very soul  
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour  
You're my saviour when I fall  
And you may not think  
I care for you  
When you know down inside  
That I really do  
And it's me you need to show  
  
Chorus  
Repeat and fade
