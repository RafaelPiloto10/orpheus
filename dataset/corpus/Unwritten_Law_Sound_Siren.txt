Sail with me across the sea  
So we could see what's goin' on  
Along the way, red stack the bong  
  
We'll make it tight alright  
We'll write the one that makes her cum  
That one that makes it so she can't sleep tonight  
  
So bombs away  
And as they say  
Here's to oblivion  
  
And cheers to you  
As well it's through  
Sound siren  
  
[Chorus]  
She's still cryin'  
It's over  
It's over  
Sound siren  
It's over  
It's over  
  
We'll have some fun  
Play with a loaded gun  
Try not and shoot and kill no one  
'cause I would feel like shit  
  
But in the same regard  
It's getting hard to deal with it  
And I'm sick of it  
And no place is too far  
  
So bombs away  
And as they say  
Here's to oblivion  
  
And cheers to you  
As well it's through  
Sound siren  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
So bombs away  
And as they say  
Well it's over now  
It's over now  
She's gone, yeah  
And he won't go away  
  
So sound siren  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(S-s-s-sound siren)  
(S-s-s-sound siren)  
(S-s-s-sound siren)  
(S-s-s-sound siren)  
  
[Chorus: x2]
