She works in the bank and she works in the store  
And she don't go for that old stuff anymore  
Likes to get high and listen to the band  
She likes to make love to her kind of man  
These outlaw women, first of their kind  
Outlaw women they got here right on time  
Outlaw women don't need any guns  
Outlaw women just out for fun  
  
In many ways she's a lot like me  
She don't give a damn 'bout society  
Might be little rich girl, or she might be poor  
She Might be a married woman that needs a little more  
Shes a outlaw woman, first of her kind  
These outlaw women ridin' high in seventy-nine  
Outlaw women don't need any guns  
These outlaw women were just out for fun  
  
Some call her a lady some call her other names  
But you wont ever call her that around me and my gang
