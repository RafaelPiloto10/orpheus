On certain nights  
When the angles are right  
And the moon is a slender crescent  
  
It's circle shows  
In a ghostly glow  
Of earthly luminescence  
  
Earthshine  
A beacon in the night  
I can raise my eyes to  
Earthshine  
Earthshine  
A jewel out of reach  
Form a dream to rise to  
Earthshine  
  
Floating high  
In the evening sky  
I see my faint reflection  
  
Pale facsimile  
Like what others see  
When they look in my direction  
  
Earthshine  
Stretching out your hand  
Full of starlit diamonds  
Earthshine  
  
Reflected light  
To another's sight  
And the moon tells a lover's story  
  
My borrowed face  
And my third-hand grace  
Only reflect your glory  
  
You're still out of reach  
Form a dream to rise to  
Earthshine
