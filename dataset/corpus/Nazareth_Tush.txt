I've been up, I've been down  
Take my word, I've been 'round  
I ain't asking for much, uh-huh  
I said Lord take me downtown  
I'm just looking for some tush  
  
I've been bad, I've been good  
Dallas Texas, Hollywood  
I ain't asking for much, mmm  
I said Lord take me downtown  
I'm just looking for some touch  
  
Take me back, way back home  
Not by myself, not alone  
I ain't askin' for much, mmm  
I said Lord take me downtown  
I'm just looking for some touch
