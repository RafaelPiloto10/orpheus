[Verse 1: Chris Brown]  
If you leave this time I fear that you'll be gone for good  
So I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left  
Said her father left her young and  
He said he'll be back with that same  
Tone that you just said you'll stay forever with  
  
[Chorus: Chris Brown]  
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling  
I feel like you're the only reason for it  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
It seems that you're the only reason for it  
  
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]  
I've been bleeding in your silence  
I feel safer in your violence  
I hold on like leaves in Fall to what is left  
Before I sleep I talk to God  
He must be mad with me, it's coming  
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with  
  
[Chorus: Chris Brown]  
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling  
I feel like you're the only reason for it  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
It seems that you're the only reason for it  
  
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]  
So the iceberg never broke  
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it  
And I poke (and I poke) and I poked at it  
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more (some more)  
And in my notepad, man I wrote (man I wrote)  
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it  
If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last  
I'mma hope (I'mma hope) so iceberg don't float (don't float)  
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit  
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies or my granny still standing  
With a note (with a note) that read ''granted, don't you panic''  
When you make mistakes the most (the most)  
One day it'll make you grow (you grow)  
When you outlandish and you lose manners  
To God you shall consult (consult)  
When the bright cameras are still cramming  
In your face and it provoke (provoke)  
You to act mannish, just stay planted  
Cause you reaping what you sowed  
Keep positivity in your heart and (and)  
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (and)  
When you get mad and when you poke at it  
When you poke it at just know, man  
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision  
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck you would do to a critic, my
nigga?  
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em lord?  
(Do you hear 'em lord? Do you hear 'em?)  
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?  
And they won't let me live even when remorse that I give  
When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive  
When they never see good in me  
Even though I got hood in me  
Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord  
  
[Chorus: Chris Brown]  
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling  
I feel like you're the only reason for it  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
It seems that you're the only reason for it
