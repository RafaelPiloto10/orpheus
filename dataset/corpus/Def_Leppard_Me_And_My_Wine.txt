Well I'm down in the alley of Sally and I'm feeling my way  
And it's four in the morning, I don't have a lot I can say  
I know I'm looking for some satisfaction  
But there ain't much news  
Got some walking from a back reaction  
I'm hanging down and loose  
  
Me and the boys have been drinking  
Feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking  
All I can say is I'm doing fine with just me and my wine  
  
Now my brain and my body are runnin' on different rails  
And I died and just say hi what if all else fails  
Oh I woke up in a subway station  
Lying half dead on the floor  
I don't remember anything  
What happened the night before  
  
Oh me and the boys have been drinking  
Feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking  
All I can say is I'm doing fine with just me and my wine  
  
Now listen  
My hair's a real mess, I feel and look like a joke  
And there's a hole in my jeans, I just ran right out of smokes  
You know I'd like to get to know you  
But I ain't got the time  
I'm finding it harder and harder  
To make this damn thing rhyme  
  
Just me and my wine  
Well just me and my wine  
You know that I'm doing fine  
Well just me and my wine  
Thank you
