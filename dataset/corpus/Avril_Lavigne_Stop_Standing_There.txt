All this talking to you  
I don't know what I'm to do  
I don't know where you stand  
What's inside of your head  
  
All this thinkin' of you  
Is that what you're doin' too  
You're always on my mind  
I talk about you all of the time  
  
Don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I can't wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
So open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
You're just standing by  
You're just wasting time  
Why don't you just tell me the truth about me and you  
And as the time goes by  
I hope you realize  
If you ask me to  
I just might be with you  
  
So don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I can't wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
Open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
Stop standing there, standing there  
And stop acting like you don't care  
And stop being scared, being scared  
Stop acting like you don't care  
  
So, don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I can't wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
Open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
So, don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I cannot wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
Open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
Who I am,  
Who I am,  
Who I am
