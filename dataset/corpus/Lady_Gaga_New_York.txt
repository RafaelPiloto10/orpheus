New new, new new, New York,  
New new, new new, New York,  
New new, new new, New York,  
Sittin' here in my hotel room, I'm livin' the dream and look at you (HAH! )  
  
This, be, the city of dreams.  
This, is, more than I can handle,  
(But hey, I'm a city girl right?)  
I can't sleep,  
Must I,  
Dance all nightt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just woke up, I gotta recording,  
Stayed up all night  
Those clubs dun bore me,  
Irresistable, all the men at my door go  
Ring ring, ring ring ring(ding dong)  
Ring ring, ring ring ring(ding dong)  
  
Hey, just wanted your money,  
You got my drink,  
Have a pleasant morning,  
One night stand,  
Please don't come and lure me,  
A girl like me? you must be shittin',  
Get off my steps before  
I give you a beating  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm livin' the dream,  
Livin' the dream,  
Livin' the, livin' the, livin' the dream.  
Ooooooooo.  
Oooooooo.  
Oooooooo.  
  
I'm living the dream  
  
[Chrous]  
  
Livin' the dream  
Livin' the, livin' the, livin' the dream.  
  
Oh shit, I lost my phone, can't see straight I'm on patron.
