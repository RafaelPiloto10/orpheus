Revenge is sweet for thouse who wait  
Never early always late  
Waiting now to consummate  
A marriage made in hell  
Hand in hand, walk alone  
As good advice seems to drone  
Evil cuts right to the bone  
  
Has it come, awakens me  
Is it done and will it ever die  
Will it go. taking me  
Don't you know  
Evil never dies  
  
Keep me close to your heart  
Adversity will come apart  
And finish just before you start  
Never question why  
Today was then, remenber when  
Skipping numbers one through ten  
Permanence through the pen  
  
Read the rights a prophete's word  
I've learned to deal with the absurd  
And reach a darkened  
Pinnacle of light  
  
Money hungry, power thirsty  
Penny piching, fear inflicting  
Double crossing, back stabbing  
Promising eternity for a price  
Suckin', brain washing  
Mind raping, soul stealing  
Constant preaching, salvation reaching  
Lowest form of human, fucking life  
Evil never dies  
  
Laughter stands accusing me  
Emotion stands abusing me  
The battered and the bruising me  
Is there darkness when you die  
I heard a sound no one there  
I heard a shot no one cares  
Laughter turns into despair  
  
Evil hidden everywhere  
Evil has a chilling stare  
Null and void of any care  
Is where the answer lies  
It does no good to beg or cry  
It does no good to question why  
It does no good it never dies  
Evil never dies
