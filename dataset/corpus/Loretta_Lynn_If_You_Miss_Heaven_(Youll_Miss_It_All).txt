If you're tired of sinnin' take your Saviour's hand  
There's a mansion worth winnin' in the great Promised Land  
Many doubters are grinnin' don't you slip and fall  
If you miss heaven you'll miss it all  
If you miss heaven you'll miss it all  
For me to reach heaven I'd gladly crawl  
The smallest and weakest who love him are tall  
If you miss heaven you'll miss it all  
[ steel ]  
Our loving Saviour gave us a second birth  
And his salvation frees us from the sorrows of earth  
Forever with Jesus makes life seem so small  
If you miss heaven you'll miss it all  
If you miss heaven you'll miss it all...
