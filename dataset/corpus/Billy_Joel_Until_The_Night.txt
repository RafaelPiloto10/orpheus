I never ask you where you go  
After I leave you in the morning  
We go our different ways to separate situations  
It's not that easy anymore  
Today I do what must be done  
I give my time to total strangers  
But now it feels as though the day goes on forever  
MOre than it ever did before  
CHORUS  
Until the night, until the night  
I just might make it  
Until the night, until the night  
When I see you again  
Now you're afraid that we have changed  
And I'm afraid we're getting older  
So many broken hearts, so many lonely faces  
So many lovers come and gone  
I'll have my fears like every man  
You'll have your tears like every woman  
Today we'll be unsure, is this what we believe in  
And wonder how can we go on  
CHORUS  
When the sun goes down  
And the day is over  
When the last of the light has gone  
As they pour into the street  
I will be getting closer  
As the cars turn their headlights on  
While they're closing it down  
We're gonna open it up  
And while they're going to sleep  
We'll just be starting to touch  
I'm just beginning to feel  
I'm just beginning to give  
I'm just beginning to feel  
I'm just beginning to live  
Before I leave you again  
Before the light of the dawn  
Before this evening can end  
I have been waiting so long  
CHORUS
