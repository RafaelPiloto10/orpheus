I had no idea how much I need her  
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her  
My heart starts palpitating  
When I think my guess was wrong  
But I think I'll get alone  
She's just a girl  
She's a bomb  
  
Athena  
All I ever want to do is please her  
My life has been so settled  
And she's the reason  
Just one word from her  
And my troubles are long gone  
But I think I'll get along  
She's just a girl  
She's a bomb  
She's a bomb  
Just a girl, just a girl  
Just a girl, just a girl  
Just a girl, just a girl  
She's just a girl  
  
Athena  
My heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath  
I felt like one of those flattened ants  
You find on a crazy path  
I'd have stopped myself to give her time  
She didn't need to ask  
Was I a suicidal psychopath  
She's just a girl  
She's a bomb  
She's just a girl  
She's a bomb  
Consumed  
There was a beautiful white horse  
I saw on a dream stage  
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe  
Livin' in his rib cage  
  
I felt like a pickled priest  
Who was being flambed  
You've got me requisitioned blondie  
She's just a girl  
She's a bomb  
I'm happy  
She's a bomb  
I'm ecstatic  
Just a girl, just a girl  
Just a girl, just a girl  
Just a girl, just a girl  
Just a girl  
  
Look into the face of a child  
Measure how long you smiled  
Before the mem'ry claimed  
How long would children remain  
How long could children remain  
  
Athena  
You picked me up by my lapels  
And screamed "leave her"  
I felt like waking up in heaven  
On an empty meter  
And now you're stuck  
With a castrated leader  
And I hate the creep  
I didn't mean that  
She's a bomb  
I just said it  
She's a bomb  
Please She's a bomb  
  
Athena  
I had no idea how much I need her  
My life has been so settled  
And she's the reason  
Just one word from her  
And my troubles are long gone  
Ooh but I get along  
She's just a girl  
She's a bomb  
She's just a girl  
She's a bomb
