I'm an autumn girl, flying over london  
With the trees on fire it looks like home  
I'm an autumn girl on the endless search for summer  
Cause I need some love to cook my frozen bones  
You needed something to get your teeth into  
And in my voodoo kitchen you said  
"I've got something to show you,  
It's a recipe handed down from father to son  
For a thousand years, and it goes with those hot salt tears."  
I'm an autumn girl, crying over london  
With a heart on fire but no-one home  
I'm an autumn girl on the endless search for summer  
Cause I need some love to heat my frozen bones  
Get me on the boil and reduce me  
To a simmering wreck with a slow kiss  
To the back of my neck  
Carve up my heart on a very low flame  
Separate my feelings then pour them down the drain  
Close my eyes and sweeten me with lies  
Pierce my skin with a few well chosen words  
Now you can stuff me with whatever you've got handy  
And on a cold grey day a cold grey man will do  
I'm an autumn girl, flying over london  
With the trees on fire it looks like home  
I'm an autumn girl on the endless search for summer  
Cause I need some love to heat my frozen bones  
So give me something to whet my appetite  
And chill my soul with a sudden lack of interest  
Oh, but the winter freezes on and the candle's burned low  
Fill me with the hot stuff then say you've got to go  
Take my mind, marinade it in red wine  
Grate my thighs with your chinny chin chin  
And I will let you in  
Oh on a long dark night a long dark man might ...
