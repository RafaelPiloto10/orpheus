I ask myself should I put my finger to the left, no  
I ask myself should I put my finger to the right, no  
I say it really doesn't matter where I put my finger  
Someone else will come along and move it  
And it's always been the same  
It's just a complicated game  
  
A little girl asked me should she part her hair upon the left, no  
A little girl asked me should she part her hair upon the right, no  
I said it doesn't really matter where you part your hair  
Someone else will come along and move it and it's  
Always been the same  
It's just a complicated game  
  
A little boy asked me should he put his vote upon the left, no  
A little boy asked me should he put his vote upon the right, no  
I say it really doesn't matter where you put your vote  
Someone else will come along and move it  
And it's always been the same  
It's just a complicated game  
  
They wanted Tom  
They wanted Joe  
To dress 'em up and stick 'em out on show  
They were arrows in a very bad aim  
It's just a complicated game  
  
God asked me should he ought to put his world on the left, no  
God asked me should he ought to put his world on the right, no  
I said God, it really doesn't matter where you put your world  
Someone will come along and move it  
And it's always been the same  
It's just a complicated game
