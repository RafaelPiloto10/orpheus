I'm just a man and I am what I am  
Nobody will ever change my ways  
I don't need money and I don't need no lies  
I only need to live for today  
But I'd like to talk things over with you  
I want to hear the things you say, today  
Although you won't change my anyway, no no way  
  
I wish you'd come and see me, I'd like to hold you  
I want to set my mind all free  
You understand me woman, you give me time  
But I don't need no sympathy  
Still I wonder what it's like to be loved  
Instead of hiding in myself  
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way  
  
Nobody's gonna change my world  
That's something too unreal  
Nobody will change the way I feel  
  
So listen to me now, hear what I say  
Please give me time and maybe love  
If there's a God up there, well I hope he helps me  
I need him now to set me free  
'Cause it may be that it's over for me  
If you don't hear the things that I say, today  
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way  
  
Nobody's gonna change my world, that's something too unreal  
Nobody will change the way I feel
