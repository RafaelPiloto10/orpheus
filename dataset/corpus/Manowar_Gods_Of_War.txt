Father obented me  
I ask thee  
Raise thy hand  
We! the sons of Odin!  
Await thy command  
Born!  
Under the sign  
Of the hammer we stand  
And here we all may die!  
Our blood on the ground  
The battle horns sound!  
Let thy Valkyries fly!!  
[Chorus:]  
Down from the sky into the fight  
Clutched full of rage!!  
Full of thunder  
And glory  
Swords in the wind  
Crossing the sky  
Lords of doom bring an end to their story  
Today is the day we Die in the fight  
None shall remain..  
Till last one for night  
Now Valhalla's calling us immortal  
We are gods immortal!  
We are Gods Of War!!  
Odin  
Hear the fallen wait  
To join thee  
By thy side  
Let Valhalla's gates  
Open wide.....  
Born! under the sign of the hammer  
They lived  
And here they fought and died!  
There blood on the ground..  
The battle horns sound!!  
Let thy Valkyries fly!!!  
[Chorus:]  
Down from the sky into the fight  
Clutched full of rage!!  
Full of thunder  
And glory  
Swords in the wind  
Crossing the sky  
Lords of doom bring an end to their story  
Today is the day we Die in the fight  
None shall remain..  
Till last one for night  
Now Valhalla's calling us immortal  
We are gods immortal!  
We are Gods Of War!!  
[Chorus]  
Woooooa!  
Wooooooa!  
Woooooooa!  
Wooooooooa!  
Woooooooooa!  
Woaaaa!  
Wooooa!!!!
