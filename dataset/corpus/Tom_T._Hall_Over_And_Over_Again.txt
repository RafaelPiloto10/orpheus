Over and over say you forgive me for the crazy fool I've been  
Over and over I'll be sorry over and over again  
Would I be untrue to you dear no no never again  
That's one lesson I'll remember over and over again  
Back together now and forever ever more will I be true  
Over and over I'm gonna prove it over and over to you  
[ guitar ]  
Over and over say you forgive me I'll be faithful to the end  
I will prove I can be trusted over and over again  
Would I be untrue to you dear no no never again...  
Over and over over and over over and over over and over  
Over and over over and over over and over over and over
