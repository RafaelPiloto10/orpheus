Dying is easy  
It's what I'm living for  
I heard a beggar  
As he wept on my floor  
These days I just can't find my ground  
No one seems to see me as I'm walking around  
Cause in these times there's no surprise  
I don't need to fantasise  
It's all here in my mind  
Some days I'm fine  
Nothing on my mind  
Some days are ok  
Only when I'm high  
Love, life, happiness  
Nothing more nothing else  
Love, life, happiness  
Nothing more no regrets  
Love, life, happiness  
Nothing more nothing else  
Love, life, happiness  
Nothing more no regrets  
These are my times  
These are my lives  
Cause dying is easy  
It's what I'm living for  
I heard a beggar as he wept on my floor  
Time, these are my times  
These are my lives  
These are my times  
In these eyes there's one surprise  
We don't need to fantasise  
It's all here in our minds  
Some days I'm fine  
Nothing on my mind  
Some days are ok  
But I don't think that's right  
Some days are ok  
But only when I'm high  
Some days are ok  
But only when I'm high  
Only when I'm high  
These are my times (repeat)  
Oh come on! (repeat)  
These are my times (repeat)  
Tick tock goes another one, yeah  
Tick tock goes another one  
Tick tock there's another one  
Another soul gone  
Tick tock there's another one gone  
Another soul gone
