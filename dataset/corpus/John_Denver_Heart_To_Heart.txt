I haven't seen all there is to see  
But I've seen quite a bit  
Some things I'll always remember  
Some things I wish that I could forget  
I haven't quite been around the world  
But I've been around the block  
I know that distances are meaningless  
Like the hands that move around a clock  
And I know that love is everywhere  
Always safe, always true  
And exactly where it comes from  
Is where it's going to  
  
Your heart to mine  
My heart to yours  
Talk about opening windows  
Talk about opening doors  
My heart to yours  
Your heart to mine  
Love is a light that shines  
From heart to heart  
  
Here I am sitting in old Hong Kong  
The harbor and the lights  
They're like diamonds in the heavens  
Enough to brighten the darkest of nights  
There's another side to sorrow  
As there is to everything  
Like the other side of lonely  
Is falling in love again  
And then you know that there's an answer  
To the suffering we see  
And though it isn't easy  
It's still as simple as you and me  
And you'll know that love is everywhere  
Always safe, always true  
And exactly where it comes from  
Is where it's going to  
  
Your heart to mine  
My heart to yours  
Talk about opening windows  
Talk about opening doors  
My heart to yours  
Your heart to mine  
Love is a light that shines  
From heart to heart  
  
Your heart to mine  
My heart to yours  
Talk about opening windows  
Talk about opening doors  
My heart to yours  
Your heart to mine  
Love is a light that shines  
From heart to heart
