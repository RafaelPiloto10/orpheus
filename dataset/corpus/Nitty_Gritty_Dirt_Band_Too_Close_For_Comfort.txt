Hey  
Well she was down on the corner  
She looked so tough  
Can't get any closer  
With her dressed up  
Somewhere her boyfriend's hangin around  
Too close for comfort  
And I can't stop now  
Well she's got the freeze on  
I put the heat on  
Now the two are dating  
I'm too close for comfort  
And I can't stop now  
Too close for comfort  
And I can't stop now  
No, I can't stop  
I maybe wrong  
I make it right  
Deep in the dark  
But not in the light  
I maybe young  
But not for long  
Cause I gambled like a fool  
Well the odds are low  
And my hopes are high  
Down on the bottle  
With eyes shut tight  
Won't let resistance  
Bring me down  
Too close for comfort  
And I can't stop now  
Too close for comfort  
And I can't stop  
Whoa no  
Oh I know how to play it cool  
I was down on the corner  
With a rovin' eye  
Teasin' a teaser  
By her stop sign  
It may turn to bad  
Lotsa luck for now  
Too close for comfort  
But I can't stop now  
Too close for comfort  
I'm too close for comfort  
Too, too close for comfort  
I'm too close for comfort  
And I can't stop  
Can't stop now  
Na na  
Well not now  
Can't stop  
I can't stop  
Stop  
Stop  
Stop  
Stop  
Hey  
Whoa oh  
Whoa oh  
Whoa oh  
Whoa oh  
Whoa oh  
Whoa oh
