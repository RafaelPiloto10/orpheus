Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June  
We stood beneath an amber moon  
And softly murmured "Someday soon"  
We kissed and clung together  
  
Then, tomorrow was another day  
The morning found me miles away  
With still a million things to say  
Now, when twilight dims the sky above  
Recalling thrills of our love  
There's one thing I'm certain of  
Return I will to old Brazil  
  
Then, tomorrow was another day  
The morning found me miles away  
With still a million things to say  
Now, when twilight dims the sky above  
Recalling thrills of our love  
There's one thing that I'm certain of  
Return I will to old Brazil  
That old Brazil  
Man, it's old in Brazil  
Brazil, Brazil
