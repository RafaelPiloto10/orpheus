You gave me back my soul again by showin' me  
The laughter and the wonder in your eyes  
Saved me from the shuttered man I used to be  
Opened up the windows of my life  
And the happiness you've given me for lovin' you  
Is sweeter love and deeper every day  
I can't stop the changes that you're growin' through  
Or someone new from stealin' you away  
Chorus:  
So darlin' when it's time you can spread your wings  
And I'll set you free - to fly away - and it's ok  
Cause darlin' time changes everything  
But it won't change me  
I love you - oh... I love you  
Inside of me you'll always be my valentine  
I pray your freedom makes your dreams come through  
As long as there's a heartbeat in this soul of mine  
You'll know there's someone so in love with you  
Chorus:  
So darlin' when it's time you can spread your wings  
And I'll set you free - to fly away - and it's ok  
Cause darlin' time changes everything  
But it won't change me  
I love you - oh... I love you
