Don't come cryin' to me when it's over  
Don't you come knockin'' at my door  
Don't come cryin' to me I won't be waiting  
Like I've done a hundred times before  
  
You promised you'd love me forever  
Now it's all over town you've changed your mind  
You'll call me and say "let's get together"  
But I'm sorry I won't take you back this time  
  
Don't come cryin' to me when it's over  
Don't you come knockin'' at my door  
Don't come cryin' to me I won't be waiting  
Like I've done a hundred times before  
  
Like I've done a hundred times before
