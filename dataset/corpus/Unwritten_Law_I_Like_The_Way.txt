I got a cocaine woman and she's cookin' up a pound of pills  
Another ride to the station and you know I'm gonna pay the bills, lord  
I gotta go see my baby  
Gotta run run run  
The only girl I loved  
It'll be the last one  
I know I know  
She's hell on wheels  
I know how she feels boy  
  
I like the way that she moves when she moves me  
I like the way that she feels when she feels me  
She don't complain when I say that I'm leavin'  
I'm in love  
  
I got a cyclone woman she's cookin' up a pound of thrills  
Another night she's away couldn't take cause you know it kills  
I missed her for six days  
Can't wait to see that fine-lookin' woman motherfuckin' lyin' next to me  
She's hell on wheels  
I know how she feels boy  
  
I like the way that she moves when she moves me  
I like the way that she feels when she feels me  
She don't complain when I say that I'm leavin'  
I'm in love  
  
I spent a lifetime finding you  
Oh my love  
And I'd die a thousand times for you, my love  
  
Yeah gotta run run run  
Oh, she'll be the last one  
I know I know
