If all you want's a good time, baby  
There's a party down the street  
If you're trying to fight an old flame  
Well, I can't take the heat  
If you're looking for a game to play  
Well, I wish you luck  
'Cause all I have to offer you is love  
  
If you only want a keeper darling  
I don't hold the key  
If you're searching for a savior better  
Get down on your knees  
If you're looking for the answers, well  
Hell I don't know that much  
'Cause all I have to offer you is love  
  
Oh darling, there's a whole lot of things  
I've found that I just can't be, no I can't  
But if you're looking for a real love, baby  
I've got all that you'll ever need  
It might be more than you're after  
Or not nearly enough  
But all I have to offer you is love  
  
Oh darling, there's a whole lot of things  
I've found I just can't be  
But if you're looking for a real love, baby  
I've got all that you'll ever need  
It might be more than you're after  
Or not nearly enough, ahh  
But all I have to offer you is love  
  
Sweet love, baby  
'Cause all I got to offer you is love  
Sweet love  
Oh baby, sugar
