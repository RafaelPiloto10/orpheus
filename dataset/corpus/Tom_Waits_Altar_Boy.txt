He's an ol' altar boy  
Lying out there in the street  
He's an ol' alter boy  
Bound up in leather and chains  
That's why I'm feeling so blue  
I'm an old altar boy  
What about you?  
  
Now, I can order in Latin  
Make 'em au gratin, Joe  
I'm an old altar boy  
That's why I'm so depressed  
I never got the rest of the dream  
Just the ritual  
Now I'm habitual  
Majoring in crimes that are unspeakable  
Cause I'm an old altar boy  
That's what happened to me  
  
I'm an old altar boy  
He's hoping he can meet a woman dressed like a nun  
He knows there's got to be some around here  
Drinking across from the church  
A little Father Cribari wine  
On a Sunday morn' time  
  
I'm an old altar boy  
Why is he winking at this time in his life?  
He never took a wife, cause he's an old altar boy  
Oh, yeah  
What about you?
