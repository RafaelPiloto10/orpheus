Clowns caress you  
Figures undress your fear  
Induced to crime beyond emotion  
Shedding tears as big as the ocean  
  
Don't say you didn't hear us callin'  
Ooh, ooh, you'll be sorry in the mornin'  
When we tell you  
Mama had tears in her eyes  
She's the only one who never cries  
  
That's the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out, shut it out  
That's the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out of your mind  
That's the way, that's the way  
  
If I address you  
And you see me in the shadows fallin'  
Call, caress me  
Hey I woke up on my own this mornin'  
  
Don't say you didn't hear us callin'  
Ooh, ooh, you'll be sorry in the mornin'  
When we tell you  
Mama had tears in her eyes  
She's the only one who never lies  
  
That's the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out, shut it out  
That's the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out of your mind  
That's the way, that's the way  
  
I'm only tryin' to help you, baby  
(Only tryin' to help you, yeah)  
I'm only tryin' to help you, baby  
(Only tryin' to help you)  
I'm only tryin' to help you, baby  
(Only tryin', only tryin' only tryin' to help you)  
  
I'm only tryin' to help you, baby  
(Only tryin' to help you)  
I'm only tryin' to help you  
(Only tryin' to help you)  
I'm only tryin' to help you  
(Only tryin' to help you)  
I'm only tryin' to help you
