There'll be  
No darkness tonight  
Lady our love  
Will shine  
Just put  
Your trust in my heart  
And meet me  
In paradise, girl  
You're every wonder  
In this world to me  
A treasure time  
Won't steal away  
  
Chorus:  
So listen to my heart  
Lay your body  
Close to mine  
Let me fill you  
With my dreams  
I can make you  
Feel alright  
And baby  
Through the years  
Gonna love you  
More each day  
So I promise you tonight  
That you'll always be  
The lady in my life  
  
Lay back  
In my tenderness  
Let's make this  
A night we won't forget  
Girl  
I need your sweet caress  
Reach out to a fantasy  
Two hearts  
In the beat of ecstasy  
Come to me, girl  
  
(Chorus)  
  
And I will  
Keep you warm  
Through the shadows  
Of the night  
Let me touch you  
With my love  
I can make you  
Feel so right  
And baby  
Through the years  
Even when  
We're old and gray  
I will love you  
More each day  
'Cause you  
Will always be  
The lady in my life  
  
Stay with me  
I want you  
To stay with me
