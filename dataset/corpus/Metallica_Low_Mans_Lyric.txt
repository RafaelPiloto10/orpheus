My eyes seek reality  
My fingers seek my veins  
There's a dog at your back step  
He must come in from the rain  
I fall 'cause I let go  
The net below has rot away  
So my eyes seek reality  
And my fingers seek my veins  
The trash fire is warm  
But nowhere safe from the storm  
And I can't bear to see  
What I've let me be  
So wicked and worn  
So as I write to you  
Of what is done and to do  
Maybe you'll understand  
And won't cry for this man  
'Cause low man is due  
Please forgive me  
My eyes seek reality  
My fingers feel for faith  
Touch clean with a dirty hand  
I touched the clean to the waste  
The trash fire is warm  
But nowhere safe from the storm  
And I can't bear to see  
What I've let me be  
So wicked and worn  
So as I write to you, yeah  
Of what is done and to do, yeah  
Maybe you'll understand  
And won't cry for this man  
'Cause low man is due  
Please forgive me  
Please forgive me  
Please forgive me  
So low the sky is all I see  
All I want from you is forgive me  
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain  
Though he just wants right back out again  
And I cry to the alleyway  
Confess all to the rain  
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror  
The one I've broken to match my face  
The trash fire is warm  
But nowhere safe from the storm  
And I can't bear to see  
What I've let me be  
So wicked and worn  
So as I write to you, yeah  
Of what is done and to do, yeah  
Maybe you'll understand  
And won't cry for this man  
'Cause low man is due  
Please forgive me  
Please forgive me  
So low the sky is all I see  
All I want from you is forgive me  
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain  
Though he just wants right back out again  
My eyes seek reality  
My fingers seek my veins
