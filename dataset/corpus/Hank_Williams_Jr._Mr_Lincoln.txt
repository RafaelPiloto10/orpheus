(Chorus:)  
Mr. Lincoln I wish you were here  
The Republics changed alot in a hundred years  
I don't think its working like you planned  
Mr Lincoln we sure could use a hand  
  
I just read the headlines in the Nashville News  
And I wish I made this up but I'm afraid its true  
Cause a man was murdered for his money in the street  
He was takin his wife to a nice place to eat  
When they caught the man he did 23 months of time  
He plead insanity like they do now all the time  
Sir what would you have done in 1859  
Now if you shoot someone sir you can get off scott free  
Its the latest thing mr Lincoln can you believe  
Now they sue the manufactures of the guns  
Aint the law changed alot since 1861  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I just heard the new story on the radio  
They let dangerous men outta prison now yes sir I'm afraid its so  
Because theyre overcrowded and it was only his fifth offense  
And this time hes killed someone does that make any sense  
Now my lawyer called me about a nuisance case  
Cause everybody sues over any little thing these days  
Well at least we're right all we gotta do is tell the truth  
  
He said youre living in the past you romantic fool  
I said you got that right I lean toward the older ways  
And theres damn few back woods lawyers left today  
  
(Chorus 2x)
