This how you make me feel, this how you make me feel  
This how you make me feel, that's how I know it's real  
Take you around the world, take you around the world  
Take you around the world, take you around the world  
  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my baby girl  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my, my, my  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my baby girl  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause my, my, my  
  
This how you make me feel, that's how I know it's real  
Take you around the world 'cause you my baby girl  
I know you feelin' good, I know you feelin' right  
You see me ridin', you ridin' wit me, our shit is tight  
  
Self-made millionaire, refined myself  
My success, God bless, not defined by wealth  
Come on, we live in crazy times, niggers that lost their minds  
We wanna fuck every fuckin' chicken we fuckin' find  
  
But then there comes a time when you start to grow  
But you ain't growin' with me and it's startin' to show  
Before I say I can't live without you  
Let's sit and have a talk about family value  
  
Now listen, I see you got some kids that you ain't never with  
Your baby father put hands on you, some crazy shit  
So he gon' pay for that, fuck with niggers who rap  
Most of that quality time is spent on your back  
  
Now before I devote the rest of my life  
Can you at least show a nigger you can boil some rice?  
Is that too much to ask, am I movin' too fast?  
Do you have anythin' to offer me besides some ass?  
  
You think you high class, the upper echelon  
But spent all your grit money in the hair salon  
I'm s'posed to help you out but it just made me think  
You ain't ready for the world, you ain't ready for me  
  
This how you make me feel, this how you make me feel  
This how you make me feel, that's how I know it's real  
Take you around the world, take you around the world  
Take you around the world, take you around the world  
  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my baby girl  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my, my, my  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my baby girl  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause my, my, my  
  
Damn baby, I see they drivin' you crazy because your body's amazin'  
I know you wanted to phase me but hey  
I seen a lot of girls, messed up a lot of curls  
You ain't gon' keep me with sex when only sex occurs  
  
Want you to think ahead, not just give me head  
Want you to make a household, baby, not just the bed  
I know the scene is what you seem to see  
But you need'nt to be but believe you me, baby girl  
  
They jus' gon' use you up, fuck you and bruise you up  
They got no family values, they ain't gon' choose you up  
We disrespect ourselves, we think we livin' well  
I could be wrong in this song but only time will tell  
  
You maybe thinkin', ?Hey X, you just a hypocrite  
You actin' like you never called a girl a fuckin' bitch?  
Nah, it's not that but it's like this  
We need change and I'm just man enough to say this shit  
  
This how you make me feel, this how you make me feel  
This how you make me feel, that's how I know it's real  
Take you around the world, take you around the world  
Take you around the world, take you around the world  
  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my baby girl  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my, my, my  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my baby girl  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause my, my, my  
  
This how you make me feel, this how you make me feel  
This how you make me feel, that's how I know it's real  
Take you around the world, take you around the world  
Take you around the world, take you around the world  
  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my baby girl  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my, my, my  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause you my baby girl  
'cause you my baby girl, 'cause my, my, my
