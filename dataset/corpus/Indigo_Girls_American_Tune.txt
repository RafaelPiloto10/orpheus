"American Tune" is a Paul Simon song. The girls have been performing  
It since at least 1985. A live version of it appears on the  
(promo-only) "Reverse 1" CD, and another on the (commercially  
Available, but kinda hard to find) "Ben and Jerry's Newport Folk  
Festival '90" CD.  
Many is the time I've been mistaken  
And many times confused  
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken  
And certainly misused.  
Oh, but I'm all right, I'm all right  
I'm just weary to my bones  
Still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home - so far away from home.  
I don't know a soul who's not been battered  
I don't have a friend who feels at ease  
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered  
Or driven to it's knees  
Oh, but it's all right, it's all right  
We've lived so well, so long  
Still, when I think of the road we're travelling on  
I wonder what's gone wrong  
I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong.  
And I dreamed I was dying  
Dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
And looking back down at me  
Smiled reassuringly  
And I dreamed I was flying  
And high up above, my eyes could clearly see  
The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was dying.  
Oh, we come on a ship they called the Mayflower  
We come on a ship that sailed the moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hour  
And sing an American tune  
Oh, oh, but it's all right - it's all right, it's all right  
You can't be forever blessed  
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day  
And I'm trying to get some rest  
That's all I'm trying - to get some rest
