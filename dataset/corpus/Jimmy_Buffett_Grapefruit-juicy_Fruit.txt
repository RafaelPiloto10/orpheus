Grapefruit  
A bathin' suit  
Chew a little Juicy Fruit  
Wash away the night  
  
Drive in  
You guzzle gin  
Commit a little mortal sin  
It's good for the soul  
  
And oh it gets so damn lonely  
When you're on a plane alone  
And if I had the money, honey  
I'd strap you in beside me  
And never ever leave you  
Leave you at home all alone and cryin'  
  
Ten speed  
No need  
My pickup gets me where I please  
Chuggin' down the street  
  
But I'll be leavin'  
In a little while  
So close your eyes and I'll  
I'll be back real soon  
  
"Ah, take it Reefers"  
"Ladies choice, Everybody dance"  
"Here we go"  
  
Yes and if I had that money, honey  
I'd strap you in beside me (in your strapless)  
And never ever leave you  
Leave you at home all alone and cryin'  
  
Grapefruit  
A bathin' suit  
You chew a little Juicy Fruit  
Wash away the night  
Yeah you chew a little Juicy Fruit  
It's good for ya soul
