Trains and boats and planes are passing by  
They mean a trip to Paris or Rome  
For someone else but not for me  
The trains and the boats and planes took you away  
Away from mewe were so in love and high above  
We had a star to wish upon  
Wish and dreams come true but not for me  
The trains and the boats and planes took you away  
Away from me  
  
You are in another part of the world  
You had to go  
You said you'd try to return again  
I'm waiting here like I promised you  
I'm waiting here but where are you?  
  
Trains and boats and planes took you away  
But every time I see them I pray  
And if my prayer can cross the sea  
The trains and the boats and planes will bring you home  
Back home to me
