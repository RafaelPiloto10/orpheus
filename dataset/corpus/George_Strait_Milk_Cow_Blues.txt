Well I woke up this mornin'  
Looked outdoors  
I can tell my milk cow  
I can tell by the way she lows  
If you see my milk cow  
Please drive her on home  
Cause I ain't had no milk and butter  
Since that cows been gone  
  
Well you gotta treat me right honey  
Day by day  
Get out your little prayer book  
Get down upon your knees and pray  
Cause you're gonna need me  
You're gonna need my help someday  
Lord you're gonna be sorry  
You, you treated me this a way  
Aw, now take it away boys  
  
Sail on, sail on, sail on little gal, sail on  
Sail on, sail on, sail on little gal, sail on  
You're gonna keep right on sailing  
Till you lose your happy home  
  
Well good evening  
Don't that sun look good going down  
I said well good evening  
Don't that sun look good going down  
Don't that ol' army cot look lonely  
When your lover ain't no place around  
  
Well I tried everything baby  
To get along with you  
Now I'm gonna tell you  
What I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna stop my cryin'  
Gonna leave you alone  
And if you don't think I'm leavin' big momma  
Just count the days I'm gone  
You ain't gonna see me  
You ain't gonna see my sweet face no more  
  
Lord you gonna be wondering honey  
Where in this world I've gone  
Milk cow blues
