[Chorus]  
Ridin' round town, got a pocket full of dough  
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know  
I take it just as fast and as far as it'll go  
Ridin' round town, got a pocket full of dough  
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know  
  
Aiyyo it's hard knock livin' doin' hard luck time  
Tryin' to make a dime still my only crime  
A man died tryin' to circumcise my shine  
Buck your gun kiddo, and I'll buck mine!  
Cash walk the line, police are the swine  
But knowledge is refined by the wise and divine  
And I can break it down for the dumb and the blind  
Unnatural acts, to actual facts  
Like cats that move packs don't never pay tax  
You ain't lie, boy you need to relax  
You leave a five like a junkie leaves tracks  
A habit needs a home like a monkey needs backs  
  
Pistol in my lap, got the pedal to the flo'  
The whiskey in the flask and a head full of blow  
You got heaven up above, got hell down below  
Pistol in my lap, got the pedal to the flo'  
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know  
  
I need a hard-headed woman for a cold-hearted man  
Never seen it comin', that's just part of the plan  
Work the hidden hand, walk forbidden land  
Do the best I can once shit hits the fan  
An hour's worth of sand, supply and demand  
Get high as you can, the power of a grand  
Two in the bush is worth one in the hand  
Could cower in the van, or burst into battle  
Back in the saddle, the kid don't rattle  
Don't play me, up the creek with no paddle  
We don't snitch while you bitches just tattle  
Poppin' off at the lip gets you tipped like cattle  
  
Eyes full of hate, got a heart full of love  
And you're the only woman that I ever dreamed of  
I get high as I can fly then I cry like a dove  
Eyes full of hate, got a heart full of love  
And you're the only woman that I ever dreamed of  
  
[Chorus]
