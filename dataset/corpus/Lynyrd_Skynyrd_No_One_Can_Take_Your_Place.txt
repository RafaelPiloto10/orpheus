Ain't no reason why I should feel this way  
I got everything going for now  
Might have it all, some people say  
But each time I think of your smiling face  
For I took upon inside now  
In your sweet love I can take  
'Cause I lost the best thing  
I miss you more everyday  
And I know deep inside me  
No one can take your place, oh no  
Sometimes when I am lonely  
And I can feel your presence near  
Well, I look at your picture  
And your sweet voice I can often hear  
But every time I really see you  
Oh, my heart often smiles  
And at that precise moment  
I break up all inside  
'Cause I lost the best thing  
I miss you more everyday  
And I know deep inside me  
No one can take your place, oh no  
Oh, all alone, I've lost you  
T'was nothing you could do  
I lost my only creation  
And now I'm paying all the due  
But every time I really see you  
Oh, my heart often smiles  
And at that precise moment  
I break up all inside  
'Cause I lost the best thing  
I miss you more everyday  
And I know deep inside me  
No one can take your place, oh no
