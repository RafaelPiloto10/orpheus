When tears are in your eyes  
It's time to look inside  
Your heart can find another way  
  
Believe in what I say  
Don't throw this time away  
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day  
  
Christmas Day  
  
So let the shadows go  
And drift away like snow  
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day  
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day  
  
Christmas Day  
  
So dream until the night,  
Becomes the morning light  
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day  
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day
