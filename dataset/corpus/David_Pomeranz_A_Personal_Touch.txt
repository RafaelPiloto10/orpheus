I know it's been hard  
I see how you've cried  
I can tell that the jagged edge of the world  
Has cut you deep inside  
So don't try and hide  
There's no reason for your heart to bleed  
What you need is a personal touch  
A hand on your shoulder  
Someone to hold you tight  
Someone to kiss you and make it right  
What you need is a personal touch tonight  
  
Don't try to be strong  
No need anymore  
Leave the cool neon signs  
And slick bottom lines  
By someone's else's door  
And you can be sure  
By the mornin' your soul will be freed  
  
All you need is a personal touch  
A hand on your shoulder  
Someone to hold you tight  
Someone to kiss you and make it right  
What you need is a personal touch tonight  
  
Oh, someone to hold you  
Someone to kiss you  
And make it right  
What you need is  
A personal touch tonight  
Tonight  
  
I'm gonna hold you  
And make it all right  
With a personal touch tonight
