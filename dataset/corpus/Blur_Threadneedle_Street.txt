The time has come  
Not to be cautious  
You must be careful no to make mistakes  
For every heart flower  
In twenty four  
  
An operation froze  
Faster than they did yesterday  
And the landing right on your side  
They won't be much of a problem  
  
Then passed smith  
There is a rise  
When everybodies asleep at home  
He becomes nervous  
And sees a change  
Today in future  
  
Oh la la oh la la oh la la  
Watch the markets move from the screen  
In a pocket in a grey flannel suit  
Re tomorrow's cash today  
And check your pulse  
  
Waste metals crawling to the kerb  
And softs dropped in a summer term  
Sugars melted in the mouth  
Of a broken home  
If we knew a better option  
  
She sleeps for while  
And it could be long time before he thinks again  
And then he looks at the papers and looks again  
Today futures  
  
Oh la la oh la la oh la la oh la la  
Today futures  
Futures futures futures [repeat the fade]
