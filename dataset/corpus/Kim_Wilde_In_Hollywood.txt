Divorce, law courts  
Lawyers in their new sports car  
Lots of money spent  
The public making judgment  
  
He said, she said  
Analyze the news you've read  
Irresistible, the updates unmissable  
Fighting, uniting  
The press are busy writing  
They analyze the word called love  
But what can they be thinking of?  
  
They say that love means the same  
All over the world  
But I don't think so  
Let me tell you something  
I think you should know

It won't fell like you know it should (in Hollywood)  
An you can bet it won't do ya no good  
It's just not understood  
I said  
  
Scheming, screaming  
This time you're gonna leave him  
You want to get the message straight  
Now people think you're on the take  
  
Listen to me a CNN free therapy  
Advice on how to live your life  
There's something here that isn't right
