Shackled by a heavy burden  
'Neath a load of guilt and shame  
Then the hand of Jesus touched me  
And now I am no longer the same  
  
He touched me, Oh, He touched me  
And Oh the joy that floods my soul  
Something happened and now I know  
He touched me and made me whole  
  
Since I met this blessed Savior  
And since he cleaned and made me whole  
I never cease to praise Him  
I'll shout it while eternity rolls  
  
Oh He touched me, oh He touched me  
And oh the joy that floods my soul  
Something happened and now I know  
He touched me and made me whole.
