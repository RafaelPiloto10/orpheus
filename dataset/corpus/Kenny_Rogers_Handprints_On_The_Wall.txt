The wait turned into hours  
Before you came my way  
The smile that filled a daddy's heart  
On the special day  
The moment left me speechless  
I didn't know what to say  
Then you took your first breath  
That took mine away  
  
Days go by so quickly  
Summer turns to fall  
Seems like only yesterday  
That you began to crawl  
So don't be afraid to take that step  
I'll catch you when you fall  
I don't mind if you leave behind  
A few hand prints on the wall  
  
I can't describe this feeling  
Way down deep inside  
The itsy-bitsy spider  
Was the first thing that we tried  
Patty cake, the baker's man  
With your hands so very small  
You could always stay this young  
And I wouldn't mind at all  
  
Days go by so quickly  
Summer turns to fall  
Seems like only yesterday  
That you began to crawl  
So don't be afraid to take that step  
I'll catch you when you fall  
I don't mind if you leave behind  
A few hand prints on the wall
