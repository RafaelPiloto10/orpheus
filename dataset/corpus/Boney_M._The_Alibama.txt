Proud in the morning sun  
Day has just begun  
She's a queen riding on the waves  
So many miles away  
Sailing many a day  
Brave in dark storms and hurricanes  
Bringing something for everyone  
"..." of lands underneath the sun  
Here comes the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
Here comes the Alibama, sailing homewards to you and to me  
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
Here comes the Alibama-ma  
Here comes the Alibama-ma  
Here comes the Alibama-ma  
Here comes the Alibama-ma  
Sailing the seven seas  
Like a bird on the breeze  
Oh how she travelled far and wide  
Now she is nearly at home  
Not much longer alone  
Coming back on the morning tide  
Bringing something for everyone  
"..." of lands underneath the sun  
Here comes the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
Here comes the Alibama, sailing homewards to you and to me  
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
...
