Now that I've lost everything to you,  
You say you want to start something new,  
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving,  
Baby I'm grieving.  
But if you want to leave take good care,  
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear,  
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there.  
  
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world,  
It's hard to get by just upon a smile.  
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world.  
I'll always remember you like a child, girl.  
  
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do,  
And it's breaking my heart in two,  
Cause I never want to see you sad girl,  
Don't be a bad girl,  
But if you want to leave take good care,  
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there,  
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware  
  
Oh baby baby it's a wild world,  
It's hard to get by just upon a smile  
Oh baby baby it's a wild world,  
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl.  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la,  
Baby I love you  
  
But if you want to leave take good care,  
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there,  
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware  
  
Well, baby, baby it's a wild world,  
It's hard to get by just upon a smile.  
Ooh baby, baby, it's a wild world,  
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl.  
  
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world,  
It's hard to get by just upon a smile.  
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world,  
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl.
