Come gather 'round people  
Wherever you roam  
And admit that the waters  
Around you have grown  
And accept it that soon  
You'll be drenched to the bone  
If your time to you is worth savin'  
Then you better start swimmin'  
Or you'll sink like a stone  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come writers and critics  
Who prophesize with your pen  
And keep your eyes wide  
The chance won't come again  
And don't speak too soon  
For the wheel's still in spin  
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'  
'Cause the loser now  
Will be later to win  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come senators, congressmen  
Please heed the call  
Don't stand in the doorways  
Don't block up the hall  
For he that gets hurt  
Will be he that has stalled  
The battle outside ragin'  
Will soon shake your windows  
And rattle your walls  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come mothers and fathers  
All over the land  
And don't criticize  
What you can't understand  
Your sons and your daughters  
Are beyond your command  
Your old road is rapidly agin'  
Please get out of the new one  
If you can't lend your hand  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
The line it is drawn  
The curse it is cast  
The slow one now  
Will later be fast  
And the present now  
Will later be past  
The order is rapidly fadin'  
The first one now  
Will later be last  
For the times they are a-changin'  
For the times they are a-changin'
