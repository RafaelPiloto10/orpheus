Hit the town in the cold of the night  
Looking 'round for the warmth of the light  
There was fog on the road  
So I guess no one saw me arriving  
  
I was tired and awake for some time  
Then my lights hit a welcoming sign  
It said if you're alone  
You can make this your home  
If you want to, oww  
  
Searching, searching  
(For so long)  
Searching  
(Searching)  
Searching, searching  
(I just wanted to dance)  
Searching  
  
Stepped outta the night  
It was brighter inside  
Someone come and asked me my name  
Taken back by surprise  
When I saw with my eyes  
A girl in a love's disguise  
  
She said stop, stop, stop  
Get out your heart  
Haven't got a lot  
But play the part  
  
Mister, stop, stop, stop  
Get out your heart  
What I've got's hot stuff  
The night is ours  
  
Coffee glass that had fell from my hand  
Like a child couldn't quite understand  
What was I doin' there  
Far away from nowhere, on my own  
  
I was tired and awake for some time  
Just the light playing tricks with my mind  
Was she there in a crowd  
Was the music too loud, was I dreaming  
  
Searching, searching  
(For so long)  
Searching  
(I don't want romance)  
(I just want my chance, searching)  
Searching, searching  
(Yeah)  
Searching  
  
Just came by here by chance  
Only wanted to dance  
No news, no her, no, no, no one  
Taken back by surprise  
What's in front of my eyes  
This girl in a love's disguise  
  
She said stop, stop, stop  
Get out your heart  
Haven't got a lot  
But play the part  
  
Mister, stop, stop, stop  
Get out your heart  
What I've got's hot stuff  
The night is ours
