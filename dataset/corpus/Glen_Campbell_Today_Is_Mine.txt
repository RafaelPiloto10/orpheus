When the sun came up this morning I took the time to watch it rise  
And as its beauty struck the darkness from the sky  
I thought how small and unimportant all my troubles seem to be  
And how lucky another day belongs to me  
  
And as the sleepy world around me woke up to greet the day  
All its silent beauties seemed to say  
So what my friend if all your dreams you have and realized  
Just look around you you got a whole new day to try  
  
Today is mine today is mine to do with what I will  
Today is mine my own special cup to fill  
To die a little that I might learn to live to take from life that I might
learn to give  
Today is mine  
  
Like most men I cursed the present to avoid the peace of mind  
And raise my thoughts beyond tomorrow and vision there more peace of mind  
But as I view this day around me I can see the fool I've been  
For today's the only garden we can tend  
Today is mine...
