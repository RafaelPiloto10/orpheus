[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
Remember that time I showed up with just panties under my coat?  
High heels, they was knee high, and my legs was grippin' that throat  
You told me this and I quote, cause we popped pills and you smoked  
You said, "your stuff got me strung out, it's like doin' lines of some coke"  
You always say it's the best that you ever had in your life  
And you always play with it good when we be speedin' off in that Wraith  
Just keep coppin' them things that you be coppin' me on the eighth  
You the president and I'm Biden, just slide in cause you safe, nigga, third
base  
  
[Chorus: The Weeknd]  
I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time that I'll be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah  
I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time I'd ever call you mine  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe  
  
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]  
I'ma let you know and keep it simple  
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple  
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you  
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo  
Always tryna send me off to rehab  
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf  
I'm just tryna live life for the moment  
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse  
  
[Chorus: The Weeknd]  
I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time that I'll be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah  
I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time I'd ever call you mine  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe  
  
[Bridge: The Weeknd]  
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes  
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?  
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies  
Only you to trust, only you  
  
[Chorus: The Weeknd]  
I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time that I'll be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah  
I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time I'd ever call you mine  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe  
  
[Outro: The Weeknd]
