Where did she go?  
Where did she go from here?  
The last time I saw her  
she made all the clouds disappear  
She said, with a smile,  
yea, the weather's alright  
She left her coat at home that night  
  
Where do I begin today?  
Where do colours never fade?  
In the sunshine, in the rain  
it's quite the same  
It's never gonna change  
I'll be looking for Jane  
  
Why did she come?  
Why did she come to me?  
There must have been millions  
in the world she'd rather see  
At least in my mind  
as time has gone by  
it's always harder to laugh then to cry  
  
Where do I begin today? (ba-ba-ba)  
Where the colours never fade (ba-ba-ba)  
In the sun and in the rain  
it's quite the same  
It's never gonna change  
I'll be looking for Jane  
  
Where do I begin today? (ba-ba-ba)  
Where the sunshine never fades (ba-ba-ba)  
In the sun and in the rain  
it's quite the same  
It's never gonna change  
I'll be looking for Jane  
  
Where do I begin today?  
Where the colours never fade  
In the sun and in the rain  
it's quite the same  
It's never gonna change  
I'll be looking for Jane  
  
Where do I begin today?  
Where the sun will never fade  
In the sun and in the rain  
it's quite the same  
It's never gonna change  
I'll be looking for Jane  
  
In the sunshine in the rain  
it's quite the same  
It's never gonna change  
I'll be looking for Jane
