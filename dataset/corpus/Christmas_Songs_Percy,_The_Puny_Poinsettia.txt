Percy the puny poinsettia  
Is hanging his bloom in dismay  
If they had just kept him wetta  
He'd be a houseplant today  
Folks liked the other plants betta  
Now he's alone on the shelf  
Even a plant with no uncle or aunt  
Shouldn't spend Christmas Day by himself  
  
Holiday shoppers would stop by the counter  
And pick up a plant to take home  
Until one by one all his friends were adopted  
And Percy was left all alone  
  
Percy the puny poinsettia  
Is hanging his bloom in dismay  
If they had just kept him wetta  
He'd be a houseplant today  
Folks liked the other plants betta  
Now he's alone on the shelf  
Even a plant with no uncle or aunt  
Shouldn't spend Christmas Day by himself  
  
Then into the store on the night before Christmas  
Came a poor little girl who was cryin'  
But when she saw Percy her eyes opened wide  
And she said "Can I please make him mine?"  
  
Now Percy the puny poinsettia  
Is standing beside Mr. Tree  
His leaves have never been redda,  
He's as proud as a flower can be  
  
Somebody made him feel betta,  
Rescued him off of the shelf  
Even a plant with no uncle or aunt  
Shouldn't spend Christmas Day by himself
