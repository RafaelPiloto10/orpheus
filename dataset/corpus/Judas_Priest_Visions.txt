As the day begins to fade  
Eventides when I'm afraid  
I'll never know when you'll appear  
But my senses say you're near  
  
In the dark when I write  
Telling fortunes for my life  
I'm sitting here by candle flame  
When will you arrive again  
  
Embers ignite once again  
I watch them dance around the flame  
Sparks start to fly  
I can't speak  
From seeing answers that I seek  
  
Shapes start to form as I stare  
The shadows taunt as if to dare  
Ghostly embrace takes my heart  
Now I surrender and it starts  
  
[Chorus]  
Visions in the night  
Show me what is right  
Help me through the maze of mystery  
I will sell my soul  
Only I can know  
What the future holds  
And what will be  
  
Slowly my hand  
Turns the page  
It never ceases to amaze  
Fill me with hope if you can  
I will become a better man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Visions come into my mind  
And tell the future of mankind  
  
Only time will prove that I'm right  
Will my words come true (will my words come true)  
I can't deny the gift of foresight (I can't deny)  
There's nothing I can do (There's nothing I can do)  
  
Such a lonely night  
Premonitions running wild  
I can see them now  
All alone I fantasize  
  
As daylight breaks  
Through the stars  
I wonder how I got this far  
As I leave my room  
And lock the door  
I know I'll live forever more  
  
[Chorus: x2]
