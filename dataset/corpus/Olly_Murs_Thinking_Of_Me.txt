Wintertime in London, are you making plans?  
Are you still rocking Converse with your old Ray Bans  
If you're sitting in the places that we use to be  
Or if you're somewhere listening to Bob Marley  
  
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
  
Do you still pick up the seashells on that pebble beach?  
Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet  
When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free  
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi Breeze?  
  
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
Oh yes, you are  
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
  
Oh, ooh, yeah, no point regretting that it didn't last  
No point regretting that it went so fast  
Time that we had was like sand in our hands  
But when I look behind, I'm so glad that you were mine  
  
I remember taking you home on that 86  
Standing in your doorway where we use to kiss  
Then your dad came out and chased me down the street  
If you remember just how scared I use to be  
  
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me  
  
Bumped into Irene down in Waterloo  
She told me that you got yourself somebody new  
She said you musta like him 'cause he's, oh, so nice  
But I remember that you like a pinch of spice, well I  
  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now  
  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now
