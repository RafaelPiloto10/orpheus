If I could then I would  
But I can't so I ask  
Cause I really wasn't ready for you  
  
If I knew what you knew  
Shouldn't do what I do  
Cause I really wasn't ready for you (thinkin' of you)  
  
I wasn't ready to say goodbye  
But goodbye was ready for me  
Least I'll never have to see you cry  
Cryin' is over for me  
  
If I am what I am  
And it's all that I can  
I mighta had some pity for you  
  
What I choose  
What I ooze  
What I bet  
Win or lose  
But I'd still be waitin' on you  
  
I wasn't ready to say goodbye  
But goodbye was ready for me  
Least you'll never have to see me cry  
Cryin' is over for me  
  
Who's cryin' now  
The more I think about  
The less it matters  
  
Who's cryin' now  
The less I think about  
The more it matters  
  
As I go 'round the world  
And I stop in the whirl  
As I whirlwind the world  
With you-oou-ou-ou-ou  
  
If I could then I would  
But I can't so I ask  
Cause I wasn't really ready for you  
  
I wasn't ready to say goodbye  
But goodbye was ready for me  
Least you'll never have to see me cry  
Cryin' is over for me  
  
Who's cryin' now  
The more I think about  
The less that matters
