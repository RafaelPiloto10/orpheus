Time after time, I held it just to watch it die  
Line after line, I loved it just to watch it cry  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you home  
Wave after wave, I washed it just to watch it turn  
Day after day, I cooled it just to watch it burn  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you home  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away  
Pain after pain, I stood it just to see how it feels  
Rain after rain, I stood it just to make it real  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the day you go away  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away  
Time after time, I held it just to watch it die  
Line after line, I loved it just to watch it cry  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away  
Bless the weather that brought you to me  
Curse the storm that takes you away
