Away from the city that hurts and knocks,  
I'm standing alone by the desolate docks  
In the still and the chill of the night  
I see the horizon the great unknown  
My heart has an ache  
It's as heavy as stone  
With the dawn coming on, make it last  
  
I cover the waterfront  
I'm watching the sea  
Will the one I love  
Be coming back to me  
  
I cover the waterfront  
In search of my love  
An I'm covered  
By a starlit sky above  
  
Here am I  
Patiently waiting  
Hoping and longing  
Oh how I yearn  
Where are you  
Have you thought back time  
Will you remember  
Will you return  
  
Will the one I love  
Be coming back  
To me
