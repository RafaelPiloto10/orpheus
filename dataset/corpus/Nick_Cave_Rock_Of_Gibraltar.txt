Let me say this to you  
I'll be steadfast and true  
And my love will never falter  
  
The sea would crash about us  
The waves would lash about us  
I'll be your rock of gibraltar  
  
Sometimes it's hard  
And we're both caught off guard  
But there's nothing I would ever alter  
  
The wind could howl round our ears  
For the next thousand years  
I'd still be your rock of gibraltar  
  
The best thing I done  
Was to make you the one  
Who I'd walk with down to the altar  
  
You'd stand by me  
And together we'd be  
That great, steady rock of gibraltar  
  
Under the big yellow moon  
On our honeymoon  
I took you on a trip to malta  
  
And all through the night  
You held me so tight  
Your great, steady rock of gibraltar  
  
Could the powers that be  
Ever foresee  
That things could so utterly alter?  
  
All the plans that we laid  
Could soon be betrayed  
Betrayed like the rock of gibraltar
