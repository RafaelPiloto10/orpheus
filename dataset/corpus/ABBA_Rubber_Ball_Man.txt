The poster on the wall of a dear friend  
I wish there was a way that I could show you how your songs set me free  
The hero of them all  
You're a legend  
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you  
Still you're close as can be  
  
Make the bandstand to a dreamland, Rubber Ball Man  
Clapping your hands, let your feet dance, Rubber Ball Man  
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still  
Some of us dreaming, some of us screaming  
Look at your fans, how we love you, Rubber Ball Man!
