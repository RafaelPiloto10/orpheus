You may drive around in your town  
Ina brand new shiny car  
Your face in the wind your haircut's in  
And your friends think you're bizarre  
You may find a cushy job and I hope that you go far  
But if you really want to taste some cool success  
You better learn to play guitar  
  
[Chorus:]  
Play guitar--play guitar (3X)  
  
You got your eyes on the cheerleader queen  
And you're walkin' her home from school  
You know that she's only seventeen  
But you know that your a fool  
You know you can't touch this stuff  
Without money or a brand new car  
Let me give you some good advice young man  
You better learn to play guitar  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
All women around the world want a phony rock star  
Who plays guitar  
  
Well you can pump your iron and shine your shoes  
And wear your hair just right  
You go down out on cruisin' street  
'Cause you want to score tonight  
We all want to strut our stuff  
And you really want to show your scars  
Forget all about that macho shit  
And learn how to play guitar  
  
[Chorus:]
