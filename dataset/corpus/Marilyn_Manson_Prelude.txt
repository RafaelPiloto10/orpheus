There's no earthly way of knowing  
Which direction we are going  
There's no knowing where we're going  
Or which way the wind is blowing  
Is it raining? Is it snowing  
Is a hurricane a-blowing  
Not a speck of light is showing  
So the danger must be growing  
Oh, the fires of hell are glowing  
Is the grisly reaper mowing  
Yes! The danger must be growing  
For the rowers keep on rowing  
And they're certainly not showing  
Any signs that they are slowing!  
Stop the boat!
