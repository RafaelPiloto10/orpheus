Hey look yonder  
What's that I see  
Well that old bogus, honey  
Comin' after me  
  
I goin' told you  
Was out of town  
I wonder how she knowed  
I was hangin' around  
  
Say, listen babe  
Don't go wastin' your time  
You keep comin' 'round  
You'll hear the same old line  
  
You got a thousand boys  
You say you need 'em  
You take what's good for you  
And I'll take my freedom  
  
'Cause lately it's been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I gotta go the other way  
(Heh, heh, heh)  
  
I thought I knew her  
My cagey lady  
How come my sunshine  
Was so damn shady  
She'll say she love to talk  
A conversation  
But I'm the one  
Who makes my situation  
  
This one way city  
That I thought I knew  
It's such a pity, honey  
That's it for you  
'Cause lately it's been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I gotta go the other way  
  
There's nothing over here  
I never showed you  
I made it pretty clear  
I'm glad to know you  
  
You know your brother Spike  
He's on the level  
But you always lookin'  
Like you're mad at the devil  
  
Don't say I cop a 'tude  
It's all forgotten  
It's just you're much too rude  
Your fruits are rotten  
  
You know I work so hard to keep it alive  
Now all I hear from you  
Is nothing but jive  
  
Lately it's been so hard  
Now to make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I'm goin' on the other way  
Yes I do!  
  
And lately it's been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I really been feelin'  
Like I could be movin' on  
  
You're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody you meet  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody but me  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody you meet  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody but me...  
You got to get yourself back on your feet
