(l. lovich)  
Let's face the music - I think that it's time.  
What's the use, when the future looks so unkind.  
Life and death - the choice we make.  
Revolution - the line in my mind takes.  
Win or lose, hey! what do you say.  
Got to change, change, change, change.  
Check it out and see - there could be a better lifestyle.  
My hopes are big as the sky,  
My dreams are wider than wide.  
One day we'll be absolutely crueltyfree!  
Rage!  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, into the light.  
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,  
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.  
What is this sad fascination,  
To rip off another's skin.  
Shame! shame! shame!  
Fancy people in furcoat - what a pitiful sight.  
Leather is dead - it's not so nice.  
Rage!  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, into the light.  
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,  
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.  
Stop! think! before you chew.  
Don't eat a creature, that won't eat you.  
Food for everyone,  
Let's all eat - it's so much fun.  
Let that chicken be! a cow is not a factory!  
Fast food slaughter - a criminal waste.  
We've got to tune ourselves into a new morality.  
Make some improvement on the human race.  
Rage, each time I turn around.  
Rage, it tears my heart apart.  
Rage, each time I see the blood.  
Hey, now! sentimental feelings are just not good enough.  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, it's time to care.  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, into the light.  
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,  
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, it's time to care.
