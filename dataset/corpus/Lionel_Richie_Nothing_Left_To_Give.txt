I walk the land  
And release all the way to my shoes  
And I Sailing the Sea's  
And watched out all my dream come truth  
I'm through the sky  
There see everything from a purse view  
And I row the streets and reality brought me back to you  
That's when I realize that we gotta be a life  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Party like there's nothing left to give  
Yeah it's nothing
