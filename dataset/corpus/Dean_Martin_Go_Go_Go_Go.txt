(Go go go go)  
Come on and dance with me  
(Go go go go)  
In to a trance with me  
(Go go go go)  
And try romance with me  
Don't stop, don't stop, go go go go  
(Go go go go)  
The music's bright tonight  
(Go go go go)  
And hold me tight tonight  
(Go go go go)  
I fell so right tonight  
Don't stop, don't stop, go go go go  
This heart of mine is beating overtime  
It's four leaf clover time  
(It's love) It's love, it's love, it's love  
(Go go go go)  
And swing me round the floor  
(Go go go go)  
And kiss me more and more  
(Go go go go)  
What are we waiting for  
Don't stop, don't stop, go go go go go go  
Go go go go
