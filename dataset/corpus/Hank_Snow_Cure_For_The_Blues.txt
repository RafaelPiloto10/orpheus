I've got a sort of lowdown feeling a sickness that is hard to describe  
It ain't no use to call a doctor cause the cure I know he couldn't prescribe  
Day by day I'm gradually failin' guess it's just a matter of time  
It's started in my mind and infected my heart  
Baby when you said goodbye  
[ piano ]  
I thought that I was slowly improvin' when the tears began to dry  
Then I passed you on the corner and it took the rainbow out of my sky  
So baby won't you hear my pleadin' your love would really pull me through  
It would heal my troubled mind leave these heartaches behind  
Cause you're the only cure for the blues  
[ guitar ]  
I strolled beside that muddy Mississippi and as the evening sun sank low  
That naggin' deep inside said jump boy but the longin' in my heart said no  
I guess that I'll continue on a walking and maybe Lady Luck will come through  
Then contentment I will find in my troublesome mind  
Cause baby you're the cure for the blues  
Cause baby you're the cure for the blues
