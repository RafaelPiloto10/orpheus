My love  
Lives out at the end of the road  
Takes what you give her and goes  
Says things that everyone knows  
Shes only willing  
To kiss me again  
Lights me on fire  
Sprays me with water  
And she lights me up again  
Said my love  
Burried my head in the sand  
Screams just as loud as she can  
Sings me to sleep when I can't  
Shes always willing  
To kiss me again  
She wakes up the neighbors  
Goes down for water  
And then she comes up again  
I said good love  
Lives on the radio dial  
Never goes out of style  
Makes all the children run wild  
We keep on thinking  
Strait to the end?  
Now it's completly  
We just just shout for the moment and then we vanish again  
My love  
Waits at the end of the road  
Takes what you give her and goes  
Says things that everyone knows  
Ya she's my love  
Talking about my love  
Ya she's my love my love my love  
Shes my love
