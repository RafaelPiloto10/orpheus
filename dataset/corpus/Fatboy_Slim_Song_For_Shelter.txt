I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper, ha.  
Into this thing.  
  
The deeper I go,  
The more knowledge I know.  
What to sing, what to bring. What?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper, deeper, deeper  
Into the vibe,  
What? ha.  
  
Chilling in the corner,  
At the shelter all by myself,  
Checkin' it out, Im not dancing no more,  
But, why? Why? Why? What?  
  
How on Earth?  
Are you supposed to vibe? around the fake ones, the one that say:  
They know what is what,  
But they don't know what is what,  
They just strut.  
What the fuck? What?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper,  
Into this thing,  
And I pretend,  
That they're not there.  
I just stare,  
Up in the booth at the dread man spinning the song, Spinning it strong  
Playing things like:  
We care bout house, we care.  
  
That's my shit, what?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper  
When people start to disappear,  
It is about six o'clock,wooo, I'm feelin hot,  
Take off my sweater and my pants,  
And i start to dance,  
And all the sweat just goes down my bass?.  
  
And I pretend that,  
There's nobody there but me in this place.  
  
I get deep yo, I get deep. What? Woo!  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep when he takes all the bass out the song and all you hear is highs,
and it's like: Oh shit! I get deep...  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep when the rhythm flows through my blood like alcohol and i get
drunk, and I'm over the place.  
But I catch myself right on time, right on line with the beat, and it's so
sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. I get deep, I get deep, I get deep.  
  
Why, if house music was air, then Dr. Love would be my song, and I would only
take deep breaths.  
And fill my lungs with the rhythm, with the bass. I get deep, I get deep.  
  
??????  
  
She said i wanna go out on a picknick with you baby, Under the big bright
yellow sun  
  
You guys, just keep it rollin'
