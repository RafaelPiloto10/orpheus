I could hold on for a hundred years  
When all else is gone  
I would still be here  
In a memory of things yet unseen  
I?d remember all that we?ve never been  
And I cannot wait to see  
What life has in store for me  
[chorus]  
In another lifetime  
It would be forever  
In another world  
Where you and I  
Could be together  
In another set of chances  
I?d take the one?s I?d missed  
And make you mine  
If only for a time  
My life would matter  
In another life  
And I?d stay as strong and I?d stay as true  
And you?d have forever now to think it through  
Coz I believe what wasn?t meant to be  
Wasn?t meant for now and  
Someday you?ll see  
In a place and time we never know  
I?d be standing there waiting for you  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Bridge]  
You would be mine  
But until that time is now  
I?d be holding on somehow  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Coda]  
But until that time  
I?ll be holding onto forever  
Until another life
