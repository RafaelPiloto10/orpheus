A quiet conversation  
A solitary prayer  
Listening in the silence  
and knowing You are there  
Emptying my troubled heart  
My secret hopes and fears  
You speak to me in whispered words  
That the heart alone can hear  
  
[Chorus]  
I love You so  
Won't let You go  
Hold on to me  
  
I could never offer You  
the praise that You deserve  
The thanks for all You've given me  
and with nothing in return  
But I will give my life to you  
My moments and my days  
If only for the peace I find  
Every time I hear You say . . .  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep me near this day  
Never let me stray  
From Your everlasting, sweet embrace  
Hold on  
Hold on to me  
  
Another conversation  
Another quiet plea  
Stumbling for a way to say  
How much You mean to me  
and once again You give me more  
Than I can give to You  
So I'll just say these simple words  
'Cause it's all I know to do  
  
[Chorus]
