Some will sing a song  
To reel 'em in  
It's a song I sung before  
And a song I'm gonna sing again  
I mean every word  
I don't mean a single one of them  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
  
Tell a joke  
Tell it twice  
If no one else is laughing there why am I  
I split myself both times and laugh till I cry  
Oh Lord, please make me pure  
But not yet  
  
I don't have to try  
I just dial it in  
I've never found a job that for me was worth bothering  
I got a ton of selfish genes and lazy bones  
Beneath this skin  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
  
Smoking kills  
Sex sells  
I've got one hand in my pocket but the other one looks cool as hell  
I know I'm gonna die so my revenge is living well  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
  
I stopped praying  
So I hope this song will do  
I wrote it all for you  
I'm not perfect but you don't mind that, do you?  
I know you're there to pull me through, aren't you?  
  
So I look for love  
I like the search  
And I'll be standing for election all across the known universe  
Let every president get the country she deserves  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
  
And I've been seeing  
Somebody's wife  
She said she'd leave him for me and I said that wasn't wise  
You can't lie to a liar because of all lies  
Oh Lord, please make me pure  
Not yet
