[Chorus 1]  
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down  
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems  
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out  
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems  
  
[Verse 1]  
You know where I'm coming from  
Though I am running to you  
All our feelings tonight, tonight, tonight, oh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I wanted to be a better brother, better son  
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done  
I have none to show to the one I love  
But tonight, tonight, tonight, oh  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
[Verse 2]  
Polarize is taking your disguises  
Separating em, splitting em up from wrong and right  
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
[Bridge]  
We have problems  
We have problems  
  
[Breakdown]  
Domingo en fuego  
I think I lost my halo  
I don't know where you are  
You'll have to come and find me  
Domingo en fuego  
I think I lost my halo  
I don't know where you are  
You'll have to come and find me, find me  
  
[Bridge]  
We have problems  
We have problems  
  
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out  
My friends and I have problems  
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out  
My friends and I have problems  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out  
My friends and I have problems  
(4x)  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Outro]  
I wanted to be a better brother, better son  
(3x)
