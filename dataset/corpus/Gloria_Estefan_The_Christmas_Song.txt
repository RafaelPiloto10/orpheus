Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yule tide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like eskimos, everybody knows  
A turkey and some mistletoe help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow will find it hard to sleep tonight  
They know that Santa is on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy to see if reindeer really know how to
fly  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase from kids from one to nintey-two  
Although it's been said many times many ways Merry Christmas to you.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from one to ninety-two  
Alhough it's been said many times mamny ways Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,
Merry Christmas to you  
Merry Christmas to you  
Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
