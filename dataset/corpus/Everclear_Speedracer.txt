Here he comes, here comes Speedracer  
Hes a demon on wheels  
Hes a demon and hes gonna be chasing after someone  
Hes gaining on you so you better look alive  
Hes busy revving up the powerful mach-5  
And when the odds are against him and theres dangerous work  
You can bet your life Speedracer will see it through  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer, go  
  
Hes off and flying as he guns his car around the track  
Hes jamming down the pedal like hes never coming back  
Adventures waiting just ahead!  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Go Speedracer, go  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer, go  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer, go  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer, go  
  
[Repeats]  
Go  
  
Here he comes, here comes Speedracer  
Hes a demon on wheels  
Hes a demon on wheels
