It's our last dance  
And my last chance  
To be holding you tight  
For soon, you'll belong to someone else  
After Tonight  
  
Everyone says  
In a few days  
Everything will be alright  
For you, it may be, but not for me  
After Tonight  
  
All The moments  
That we are together  
Why can't they last, forever and ever  
  
Oh, as I leave you, I'll won't see you  
For teardrops are dulling my side  
And soon you will be a memory  
After Tonight  
  
All The moments  
That we are together  
Why can't they last, forever and ever  
  
Oh, as I leave you, I'll won't see you  
For teardrops are dulling my side  
And soon you will be a memory  
After Tonight
