Candy talks to strangers  
Thinks her life's in danger  
No one gives a damn about her hair  
It's lonely down on track street  
She used to go by Jackie  
The cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers  
Take a number where the blood just barely dried  
  
Wait for something better  
No one behind you  
Watching your shadows  
This feeling won't go  
  
Crooked wheels keep turning  
Children, are you learning  
Acclimatize but don't you lose the plot  
A history of blisters  
Your brothers and your sisters  
Somewhere in the pages we forgot  
  
Take a number Jackie  
Where the blood just barely dried  
You know I'm on your side  
  
Wait for something better  
No one behind you  
Watching your shadows  
You gotta be stronger than the story  
Don't let it blind you  
Rivers of shadow  
This feeling wont go  
  
And the sky is full of dreams  
But you don't know how to fly  
I don't have a simple answer  
But I know that I could answer  
Something better  
  
This feeling won't go  
  
Wait for it [Repeat: x4]
