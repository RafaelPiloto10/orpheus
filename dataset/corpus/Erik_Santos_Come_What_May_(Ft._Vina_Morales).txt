Wish I was your child  
Hold me in your heart  
We could love so free  
And oh we'd never part  
But I'm not a child  
And wishes are just child's play my love  
No I'll never be afraid  
Of who I am  
And who I'm not  
Come what may  
  
Wish I was a bird  
I'd warm you with my wings  
Safe from all the storms  
You know true love can bring  
But I'm not a bird  
And wishes can just fly away  
My love  
And I'll never be afraid  
Of who I am  
And who I'm not  
Come what may  
  
Oh I'm just a moon shining in your eyes  
And you're the stars my love  
No we'll never be afraid  
Of who we are  
And who we're not  
Come what may  
  
Of who we are  
And who we're not  
Come what may  
(2x)
