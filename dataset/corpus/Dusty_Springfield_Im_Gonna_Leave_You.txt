I've been trying hard to see  
Just what you want of me  
But it's no good boy  
I'm setting you free  
'Cause I need you so much more  
With each day that passes by  
You don't seem to care  
It's making me cry  
  
So I'm packing up my bags  
Gonna make my getaway  
Get myself together  
I can't go on this way  
Oh, baby, baby  
I'm gonna leave you  
I'm gonna leave you, baby  
  
This lonely feeling deep in my mind  
'Cause I can't turn back  
If I leave you behind  
But I gotta do it now  
Yes, I gotta turn away  
Hold me one more time  
Don't ask me to stay  
  
It's so hard so say goodbye  
But it's you I'm thinking of  
It would never work out  
I know you're not in love with me  
Oh, baby  
I'm gonna leave you  
Said, I'm gonna leave you  
  
It's over and I'm walking out on you  
You'll never get the chance to feel untrue  
Though I love you  
And I need you  
And I want you  
I'm still walking out on you  
  
Darling, though it hurts me so inside  
I can't take no more  
Gonna lose my mind  
So I'm packing up my bags  
Gonna make my getaway  
Get myself together  
I can't go on this way  
Oh, baby, baby  
I'm gonna leave you  
Said I'm gonna leave you, baby  
Yes I'm gonna leave you, baby  
Oh, I'm gonna leave you baby  
Ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh
