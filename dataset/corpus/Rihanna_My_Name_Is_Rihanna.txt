New on the streets, my name's Rihanna...  
  
I'm a soldier true and true, I know I make it true the storm...  
I really want you to realise, I really want you to put me on...  
I've been searching for some fire to let me be all I can be...  
Music is my inspiration it's the only thing I need...  
  
New on the streets, my name's Rihanna...  
  
So I tryed my best en prayed to god  
My dreams will all turn real...  
Cauze there is a fire burning in my heart  
I hope you all can feel.  
To my music I be faithful you know  
I give my all and all...  
True the good times and the bad times  
And the winter spring and fall...  
  
New on the streets, my name's Rihanna...  
Rihanna... My name is Rihanna yeah...
