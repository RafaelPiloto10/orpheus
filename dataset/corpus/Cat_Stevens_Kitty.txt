I work in the mornin', I work in the night  
The men on the block, they just laugh at me  
I work in the mornin', I work in the night  
The men on the block, they just laugh at me  
  
But when they're wiping their silver spoons  
Palming the men for some bread,  
I'll be laughing  
Way, way out of my head!  
  
When my little kitty gets out,  
There's gonna be a party, a party no doubt  
When my little kitty gets out  
There's gonna be a party  
  
And if my mind isn't coming so fast  
The men on the block say I'm on the brink  
And if my mind isn't coming so fast  
And I ain't so dumb as some people think  
  
'Cause when they're wiping their silver spoons  
Palming the men for some bread  
I'll be laughing, way way out of my head
