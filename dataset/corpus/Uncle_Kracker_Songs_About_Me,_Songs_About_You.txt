You can move it on down the highway  
You can turn another page  
And when you finally get to the old folks home you can finally act your age  
I can make a million dollars  
And you can spend it as fast as it comes  
And you can sit there and cry on a bed full of lies  
And be thinking that you got you some  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Because I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
You can hear me on the radio  
You can see me on TV  
You'll have to dig you a hole just to find your soul  
And get you a word from me  
You can run as fast as a hour glass  
You can fly as high as the wind  
You can be as strong for as long as you like  
But you'll end up right back where you been  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Because I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
I got a song for every occasion  
I been told I got a way with words  
I been told I'd be loved forever  
I been sold on the lies that I heard  
I been bold in my days  
Been gold in my ways  
Been packed up and rolled out  
And thrown out the way  
I belong to a song, for as long as I say  
But I'll always have a song to play  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Cause I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Cause I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
Baby I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
Baby I ain't wrote no songs like that yet
