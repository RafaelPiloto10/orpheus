You can take away my freedom  
But my spirit will run free  
You can take away my vision  
That don't mean that I can't see  
  
Well all I have to say  
Is it doesn't work that way  
What lives inside of me  
Will find its way to be  
It all starts with a dream  
The dawn of a new day  
The God inside of you  
Will always see you through  
So hold on to your dream  
No one can take the dream  
From your heart  
From your heart  
  
You can try to shake my reason  
But you'll never take me down  
You can fill me full of bullets  
But I'm built on solid ground  
  
So all I have to say  
Is I'm not going away  
It's much bigger than me  
God's will will always be  
  
It all starts with a dream  
The dawn of a new day  
The God inside of you  
Will always see you through  
So hold on to your dream  
No one can take the dream  
From your heart  
From your heart  
  
Amen  
Amen  
Amen  
Amen  
  
You will never take my passion  
'Cause it always will remain  
Even if I lose this battle, oh yeah  
It's just blood inside my veins  
  
That's all that I will say  
The dream won't go away  
You can't steal from me  
What God gave me for free  
  
It all starts with a dream  
The dawn of a new day  
The God inside of you  
Will always see you through  
So hold on to your dream  
No one can take the dream  
From your heart  
From your heart  
  
Amen  
Amen
