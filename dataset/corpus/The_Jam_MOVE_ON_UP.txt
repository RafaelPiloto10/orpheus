Hush now child and don't you cry  
Your folks might understand you by and by  
Move on up towards your destination  
You may find from time to time  
Complications  
Bight your lip and take a trip  
Though there may be wet road ahead  
You cannot slip  
So move on up and peace you will find  
Into the steeple of beautiful people  
Where there's only one kind  
  
So hush now child and don't you cry  
Your folks might understand you by and by  
Just move on up and keep on wishing  
Remember your dreams are your only schemes  
So keep on pushing  
  
Take nothing less - not even second best  
And do not obey - you must have your say  
You can past the test  
  
Move on up!
