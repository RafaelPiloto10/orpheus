Nobody gonna take my car, I'm gonna race it to the ground  
Nobody gonna beat my car, it's gonna break the speed of sound  
Ooh it's a killing machine, it's got everything  
Like a driving power, big fat tires and everything  
  
I love it, and I need it, I feed it  
Yeah it's a wild hurricane  
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star  
  
Nobody gonna take my girl I'm gonna keep her to the end  
Nobody gonna have my girl she stays close on every bend  
Ooh she's a killing machine, she's got everything  
Like a moving mouth, body control and everything  
  
I love her, I need her, I seed her  
Yeah she turns me on  
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star  
  
Nobody gonna take my head I got speed inside my brain  
Nobody gonna steal my head now that I'm on the road again  
Ooh I'm in heaven again I've got everything  
Like a moving ground, an open road and everything  
  
I love it, I need it, I bleed it  
Eight cylinders all mine  
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star  
  
Nobody gonna take my car, I'm gonna race it to the ground  
Nobody gonna beat my car, it's gonna break the speed of sound  
Ooh it's a killing machine, it's got everything  
Like a driving power, big fat tires and everything  
  
I'm a highway star, I'm a highway star
