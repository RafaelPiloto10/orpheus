You're no good for me  
Baby you're no good for me  
You're no good for me  
But baby I want you, I want you  
  
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City  
Never was there ever a girl so pretty  
Do you think we'll be in love forever?  
Do you think we'll be in love  
  
Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses  
'Cause we gonna take a ride  
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says  
I've been waiting up all night  
  
Take another drag turn me to ashes  
Ready for another lie?  
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is  
Say it's gonna be all right  
  
Hit me my darling tonight  
I don't know why but I like it  
Gotta get back to the wire  
Give it up give it up, live it up live it up  
  
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City  
Never was there ever a girl so pretty  
Do you think we'll be in love forever?  
Do you think we'll be in love  
  
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City  
Can we get it downlow, down and gritty  
Do you think we'll be in love forever?  
Do you think we'll be in love  
  
Let's take Jesus off the dashboard  
Got enough on his mind  
We both know just what we're here for  
Saved too many times  
  
Maybe I like this rollercoaster  
Maybe it keeps me high  
Maybe this weed it brings me closer  
I could sparkle up your eye  
  
Hit me and tell me you're mine  
I don't know why but I like it  
Scary, my god, you're divine  
Gimme them gimme them dope and diamonds  
  
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City  
Never was there ever a girl so pretty  
Do you think we'll be in love forever?  
Do you think we'll be in love  
  
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City  
Can we get it down low, down and gritty  
Do you think we'll be in love forever?  
Do you think we'll be in love  
  
You're no good for me  
Baby you're no good for me  
You're no good for me  
But baby I want you, I want you  
  
You're no good for me  
Baby you're no good for me  
You're no good for me  
But baby I want you, I want you, I want you  
  
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City  
Never was there ever a girl so pretty  
Do you think we'll be in love forever?  
Do you think we'll be in love
