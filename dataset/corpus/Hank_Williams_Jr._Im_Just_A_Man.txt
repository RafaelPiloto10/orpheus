I'm just a man.I breath and I bleed yes I got feelings I can hear and I can
see  
and you are the lady that brings them out of me making me feel special aww
that's your specialty.  
'cause you let me be me and I let you be you.Hey don't that sound so easy but
that is so hard to do.  
Some things make me feel sad. I feel like I could cry, feeling you next to me,
aww, that makes me feel alright!  
I'm not made of steel and I'm not made of stone I'm not a super hero I'm made
of flesh and bone.  
I'm just a man I breath and I bleed yes I've got feelings.I can hear and I can
see,  
and you are the lady that brings them out of me making me feel special, aww,
that's your specialty!
