Sleepy alligator in the noonday sun  
Sleeping by the river just like he usually done  
Call for his whiskey  
He can call for his tea  
Call all he want to but he  
Can't call me  
  
Oh no  
I been there before  
And I'm not comin' back around  
There no more  
  
Creepy alligator coming all around the bend  
Talking bout the times when we was mutual friends  
I check my memory  
I check it quick yes I will  
I check it running  
Some old kind of trick  
  
Oh no well I  
Been there before  
And I ain't a coming back around  
There no more  
No I'm not  
  
Hung up waiting for a windy day  
Hung up waiting for a windy day  
Tear down the Fillmore,  
Gas the Avalon  
  
Riding down the river in an old canoe  
A bunch of bugs and an old tennis shoe  
Out of the river all ugly and green  
The biggest old alligator that I've ever seen  
Teeth big and pointed and his eyes were bugging out  
Contact the union, put the beggars to route  
Screaming and yelling and licking his chops  
He never runs he just stumbles and hops  
Just out of prison on six dollars bail  
Mumbling at bitches and wagging his tail  
  
Alligator running round my door [Repeat: x4]  
  
Alligator creeping round the corner of my cabin door  
He's coming round to bother me some more
