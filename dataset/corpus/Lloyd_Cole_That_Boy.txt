Even though the skies are blue  
Don't we let the sun shine through  
Because he is a jerk I guess  
Does that make him love you less  
Could you forgive that boy  
Could you find some part of your aching heart  
To forgive that boy  
Could you take him home  
Could you hold him in your arms  
Until the morning comes  
When he's a all cried out  
Could you be that girl  
What if it were you who fell  
Would he have you go to hell?  
Because he is a man that's true  
Now wasn't she a woman too?  
Could you forgive that boy  
Could you find some part of your aching heart  
To forgive that boy  
Could you take him home  
Could you hold him in your arms  
Until the morning comes  
When he's a all cried out  
Could you be that girl?  
Could you forgive that boy  
Could you find some part of your aching heart  
To forgive that boy  
Could you take him home  
Could you hold him in your arms  
Until the morning comes  
When he's a all cried out  
Could you be that girl  
Could you be that girl  
Could you be that girl  
Could you be that girl  
Could you be that girl  
Could you be that girl  
Could you be that girl  
Yeah yeah yeah
