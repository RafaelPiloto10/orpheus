Don't tell me no, babbette  
(I mean duke)  
Don't you tear my dream  
Don't you break my heart  
Darling, we could share a love so fine  
Please, darling, won't you be mine  
Don't tell me no, babbette  
Can't you see that I  
Don't wanna make you cry  
You're the only one like this before  
Please, babbette, it's you I adore  
You I a-do-re  
Oh!  
Oh, how I want you  
I really really want you  
I need your love to guide my way  
Oh! oh! oh!  
Oh, how I need you  
I really really need you  
Don't try to bark  
And I'll take you to the park  
Arf! arf! arf!  
No, babbette,  
Don't you tear my dream  
Don't you break my heart  
Oh-wow-wow-woh!  
We could share a love  
We could share a love...  
We-e-e-e could share a life...  
You know  
Babbette  
I know I had to go on a tour with zappa  
And so marty said to his ever babbette  
Well, you know  
When I need a little bit of your lovin', babbette  
I brought along a whistle around my neck  
So I can call you babbette  
I said wah-ah-aahh!  
Could nobody hear that whistle for babbette?  
Woh! it's a strange dog-whistle  
The only dog that could answer the great things  
Is a german shepherd  
Golden man pinches...  
All marty's women  
You know I said  
No, no, no, babbette  
Share my love  
Don't make me cry-why  
Don't make me cry  
Oh-oh! no-oh, no-oh, no-oh, babbette  
Share my love  
Don't make me  
Don't make me  
Don't make me cry-why-why  
Oh-wow-wow-wow-woh!  
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf!  
Please,  
(that's what marty said to all his dogs)  
(marty, there's a phone call for you!)  
Please!!!
