[Chorus (x4)]:  
I'm A Flirt  
I'm A Pro  
I'm A Freak  
Got A Different Girl Everyday Of The Week  
  
Weezy Verse:  
I'm a blood ima roll I'm a g  
In a different world outerspace with a freak  
But that don't mean neptune on the beat  
Cuz it's new jersey devil from blackwall street  
Weezy f baby from young money baby  
Like the easter bunny baby wanted my candy  
So I gave her my lollipop then she made her body pop  
Then that made me kinda hot  
I'm lying that made me sauna hot  
But please stop sweating me  
Women scream"get in me"  
And what do I do I get in it  
I put on my boot and I step in it  
Right left in em mr eterceden head all the time  
It may sound crazy but I got head on my mind  
Lay it on the line or just lay it on carter!  
And yea I hear you screaming but my name aint harder!  
Girl I'm nasty I do my thing and they coming for me like lassie  
  
[Chorus (x4)]:  
I'm A Flirt  
I'm A Pro  
I'm A Freak  
Got A Different Girl Everyday Of The Week
