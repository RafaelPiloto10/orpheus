How glad the many millions  
Of Toms and Dicks and Williams  
Would be  
To capture me  
  
But you had such persistence  
You wore down my resistance  
I fell  
And it was swell  
  
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo  
How I won you I will never never know  
It's not that you're attractive  
But oh my heart grew active  
When you came into view  
  
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie  
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh  
I never had the least notion  
That I could fall with so much emotion  
Taken from  
Could you coo  
Could you care  
For a cunning cottage we could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you  
  
Could you coo  
Could you care  
For a cunning cottage we could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
Cause I have got a crush,  
My baby, on you
