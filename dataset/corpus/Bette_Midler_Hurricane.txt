You drove into town like the wind.  
Hot on the heels of the rain.  
And in your eyes all is calm.  
That's why they call you Hurricane.  
  
You blow me away.  
You blow me away.  
  
Ooh, what a powerful force  
Howling around in my brain.  
Knocking me down with your touch.  
Mmm, that's why they call you Hurricane.  
  
You blow me away.  
Oh, oh, you blow me away.  
  
Hurricane gonna kill me!  
Honey, you sure do thrill me!  
Swallow me without a sound.  
Hurricane is a-rising,  
Hot and so surprising.  
Forecast warns I'm gonna drown.  
Blow me and swell me on down.  
  
You blow me away.  
You blow me away!  
Ah, ah-mmm, blow me away.  
  
Hurricane gonna kill me!  
Ah, honey you sure do thrill me!  
Swallow me without a sound.  
Hurricane is a-rising,  
Hot and so surprising!  
Forecast warns I'm gonna drown.  
Baby, just go on down!  
  
Leave broken hearts in your wake.  
I ain't the one to complain, no, no, no!  
You blow all the lives that you take.  
Give me a ride, won't you Hurricane?  
  
You blow me away.  
You blow me away.  
Oh, Hurricane, blow me away.  
You, only you, blow me away, ahh.  
  
Hurricane is rising, it keeps surprising me.  
Spinnin' me around and around.  
Don't let me down.  
Hurricane is rising, it keeps surprising me.  
Hurry, hurry, Hurricane.  
  
Tell me you love me.  
He really does love me.  
Spinnin' me around and around.  
Don't let me down.  
Hurricane is rising, it keeps surprising me.  
Hurry, hurry, Hurricane.  
  
Baby, you and I sky high!  
You and I sky high!  
Baby, you and I sky high!  
You and I sky high!  
Destiny is calling me.  
All I want is calling me away.
