They told me to run, but just how far?  
Can I go wearing the black mask of fear?  
The hate in my eyes always gives me away  
The tension building slowly  
Now I lost everything I had in you  
Nothing we shared means a thing  
Without you close to me  
I can't live without you  
  
Breaking the silence of the night  
Can't you hear me screaming?  
I look for your face in the neon light  
You never answer me  
  
There's no direction to my stare  
No more flame burning in my heart anymore  
Quiet, I keep it to myself  
Until the sun sets slowly  
I hear your voice in the evening rain calling  
Nothing will keep us apart  
No more lies and fear  
There's no end to our story  
  
Breaking the silence of the night  
Can't you hear me screaming?  
I look for your face in the neon light  
You never answer  
I could make all the wrong seem right  
If you were by my side  
I'd gather all the tears you cried  
And hide them deep underground  
  
Can't look back, it's just a waste of time  
Can't erase this hate from my eyes  
  
Breaking the silence of the night  
Through the streets I'm screaming  
Looking for you in the neon light  
Why don't you answer me?  
Breaking the silence with my cries  
Can't you hear me screaming?  
We could make all this wrong seem right  
But you never answer me
