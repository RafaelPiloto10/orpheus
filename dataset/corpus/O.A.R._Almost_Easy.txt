Pick it up, don't put it down  
Do you recognize the feeling that I'm passing around  
Like your all lit up, feet on the floor  
Everywhere you go feel like you've been there before  
  
It's almost easy  
To believe this is how it could be  
Just to easy  
To see it could happen to me  
  
What a feeling when it takes control of you  
Everything you need is back ten fold  
Like a feeling do it comes and goes  
Then it's gone  
  
Oh no  
  
Then the rain came knocked me sideways  
Hope the wind will break my fall  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
It's just getting old  
  
When the rain just knocked me sideways  
I don't know what I don't know  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
It's just getting old  
  
Damn it's getting old  
  
I'm all locked up. I mean I did it again  
Couldn't recognize the feeling that you tried to fit in  
So I might kick back  
I think I'm taking my time  
Underneath the sun without a cloud in the sky  
  
It's almost easy  
It's got to easy  
To see it could happen to me  
  
What a feeling when it takes control of you  
Everything you need is back ten fold  
But like a feeling do it comes and goes then it's  
Gone  
  
Oh no  
  
Then the rain came knocked me sideways  
Hope the wind will break my fall  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
It's just getting old  
  
When the rain just falls on Sunday  
I don't know what I don't know  
Spend my days looking down a highway  
It's just getting old  
Damn it's getting old  
  
You told me you'd break my heart  
Sounds like something you say  
When you knew it from the start  
And it didn't matter anyway  
  
You told me you'd break my heart  
I didn't believe you then  
So why would I hear you now?  
You're undecided  
  
I know the rain may knock you sideways  
Hope the wind will break your fall  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
Damn, it's getting old  
  
When the rain just falls on Sunday  
I don't know what I don't know  
Spend my life looking down a highway  
Now it's getting old  
  
When the rain just knocks you sideways  
I've been lost since I don't know  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
It's just getting old  
  
Oh, how it gets old.  
Damn it's getting old
