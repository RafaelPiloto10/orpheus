Girl, Me and the Lods been friends for a mighty long time  
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)  
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
Up in the street and misguided never payed attention  
So I got my soul devine, player's soul decided  
to let my soul confide with the lights of him  
Who the father, my bread and my water  
I never bought a cue and into this (?)  
Down in my world are you going let you hypocrites  
It'll take your life to be a Christian man  
I hope you learn, everything else  
Is in vein so you're bound to burn  
Gonna break your bone  
I'm in a war don't let this life game over-rule  
Trying take control of you  
That's all the devil do  
God was in Jesus, God is in us  
But God ain't in the barrel of that pistol that you bust  
You can play this game wrong, you gotta take it how it goes,  
Is there ever a feeling for living if the body's gone  
I never understood why what can make a man cry,  
It can make a man strong when nobody's on his side  
  
Girl, (girl) Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)  
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind  
(Never crossed my mind, never crossed my mind, oooh)  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
Back and forth, night and day, you repeat the same scene  
Standing at the pool a bit, time to repent again  
Mostly men have a gun just put that down on circle purpose  
When the poo of the world, got me standin by the circle  
Agitate you, yes it does, this is what you though was love  
Only name, same to be lust, mixed emotions make you want to bust  
Mamma tryin, children cryin, dad outta work, welfare lying  
Prejudice, always see, the bottom of the barrel  
Falling down on my knees, heavenly father, here we go on knowing  
That we get to heaven, there's gonna be some open arms,  
Judgment was man-made, not a [..], and this I recorded,  
But I didn't live the party, but I thank that my heart beat,  
Gotta make me, oh sure Jesus I don't know if there's a hell,  
But I know I've whitnessed hell here, all I do is dwell here  
Trying not to trail here, saying too much will get you knocked off or locked
up in jail here  
Tell me do you smell fear, knowing that we so near,  
Trying to take the voices of the truth, out the youth ear,  
And if you late a time frame, you play all kind of mind games,  
I ain't put my life on the line for a damn thing  
  
Girl, Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)  
And Girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin' you
has never crossed my mind  
(Never crossed my mind)  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
I can never make it, I can never ever make it  
Without you baby  
Cause you've been my best friend  
Girl,  
When everybody turned their back on me,  
You were there when I fell down on my knees  
And I give you all, all of me,  
And every part of me, oooowoooo,  
  
Girl, me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
(For long time, such a mighty long time)  
And girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin you
has never crossed my mind  
(Never crossed my mind)  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
I'm a live, I will never leave o no no  
When the people say, c'mon and go with me  
'Cause I will never leave you, and you've been my best friend  
nobody understand, but they can't look inside of me,  
o yeah..  
[fade out]
