[Verse 1]  
They say sing what you know  
But I've sung what they want  
Some folks do what they're told  
But baby this time I won't  
When I look through that door  
I know the truth from lie  
Some things I've done before I can't justify  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
There are kings in my past  
Things no one can be proud of  
But I stand in the light I've cast  
And turn away from any lack of love  
Oh, when I walked through that door  
I say here I go  
You see me and nothing more  
I'm singing what I know  
  
[Chorus]  
I know better  
I know better  
  
[Verse 2]  
Legend is just a name  
I know better than to be so proud  
I won't drink in all this fame  
I'll take more love than I'm allowed  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I won't hide or cut it off from where it came  
My history has brought me to this place  
This power and the color of my face  
  
[Chorus]  
And I know better  
I know better  
  
[Bridge]  
I'll rise from the floor if I don't win  
I'll bust open that door so let me in  
And if music chooses me to sing I let her  
I'll sing what I know, yes  
  
[Chorus]  
I know better, oh  
I know better, yes  
I know better  
I know better
