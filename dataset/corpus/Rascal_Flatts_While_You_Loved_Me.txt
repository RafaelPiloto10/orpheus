If I ever write the story of my life  
Don't be surprised if you're where it begins  
Girl, I'd have to dedicate every line on every page  
To the memories we made, while you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived, oh how I lived  
(I lived) While you loved me  
  
I'd start with chapter one, love innocent and young  
As the morning sun on a new day  
Even though I know the end, Well I'd do it all again  
'Cause I got a lifetime in, while you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived, oh how I lived  
(I lived) While you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived, oh how I lived  
(I lived) While you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived, oh how I lived  
(I lived) While you loved me
