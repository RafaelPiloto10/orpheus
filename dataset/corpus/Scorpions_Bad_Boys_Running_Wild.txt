Out in the streets  
The dogs are on the run  
The cats are all in heat  
Out in the streets  
Snakes are all around you  
Dirty rats are on their way  
They control you and they'll make you play  
  
Out in the night  
Glaring eyes in darkness  
Tigers want to fight  
Out in the night  
Spiders all around you  
Spinning webs and make you pray  
Tie you up and you can't get away  
  
Bad boys running wild  
If you don't play along with their games  
Bad boys running wild  
And you better get out of their way  
  
Out in the streets  
The dogs are on the run  
The cats are all in heat  
Out in the night  
Spiders all around you  
Spinning webs and make you pray  
Tie you up and you can't get away  
  
Bad boys running wild  
If you don't play along with their games  
Bad boys running wild  
And you better get out of their way  
  
Bad boys running wild  
If you don't play along with their games  
Bad boys running wild  
And you better get out of their way  
Get out of their way
