  
Spread your wings  
Flying over frozen mountains  
Crystal rivers and geizer fountains  
????  
Float with the breeze and cross seas to shores  
Deserts, cactus, and tumbleweed  
Irish meadows and fields of green  
Glide through cities of brick and stone  
Broken arrows of ancient roan  
Fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Won't you come fly with me?  
Come on and fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Everybody  
Haunted woodlands, forbidden trails  
?????  
Castle halls, underwater falls  
Pyramids crumble when nature calls  
Skies of blue become black with stars  
Lightning bugs kept within jars  
Sand moves slowly through the hour glass  
Wings spread, we can all fly last  
Everybody come and fly away  
You must believe that you can fly away  
Spread your wings and come and fly away  
Just believe that you will fly away  
Rock will melt, coal crystalize  
The clouds and skylines materialize  
Wings spread take flights over northern lights  
Wolves howl over blood-red moonlit nights  
We're Kings and Queens within our dreams  
The sky rains down into ruby rings  
Oceans river lakes and ponds  
Lions unicorns birds and ???  
Fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Won't you come fly with me?  
Come on and fly with me  
Come on and fly with me  
Everybody  
Martians travel to the land of Mecca  
Atlantis hidden deep under forever  
Iceland golden tombs of Pharaoh kings  
Rainbows trickelin diamond rings  
Voices cry now echo carries  
Angels dance with the cryptic fairies  
Gates of Afterlife open swiftly  
Stay if you wish...  
But come fly with me  
Everybody come and fly away  
(fly with me, come on)  
You must believe that you can fly away  
(we could fly together, come on)  
Spread your wings and come and fly away

Just believe that you will fly away  
(we can fly together)  
I'm hoping your imagination (imagination)  
Beyond anything conceivable (anything conceivable)  
Allow the unbelievable (unbelievable)  
To take complete control of your soul (let it take control)  
Levitate 3 feet above ground level (3 feet above ground level and raising)  
Allow yourself to raise and amaze  
Drift higher and higher into the moon's rays, come on  
Everybody come and fly away  
(fly with me, come on)  
You must believe that you can fly away  
(we could fly together, come on)  
Spread your wings and come and fly away
