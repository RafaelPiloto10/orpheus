See, I can't scare anybody  
They come from miles around  
To laugh in my face and eat in my field  
  
Said a scarecrow swinging on a pole  
To some blackbirds sittin' on a fence  
"Oh, the Lord gave me a soul,  
But forgot to give me common sense."  
  
Said the blackbirds, "Well, well, well.  
What the thunder would you do with common sense?"  
Said the scarecrow, "Would be pleasin'  
Just to reason out the reason  
Of the wishes and the whyness and the whence."  
  
If I had an once of common sense...  
(If he had an ounce of common sense...)  
  
("Well, what would you do Scarecrow?")  
I would while away the hours  
Conferrin' with the flowers  
Consultin' with the rain  
And my head I'd be scratchin'  
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'  
If I only had a brain  
  
I'd unravel every riddle  
For every individle  
In trouble or in pain  
With the thoughts I'd be thinkin'  
I could be another Lincoln  
If I only had a brain  
  
Oh, I could tell you why  
The ocean's near the shore  
I could think of things I never thought before  
Then I'd sit and think some more  
  
I would not be just a nothin'  
My head all full of stuffin'  
My heart all full of pain  
I would dance and by merry  
Life would be a dingle derry  
If I only had a brain  
  
If I only had a brain...  
(If he only had a brain...)  
  
I could tell you why  
The ocean's near the shore  
I could think of things I never thought before  
And then I'd sit and think some more  
  
Yeah, it would be kind of pleasin'  
To reason out the reason  
For the things I can't explain  
Then perhaps I'd deserve you  
And be even worthy of you  
If I only had a brain  
  
I could dance and by merry  
Life would be a dingle derry  
If I only had a brain  
  
If I only had a brain...  
(If he only had a brain...)
