You're So Beautiful  
  
  
Girl, there's a secret in your eyes  
A look this man can not ignore  
Girl, I don't know what's on your mind  
So you must know I want you more  
Like a trip to paradise  
You're so beautiful  
But I think you're really mine  
I gotta tell the world  
You are so beautiful  
You make my heart a fool  
When I take you in my arms  
Your kisses sweet delight  
  
They feel so wonderful  
You're making this a magic night  
Now, with your body burning mine  
I don't mean to drink the wine  
I'm not so high .................  
There's something so unreal  
Now, I can tell you how I feel  
A fantasy you made come true
