Everyone's here, talking and dancing. There havin' a good time,  
  
But its hard to smile when my friends all know I got you on my mind.  
  
Hey I'm not in the mood to hear another fast dancin' song. I don't care if
it's old country gold or new country soul.  
  
I've had enough of this rock-n-roll.  
  
Let's keep the heart in the country, 'cause that's where it should always be.  
  
Don't get me wrong I like to party, but tonight I must sit this one out you
see,  
  
Because the one I love is leavin', bartender bring me whiskey please,  
  
Let's keep the heart in the country, 'cause love has torn the heart right out
of me.  
  
Now that was great, please thank the band for playing that song.  
  
It was nice and smooth like this Kentucky brew that I am sipping on  
  
Oh how I'll miss her, but I got my music and now I'll get along,  
  
I don't feel bad now you see, misery loves company in a country song.  
  
Let's keep the heart in the country, 'cause that's where it should always be,  
  
Don't get me wrong I like to party but tonight I must sit this one out you
see.  
  
'cause the one I love is leavin', bartender, bring more whiskey please,  
  
And let's keep the heart in the country 'cause love torn the heart right out
of me,  
  
And lets keep the heart in the country, 'cause love has torn the heart right
out of me.
