Watching the people on the street today she couldn't help but smile  
Watchin' the town go walking by all shaded eyes and alibis  
Strange how much pain you can hide away beneath a well-cut suit  
This is the day she walks away  
  
And the lights of the city pushin' a good time  
Asking her out tonight  
But she's saving her money for a better life  
  
She's got a map of the world  
Pinned up on her wall  
She's got a map of the world  
She's gonna go and see it all  
She's gonna see it all  
  
Watchin the people on the street today  
Such a lonely sight  
'Swore she could see their dreams go by  
All cars and stars and buy buy buy  
Runnin on empty Runnin to stand still  
No time for their own lives  
Sleepwalking through the danger signs  
  
And it feels a little scary  
A little runaway  
Letting go of all she's done  
And the lights of the city, well they're all singin'  
Buy some of this, c'mon  
But when you lie to yourself  
You lie to everyone  
  
She's got a map of the world  
Pinned up on her wall  
She's got a map of the world  
She's gonna go and see it all  
She's gonna see it all  
  
She'll empty the sand from her shoes  
In Paradise  
Sail out across the bay  
She'll dance under an island sky  
Until the break of day  
  
She's got a map of the world  
Pinned up on her wall  
It's such a beautiful world  
Glistening and magical  
  
She's got a map of the world  
Shining away in her mind  
Colouring-in her life  
This is the day she walks  
She's gonna see it all  
She's gonna breathe it all  
Paris London New York  
She's gonna see it all
