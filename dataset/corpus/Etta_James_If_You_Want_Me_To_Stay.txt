Alright!  
If you want me to stay, I'll be around today  
Available for you to see  
I'm about to go and then you'll know  
For me to stay, I got to be me  
You'll never be in doubt, that's what it's all about  
You can't take me for granted and smile  
Count the days I'm gone, forget reachin' me by phone  
'Cause I promise I'll be gone for a while  
And when you see me again, I hope that you have been  
The kind of person you really are now  
You got to get it straight, how could I ever be late  
When you're my man takin' up my time  
How could I ever allow? I guess I wonder how  
Could you get out a pocket for fun  
When you know that you're number two  
Number one gonna be number one  
I'll be good to you, I wish I could  
I get this message over to you now, oh baby  
When you see me again, I hope that you have been  
The kind of person you really are now  
I'll be so good, I wish, I could  
Get the message over to you now  
And if you want me to stay, baby, if you want me to stay  
If you want me to stay, I'll be around today  
Available for you to see  
I'm about to go and then you'll know  
For me to stay, I got to be me  
You'll never be in doubt, that's what it's all about  
You can't take me for granted and smile  
If you want me to stay  
If you want me to stay, hey babe  
If you need me to stay  
If you want me to stay, baby  
Count the days I'm gone, baby  
Count the days I'm gone, baby  
Count the days I'm gone, yeah  
Yeah, baby, I'll stay around if you want me, oh baby  
If you want me, I'll be around
