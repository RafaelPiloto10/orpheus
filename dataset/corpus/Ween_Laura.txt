Dud'n dud'n dud'n dud'n, dud'n dud'n dud'n dud'n  
  
The grain bag sits on the chair, and why the hell am I with ya?  
And if you told me that it wasn't there, why the hell am I with ya?  
You know I really don't care, and why the hell now with ya?  
I told my mommy that it was ok, and why the hell now with ya?  
  
Laura, Laura  
Oh baby I cut myself  
  
And if you threw the garbage away, why the hell am I with ya?  
And if you knew you wanted to stay, then why the hell now with ya?  
Little Eddie Dingle is going away, and why the hell now with ya?  
Somebody wants to come and play, and why the hell am I with ya?  
  
Laura, Laura  
  
You know something? I've got somethin', I've got somethin'  
I've got somethin' for all the people in the world
