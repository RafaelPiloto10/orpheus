One night in the West Virginia mountains I got stranded in the deepening snow  
I found important house and took a small room no TV magazines or radio  
I've stood and watched the snow fall past the window  
And as a traveling man would sometimes do  
I've picked up the Bible and looked through it I found the stock of letters
tied in blue  
The letters had been left there by a young girl there were ten and as I read
the first  
I found that they were from a boy in Detroit  
Who'd sent for her as soon as he got work  
The first one mentioned her expected baby  
The one and two and three were much the same  
The fourth and fifth said that he might send to get her  
The sixth and seventh offered her his name  
The eighth and ninth were weeks apart in postmark  
They were short and asked about her help  
The tenth one was a tear stained on the pages  
Said that he had married someone else  
Next morning I felt guilty when I checked out  
As the highway people cleared away the snow  
I asked about the girl who used to live there  
They said she passed away three weeks ago  
Well I kept the letters but I never read them  
Oh but somewhere up in Detroit there's a man  
Who heard what happened down in West Virginia  
And we're the only two who understand
