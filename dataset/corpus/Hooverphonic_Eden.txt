Did you ever think of me  
As your best friend  
  
Did I ever think of you  
I'm not complaining  
  
I never tried to feel  
I never tried to feel this vibration  
I never tried to reach  
I never tried to reach your eden  
  
Did I ever think of you  
As my enemy  
  
Did you ever think of me  
I'm complaining  
  
I never tried to feel  
I never tried to feel this vibration  
I never tried to reach  
I never tried to reach your eden
