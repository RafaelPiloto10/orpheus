Open up your eyes looking at the people  
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smiling  
Open up your eyes looking at the people  
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smiling smiling  
  
Wake in the morning  
Look out of my window  
Down on the street as the people pass by  
Wonderful faces awake but asleep  
Rushing around with appointments to keep  
Rushing around with appointments to keep  
  
Bald-headed banker with bowler on head  
Credit for debit but still in the red  
Schoolgirl in pigtails and freckly nose  
Trying to remember her Latin prose  
Trying to remember her Latin prose  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
Isn't it surprising what you'll find  
  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
What are they thinking  
What's on their minds  
Are they all looking for something to find  
Decreasing circles running around  
Searching for something they've already found  
Searching for something they've already found  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open up your eyes looking at the people
