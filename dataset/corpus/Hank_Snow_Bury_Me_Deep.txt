Dig down deep where the ground is cold  
(Dark and cold and all alone)  
Tired of life all alone and  
Blue happiness I never knew  
In this cold world  
There's nothing for me now  
Won't you hear my only plea  
And bury me deep  
Where the sun doesn't shine  
Because sunshine I've never known  
Dig down deep where the ground is cold  
Dark and cold and all alone  
You were my love  
Only love I knew  
And tonight I find I can't have you  
Trouble and tears are all that I see  
Now you are gone please hear my plea  
Bury me deep where the sun...
