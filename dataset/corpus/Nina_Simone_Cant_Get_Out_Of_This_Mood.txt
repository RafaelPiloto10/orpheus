All day long before my eyes come little visions of you,  
They shouldn't, they mustn't, but they do.  
Can't get out of this mood,  
Can't get over this feeling,  
Can't get out of this mood,  
  
Last night your lips were appealing,  
The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,  
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.  
Can't get out of this dream  
What a fool to dream of you,  
Twasn't part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you,  
But now I'm saying it, I'm playing it dumb,  
Can't get out of this mood,  
Heartbreak here I come.  
  
I can't get over this feeling,  
Last night your lips were appealing,  
The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,  
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.  
What a fool to dream of you,  
To sigh and tell you that I love you,  
But now I'm playing it, now I'm playing it dumb,  
I can't get out of this mood,  
Heartbreak, heartbreak here I come.
