Lullaby and good night, with roses bestride,  
With lilies bedecked. 'neath Baby's sweet bed.  
May thou sleep, may thou rest, may thy slumber be blest.  
May thou sleep, may thou rest, may thy slumber be blest.  
Lullaby and good night, thy mother's delight.  
Bright angels around, my darling, shall guard.  
They will guide thee from harm, thou art safe in my arms.  
They will guide thee from harm, thou art safe in my arms.  
Good evening, good night, covered with roses,  
With tiny fingernails hidden, slipping under the blankets,  
Tomorrow morning, if God wills, you will wake again.  
Tomorrow morning, if God wills, you will wake again.  
God evening, good night, watched over by tiny angels  
Who show the little Christ Child's tree in dreams,  
Sleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradise.  
Sleep now, blessed and sweet, look at dream's paradise.
