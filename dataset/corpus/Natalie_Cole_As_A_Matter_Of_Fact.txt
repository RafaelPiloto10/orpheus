Blow daddy, oh, yeah  
Here we are, standing at the hard line  
We made it last this long  
The two of us, together since the first time  
And I believe our love is still strong  
Seems love has a funny way  
Well, it can come or go or it can choose to stay  
But love says what it has to say  
Matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter of fact)  
I love you  
(Oh, as a matter of fact)  
And I love that you love me back  
As a matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter, a matter)  
Some said we wouldn't make it this far  
But they don't talk no more  
(No more)  
The love we share is precious as a big star  
And what we have's what others hope for  
Seems love has a funny way  
Well, it can come or go or it can choose to stay  
But love says what it has to say  
Matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter of fact)  
I need you  
(Oh, as a matter of fact)  
And I'm glad that you need me back  
As a matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter, a matter)  
Mm, matter of fact, yeah  
(Ooh as a matter of fact)  
I want you  
(Yeah, as a matter of fact)  
And I can't tell you more than that  
As a matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter, matter)  
Aw, blow, daddy  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, seems love has a funny way  
Well, it can come and go or it can choose to stay  
But love says what it has to say  
Matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter of fact)  
I love you  
(Oh, as a matter of fact)  
Yeah, and I love that you love me back  
As a matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter of fact)  
Ooh, ooh, baby  
Matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter of fact)  
I need you  
(Yeah, as a matter of fact)  
And I'm glad that you need me right back  
As a matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter, a matter)  
Ooh baby  
(Ooh, as a matter of fact)  
Loving you baby  
(Oh, as a matter of fact)  
And I love that you love me back  
As a matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter, matter)  
Matter of fact  
(Ooh, as a matter of fact)  
Ooh, matter of fact  
(Yeah, as a matter of fact)
