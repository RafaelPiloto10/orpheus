Well, a travelin' man's affliction makes it hard to settle down  
But I'm stuck here in the flatlands while my heart is homeward bound  
Goin' back, I'm too tired to roam, Loma Prieta my mountain home  
On the hills above Santa Cruz, in the place where I spent my youth  
Well it was Neal Cassady that started me to travelin'  
All the stories that were told, I believed them every one  
And it's a windin' road I'm on you understand  
And no time to worry 'bout tomorrow when you're followin' the sun  
  
Papa don't you worry now and mama don't you cry  
Sweet woman don't forsake me, I'll be comin' by and by  
  
Goin' back, I'm too tired to roam, Loma Prieta my mountain home  
On the hills above Santa Cruz, in the place where I spent my youth
