Lately I've been feeling low  
A remedy is what I'm seeking  
Take a taste of what's below  
Come away to something better  
What I want is what I've not got  
But what I need is all around me  
Reaching searching never stop  
And I'll say...  
  
If you could keep me floating just for a while  
'Til I get to the end of this tunnel... Mummy  
If you could keep me floating just for a while  
I'll get back to you  
  
Take a Jimi Thing  
Just to keep me swingin'  
I'd like to show you what's inside  
I shouldn't care if you don't like it  
Brother chaos rules all about  
Sometimes I walk there  
Sometimes, God knows, I take a bus there  
I should't care I shouldn't care bereaved as  
I'm feeling  
  
Day is gone I'm on my back  
Staring up at the ceiling  
I take a drink sit back relax  
Smoke my mind makes me feel  
Better for a short time  
What I want is what I've not got  
What I need is all around me  
Reaching searching never stop  
And I'll say  
  
If you could keep me floating just for a while  
'Til I get to the end of this tunnel... Mummy  
If you could keep me floating just for a while  
I'll get back to you
