Living in my world  
  
So many riffs you have with your girl  
But I'm here to hear all your problems and tell you I understand,  
Falling in and out of love with her now. As I watch all I can see... Is you
being with me,  
I know you feel like a fool, being used, paying dues,  
Afraid of your loving is taken advantage of,  
You don't have to live a life full of strife, take my hand and i'll be the
leader  
You can depend on me  
  
Chorus  
You can be living in my world, sharing my time, being the one,  
Stare in the face of love, long enough to see,  
You can be living in my world, you'll never shed another tear,  
And i'll never stop the love, I'll give you all of me  
  
With open eyes and ears I can hear, hear your crys come from the inside,  
But baby its alright, you can just let it go, I'm your friend  
Sitting here, willing to listen... Oh baby see that you don't have to live,  
Like you do, come with me be my king i'll be by your side,  
Just let me know what to do, only one goal in mind,  
Take your heart, share with mine, make you believe, so you can see that  
  
Chorus  
  
It only takes one look to see,  
That she's a fool and you should know,  
Come with me, and I will be... All that you need,  
Theres no dreams we can't make real,  
And theres no feelings we can't feel,  
I'm just... Wanting you... Needing you.. Don't you know  
  
Chorus
