I did my best to please you  
But my best was never good enough  
Somehow you're only able to see  
All I am not  
Did you ever look behind?  
Aren't you afraid of the pieces you'll find?  
I have failed you  
But you have failed me too  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
In your life, why didn't you ever try?  
I close my eyes as I walk the thin line  
Between love and hate  
For the person with the same blood  
In his veins  
You show no regrets  
About all the things you did or said  
I have failed you  
But believe me you failed me too  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
In your life, why didn't you ever try?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?
