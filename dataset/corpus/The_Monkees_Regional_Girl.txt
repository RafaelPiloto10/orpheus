She's a regional girl  
Come to the big city  
Give it a whirl  
  
She thinks that she can make it  
She thinks that she can take it  
I think she's gonna end up makin' burgers in a basement  
She's a regional girl  
  
He's a regional guy  
Come to the big city give it a try  
He wants to be a mover  
Yea, he wants to shake it up  
  
I think he's gonna end up pourin' Pepsi in a cup  
'Cause it's a regional lie  
It's a regional lie

Try to keep the little buggers playin' with your pants  
A singin' Whoa oh oh oh

The grass is always green  
And the coke is purified  
You want to hit the big time  
Yea, you want to strike it rich  
I think you're gonna end up bakin' burgers for some bitch
