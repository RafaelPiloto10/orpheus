Now I'm gonna tell you, so you'll understand  
How it all got started, how it all begin  
God made the heavens, God made the earth  
Made a man and a woman out of blood, sweat and dirt  
And He looked around the neighborhood  
And He said to His self, "This is good"  
  
God made the rivers and the mountains with his hands  
God made the wind to blow the shifting sands  
He put the fishes in the, in the deep blue sea  
Filled up the garden with flowers and the trees  
And God looked around the neighborhood  
And He said to His self, "This is good"  
  
But the devil he was jealous, took the apple in his hand  
The devil tempted woman and woman tempted man  
God, He mourned and the tears rolled down His face  
It broke His heart to see His children fall from grace  
And on the seventh day they say, "God rested"  
But you know that ain't the truth  
  
Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue  
Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue  
  
The blues is been around ever since that day  
Everybody gets the blues, everybody got to pay  
For the wicked things we do  
And what we put each other through  
And on the seventh day they say, "God rested"  
But you know that ain't the truth  
  
Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue  
Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue  
God made the blue
