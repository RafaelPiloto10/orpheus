She's got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
How can she look so sad when the music is playing so loud  
Maybe she's waitin' on someone who'll make her feel proud  
She's got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
I took a chance and I asked her to dance but she put me down  
While I was a lookin' for a big ole smile I found a big ole frown  
So loving looking so calm and she's so well endowed  
She's got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
Somebody hurt her, I don't understand it's so wrong  
Why is she here, she's mixing her tears with my happy song  
She looks like an angel who just came down out of the clouds  
But she's got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
I took a chance and I asked her to dance but she put me down  
While I was a lookin' for a big ole smile I found a big ole frown  
So loving looking so calm and she's so well endowed  
She's got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd  
She's got to be the loneliest girl in the crowd
