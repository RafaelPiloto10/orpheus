Trust in me my tongue is weeping  
Words of love you must be needing  
Trust me for the only reason  
That our love will never weaken  
  
Trust in me as someone you love  
Trust in me a little closer  
Trust the soul of every soldier  
Trust in me each beat taps lightly  
  
On your door so now invite me  
Trust in me as someone you love  
  
Someone that you love  
Someone that you trust  
Someone to love you more and more  
  
Trust in me the words are woven  
Words of love can not be broken  
Trust before a night together  
The secret's ours in trust forever  
Trust in me as someone you love
