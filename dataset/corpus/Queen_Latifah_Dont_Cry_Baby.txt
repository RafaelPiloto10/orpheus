Don't cry, don't cry, baby  
Don't cry, baby  
Dry your eyes  
And let's be sweethearts again  
  
Oh, 'cause you know  
You know I didn't mean  
To ever treat you so mean  
Come on, come on sweetheart  
Let's try it over again  
  
And oh, don't cry, don't cry, baby  
Don't cry, don't cry  
Dry your eyes  
And let's be sweethearts again  
  
And oh, 'cause you know  
You know I didn't mean  
To ever treat you so mean  
Come on, come on sweetheart  
And let's try it over again  
  
Oh, don't cry, don't cry, baby  
Oh, don't cry, baby, don't cry  
Dry your eyes  
And let's be sweethearts again  
  
Oh, don't cry, don't cry  
Don't cry, don't cry  
I'm so sorry, baby  
Don't cry  
  
And don't cry  
I got you right here  
I wanna keep you near  
Forever my dear, baby, baby
