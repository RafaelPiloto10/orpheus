Well evening fell just like a star  
Left a trail across the sky  
You spit as you walked out the door  
If this is love were crazy  
As we fight like cats and dogs  
I just know theres got to be more  
So please call me, baby  
Wherever you are  
Its too cold to be out walking the streets  
We do crazy things when were wounded  
Everyones a bit insane  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Walking in the rain  
  
Ill admit I aint no angel  
Ill admit I aint no saint  
I'm selfish and cold but youre blind  
If I exercise my devils  
Well my angels may leave too  
And theyre so hard to find  
So please call me, baby  
Wherever you are  
Its too cold to be out walking the streets  
We do crazy things when were wounded  
Everyones a bit insane  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Walking in the rain  
  
Were always at each others throats  
You know it drives me up the wall  
Most of the time blowin off steam  
I wish to hell youd leave me  
Wish to God youd stay  
Lifes so different than in our dream  
Please call me, baby  
Wherever you are  
Its too cold to be out walking the streets  
We do crazy things when were wounded  
Everyones a bit insane  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Walking in the rain  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Out walking in the rain
