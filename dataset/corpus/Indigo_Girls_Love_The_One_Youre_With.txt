Love the one youre with  
When youre down and confused  
And you don't remember who youre talking to  
Consentration gonna slip away  
Cause your baby is so far away  
  
Honey theres a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
If you can't be with the one you love  
Honey love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
  
Don't be angry and don't be sad  
don't sit crying over bad times youve had  
Cause theres a girl sitting next to you  
And shes just waiting for something to do  
  
Honey theres a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
If you can't be with the one you love  
Honey love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do

Turn your heartache right into joy  
Theres a girl honey youre a boy  
Well you get it together gonna make it nice  
You aint gonna need any more advice  
  
Honey theres a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
If you can't be with the one you love  
Honey love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Do do do do do do do do
