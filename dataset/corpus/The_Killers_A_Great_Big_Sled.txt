This snowman is shaping up to be an eight but not out of ten  
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down  
Wondering when they break though these chains  
But little boys have action toys for brains  
I'm living proof, it can last a long time, now the girls up  
The street are innocent and sweet while their all in bed  
They got their makeup and dreams of wonderland  
Sprinkled inside their heads soon they will change  
But tonight Hollywood hills never seem so strange  
Their mothers pray it will last a long time  
I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow  
I wanna relearn what I already know  
Just let me take flight dressed in red  
Through the night on a great big sled  
I wanna wish you merry Christmas  
Ho, ho, ho  
Now the boys are all grown up  
And there working their fingers to the bone  
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend  
You know they still can't be alone  
I've been raking my brain  
With thoughts of peace and love  
How on earth did we get so mixed up  
I pray to God, it don't last a long time  
I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow  
I wanna relearn what I already know  
Just let me take flight dressed in red  
Through the night on a great big sled  
I hear the sound of bells  
There's something on the roof  
I wonder what this night will bring  
I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow  
I wanna relearn what I already know  
Just let me take flight dressed in red  
Through the night on a great big sled  
I wanna wish you merry Christmas  
Can't do that  
I wanna wish you merry Christmas  
Can't do that
