Only when I dream  
Only when I dream  
  
To everyday there's a history  
To every love that's lost there is tragedy  
I saved the vision of you in my head  
I watched a new universe being born raised in breath  
In the calm of my bed  
  
Some might say it's over now  
I don't believe them  
If I only got to you  
I'd prove them right  
  
(Only when I dream) I hear you, I'm near you  
I hold you close to me  
(Only when I dream) I touched you and I breath you  
I feel you deep inside me  
  
Things were never easy for me  
And the temple we built stayed sacred and free  
I came looking for more self-esteem  
All I found was your voice on the answering machine  
Simple and clear  
  
Some might say it's truthful gone  
I don't believe them  
If I could only talk to you  
I'd prove I'm right  
  
(Only when I dream) I hear you and I'm near you  
I hold you close to me  
(Only when I dream) I touched you and I breath you  
I feel you deep inside me  
  
I tried to catch a butterfly  
I tried to make a summer sky  
Heal me  
Rain exploded in my face  
Seems to fade without a trace  
Heal me  
  
(Only when I dream) I hear you and I'm near you  
I hold you close to me  
(Only when I dream) I touched you and I breath you  
I feel you deep inside me
