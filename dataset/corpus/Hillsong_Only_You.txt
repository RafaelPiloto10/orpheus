Verse  
On the mountain  
In the valley  
Everywhere I go  
You are with me  
Right beside me  
You never let me go  
The Messiah  
The Almighty  
Saviour of my soul  
Saviour of my soul  
  
In the daylight  
In the shadow  
Your faithfulness untold  
You surround me  
And protect me  
Guiding as I go  
The Messiah  
The Almighty  
Saviour of my soul  
Saviour of my soul  
  
Pre-Chorus  
There is nowhere I can run  
There is nowhere I can hide  
And if I ever lose my way  
You're calling out my name  
You're calling out my name  
  
Chorus  
And only You can save us Jesus  
Only You can heal us Jesus  
Only You can fix this Jesus  
Only You Jesus  
  
Bridge  
The boroughs have been opened  
The broken have been chosen  
The city is becoming alive in You
