Yeah, aha, give it all you got to make sense, we pump it  
I'm so blessed with the music, love it  
We gotta dance all night, no question  
... It's so important on  
For the party corms to the roof  
Shawty don't stop on the dj roof  
Baby it's four blocks, let go, get lose  
For em to get make hot, just make a move!  
Celebrate, we don't hesitate  
It's plenty girls in the park, don't regulate  
To the right, to the left that I make you shake

What a... I like your body, body  
Make me so naughty, naughty  
When I stretch you like pilates  
Hey shawty!  
  
Parapapa parapapa parapapa

Let's get this party rocking now,  
Show you how to do it when...  
Get it backed up with a brand new sound  
I know how to make the room get extra crowd, extra crowd!  
Run this town, better... This ship...  
I'll be your life guard, it's ok...  
... Just in case!  
Rose... You have to get your groove on, no shoes on  
That's why you gotta do it when the world got a new song  
Wait too strong,... Too long  
From the...  
Got up to date feel like a rock star
