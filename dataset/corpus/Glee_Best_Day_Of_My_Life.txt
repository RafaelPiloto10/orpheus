I had a dream so big and loud  
I jumped so high I touched the clouds  
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]  
I stretched my hands out to the sky  
We danced with monsters through the night  
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]  
  
I'm never gonna look back  
Woah, never gonna give it up  
No, please don't wake me now  
  
Oo-o-o-o-oo  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
Oo-o-o-o-oo  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
  
I howled at the moon with friends  
And then the sun came crashing in  
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]  
But all the possibilities  
No limits just epiphanies  
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]  
  
I'm never gonna look back  
Woah, never gonna give it up  
No, just don't wake me now  
  
Oo-o-o-o-oo  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
Oo-o-o-o-oo  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
  
I hear it calling outside my window  
I feel it in my soul (soul)  
The stars were burning so bright  
The sun was out 'til midnight  
I say we lose control (control)  
  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
Oo-o-o-o-o  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be  
The best day of my life  
Everything is looking up, everybody up now  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
