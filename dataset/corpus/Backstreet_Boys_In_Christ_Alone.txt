In Christ alone will I glory  
Though I could pride myself in battles won  
For I've been blessed beyond measure  
And by His strength alone I overcome  
Oh I could stop and count successes  
Like diamonds in my hands  
But those trophies could not equal  
To the grace by which I stand  
  
Chorus:  
In Christ alone I place my trust  
And find my glory in the power of the cross  
In every victory let it be said of me  
My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone  
  
In Christ alone will I glory  
For only by His grace I am redeemed  
And only His tender mercy  
Could reach beyond my weakness to my need  
And now I seek no greater honor  
Than just to know Him more  
And to count my gains  
But losses to the glory of my Lord
