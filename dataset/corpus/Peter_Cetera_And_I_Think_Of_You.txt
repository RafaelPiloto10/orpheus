Where did you go - why did you run  
What did you need from me you felt we were missing  
Now you never write - and you never call  
  
What did you want - I couldn't give  
You should've told me baby I would have listened  
Why did you leave - when we had it all  
  
And I think of you  
Yes I think of you  
  
[Chorus]  
Everywhere I go - anytime of the day  
Every move I make - every word that I say  
If I let myself I get carried away  
When I think of you  
I still think of you  
  
Time on my hands doesn't seem right  
I'll never get used to this single life  
And now I wonder what you're doing tonight  
  
We got away from it all  
In a house upon the hill  
I loved you then and I always will  
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
