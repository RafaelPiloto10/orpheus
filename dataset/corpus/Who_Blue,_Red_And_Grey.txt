Some people seem so obsessed with the morning  
Get up early just to see the sun rise  
Some people like it more when there's fire in the sky  
Worship the sun when it's high  
Some people go for those sultry evenings  
Sipping cocktails in the blue, red and grey  
  
But I like every minute of the day  
  
I like every second, so long as you are on my mind  
Every moment has its special charm  
It's alright when you're around, rain or shine  
  
I know a crowd who only live after midnight  
Their faces always seem so pale  
And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight  
They say a suntan never fails  
I know a man who works the night shift  
He's lucky to get a job and some pay  
  
And I like every minute of the day  
  
I dig every second  
I can laugh in the snow and rain  
I get a buzz from being cold and wet  
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain  
  
And so you see that I'm completely crazy  
I even shun the south of France  
The people on the hill, they say I'm lazy  
But when they sleep, I sing and dance  
Some people have to have the sutlry evenings  
Cocktails in the blue, red and grey  
  
But I like every minute of the day  
  
I like every minute of the day
