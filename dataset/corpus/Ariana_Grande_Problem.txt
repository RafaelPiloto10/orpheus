[Intro: Iggy Azalea]  
Uh huh It's Iggy Iggz  
I got one more problem with you girl  
Aye  
  
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]  
Hey baby, even though I hate ya  
I wanna love ya, I want you  
And even though I can't forgive ya  
I really want ya, I want you  
Tell me, tell me, baby  
Why can't ya leave me?  
Cause even though I shouldn't want it  
I gotta have it, I want you  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
Head in the clouds  
Got no weight on my shoulders  
I should be wiser  
And realize that i've got  
  
[Chorus x2]  
One less problem without ya  
I got one less problem without ya  
I got one less problem without ya  
I got one less, one less problem  
  
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]  
I know you're never gonna wake up  
I gotta give up, but it's you?  
I know I shouldn't ever call back  
Or let you come back, but it's you  
Every time you touch me  
And say you love me  
I get a little bit breathless  
I shouldn't want it, but it's you  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
Head in the clouds  
Got no weight on my shoulders  
I should be wiser  
And realize that i've got  
  
[Chorus x2]  
One less problem without ya  
I got one less problem without ya  
I got one less problem without ya  
I got one less, one less problem  
  
[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]  
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you  
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you  
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you  
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you  
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'  
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you than I love your presence  
And the best thing now is prolly for you to exit  
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson  
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'  
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'  
There's a million you's baby boy, so don't be dumb  
I got 99 problems but you won't be one  
Like what!  
  
[Bridge: Ariana Grande]  
One less, one less problem  
One less, one less problem  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
Head in the clouds  
Got no weight on my shoulders  
I should be wiser  
And realize that i've got  
  
[Chorus x4]  
One less problem without ya  
I got one less problem without ya  
I got one less problem without ya  
I got one less, one less problem
