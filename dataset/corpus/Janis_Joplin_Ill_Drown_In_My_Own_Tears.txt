He brings a tear into my eyes  
When I begin, Lord, to realize.  
If you don't think that, honey, you'll be lonesome,  
You know I'll drown, drown, oh Lord, in my own tears.  
  
I know it's true into his mind  
A little rain is bound to fall  
But since you been gone honey I'm so blue,  
It just keeps rainin', keeps right on rainin' more and more.  
  
I didn't cry just like a child,  
My poor tears, Lord, they were runnin' wild.  
If you don't think that baby you'll be home soon now  
You know I'll drown, drown, oh Lord in my own tears.
