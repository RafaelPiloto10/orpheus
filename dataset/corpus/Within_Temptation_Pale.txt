The world seems not the same,  
though I know nothing has changed.  
It's all my state of mind,  
I can't leave it all behind.  
I have stand up to be stronger.  
  
[Chorus]  
I have to try to break free  
from the thoughts in my mind.  
Use the time that I have,  
I can't say goodbye,  
have to make it right.  
Have to fight, cause I know  
in the end it's worthwhile,  
that the pain that I feel slowly fades away.  
It will be alright.  
  
I know, should realize  
time is precious, it is worthwhile  
Despite how I feel inside,  
have to trust it will be alright.  
Have to stand up to be stronger.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, this night is too long.  
I have no strength to go on.  
No more pain, I'm floating away.  
Through the mist I see the face  
of an angel, who calls my name.  
I remember you're the reason I have to stay.  
  
[Chorus]
