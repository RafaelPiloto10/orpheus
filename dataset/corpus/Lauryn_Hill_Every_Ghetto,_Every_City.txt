I was just a little girl  
Skinny legs, a press and curl  
My mother always thought I'd be a star  
But way before my record deal,  
The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill  
Made sure that I'd never go too far  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem  
Story starts at Hootaville grew up next to Ivy Hill  
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun  
"Kill the guy" in Carter park  
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark  
Watching kids show off the stolen ones  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem  
  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back,  
Looking back, looking back, looking back  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
  
A bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel  
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles  
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu  
Main street roots tonic with the dreds  
A beef patty and some coco bread  
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe  
'Member Frelng-Huysen used to have the bomb leather  
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick were together  
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever  
  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
  
Drill teams on Munn street  
Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef  
Moving Records was on Central Ave.  
I was there at dancing school  
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool  
Unaware of what we didn't have  
Writing your friends' names on your jeans with a marker  
  
July 4th races off of Parker  
Fireworks at Martin stadium  
The Untouchable P.S.P., where all them crazy niggers be  
And car thieves got away through Irvington  
Hillside brings beef with the cops  
Self-Destruction record drops  
And everybody's name was Muslim  
Sensations and '88 attracted kids from out-of-state  
And everybody used to do the wop  
Jack, Jack, Jack ya body  
Nah, the Biz Mark used to amp up the party  
I wish those days, they didn't stop  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem  
  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back
