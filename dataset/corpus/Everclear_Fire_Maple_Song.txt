Turn away from the pain you don't want  
Turning down to avoid them when they call  
Strange words I heard a long long time ago  
I wish I could go back to a summer time  
I knew more than twenty years ago  
Lay between the sheets we lie underneath the maple tree  
Now I can't smile  
Lying down in the grass with the wind around us as we smile and talk  
Listen to your Grandma sing those country songs  
She'd tell us how the maple turns to fire every four years  
We'd lay in the grass all summer just to watch the autumn come around  
I can't smile  
Now I can't smile  
I live alone and you're so far away  
I call you every year just around the holiday  
I still see you in the night lying above me in the grass  
I can't smile  
Turn away from the pain you don't want  
Turning down to avoid them when they call  
I can't believe this letter that says you died  
I think I'm gonna go back to the house in North Carolina and lay in the
backyard  
Get drunk and let the leaves just bury me  
Bury me  
I can't smile  
Now I can't smile  
I don't know what's happening to me  
I don't know what's happening to me  
I can't smile
