Where are you my love?  
I need you my love  
Please try to forgive  
For I cannot live  
No I can't go on without you  
  
Swallow all your pride  
This I beg of you  
And I'll cry no more  
No not like before  
For I've tasted tears without you  
  
Come back my love  
I know I was wrong  
And now I pray  
That I can be strong  
  
Run to me my love  
  
Fill my empty arms  
Come as close as you can  
For though I'm a man  
I'm just a child without you  
  
Come back my love  
I know I was wrong  
And now I pray  
That I can be strong  
  
Run to me my love  
Fill my empty arms  
Come as close as you can  
For though I'm a man  
I'm just a child without you
