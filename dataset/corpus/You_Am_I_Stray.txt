It's irregular and it sure won't pay  
but say naught 'til you got something to say  
So I live for forty minutes a day  
Can I have that?  
The biggest kick you ever got  
was paying out on dinosaur rock  
and said with every prehistoric thought  
you can stain  
For every door that's been closed  
there's another of your friends you can dose  
While your brains seem to speak through your clothes  
And for every handshake that'll pay  
there's another motherfuck who'll complain  
that to keep a legal dose is so lame  
Are you stray?  
Those born with gold with weary souls  
Should eat their young and die  
Are you stray?
