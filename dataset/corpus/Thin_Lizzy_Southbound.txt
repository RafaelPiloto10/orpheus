The boom time it is over  
A ghost town is all that's left here  
The gold rush it is over  
And depression days draw near  
  
Tonight after sundown  
I'm going to pack my case  
I leave without a sound  
Disappear without a trace  
  
I'm going southbound  
  
Drifting like a drover  
Chasing my career  
From the ships docked in the harbour  
New horizons will appear  
  
Tumbling with the tumbleweed.  
Down the open road.  
Taking only what I need.  
Before my head explodes.  
  
I'm going southbound  
  
Hey, you're not getting any younger.  
The wild west has already been won.  
Northern lights are growing colder.  
And the old eastern ways are gone.  
  
So tonight after sundown.  
You must go from this place.  
Without a tear, without a frown.  
Disappear without a trace.
