Where are those happy days?  
They seem so hard to find  
I tried to reach for you  
But you have closed your mind  
What ever happened to our love?  
I wish I understood  
It used to be so nice  
It used to be so good  
  
[Chorus:]  
So when you're near me  
Darling can't you hear me?  
S.O.S.  
The love you gave me  
Nothing else can save me  
S.O.S.  
  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try, how can I carry on?  
  
You seemed so far away  
Though you were standing near  
You made me feel alive  
But something died, I fear  
I really tried to make it out  
I wish I understood  
What happened to our love?  
It used to be so good  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone (When you're gone)  
Though I try, how can I carry on?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone (When you're gone)  
Though I try, how can I carry on?  
[Repeat]  
  
Carry on.
