Left the ground  
In black and white  
And when the plane went down  
The colors all around  
I know by now  
The margins slight  
And still I can't get out  
She's all I think about  
Can't let her go  
It's who you know  
  
We came down to watch the world walk by  
And all she found was trouble in my eyes  
From the sky she pulled me down tonight  
Let her go  
Let her go  
  
She moves fast  
Takes control  
And like a heart attack  
I know I can't turn back  
And time just passed  
Nights move slow  
And she was all I had  
Thought I'd never last  
Can't let her go  
It's who you know  
  
We came down to watch the world walk by  
And all she found was trouble in my eyes  
From the sky she pulled me down tonight  
Let her go  
  
Let her go  
  
We came down to watch the world walk by  
And all she found was trouble in my eyes  
From the sky she pulled me down tonight  
She calls out the farther that I fly  
I love that sound, so give me one more line  
And from the sky she pulled me down tonight  
Let her go  
Let her go  
Let her go  
Let her go
