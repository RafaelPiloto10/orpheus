There she goes again see her smiling so happy with the new love that she's
found  
See her whisper in my ear all those things I used to hear  
Oh how that hurts me so I'm leavin' town she's the reason why I'm leavin' town  
I'm going far away where no one knows me when morning comes well I won't be
around  
To see her whisper in his ear kiss and call him dear  
Oh I can't stand that so I'm leavin' town bet she's even glad I'm leavin' town  
  
I'm going far away where no one knows me when morning comes well I won't be
around  
To see her whisper in his ear kiss and call him dear  
Oh I can't stand that so I'm leavin' town packin' up my hurt and leavin' town  
Mm leavin' town bet she's even glad I'm leavin' town
