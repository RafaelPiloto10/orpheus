Some of us live like princes  
Some of us live like queens  
Most of us live just like me  
We don't know what it means  
To take our place in one world  
To make our peace in one world  
To make our way in one world  
To have our say in one world  
If you ain't got two words to say  
Then I can't talk to you  
No use crying, there's been no crime  
I say it's just the way the wind blows  
Just the name of the game  
The way of the world, way of the world  
Just the way of the world  
Just the way of the world  
So cold and lonely  
Cold and lonely  
Cold and lonely world  
Such a cold and lonely  
Cold and lonely  
Cold and lonely world  
It's just a cold and lonely world  
It's one world, like it or not  
It's one world, believe it or not  
It's one world  
It's one world, believe it or not  
One world, like it or not  
It's one world  
Some of us live like princes  
Some of us live like queens  
Most of us live just like me  
And we don't know what it means  
To take our place in one world  
To take our place in one world  
To make our loving in one world  
Make our way in one world  
It's one world, one world, one world
