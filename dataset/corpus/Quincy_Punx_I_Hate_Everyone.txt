  
I hate Christians and I hate Jews  
I hate my friends and I hate you  
I hate the blacks and whites and reds  
I hope to see them all dead  
[Chorus:]  
I'm not prejeduced, 'cause I hate everyone  
And don't you ask me why, 'cause I just think its fun  
I hate the politically correct  
I hate jocks and I hate rednecks  
I hate the corporate fucking clones  
I hate faggots and homophobes  
[Repeat Chorus]  
I hate capitalists and I hate commies  
I hate daddies and I hate mommies  
I hate straightedgers and I hate drunks  
I hate skinhead and I hate punks  
[Repeat Chorus]
