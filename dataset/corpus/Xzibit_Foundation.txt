When I look you in your eyes I can see my own  
Straight love manifested in flesh and bone  
You's a breath of fresh air in this world of shit  
You was born to be a soldier don't ever forget  
Hit back when hit  
Use force that's effective  
All these bitches and women  
Son, please be selective  
This is California can't stick your dick in everything  
We will survive necessarily by any means  
Let no man ever hold you down or suppress you  
It's the 90's the police just arrest you,  
disrespect you on occasion take life  
By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight  
It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us  
When your neck is on the line stand ground then bust  
In God we trust but just in case keep it loaded and locked  
Ready to rock  
Then shake the spot  
The Foundation  
  
You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers  
Who forever smoke bud  
So it's probably in your blood  
Realize you can only run the streets so long  
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone  
It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong  
Same shit different day  
It's the same ol' song  
If the time ever comes that I meet my match  
Take control of my assets  
Fuck startin' from scratch  
Take care of your mother  
Keep yourself on track  
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back  
Beware of the serpent  
Cause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike  
And try to make you loose sight  
Don't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real  
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill  
Son if you ever pull heat  
Then use it  
If you got a chance to walk away  
Then do it  
Total domination takes full concentration in all situations  
A solid foundation  
  
You are the foundation  
Beginning of a new generation  
I remember hospital hallway pacin'  
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine  
Only to find that yours looked like mine  
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time  
In this life you can't press stop  
Then press rewind  
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man  
Have your own plan, expand your mind  
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs  
This is nothing but love  
Via satellite Mug gs  
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life  
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife  
Be prepared for the worst  
But expect the best  
No matter where life takes you  
Come home to the West  
Survival takes more than just gats and guns  
That's words to live by  
From a father to a son
