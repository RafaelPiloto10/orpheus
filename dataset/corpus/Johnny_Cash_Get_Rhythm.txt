Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues  
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues  
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones  
Put taps on your toes and get goin'  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.  
  
Little shoeshine boy never get slowed down  
But he's got the dirtiest job in town  
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet  
On the windy corner of a dirty street  
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes  
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues  
He grinned as he raised his little head  
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.  
  
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues  
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues  
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine  
It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.  
  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues  
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues  
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones  
Put taps on your toes and get goin'  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.  
  
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy  
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy  
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right  
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight  
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away  
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way  
He said I like it with a big wide grin  
Kept on a poppin' and he said again  
  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues  
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues  
It only cost a dime, just a nickel a shoe  
It does a million dollars worth of good for you  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues
