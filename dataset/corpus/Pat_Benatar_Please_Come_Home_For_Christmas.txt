Bells will be ringing, the glad - glad news  
For what a Christmas to have the blues  
My baby's gone and I have no friends  
To wish me greetings once again  
  
Oh, crowds will be singing Silent Night  
Christmas carols by candlelight  
  
Please come home for Christmas  
Please come home for Christmas  
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night  
  
Friends and relations, send salutations  
As sure as the stars shine above  
Yes it's Christmas, Christmas my dear  
It's the time of the year, time of the year  
To be with the one you, the one you really love  
  
Oh won't you tell me, we'll never grow old  
  
Christmas and New Years will find you home  
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain  
Because I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again  
  
Please come home for Christmas baby  
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain  
Because I'll be happy, Lord I'll be so happy  
Happy once again
