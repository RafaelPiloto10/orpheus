Hey boys, Miss Magic is back  
No Hollywood waste or tinsel trash  
Street kid, she's no stray cat  
Heaven on legs she's feline flash  
Takes a good woman to play a good man  
And no one plays like heaven can  
  
She said leave your name  
At the sound of the tone  
Call you right back  
When I get home  
Better watch out  
When we're all alone  
  
Heaven is a girl I know so well  
She makes me feel good when I feel like hell  
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have  
She makes me feel better when I'm feelin' bad  
  
Hey guys, Miss Magic is mine  
No silicone smile she's a vintage wine  
Bombshell blond, red lipstick on  
Aquiline fine, she's a real wild one  
  
She said leave your name  
At the sound of the tone  
Call you right back  
When I get home  
Better watch out  
When we're all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven is a girl I know so well  
She makes me feel good when I feel like hell  
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have  
She makes me feel better when I'm feelin' bad  
Heaven is a girl that makes dreams come true  
Oh, no one does it good like heaven do, no  
  
She got the rhythm to drive me crazy  
She got the rhythm of love  
  
She said leave your name  
At the sound of the tone  
The lights are out  
But there's somebody home  
Better watch out when  
We're all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have  
She makes me feel good when I feel like hell  
Heaven is a girl she makes dreams come true  
And no one does it good like heaven do  
That voodoo that you do
