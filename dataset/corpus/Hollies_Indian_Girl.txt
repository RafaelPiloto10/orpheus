I see the snowflakes falling  
I hear the drumbeat calling  
I am just only lonely Indian girl  
Braver than all the brave now  
I sit at every pow-wow  
I fought a million men for Indian girl  
  
Ten hides and twenty horses  
That's what the tribal law says  
Too much for me to pay for Indian girl  
  
Oh sun shine on sun shine on  
And take my darkness away  
Oh sun shine on sun shine on  
And bring this girl my way  
  
Far from her lonely teepee  
Wind sends her sweetness to me  
Too much for me to bear my Indian girl  
Gather your things together  
And bring your wedding feather  
We'll steal away forever Indian girl  
  
Chorus x2
