It doesn't matter if I say you're right even when you're wrong  
Or paint you as a hero or the chicks in every song  
I roll my eyes to heaven, I recognize your flaws  
But after all is said and done, I just want you more  
  
Some people say I must be blind  
But I'll have you over them any time  
  
Oh, I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh, I wanna get next 2 you  
I wanna get next 2 you  
  
While searching for perfection, I fell foul of your charms  
Ti caro mi amigo, I want to leave, I can't  
These shoes are getting heavy, this cross is hard to bear  
At least a life of misery is something we can share  
  
Some people say I must be blind  
But I'll have you over them any time  
  
Oh, I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh, I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh, I wanna get next 2 you, yes, I do  
Oh, I wanna get next 2 you  
I wanna get next 2 you  
  
Some people say I must be blind  
But I'll have you over them any time  
  
Oh, I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh, I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh, I wanna get next 2 you, yes, I do
