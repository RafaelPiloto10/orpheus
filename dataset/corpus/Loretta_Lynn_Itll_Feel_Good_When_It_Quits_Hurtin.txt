When you left me you thought I'll die sit at home alone and cry  
And it hurts me because that you were right  
I tell myself that I'll begin to try and forgive you but then  
I go and cry myself to sleep at night  
But somethin' that my mama said keeps goin' around inside my head  
And if I only knew that it was cool  
The time and tears will wash away this hurt I'm still in night and day  
And I know that I'll get over you  
Mama said one thing for certain it'll feel good when it quits hurtin'  
And you know that mamas always right  
And if this hurt will go away then I'll feel good again someday  
And I won't ever want you in my side  
And now you're spread all around just how you tore my playhouse down  
And that's because you broke my heart in two  
You think that love was fun and game and you don't even feel the shame  
But someday it may all come home to you  
And now you think you're flyin' high and you don't care how much I try  
What goes up will come back down someday  
And if my mama's words are true but then I won't be lovin' you  
And I'll be glad I heard my mama say  
Mama said one thing for certain...
