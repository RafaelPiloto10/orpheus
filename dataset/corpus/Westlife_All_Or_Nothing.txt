I know when he's been on your mind  
That distant look is in your eyes  
I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over  
It's not the way I choose to live  
Bit something some where's gotta give  
As sharing in this relationship gets older, older  
  
You know I'd fight for you but how could I fight someone who isn't even there  
I've had the rest of you now I want the best of you I don't care if that's not  
Fair  
  
Cause I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing at all  
  
There are time it seems to me  
I'm sharing you with memories  
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it  
Then there's times you look at me  
As though I'm all that you can see  
Those times I don't believe it's right I know it, know it  
  
Don't make me promises baby you never did know how to keep them well  
I had the rest of you now I want the best of you it's time to show and tell  
  
Cuz I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing at all  
  
Cause you and I  
Could lose it all if you've got no more room  
No more inside for me in your life  
  
Cause I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
It's now or never  
  
Is it all  
Or nothing at all  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing  
  
Cause you and I  
Could lose it all if you've got no more room  
No more inside for me in your life  
  
Cause I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
It's now or never  
  
Is it all  
Or nothing at all  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing at all
