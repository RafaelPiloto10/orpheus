She's a painting outta focus with no good sense of intention she's authentic  
She's a model of disaster with a heart of revolution  
She's so innocent, but guilty's her plea  
Everybody wants to save her from herself, they really want to save themselves  
  
She's got the grace of a tourist, with the charm of demolition  
She's a poem without a meter or rhyme a random design  
Of a flower like a rose no one really knows  
She's a master piece deserving restoration or condemnation time will tell us  
If she's a lifer or a decomposuer she's the rose no one really knows
