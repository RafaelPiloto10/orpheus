There ain't nothing I can do  
Or nothing I can say  
That folks don't criticize me  
But I'm going to do  
Just as I want to anyway  
And don't care just what people say  
If I should take a notion  
To jump into the ocean  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
If I go to church on Sunday  
Then cabaret all day Monday  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
If my man ain't got no money  
And I say "take all mine, honey"  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
If I give him my last nickel  
And it leaves me in a pickle  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
But I'd rather my man would hit me  
Than follow him to jump up and quit me  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
I swear I won't call no copper  
If I'm beat up by my papa  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
Nobody's business  
Ain't nobody's business  
Nobody's business if I do
