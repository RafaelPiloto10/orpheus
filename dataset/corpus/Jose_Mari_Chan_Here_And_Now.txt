You and I may never be the perfect pair  
The kind most people dream  
Themselves to be  
Just as long as you and I  
Are both aware  
That life is what we make it to be  
Then we won't care what others  
Have to say  
Our love will guide us  
And show the way, oh baby  
  
Refrain:  
From this moment on it's  
Me and you  
The road of life ahead we'll journey  
Through  
And through it may be winding  
We'll go right on reminding  
That we both have eachother  
  
Chorus:  
Cheeish every moment  
Darlin' hold me fast  
Live each day as though it  
Were last  
The only time and place that  
We are certain of  
My love, is here and now  
  
We had yesterday but now it's  
Come and gone  
Tomorrow still to come belongs to none  
We had found the miracle of love today  
If we try hard enough it's here to stay  
Our rainbows end may just be rond the bend  
I know we'll find it but until the oh baby  
  
(repeat refrain and chorus)  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Coda:  
Ourl ove is here and now
