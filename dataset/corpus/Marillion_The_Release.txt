The alarm by the bed  
Wrings the dreams from my head  
It's a new day  
Leave the flakes in the bowl  
Milk unopened, I'm gone  
But I'm still late  
Join the fight for a cab  
Take our place in the jam  
And watch the clock again  
There is a man in my head  
I think he came from the screen  
Or the bible  
All he wants is for me is to be strong  
But I seem to be unreliable  
You know it gets so hard  
When everything you are  
Is everything you don't want to be  
But at the end of the day  
You're the one who burns it all away  
The end of the day  
You're the one, you're the one  
The end of the day  
So won't you show me those pictures you hold in your head  
And can you lose me somewhere inside them all  
Because there are colours that run through the heart of me  
That only you can see  
But at the end of the day  
You're the one who burns it all away  
The end of the day  
You're the one, you're the one  
The end of the day  
You're the one who burns it all away
