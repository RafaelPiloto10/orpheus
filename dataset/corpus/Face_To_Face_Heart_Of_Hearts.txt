Close your eyes and try to get to sleep  
Now don't you make a peep  
Now we hear everything  
Shut the door and make it clean and neat  
Now you've been so discreet  
Now we've seen everything inside your heart of hearts  
You know pick yourself up off the floor  
And stand now wash away your sin  
Now you've got everything  
  
Inside your heart of hearts  
You know will you choose to hide it in your soul?  
If it's wrong and I'm feeling so indifferent  
I might be in danger of myself  
Shut your mouth and get yourself to sleep  
Now don't let then hear you weep  
Now you've got everything inside your  
Heart of hearts you know will you  
Choose to hide it in your soul?
