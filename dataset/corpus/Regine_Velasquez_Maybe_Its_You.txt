I've been alone searching for love  
'til you came along and touched my heart  
With you in my life I'll never think twice  
It's you I've been waiting to call  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe it's you I'm thinking of  
Who'll mend this broken heart of mine  
It's you I'm wishing for who'll be with me tonight  
Someone to hold, someone to cry, someone who'll  
Make me feel alive  
Maybe it's you all my life  
Ohh...  
  
No lonely hours but just precious times  
I turn to you and I am alright  
Oh...  
Never will die this feeling inside  
With you every moment's forever  
  
Maybe it's you  
I'm thinking of who'll mend this broken heart of mine  
It's you I'm wishing for who'll be with me tonight  
Someone to hold, someone to cry, someone who'll  
Make me feel alive  
Maybe it's you all my live  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
Maybe it's you  
I'm thinking of who'll mend this broken heart of mine  
It's you I'm wishing for who'll be with me tonight  
Someone to hold, someone to cry, someone who'll make me feel alive  
Maybe it's you all my life  
  
Someone to hold, someone to cry, someone  
Who'll make me feel alive  
Maybe it's you all my life  
  
Ohhhh...  
Maybe it's you all my life
