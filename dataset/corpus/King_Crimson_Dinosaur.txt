Long ago and far away in a different age  
When I was a dumb young guy  
Fossilized photos of my life then  
Illustrate what an easy prey I must have been  
  
Standing in the sun, idiot savant  
Something like a monument  
I'm a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones  
  
Ignorance has always been something I excel in  
Followed by naivete and pride  
Doesn't take a scientist to see how  
Any clever predator could have a piece of me  
  
Standing in the sun, idiot savant  
Something like a monument  
I'm a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones  
  
When I look back on the past  
It's a wonder I'm not yet extinct  
All the mistakes and bad judgments I made  
Nearly pushed me to the brink  
  
It doesn't pay to be too nice  
It's the one thing I have learned  
Still, I made my fossil bed  
Now I toss and turn  
  
I'm a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones
