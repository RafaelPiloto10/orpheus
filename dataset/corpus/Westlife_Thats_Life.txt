That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say  
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May  
But I know I'm gonna change that tune  
When I'm back on top, back on top in June  
  
I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem  
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream  
But I don't let it, let it get me down  
cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around  
  
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king  
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing  
Each time I find myself flat on my face  
I pick myself up and get back in the race  
  
That's life (that's life), I tell you I can't deny it  
I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it  
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try  
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly  
  
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king  
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing  
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face  
I just pick myself up and get back in the race  
  
That's life (that's life), that's life and I can't deny it  
Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it  
But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July  
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball a-and die  
  
My, my!
