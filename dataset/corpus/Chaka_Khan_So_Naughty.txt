At the gypsy's eye  
When the moon is high  
And the mood is right for dancing, romancing  
While Michael Wails  
In his baggy tails  
Makes it all seem so enhancing for dancing  
CHORUS:  
Oh you're so naughty  
Oh with your body  
Oh you're so naughty  
I wanna get naughty with you  
If you want me to  
All those fools out there  
Could they be aware  
I just need someone to come home to  
But you are so rare, I don't even care  
'Cause I got you to roam with  
Could I be dreamin'  
Am I with you  
My heart is screamin'  
Could this be true  
Let's keep it goin'  
Our love is rare  
Let's keep it growin'  
We're almost there
