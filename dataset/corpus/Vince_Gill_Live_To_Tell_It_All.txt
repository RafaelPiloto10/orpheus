True love is understated  
True love is being known  
Oh I've never felt so connected  
And two hearts have found a home  
  
[Chorus]  
And no matter how we struggle  
Oh I'll answer when you call  
And we'll walk away from trouble  
And live to tell it all  
  
Safe in my arms I'll keep you  
Never more to roam  
And I promise to lay down beside you  
When our names are carved in stone  
  
[Chorus: x2]
