Yesterday you were here by my side  
Nothing to prove and nothing left to hide  
You promised me there would be no goodbye  
But now I find another set of lies  
Babe you must be crazy  
How could you be so blind  
Why would you deceive me  
Now you're saying that you're leaving me behind  
So strong I'm not gonna run away  
Want you to know that I'm gonna break through  
How long can I go on this way  
There's nothing can I do  
  
Desperate hearts think you better hold out  
Turn apart I was left to bleed  
Don't start feeling you were sold out  
Now you better face reality  
  
Did my best, did the best that I could  
It's all been wanted just misunderstood  
You been on talking  
Your words are sounding so smooth  
Why don't you say it  
You just want to out me loose  
Oh don't say that you love me  
Don't want to hear that you tried  
Oh don't tell me that you need me  
Don't want to hear none of your alibis  
So strong I'm not gonna run away  
Want you to know I'm gonna break through  
How long can I go on this way  
There's nothing I can do  
  
Desperate hearts think you better hold out  
Turn apart I was left to bleed  
Don't start feeling you were sold out  
Now you better face reality  
  
So strong I'm not gonna run away  
Want you to know I'm gonna break through  
How long can I go on this way  
Tell me what can I do  
There's nothing I can do  
  
Desperate hearts think you better hold out  
Turn apart I was left to bleed  
Don't start feeling you were sold out  
Now you better face reality  
  
Desperate hearts think you better hold out  
Turn apart I was left to bleed  
Don't start feeling you were sold out  
Now you better face reality
