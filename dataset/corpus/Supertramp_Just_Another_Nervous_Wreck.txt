I'm feeling so alone now  
They cut the telephone uh huh  
Yeah my life is just a mess  
  
I threw it all away now  
I could have made a fortune  
I lost the craving for success  
  
And as the acrobats they tumble  
So the corn begins to crumble  
While in the mirror  
She admires a brand new dress  
  
Live on the second floor now  
They're trying to bust the door down  
Soon Ill have a new address  
  
So much for liberation  
They'll have a celebration  
Yeah I've been under too much stress  
  
And as the cloud begin to rumble  
So the juggler makes his fumble  
And the sun upon my wall is getting less  
  
Don't, give a damn  
Fight, while you can  
Kill, shoot em up  
They'll run amuck  
Shout, Judas  
Loud, they'll hear us  
Soldier, sailor  
They'll run for cover when they discover  
Everyone's a nervous wreck now  
  
I used to think she was so nimble  
Would have bought her as symbol  
But now I can't afford the pen to sign her checks  
  
Don't, give a damn  
Fight, while you can  
Kill, shoot em up  
They'll run amuck  
Shout, Judas  
Loud, they'll hear us  
Soldier, sailor  
They'll run for cover when they discover  
Everyone's a nervous wreck now  
  
Life's just a bummer they got your number  
Well give as good as we get now  
Rise from the gutter, stick with each other  
Well drive em over the edge now  
They're gonna bleed, that's what they need  
Well get together and blow their cover  
Were ready  
Yeah we're ready  
Yeah we're ready
