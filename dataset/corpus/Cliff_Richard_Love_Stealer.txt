When she's got her eye on you - there's no escape  
She keeps unnoticed - hidden under her cape  
She shows no mercy - no - she plays it rough but  
She don't want your money - she just wants your love  
  
Better call the cops - better call the cops  
Better call the police  
Better come quick - better come quick  
While I'm in one piece  
  
Better bring a book - better bring a book  
Gonna press charges - for attempted  
Breaking and entering my heart  
Yeah  
  
'Cause she's a lovestealer - raw dealer  
Heart breakin' - love takin' yeah-yeah  
Love stealer - raw dealer  
Heart breakin' - love takin' yeah-yeah-yeah  
  
She hangs around - casing the joint  
Then she'll move in and get - right to the point  
Take my advice and keep your love to yourself  
Or the love stealer will rob you-  
  
Leave you there on the shelf  
Better call the cops - better call the cops  
Better call the police  
Better come quick - better come quick  
  
While I'm in one piece  
Better bring a book - better bring a book  
Gonna press charges - for attempted  
Breaking and entering my heart  
Yeah  
  
'Cause she's a lovestealer - raw dealer  
Heart breakin' - love takin' yeah-yeah  
Love stealer - raw dealer  
Heart breakin' - love takin' yeah-yeah-yeah  
  
Better call the cops - better call the cops  
Call the police  
Better come quick - better come quick  
While I'm in one piece  
  
Better bring a book - take a look  
Press charges  
For attempted breaking and entering my heart  
Yeah...
