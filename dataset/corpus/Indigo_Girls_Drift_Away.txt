Day after day I'm more confused  
Still I look for the sun through the pouring rain  
You know that's a game that I hate to lose  
And I'm feeling the strain  
Aint it a shame  
  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
  
Beginning to think that I'm wasting time  
I don't understand the things I do  
World outside looks so unkind  
And I'm counting on you to carry me through  
  
Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
I said give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
  
When my mind is free  
You know that a melody can move me  
And when I'm feeling blue  
The guitars coming through to soothe me  
  
Thanks for the joy that youve given me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
Youve helped me along making me strong  
  
Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
I said give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away all right  
I said give me the beat boys and free my soul  
(oh now it's time to come on and free my soul)  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
(were gonna drift away)  
Why don't you give me the beat boys and free my soul  
(take me, take me, take me away)  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
(oh)  
I said give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
