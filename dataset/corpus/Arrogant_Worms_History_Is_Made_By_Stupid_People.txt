Scott became famous for freezing to death in Antartica.  
Columbus made history thinking some island was India.  
General Custer's a national hero for not knowing when to run.  
All these men are famous, and they're also very dumb.  
  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
  
Nobility are famous for no reason.  
Marie Antoinette enjoyed her cake.  
She cause a Revolution when she would not share.  
And her husband lost his head for that mistake.  
  
The Hindenberg was a giant zeppelin.  
Her makers made a minor oversight.  
Before they filled it up with explosive gas  
They should have fixed the no smoking light.  
  
'Cause!  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
  
Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!  
Our king and country's honor we will save.  
Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!  
We're marching into history and the grave.  
  
So, if your son or daughter seem too lazy,  
Sitting there watching mad T. V.  
Just remember you should be quite grateful  
At least they're not making history.  
  
Ahhh!  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
Do something dumb before you die  
Do something dumb before you die!!
