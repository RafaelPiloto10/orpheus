Paul and Silas in jail  
Had no money to go their bail  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Paul and Silas thought they was lost  
Dungeon shook and the chains come off  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Freedom's name is mighty sweet  
And soon we're gonna meet  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
I got my hand on the gospel plow  
Won't take nothing for my journey now  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Only chain that a man can stand  
Is that chain o'hand on hand  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
I'm gonna board that big Greyhound  
Carry the love from town to town  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
The only thing I did was wrong  
Was stayin' in the wilderness too long  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
The one thing we did was right  
Was the day we started to fight  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Ain't been to heaven but I been told  
Streets up there are paved with gold
