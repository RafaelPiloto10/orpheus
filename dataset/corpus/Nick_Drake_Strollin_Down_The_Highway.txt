Strolling down the highway  
I'm gonna get there my way  
Just keep on down-a-walking  
You hear my guitar, rocking  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway  
  
People think I'm a crazing  
Lot about how they're-a-lazing  
Sunshine's all day long  
Narcotics far too strong  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway  
  
Cars won't stop for no one  
But don't you think that you're just rolling down  
Think you are a spy  
Gonna shoot them as they go by  
Well, no cars  
No cars  
Won't stop for no one  
  
Strolling down the highway  
I'm gonna get there my way  
Just keep on down-a-walking  
You hear my guitar, rocking  
Well I stroll  
On down  
On down the highway
