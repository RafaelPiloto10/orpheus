When day is gone and night comes on  
Until the dawn what do I do?  
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land  
Dream dancing with you  
  
We dance between a sky serene  
And fields of green sparkling with dew  
It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time  
Dream dancing with you  
  
Dream dancing  
Oh, what a lucky windfall  
Touching you, clutching you  
All the night through  
  
So say you love me, dear  
And let me make my career  
Dream dancing, dream dancing with you

Dream dancing, dream dancing  
With you, with you, with you
