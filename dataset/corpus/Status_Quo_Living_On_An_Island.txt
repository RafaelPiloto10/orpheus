Easy when you're number one  
Everybody say you're having fun  
Smiling for the public eye  
When your body say you want to die  
Living on an island  
Looking at another line  
Waiting for my friend to come  
And we'll get high  
  
Hugh he got a real nice place  
Cruxie gonna be there soon  
And I just want to see his face  
I'm getting lonely in my empty room  
Living on an island  
Working at another line  
Waiting for my friend to come  
And we'll get high  
  
Passing time away in blue skies  
Thinking of the smile in her eyes  
Easy, it's easy  
  
Living on an island  
Oh boy, we're having fun  
Living on an island  
Thinking 'bout the things I've done  
Living on an island  
Searching for an other line  
Waiting for my friend to come  
And we'll get high  
Waiting for my friend to come  
And we'll get high  
I said we're gonna get high  
Yeah, we're gonna get high  
We're gonna touch the sky  
Sky...sky...sky...sky...sky...sky...
