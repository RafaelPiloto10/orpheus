Gimme some love  
Gimme some love  
Gimme some I want you to know  
Gimme some love  
Gimme some love  
Sugar, that's the wrong wrong way to go  
  
Open your arms  
Open your arms  
Honey, you'll come right back home to me  
Gimme some love  
Gimme some love  
Sugar, that's the wrong wrong way to be  
  
Can't you see  
Where to be  
This time  
Simple pages on my mind  
  
Kick it on back  
Kick it on back  
Kick it on back to what you know  
Gimme some love  
Gimme some love  
Sugar, on the hard rock radio  
  
Where they play tunes  
Where they play tunes  
Where they play riffs to the hard rock beat  
Gimme some love  
Gimme some love  
Sugar, from the top of the old school beat  
  
Can't you see  
Where to be  
This time  
Simple pages on my mind  
  
Give me something  
Love can believe  
(Oh babay)  
  
Can't you see  
Where to be  
This time  
Simple pages on my mind  
  
Kick it on back  
Kick it on back  
Kick it on back to what you know  
Gimme some love  
Gimme some love  
Sugar, on the hard rock radio  
  
So, gimme some love  
Gimme some love  
Gimme some love  
Gimme some love  
  
Gimme some...can't you see  
You're just me  
Turn these pages on my mind  
Aww...ohhh
