Can We Get Back To Love Again  
  
I can't cry no more  
Girl, my eyes are empty  
Can't think of nothing but you  
You are the reason I wake up in the morning  
Lately I'm sleeping till two  
  
Sometimes I swear that you are lying here beside me  
I reach for you girl and you're not there  
Still got the smell of your body on the pillow  
Still finding strings of your hair  
  
Tell me can we try baby  
Can we get back to love again  
Seems like I'm losing my best friend  
Can you rescue me from the rain  
And be my sunshine again  
Can I make it up to you  
I promise that I'll do anything for us  
Cause baby I love you  
I mean it, I need you  
Let's go back to love again  
  
I don't wanna go on without you, baby  
Don't wanna hurt anymore  
Ain't nothing right and my world is going crazy  
Ain't nothing left to live for  
  
And I try but I  
Can't stop loving you wishing you were here,  
Baby you are my life  
I just want my baby girl  
  
So can we get back to love again  
Seems like I'm losing my best friend  
Can you rescue me from the rain  
And be my sunshine again  
Can I make it up to you  
I promise that I'll do anything for us  
Cause baby I love you  
I mean it, I need you  
Let's get back to love again  
  
Give me one more night to change your mind  
And girl I swear tonight will be the night I'm gonna take you there  
I have to risk my last chance girl  
I don't care if I die trying to get you back, baby  
I love you, you are my lady  
I'll be there daily, weekly  
  
Can we get back to love again  
Seems like I'm losing my best friend  
Can you rescue me from the rain  
And be my sunshine again  
Can I make it up to you  
I promise that I'll do anything for us  
Cause baby I love you  
I mean it, I need you  
Let's get back to love again  
  
Can we get back to love again  
Seems like I'm losing my best friend  
Can you rescue me from the rain  
And be my sunshine again  
Can I make it up to you  
I promise that I'll do anything for us  
Cause baby I love you  
I mean it, I need you  
Let's get back to love again
