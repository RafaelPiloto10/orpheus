The smell of trees. Can only be that way. On a sunny day.  
Floating through the open window. To the cool inside.  
Where we lay side by side. How can anything we feel. Ever  
mean so much. As a summer love? How can anything we  
need. Ever get in touch. With the meaning of.  
A whole life waiting? Wishing suddenly. That it's going to be  
the real thing. Or separating. Try your luck again. It's just  
part of the adventure.  
Holy Cow. You do it to me now. "The Soundtrack to a  
Generation". Oh, Wow. You're getting to me now. "The  
Soundtrack to a Generation".  
Another tune. Before the light has gone. And we'll be on  
our way. The sounds and smells. Will always linger on.  
They're in my heart today.  
We feel so lucky then. The world's a massive place. But we  
run into each other. Just one small happening. An accident  
of fate. Or the work of co-conspirators? But if we knew.  
What could it do. To help us now?  
Holy Cow. You do it to me now. "The Soundtrack to a  
Generation". Anyhow. Just give it to me now. "The  
Soundtrack to a Generation". Oh Wow. You really got me  
now. "The Soundtrack to a Generation". Holy Cow. You're  
getting to me now. "The Soundtrack to a Generation".  
Years have gone on in between. But all I knew at  
seventeen. Is all I know now now. Through times of joy and  
suffering. The music flavours everything. That's all I know  
now.  
Holy Cow. You do it to me now. "The Soundtrack to a  
Generation". Oh Wow. You really got me now. "The  
Soundtrack to a Generation". Anyhow just give it to me  
now. "The Soundtrack to a Generation".  
Just give it. You're getting. You do it you really got me now.  
"The Soundtrack to a Generation". Oh Wow. Just give it.  
You're getting. You do it.  
You really got me now. "The Soundtrack to a Generation".  
Oh Wow. You really got me now. "The Soundtrack to a  
Generation".
