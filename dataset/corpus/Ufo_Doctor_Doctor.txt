Doctor doctor, please  
Oh, the mess I'm in  
Doctor doctor, please,  
Oh the mess I'm in  
She walked up to me  
And really stole my heart  
And then she started  
To take my body apart  
  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
Far away from you  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
So far away from you  
  
Doctor doctor, please  
Oh, I'm goin' fast  
Doctor doctor, please,  
Oh, I'm goin' fast  
It's only just a moment,  
She's turnin' paranoid  
That's not a situation for a nervous boy  
  
Doctor doctor, please  
Oh, the mess I'm in  
Doctor doctor, please,  
Oh, the mess I'm in  
But you look so angry  
As I crawled across your floor  
She's got the strain,  
And I can't take any more  
  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
Far away from you  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
So far away from you  
  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
Far away from you  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
So far away from you
