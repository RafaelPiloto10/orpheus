Walking alone inside my world  
Thinking I'm doing the right thing  
Destroying all that appears before me  
It was all done in vain  
  
Wanna get through fire  
Wanna get through pain  
Wanna get with violence  
Wanna get with shame  
  
Digging this place to call my own  
Raping my body without a face  
Tortured my soul is black as pitch  
And I have no life to waste  
  
Wanna get through fire  
Wanna get through pain  
Wanna get with violence  
Wanna get with shame  
  
I worshipped you  
Do anything  
So lost and helpless  
I played your game  
  
I worshipped you  
Do anything  
So lost and helpless  
I played your game  
  
Wanna get through fire  
Wanna get through pain  
Wanna get with violence  
Wanna get with shame
