(Harris)  
  
He's walking like a small child  
But watch his eyes burn you away  
Black holes in his golden stare  
God knows he wants to go home  
Children of The Damned  
(repeat another 3 times)  
  
He's walking like a dead man  
If he had lived he would have crucified us all  
Now he's standing on his last stand  
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all  
Children of The Damned  
(repeat another 3 times)  
  
Now it burns his hand he's turning to laugh  
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh  
Melting his face screaming in pain  
Peeling the skin from his eyes  
Watch him die according to plan  
He's dust on the ground what did we learn  
  
You're Children of The Damned  
Your back's against the wall  
You turn into the light  
You're burning in the night  
You're Children of The Damned  
Like candles watch them burn  
Burning in the light  
You'll burn again tonight  
You're Children of The Damned
