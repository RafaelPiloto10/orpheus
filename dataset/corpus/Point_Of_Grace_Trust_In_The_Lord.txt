Written by Amy Sandstrom-Shoyer  
  
Chorus  
Trust, trust in the Lord  
Lean not on your own understanding  
In all, all of your ways  
Acknowledge Him  
He'll make your path straight  
  
You'll be my guide for life  
I'll walk by Your side  
With Your hand in mine  
I'll go where You lead me  
  
Chorus  
  
My eyes can only see  
The ground beneath my feet  
Your dreams are greater  
Your ways are higher  
O Lord please show me  
  
Chorus  
  
Bless my thoughts  
My dreams my imaginations  
Step by step  
Your delight, Your creation  
  
Chorus
