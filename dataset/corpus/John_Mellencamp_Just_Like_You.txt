As my time goes by  
On the mean, cruel earth  
Trying to find some peace  
A little something to believe in  
How can things go so wrong  
In such a beautiful world  
Why are so many people crying  
Where's humanity gone  
And every time it gets so dark  
There's nothing for me to see  
  
Something comes along (just like you)  
Yea, just like you  
Something so unbelievably beautiful  
Just like you  
  
Well, it happened the other day  
I'm just walking down the street  
I'm looking down at my shoes  
With only myself in my way  
I'm livin' in my head  
Too much life in my veins  
Forgetting all of the time  
We're always in motion with angels  
And every time it gets so dark  
And there's nothing for me to see  
  
Something comes along (just like you)  
Yea, just like you  
Something so unbelievably beautiful  
Just like you  
  
As my time goes by  
On this mean, cruel world  
Trying to find some peace  
A little happiness to believe in  
How can things go so wrong  
In such a beautiful world  
Why are so many millions crying  
Where's humanity gone  
And every time it gets so dark  
There's nothing for me to see  
  
Something comes along (just like you)  
Yea, just like you  
Something so unbelievably beautiful  
Just like you  
  
Yea come along (just like you)  
Yea, just like you (just like you)  
Something so unbelievably beautiful  
Just like you
