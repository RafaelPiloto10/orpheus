I was born in the shadows  
Under the Iberian sun  
I was the dawn of the valley  
Under the Iberian sun  
  
I once was a sinner  
But who was not?  
I really liked to rumble and hustle a lot  
But where is the key monster  
He is not here  
I am just a gatekeeper  
Now so sincere  
Now so sincere  
Now so sincere  
  
Who am I  
What is the purpose  
Who am I  
And where do I flee?  
Who am I  
I'd like to remember  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be  
Who do I want to be  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be  
  
I went down to the river  
Trying to find peace in my mind  
In the throw  
I saw you glimmer  
The desire for you made me blind  
I first saw you at the distance  
When the moon's at its height  
I came to get to know you  
A disclosure so bright  
I knew, in my heart  
When your flair made me swoon  
I am just a prisoner  
In search of my tune  
  
Who am I  
What is the purpose  
Who am I  
From where do I flee?  
Who am I  
I'd like to remember  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be
