It's the ways of her father  
If she's gonna change she hasn't done it yet  
And the desert is calling to me  
Run before the final trap is set  
All roads lead to the city  
Where the dudes and the dykes all look the same  
Lady lays out the pattern  
With the parts of her body that seem tame  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
Act like a child and I'll respond with my well-rehearsed farewell  
Quoting the verse that you bought but weren't quite prepared to sell  
Saying I think I love you  
Maybe I care  
It's not fair  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
And it's a sore spot when the room's burning hot  
And the desert air just cannot bring you down  
Still the bed's warm but a cold arm  
Keeps me floating inches off the ground  
Death valley lives and tracy isn't sure what really gives  
Go paint your toes wipe you nose and then come to say goodbye  
And all along tell yourself I am wrong if I try  
Crying sorry it's over  
I'm not to blame  
What a game  
Death valley lives now I'm not even sure what really gives  
Ho, ha
