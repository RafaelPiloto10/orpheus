Battle hymns did sound the call.  
You came to our side.  
You heard true metal - into glory  
Ride.  
You stood beside us the false ones  
Cried. - Your love is judgment.  
You gave us life.  
You wait in the rain - you walk  
Through the snow. We give you  
Our blood. We want you to know.  
In our eyes your're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forever -  
In our eyes your're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forever.  
We have read your letters -  
We have heard your call.  
We were brought together -  
Cause we've got the balls -  
To play the loudest metal.  
So hard and so wild and mean. -  
You'll live forever we were  
Born from your belief.  
Metal makes us strong  
Together we belong - forever  
Here's your song. We want you  
To know.  
In our eyes you're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forever -  
In our eyes you're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forevermore.  
Metal makes us strong  
Together we belong - forever  
Here's your song. We want you  
To know.  
In our eyes you're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forever -  
In our eyes you're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forevermore.
