I fall over and over and over over over on you  
I get ill, I get ill, I get ill, you're the only one I'm into  
You and me  
Fit so tight  
I go lower and lower and lower lower livin easy  
I don't know, I don't know what I got till it's over  
You and me  
Fit so tight  
  
Can you do it again  
Do it again  
Do it again  
Can you do it again  
  
All the way, all the way, all the way, there's no where left we can meet  
I'm into what you do but I leave you no where  
You and me  
Fit so tight  
All we need  
Is one more time  
  
Can you do it again  
Do it again  
Do it again  
Can you do it again  
  
I only get to live one life  
I won't pretend you're only mine  
Where will you go, where will you find the way  
  
To do it again  
Do it again
