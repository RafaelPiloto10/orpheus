Radio speaker - radio bleep  
Put it on hard disc -  
See it on your pc  
Everybody moving - 'cause  
their so afraid of losing  
You gotta pull the straps  
Till it can't fight back  
  
Say you gotta pull straps  
Till it can't fight back  
Press it down, press it down  
  
What's going on,  
Oh what's going on  
There was a time,  
When all I could see  
was a sun in the sky  
There was a place I knew where we  
We used to run, run with  
the wind in our faces  
  
I look to the left, I look to the right  
Can't get through  
Press it down, I can't get through  
Look to the left, I look to the right  
I can't get through  
  
I can't get through  
I can't get through  
  
Radio play, radio scream  
Coming up through  
All the crap on my windscreen  
I can't get through  
I can't go back  
Laugh (too scared)  
I might have a heart attack  
I say I might have a heart attack  
  
I can't get through  
I can't get through
