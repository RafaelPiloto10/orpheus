You say you've been overseas  
I say over where  
You say just a holiday  
My Alsatian heir  
I say I've been working late, working overtime  
Haven't seen the sun since eighty-nine  
  
Does the moon light shine on Paris  
After the sun goes down  
If the London Bridge is falling  
Will anybody hear a sound  
If you follow the sunset will it ever end  
Does the moonlight shine on Paris  
  
Oh and how can you just walk away  
Is it something that I said  
I see only black and white  
You see green and red  
You believe in the miracles  
Water into wine  
I'll believe it when it makes the New York Times  
  
Does the moonlight shine on Paris  
After the sun goes down  
If the London Bridge is falling  
Will anybody hear a sound  
If you follow the sunset will it ever end  
Does the moonlight shine on Paris
