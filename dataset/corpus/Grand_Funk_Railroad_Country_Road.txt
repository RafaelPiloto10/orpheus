Goin' down that country road,  
Leavin' behind that heavy load.  
Gettin' away from the city life,  
Society causes too many fights.  
  
Chorus  
Down my country road.  
Down my country road, oh.  
Down my country road.  
Down my country road, road, road.  
  
Too much killin' and too many wars,  
Women and children must be shuttin' their doors.  
Protect your country and for this you must die,  
They take your life but they don't tell you why.  
  
Chorus
