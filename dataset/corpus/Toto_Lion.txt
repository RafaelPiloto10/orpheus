I got my feet back on the ground  
We were headed for disaster  
Woke up, I got ready for work  
You weren't around  
I was fast, but you were faster  
Such a night, feeling right  
Nothing I could say  
(Then you went away)  
Have to know, why'd you go?  
Couldn't even beg you to stay  
  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
  
Huntress, you compell me with your eyes  
It's my heart that you're enslaving  
Serpent dance  
You really hypnotize  
To the lion's den is the road for me you're paving  
In a trance, saw you dance  
And you made romance to me  
(Don't take it away)  
Took a chance, circumstance  
And it wasn't hard to see  
  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
  
You're the one that made me feel this way  
So alone without your smile  
You took my heart  
Left my soul to pay  
Just to watch me crawl on another smile  
  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl
