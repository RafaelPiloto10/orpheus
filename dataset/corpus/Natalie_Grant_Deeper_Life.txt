So many voices calling out to me  
To sell me something, tell me what I need, But they don't know about the
treasure I've found, A gift from heaven I can't live without  
It's a kingdom and it's hidden deep inside, I will be living for much more
than meets the eye  
-CHORUS-  
'Cause I need the deeper life, where the love of God runs far and wide, I need
the deeper life, I will give him all my heart and mind, I won't be swept away
by every changing tide  
I believe in the deeper life  
I got my telephone, Got my radio  
I got a lotta places I can go  
But where I want to be is off the deep end, My Jesus meets me when I dive
right in  
Don't want to slip slide on the surface of this life, My soul will search
untilthis thirst is satisfied  
[ -CHORUS-]  
I will be seeking first the kingdom of my God, I want everything he's got  
[-CHORUS-]
