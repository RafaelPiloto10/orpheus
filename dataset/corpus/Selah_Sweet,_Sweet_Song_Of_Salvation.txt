When you know a pretty story  
You don't let it go unsaid  
You tell it to all of your children  
As you tuck them into bed.  
When you know a wonderful secret  
You gotta tell it to all of your friends  
Tell 'em that a lifetime filled with Happiness  
Is like a street that never ends.  
  
Sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation  
And let your laughter fill the air  
Sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation  
And tell the people everywhere.  
Sing that sweet song of salvation  
Tell every man in every nation  
To sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation  
And let the people know that Jesus cares.  
  
Well, look around you  
As you're singin'  
There are people everywhere  
And to those who stop and listen  
That sweet song becomes a prayer.  
When you know a wonderful secret  
You gotta tell it to all of your friends  
Tell 'em that a lifetime filled with Jesus  
Is like a street that never ends.  
  
Sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation  
And let your laughter fill the air  
Sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation  
And tell the people everywhere  
Sing that sweet song of salvation  
Tell every man in every nation  
To sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation  
And let the people know that Jesus cares.
