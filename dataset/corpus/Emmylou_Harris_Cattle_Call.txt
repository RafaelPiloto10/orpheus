The cattle are prowlin' the coyotes are howlin'  
Way out where the dogies bawl  
Where spurs are a-jinglin', a cowboy is singin'  
This lonesome cattle call.  
  
He rides in the sun 'til his days work is done  
And he rounds up the cattle each fall  
Singin' his cattle call.  
  
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide  
When the night winds blow up a squall  
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather  
He sings his cattle call.  
  
He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie  
And he sings with an ol' western drawl  
Singin' his cattle call.
