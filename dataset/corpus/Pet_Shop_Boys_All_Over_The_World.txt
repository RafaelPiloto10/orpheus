(oh-way-oh, oh-way-oh  
Oh-way-oh, oh-way-oh  
Oh-way-oh, oh-way-oh  
Oh-way-oh, oh-way-oh)  
  
It's something  
That look in your eyes tonight  
Like magic  
It's changing everything in sight  
  
I hear it all around me every day  
In the music that you play  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
This is the sound  
Of all boys and girls  
You hear it  
Playing all over the world  
  
The night sky  
Like velvet masks our eyes tonight  
And falling  
Reveals the sunrise  
Ending night  
  
We feel it  
All around us  
Every day  
In the music that we play  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
This is the sound  
Of all boys and girls  
You hear it  
Playing all over the world  
  
(all over the world)  
Ey-ey-ey-ey  
[x4]  
  
Ay-oh-ay-oh  
  
It's sincere at its objective  
Superficial and true  
Easy and predictable  
Exciting and new  
Just say 'I want you'  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
This is the sound  
Of all boys and girls  
You hear it  
Playing all over the world
