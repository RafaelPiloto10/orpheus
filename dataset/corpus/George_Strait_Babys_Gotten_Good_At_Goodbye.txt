What a rotten day this turned out to be  
I still can't believe she'd leave so easily  
She just got all her things threw em' into a pile  
Then she loaded her car and said after a while  
She done this before but this time she didn't cry  
  
That's why I'm sittin on the front steps  
Starin down the road, wonderin' if she'll come Back this time I don't know  
After she packed  
When she looked back  
There were no tears in her eyes  
And that's got me worried thinking  
Maybe my baby's gotten good at a goodbyes  
  
All the times before she'd break down and cry  
She'd make her threats, but her heart wasn't set on goodbye  
She just wanted me to hear what she had to say  
Now I'm lost for words since she went away  
She may not return for this time she didn't cry  
  
That's why I'm sittin on the front steps  
Starin down the road, wonderin' if she'll come back  
This time I don't know  
After she packed when she looked back  
There were no tears in her eyes  
And that's got me worried thinking  
Maybe my baby's gotten good at goodbye  
  
That's why I'm sittin on the front steps  
Staring down the road, wonderin' if she'll come back  
This time I don't know  
After she packed when she looked back  
There were no tears in her eyes  
And that's got me worried thinking  
Maybe my baby's gotten good at goodbye
