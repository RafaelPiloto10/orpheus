Pressure on me  
Can't get out  
Situation it's a melt down  
Nine to fivin', want to shout  
New direction, got to get to high ground  
  
I've got to get back to the floor  
Just grab my keys and pop the door  
  
[Chorus]  
Going to give it up  
Get on down  
Little by little going to turn it around  
  
Wash the week out  
Of my mind  
Slap my face on  
Now I feel sublime  
Put some sounds on  
To unwind  
Caught the moment  
Just about the right time  
  
I've got to get back to the floor  
Just grab my keys and pop the door, yea  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Make my heart sing  
Like a wild thing  
Yea yea yea  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Give it up [Repeat x7]
