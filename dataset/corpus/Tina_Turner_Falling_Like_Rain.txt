Really brings me down, I don't know how  
That you can say you're not my kind  
Couldn't find a cloud for miles around  
Why do you change your story line  
It all goes gray again sometimes I don't know when  
To come out of the storm  
It feels like forty days and forty nights I've been  
Beating on your door  
  
I'm falling like rain  
Oh I, I love ya, love ya, love ya  
Falling like rain  
Oh I, I'm coming down around ya  
I will always think about you  
  
My sentimental ways don't seem to phase you  
I don't ever want to force your hand  
If you met me one time, just half the way  
I could meet you where you are  
Just meet me where I am  
'Cause every now and then you've gotta drive right in  
Deeper than deep  
You take a chance and then you give the wheel a spin  
Anyone can see  
  
I'm falling like rain  
Oh I, I love ya, love ya, love ya  
Falling like rain  
Oh I, I'm coming down around ya  
I will always think about you
