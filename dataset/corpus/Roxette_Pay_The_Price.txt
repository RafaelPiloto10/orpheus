I try to keep your name  
And still get rid of your face  
I hate to be by myself  
All locked away in this place  
You turn me inside out  
You turn me outside in  
Around and upside down  
A rollercoaster within  
  
Pay the price of love  
When he calls for you  
You've got to  
Pay the price of love  
When he calls for you  
  
I grab my big black book  
And call the numbers I know  
Something is melting this town  
Like it was all made of snow  
You turn me inside out  
You turn me outside in  
Around and up and down  
The elevator within  
  
Pay the price of love (ooh la la la)  
When he calls for you  
You've got to  
Pay the price of love (ooh la la la)  
When he calls for you  
  
Spending the evening alone  
With the 10 o'clock news  
Looking at you through the holes  
In the soles of my old brown shoes
