I know the Lord, will make a way  
He will make a way, yes he will  
Yes, he will  
  
Oh, I do believe that we will make it  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Uh uh  
I was at rock bottom, my whole life was mo' problems  
Reincarnation of a slave pickin' cotton  
Stress beamin' down like the sun I felt rotten  
To the core, was at war, cause the enemy is plottin'  
I hear him knockin', sayin' that we got him  
Hot like solar, he wanna burn my soul up  
World on my shoulders but I roll back ya boulders  
Words have a funny way of comin back to scold ya  
Watch what come out of your mouth, you crack a molar  
I tried to told ya, he he he  
Enemies gunnin', true believers ain't runnin'  
Or duckin', we ain't scared of nothin', ya feel me?  
They wanna test me and press my buttons, oh really?  
Allow Uncle L to hip y'all to somethin', uh, uh  
Yeah, uh, check it out  
There's a living power, make a man out a coward  
Rebuild your strength like the new Trade Towers  
I thought that I was over, my life got devoured  
Now I'm on top and I pray for all the doubters  
Time to shout it, sing it louder  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, we're gonna make it  
We're gonna make it (we're gonna make it)  
Thank God we made it (yeah)  
And I mean it, yeah yeah, oh yeah  
  
I was feelin' like my whole world was spinnin' and spillin'  
On the ground and that God wasn't willin'  
It seemed like the only ones ballin' was the villains  
Dollar signs in they eyes, lyin' to our chillin'  
I wanna kill 'em, I'd rather God hit 'em  
They sellin' venom and we buyin' it like denim  
These world wide webs they weave, we caught in 'em  
Old folks is dyin' and CEO's skimmin'  
The bat's in your hand and this is the 9th inning  
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin'  
Don't be confused, don't be fooled by the wind-up  
Start switchin' your position, make your mind up  
Pull your bootstraps tight, get your grind up  
Get your life lined up before time's up  
Yo, yo, you know what?  
Take ten percent of that, dough you tryin' to stack  
Send it up to God, I guarantee he send it back  
Multiply it by a hundred times, y'all remember that  
That's just a little jewel to get the monkey off your back  
Uh, yeah, sing it out now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the darkest valley, through the loneliest alley  
Never give up, press on through the storm  
Weepin' man fall, for the night seem long  
But if you stand strong joy come within the morn'  
And it goes, on and on and on and on and on and-ah  
I know it feels like your back's to the wall  
Who's sittin' in the crib, and you don't know who to call  
(Jesus!) Hangin' on a tight rope, fingers slippin' off  
But you ain't by yourself dog, we all been lost  
Stay on your course, carry your cross  
Ain't no stoppin', got to keep it poppin'  
You want it, you can get it, believe me the king did it  
Nothin' gonna hold you back, there's no limits  
I'm sent to bring truth to rap, not gimmicks  
And I'm not finished, man listen  
Here's the moral to the thesis, y'all cats need Jesus  
He put your life back together, pick up the pieces  
Word to the masses, I heard God asked us  
For less fake rappers, and more real pastors  
Uh-huh, uh-huh, so hereafter  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We made it, we made it  
Through the storm and rain, yeah  
You can make it, yes you can  
You can make it, you got me  
I know you can, I know you can  
I know you can, yes, yeah  
I do believe we'll make it (Hallelujah!)  
(Glory! Glory!)
