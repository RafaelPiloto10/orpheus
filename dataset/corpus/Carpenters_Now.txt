Now, now when I wake, I don't feel cold  
Now that I have your hand to hold  
The winds might blow through me  
But I don't care  
There's no harm in thunder if you are there  
  
And now, now when we touch  
My feelings slide  
Now when I'm smiling, I know why  
You light up my world like the morning sun  
You're so deep within me we're almost one  
And now all the feelings that I have start to fade  
I was always afraid life might forget me  
Love might let me down  
Then look who I found  
  
(The winds might blow through me, but I don't care  
There's no harm in thunder if you are there)  
  
And now, now when I wake, there's someone home  
I'll never face the night alone  
You gave me the courage I need to win  
To open my heart and to let you in  
And I never really knew how until now  
Until now  
  
No, I never really knew how until now
