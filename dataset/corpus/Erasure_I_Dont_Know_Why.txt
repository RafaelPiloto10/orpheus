Time passes by  
Goes so fast then you die  
It's enough just to be with you  
  
You set your sights high  
No regrets no goodbye  
Just a face in your mind for the ones  
  
Cross my heart  
Cross my fingers  
Cross my mind  
Cross my path  
Cross my heart  
Hold my breath  
  
Space and time  
Our souls entwine  
We are touching something  
Spiritual and divine  
  
The lonesome heart  
When our souls part  
But the saints in heaven  
Hear the lonely cry  
  
I close my eyes  
And I see your sweet smile  
Been a while since you came and talked  
  
Places I've been  
And people I've seen  
Simply pale into view when compared  
  
Cross my heart  
Cross my fingers  
Hold my breath  
  
Space and time  
Our souls entwine  
We are touching something  
Spiritual and divine  
  
The lonesome heart  
When our souls part  
But the saints in heaven  
Hear the lonely cry  
  
Space and time  
Our souls entwine  
We are touching something  
Spiritual and divine  
  
The lonesome heart  
When our souls part  
But the saints in heaven  
Hear the lonely cry  
  
Space and time  
Our souls entwine  
We are touching something  
Spiritual and divine  
  
The lonesome heart  
When our souls part  
But the saints in heaven  
Hear the lonely cry
