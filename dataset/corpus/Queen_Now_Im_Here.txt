Here I stand (here I stand)  
Look around around around around around  
But you won't see me (but you won't see me)  
  
Now I'm here (Now I'm here), now I'm there (Now I'm there)  
I'm just a?just a new man  
Yes you made me live again, wow  
  
A baby I was when you took my hand  
And the light of the night burned bright  
The people all stared didn't understand  
But you new my name on sight  
  
Ooh whatever came of you and me  
America's new bride to be - ooh, don't worry baby I'm safe and sound  
  
Down in the dungeon just peaches 'n' me  
  
Don't I love her so  
Yes you made me live again, yeah  
  
Yeah, ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky  
Where the beams of your lovelight chase  
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain  
With the rain running down my face  
  
Your matches still light up the sky  
And many a tear lives on in my eye  
  
Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me  
Don't I love him so  
Ooh, don't I love him so  
Wooh  
  
Whatever comes of you and me  
I love to leave my memory with you  
  
Now I'm here (Now I'm here)  
Think I'll stay around around around around around around  
Down in the city justa you 'n' me (down in the city justa you 'n' me)  
Don't I love you so  
Go, go, go, little Queenie  
Wooh
