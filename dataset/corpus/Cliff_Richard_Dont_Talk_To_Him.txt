If some guy tells you, I don't care  
And tells you lies while I'm not there  
Don't talk to him  
If he tells you, I'm untrue  
Then darling, here what you must do  
Don't talk to him  
And if he tells you I've been seen  
Walking 'round with Sue and Jean  
He's lying again (lying again)  
Do anything that you want to  
But darling, this I beg of you  
Don't talk to him  
  
If you hear the words he has to say  
He'll break your heart  
Let your love for me prove strong  
While we are far apart  
  
So just remember what'd I say  
(And) Trust in me while I'm away for I'll be true  
And just remember my true love is  
Brighter than the moon above for only you  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Nearly a wind (nearly a wind)  
Just close your eyes and count to ten  
And think of me again  
But don't you talk to him  
  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Merely a whim (Merely a whim)  
Just close your eyes and count to ten  
And think of me again  
But don't you talk to him  
  
If you hear the words he has to say  
He'll break your heart  
Let your love for me prove strong  
While we are far apart  
  
So just remember what'd I say  
Trust in me while I'm away for I'll be true  
And just remember my true love is  
Brighter than the moon above for only you  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Merely a whim (Merely a whim)  
Just close your eyes, count to ten  
And think of me again  
But don't you talk to him
