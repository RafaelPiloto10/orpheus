I am terrified of all things.  
Frightened of the dark.  
I am.  
You are taller than a mountain.  
Deeper than the sea.  
You are.  
  
Hold me.  
Hold me.  
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely.  
  
I was closer to you back then.  
I was happier.  
I was.  
You are fading further from me.  
Why don't you come home to me?  
  
Hold me.  
Hold me.  
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely.  
  
I am...  
I am...  
Cold.  
  
Hold Me.  
  
Hold me.  
Hold me.  
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely.  
Hold me.  
Hold me.  
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely.  
Hold me.  
Hold me.
