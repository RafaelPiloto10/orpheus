Take the river to the highest mountain  
Take the ocean to the farthest sea  
I'd take back everything I've said to hurt you  
If you'd come back to me  
  
I'd bring you fire from the frozen waters  
Leave a flower 'neath a fallen tree  
I'd take back everything I said to scare you  
Away from me  
  
Two hands can feel so much more  
That's what I'm loving you for  
I was too blind to see fear was inside of me  
I'm not afraid anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
It's never too late, it's never too late  
To forgive and forget  
Tell me that it isn't over, tell me that it isn't over  
I'll never hold you again  
  
If a broken wing can still be mended  
Then a foolish heart can still be true  
Take the river to the highest mountain  
That's where I'll wait for you  
  
Two hearts can feel so much more  
That's what I'm loving you for  
The man that you tried to free  
Is still locked inside of me  
And your heart must open the door  
  
[Chorus]
