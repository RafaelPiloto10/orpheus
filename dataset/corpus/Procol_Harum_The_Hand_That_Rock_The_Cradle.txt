(G. Brooker K. Reid C. Thompson)  
When you're out in the dark  
Nothing to believe in  
And you can't find a way back home  
There's a man with a secret  
There's a visionary sister  
Who knows what's right or wrong?  
Little by little I turn to the light  
And one day I'll be satisfied  
Like the hand that rocks the cradle  
I gotta be gentle and strong  
The hand that rocks the cradle  
Gonna be the lucky one  
When the wind blows cold  
And you lose your resistance  
Slipping down on the darkest side  
You can push too hard  
You can run too fast  
Don't get lost in the looking glass  
Little by little the wheel turns around  
And one day I'll be satisfied  
Like the hand that rocks the cradle  
I gotta be gentle and strong  
The hand that rocks the cradle  
Gonna be the lucky one
