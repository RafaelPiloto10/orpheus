Maybe I'll be your solider  
Gladly I'll do your business  
For just a taste of what you're holding  
For just a taste you could only, mean  
  
Save your summers  
For someone that's afraid to love  
I'll be right here  
Lying in the hands of god  
  
Here it comes diving into to me  
Now the floor is the ceiling  
If you never flew why would you?  
Cut the wings off a butterfly, fly  
  
Save your summers  
For someone that's afraid to  
Love you knew what I feel  
Then you couldn't be so sure  
I'll be right here  
Lying in the hands of god.  
  
Few feel angels in your head  
Tears drop  
Of Joy runs down your face  
You will rise.  
  
Feeling me up now drink me  
Skin begins to grow back slowly  
Faster into until I'm chocking  
Rinse for my mother.  
  
Save your summers  
For someone that's afraid to  
Love you knew what I feel  
Then you couldn't be so sure  
I'll be right here  
Lying in the hands of god.  
  
I am in love with my fingers  
Tear drops runs joy off my face  
I will rise  
For someone that's afraid to  
Love you knew what I feel  
Then you couldn't be so sure  
I'll be right here  
Lying in the hands of god.  
  
Now the floor is the ceiling  
If you never flew why would you?  
Why would you?
