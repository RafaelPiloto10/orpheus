I'm a dog in a manger  
A cat with a mouse  
I'm the prodigal stranger  
I'll burn down the house  
I'm a self-educator  
A collector of news  
I'm the cool liberator  
Any topic you choose  
  
I'm a man with a mission  
I'm a shooting star  
I've got no inhibitions  
I don't care who you are  
  
Got my eye on the future  
And my hand on the pulse  
There's a whole world of people  
In the back of the bus  
There's a man on a tightrope  
Who's got nothing to share  
Just a whole lot of secrets  
And a head full of air  
  
I'm a man with a mission  
I'm a shooting star  
I've got no inhibitions  
I don't care who you are  
  
It's the Tropic of Cancer  
The meaning of soul  
There's a change in the weather  
To have and to hold  
The method of access  
A handful of dust  
It's just par for the course, boy  
Get back on the bus  
  
I'm a man with a mission  
I'm a shooting star  
I've got no inhibitions  
I don't care who you are
