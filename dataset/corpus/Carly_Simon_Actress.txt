Some day I'm going to grow up  
And be every man's dream  
Some day I'm going to grow up  
And forget this sad little me  
I'm going to shine in the spotlight  
Wear sexy clothes  
Be somebody everybody wants to meet  
And no one ever really knows  
No one will ever know me  
  
I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
  
Critics will adore me  
At least they will at first  
But you see I already know this  
So it can't never really hurt  
And if it does, I'm an actress  
I'll play it nonchalant  
In the total scheme of things it's insignificant  
(Sure I can take the knocks)  
  
'Cause I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
  
I may not be that pretty now  
But who's the referee  
Standards of beauty  
Will be redefined because of me  
  
And then they'll be the scandals  
Everywhere my name  
Men will jump from balconies  
And I'll just shrug and take the blame  
(Yeah, they'll say I died for love)  
  
'Cause I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
Well, I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
  
My acceptance speech will be a milestone  
Never will such a star  
Have ever graced the microphone  
And of course I'll thank my agent  
The way they always do  
Though I could have done it without him  
And that goes for the Academy too  
And the makeup people and the lighting designers and everybody else  
  
'Cause I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
I'm an actress yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I'll be gracious to the lesser stars  
And generous to the unknowns  
And if another actress threatens  
My position on the throne  
  
Well, I don't know exactly what I'll do  
I don't exactly know  
But I know that it could turn into  
One of my most poignant roles  
Everyone will have their handkerchiefs out  
And they'll have to leave the theater early  
And then they'll go home  
And what'll they do?  
They'll have a big glass of alcohol  
  
'Cause I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
And if I make it to the top I won't be overthrown  
I'm an actress ah, yeah, yeah
