The lanes were silent  
There was nothing, no one, nothing around for miles  
I doused our friendly venture  
With a hard-faced  
Three-word gesture  
  
I started something  
I forced you to a zone  
And you were clearly  
Never meant to go  
Hair brushed and parted  
Typical me, typical me  
Typical me  
I started something  
...And now I'm not too sure  
  
I grabbed you by the guilded beams  
Uh, that's what tradition means  
And I doused another venture  
With a gesture  
That was...absolutely vile  
  
I started something  
I forced you to a zone  
And you were clearly  
Never meant to go  
Hair brushed and parted  
Typical me, typical me  
Typical me  
I started something  
...And now I'm not too sure  
  
I grabbed you by the guilded beams  
Uh, that's what tradition means  
And now eighteen months' hard labour  
Seems...fair enough  
  
I started something  
And I forced you to a zone  
And you were clearly  
Never meant to go  
Hair brushed and parted  
Typical me, typical me  
Typical me  
I started something  
And now I'm not too sure  
  
I started something  
I started something  
Typical me, typical me  
Typical me, typical me  
Typical me, typical me  
Typical me  
I started something  
And now I'm not too sure  
  
OK Stephen? ...Do that again?
