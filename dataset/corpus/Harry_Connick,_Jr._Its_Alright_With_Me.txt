It's the wrong time and the wrong place  
Though your face is charming it's the wrong face  
It's not her face but it's such a charming face  
That it's alright with me  
  
It's the wrong song in the wrong style  
Though your smile is lovely it's the wrong smile  
It's not her smile but it's such a lovely smile  
That it's alright with me  
  
You can't know how happy I am that we met  
I'm strangely attracted to you  
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget  
Don't you want to forget someone too  
  
It's the wrong game with the wrong chips  
Though your lips are tempting they're the wrong lips  
They're not her lips but they're such tempting lips  
That if some night you're free  
It's alright with me
