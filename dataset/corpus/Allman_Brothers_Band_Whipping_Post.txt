I've been run down and I've been lied to.  
And I don't know why, I let that mean woman make me a fool.  
She took all my money, wrecks my new car.  
Now she's with one of my good time buddies,  
They're drinkin in some cross-town bar.  
  
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,  
Like I been tied to the whippin' post.  
Tied to the whippin' post, tied to the whippin' post.  
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'.  
  
My friends tell me, that I've been such a fool.  
But I had to stand by and take it baby, all for lovin' you.  
Drown myself in sorrow as I look at what you've done.  
But nothing seemed to change, the bad times stayed the same,  
And I can't run.  
  
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,  
Like I been tied to the whippin' post.  
Tied to the whippin' post, tied to the whippin' post.  
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'.  
  
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,  
Like I been tied to the whippin' post.  
Tied to the whippin' post, tied to the whippin' post.  
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'.
