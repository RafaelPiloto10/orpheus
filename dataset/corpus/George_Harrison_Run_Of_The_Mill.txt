Everyone has choice  
Whether to or not to raise their voices  
It's you that decides  
Which way you will turn  
While feeling that our love's not your concern  
It's you that decides  
  
No one around you, will carry the blame for you  
No one around you, will love you today  
And throw it all away  
  
Tomorrow when you rise  
Another day for you to realize me  
Or send me down again  
As the days stand up on end  
You've got me wondering how I lost your friendship  
But I see it in your eyes  
  
Though I'm beside you I can't carry the lame for you  
I may decide to get out with your blessing  
Where I'll carry on guessing  
  
How high will you leap?  
Will you make enough for you to reap it?  
Only you'll arrive  
At your own made end  
With no one but yourself to be offended  
It's you that decides
