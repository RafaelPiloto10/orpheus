[Chorus:]  
Moli I I I na where you goin' to ?  
Moli I I I na where you goin' to ?  
  
She's daughter to the mayor  
Messin' with the sheriff  
Drivin' in a blue car  
She don't see no red light  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
She's comin' in the mornin'  
Lookin' a disaster  
Drivin' in the prowl car  
Spent the night in jail  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sheriff gonna go far  
Drivin' to the state house  
If she makes a million  
Papa can retire  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(repeat to fade)
