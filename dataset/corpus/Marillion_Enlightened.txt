Bound up in this energy ball again  
Laughing and bouncin' off the magic  
Rollin' under like a surfboard in a wave  
Washin' me up ...I want to do it again  
  
Entwined in her arms  
Spinning around and submarine beneath the deep of her  
Climbing the forks of the lightning  
Building a rod for my back it's all right, it's all right  
  
Dreamin' a dream that only the sleepless know  
Chilling the afternoon in "Viva Vida"  
Watchin' the sun slide down the avenue  
So real...  
  
I feel...  
Dizzy to fever with this love  
The blues and the greys are waved away inside a day with her  
Riding the forks of the lightning  
Feeling the sparks along my back it's all right, it's all right  
  
I thought I was born to take and to damage  
But I'm giving and healing and feeling  
Ultramarine and ultra-serene  
Climbing the forks of the lightning  
She told me today it'll be okay it's all right, it's all right  
  
I'm a submarine in this ocean
