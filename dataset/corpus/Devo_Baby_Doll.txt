Baby doll, baby doll, baby doll...  
  
Girl of my dreams she don't love me  
Always the way it seems to be  
My baby doll  
My baby doll  
My baby doll  
baby doll, baby doll  
baby, baby doll  
baby babt doll  
my baby doll  
  
Light of my life she turns it on  
  
Over my head not close enough  
My baby doll, my baby doll  
Baby doll  
You look so good  
  
Baby doll  
You feel so big  
Baby doll  
You let me have it  
  
Why did you do it baby doll  
Quick-tempered queen knows what she wants  
And what I got is what its not  
My baby doll
