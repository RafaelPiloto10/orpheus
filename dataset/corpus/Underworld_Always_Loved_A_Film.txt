The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm  
The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm  
The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm  
The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm  
The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm  
The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm  
The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm  
  
The rhythm of legs moving in the sun  
The rhythm of an engine deep and throating  
The rhythm of a summer that you walked in  
  
The sound of a barking dog on a loop  
A plane rises in the crystal blue  
The rhythm of keys swinging in your hand  
The rhythm of light coming out of your fingers  
  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Heaven, heaven  
  
The rhythm of wheels the rhythm of heels  
As we fall into the sun  
She walk on silver she walk on gold  
Paints I love you on the alley walls  
From the eyes that hide behind black glasses  
Sunlight hits tell me what she passes  
  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Heaven, heaven  
  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
  
And I don't know if I love you more  
Than the way you used to love me  
And I don't know if I need you more  
Than the way you used to need me  
But it's  
  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Heaven, heaven  
  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Heaven, heaven  
  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Heaven, heaven  
  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Heaven, heaven  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Heaven, heaven
