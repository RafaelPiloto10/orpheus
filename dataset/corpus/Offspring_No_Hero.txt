Once you said you'd stick to it until the end  
I guess you lied, they call it suicide  
Now you're gone  
What was so wrong that you couldn't find a way to carry on?  
Second guess  
Did I do my best  
There was a friend I had  
  
[Chorus]  
Johnny was a weirdo  
So what did you expect?  
I ain't no fucking hero  
I'm just trying to survive myself  
  
I should have known you went through it alone  
I wonder why did you even try?  
You could have come to me  
I would have helped you see  
You could have found a way to carry on  
Second guess  
Did I do my best  
There was a friend I had...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Johnny's strange behavior was a tip-off,' they say  
But I ain't no fucking savior  
I'm just living day by day  
  
Little things, little lives hanging 'til the end  
I say it doesn't really mean nothing  
Telling truth, telling lies  
I used to have a friend  
I say it don't really mean nothing  
And I can't let this feeling go  
Let this feeling go  
Let this feeling go
