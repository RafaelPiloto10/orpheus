I have to say that we should finish it now  
Before we weaken 'cause we already know this is wrong  
I could give in, sometimes I think that I will  
Despite the temptation I try to be very strong  
In my reluctance seems a surprise  
It's not 'cause I don't want you  
  
But I just  
Know I must... Hesitate  
  
Because I still have that other girl  
In my head  
I still have that other girl in my head  
  
There may be ugly rumors that  
I have been lying  
There may be angry tears, but  
They're never worth the crying  
  
That is why  
Sometimes I... Hesitate  
  
Because I still have that other girl  
In my head  
I still have that other girl in my head  
I still have that other girl in my head
