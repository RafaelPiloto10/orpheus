Build on a loss to injury.  
Step back from a fallen dream.  
I stay and won't go easy.  
I stay for My Desire.  
  
My arm falls and strength is fading from my veins.  
I cling to a dream that once ruled my world.  
Been gone for so long without a second thought.  
I have misled but I won't let this wreck my world.  
  
That I have left without a trace.  
It takes all I have to forget.  
I wanted nothing more than to have my day.  
This dream still lives inside of.  
  
Hold on to every emotion.  
Go further with every step.  
I asked for with every wish, but now I find it almost gone.  
Misguided, another day has come and gone without the truth.  
  
But this will never fade my world.  
That I have left without a trace.  
It takes all I have to forget.  
I wanted nothing more than to have my day.  
  
This dream still lives inside of me.  
This will never fade.  
This dream will never fade!  
As each day goes on the chance for my day slips away.  
  
I will not forget my home, my world, my home.
