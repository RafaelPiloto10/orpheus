"My turn this time," he says.  
"Never get better than this,  
We never get better than bad. "  
"My turn this time," he said.  
"Now I can do what I want,  
Now I can walk away mad. "  
"Cause last time we tried," he said.  
"We never get anywhere  
We never solve anything. "  
"It's my turn this time," he said.  
And sticks out his chin like a man  
Sticks out his chin like a man  
"My turn this time," they cried.  
And everyone walks in a line  
Around in a circle until they die  
"My turn this time," they scream.  
And diamonds and babies and cars...  
Don't add up to anything  
"My turn this time," she says.  
"I wish we could talk a bit more,  
Just give me a little more time. "  
"My turn this time," she says.  
"My children are growing up mad,  
They never get anywhere. "  
This time she starts to cry  
And everyone stares at the ground  
Nobody says a word  
"You get one chance each life," she sighs.  
"And mine is just passing me by."  
He walks out the door and she stares up at the ceiling  
"My turn this time," they cry.  
And everyone walks in a line  
Around in a circle until they die  
"My turn this time," they scream.  
And diamonds and babies and cars...  
Don't add up to anything, at all  
"My turn this time," he says.  
And he turns the radio on  
And he turns the radio off  
"My turn this time," she says.  
And she laughs at her self  
And she laughs at her self  
And the sun goes down  
And the sun comes up
