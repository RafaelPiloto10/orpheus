Oh, the night is growing colder,  
And the stars have lost their shine  
And I have been forsaken,  
By everything I thought was mine  
For in the darkest hour,  
When the final story's told  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter how bright I glittered, baby,  
I could never be gold.  
  
You gave up your finest treasure,  
For the one you saw in me  
But how could I know the measure,  
Of all you needed me to be  
Though I came with sweet intentions,  
More my pockets could not hold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I finally gave up counting,  
The ways you said I let you down  
When I fell into that river of no return,  
And you watched me drown  
Oh I could sparkle like a diamond,  
Have silver line my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You looked so high and low for heaven,  
I tried so hard to show the way  
But though I flew on wings of angels,  
My feet were always made of clay  
I could come trailing clouds of glory,  
But you saw nothing to behold  
  
[Chorus: x2]
