Young blood where you going now  
Young blood where you going now  
  
I didn't mind it when you left me honey  
But i miss you ain't the truth  
I haven't give up hanging on the phone  
But all i hear is the proof  
  
One more night and  
I'm thinking what's going wrong  
You say you love me but  
Does love take this long  
  
You paint a picture you tell a story  
Oh the tangled web that you leave  
I hear the whispers the candid talking  
Arid i don't know what to believe  
  
One more night and  
I'm thinking what's going wrong  
You say you love me but  
Does love take this long  
  
Where do all these dreams have broken  
Right or left it's stolen  
Stop your running away  
  
Young blood ooh tell me  
Where you going now  
Young blood ooh tell me  
Where you going now  
  
It's never never nothings forever  
Turning gold in our hands  
There's no magic it all seems tragic  
'Cause it's slipped through our fingers like sand  
  
One more night and  
I'm thinking what's going wrong  
You say you love me but  
Does love take this long  
  
Where do all these dreams have broken  
Right or left it's stolen  
Stop your running away  
  
Run run running away
