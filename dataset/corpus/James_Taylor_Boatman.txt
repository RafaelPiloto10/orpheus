Hearts were exploding around us  
As we drifted south down the bay.  
The gray up above and gray down below  
Left us with nothing to say.  
So we drifted along in silence  
Till the tickle of life trickled in.  
And the rhythm began in the hiss of the sand,  
We were catching fire again.  
  
Oh boatman, I am the river,  
I am the mountain and the sea.  
Oh boatman, taker and giver,  
Can you deliver me?  
I would forever run free.  
  
Yeah, we finally caught up with legends,  
We were walking along side by side.  
We worked out a plan to go out hand in hand,  
The long trail just wasn't that wide.  
The water around us was freezing,  
We just laughed and threw ourselves in.  
And although we were old,  
The sting of that cold pumped up the feeling,  
Here it is again.  
  
Oh boatman, I am the river,  
I am the mountain and the sea.  
Oh boatman, taker and giver,  
Can you deliver me?  
I would forever run free.  
  
Oh, I'm a message in a bottle  
Drifting along on a deep blue sea.  
Waiting for some foreign shore,  
Ready for something to be.  
  
No longer afraid of falling,  
We cut the strings to the sky.  
We found lever ground  
And we put ourselves down,  
Amazing we all didn't die.  
We took each moment as given,  
By second they came.  
The ice and the sun  
And the thundering guns,  
Good God I was finally sane.  
  
Oh boatman, I am the river,  
I am the mountain and the sea.  
Oh boatman, taker and giver,  
Can you deliver me?  
Oh holy roller,  
I am the river,  
I am the mountain and the sea.  
Oh boatman, taker and giver,  
Can you deliver me?  
I would forever run free.
