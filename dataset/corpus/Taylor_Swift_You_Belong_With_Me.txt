You're on the phone with your girlfriend  
She's upset  
She's going off about something that you said  
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do  
I'm in my room  
It's a typical Tuesday night  
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like  
And she'll never know your story like I do'  
  
But she wears short skirts  
I wear T-shirts  
She's cheer captain  
And I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you wake up  
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time  
  
If you can see I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans  
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be  
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself  
Hey isn't this easy  
  
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town  
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down  
You say your fine  
I know you better then that  
Hey what you doing with a girl like that  
  
She wears high heels  
I wear sneakers  
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming about the day when you wake up  
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time  
  
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
  
Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time how could you not know  
Baby, you belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night  
I'm the one who makes you laugh  
When you know you're about to cry  
And I know your favorite songs  
And you tell me about your dreams  
I think I know where you belong  
I think I know it's with me  
  
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
  
Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time  
How could you not know  
Baby you belong with me  
You belong with me  
  
You belong with me  
Have you ever thought just maybe  
You belong with me  
You belong with me
