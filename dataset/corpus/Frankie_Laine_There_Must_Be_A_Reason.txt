There must be a reason for raindrops to fall.  
There must be a reason why mountains are tall.  
And why are the stars in the sky?  
There must be a reason why.  
There must be a reason for rivers to flow.  
For beautiful trees and flowers to grow.  
And why have the birds wings to fly?  
There must be a reason why.  
The changes from season to season,  
The dawning that brings the new day.  
These wonders mist all have a reason,  
It was intended that way.  
There must be a reason for falling in love,  
It must have been planned up in Heaven above.  
And why are we so much in love, you and I?  
There must be a reason why.  
The changes from season to season,  
The dawning that brings the new day.  
These wonders mist all have a reason,  
It was intended that way.  
There must be a reason for falling in love,  
It must have been planned up in Heaven above.  
And why are we so much in love, you and I?  
There must be a reason why.  
There must be a reason why.
