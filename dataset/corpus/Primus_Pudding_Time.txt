You can have a lolly pop  
A candy bar, a jelly bean  
I'll buy you a rainbow to hang above your door  
  
It's pudding time  
  
Laughter is a sweet you can't put a price on  
When laughter's all gone, Daddy won't buy you more  
  
It's pudding time, children  
  
Money, money, money to buy you things  
Daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring  
  
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall!  
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall!  
All kings horses and all the kings men  
Couldn't put Humpty together again!  
  
San Franciso the striped bass are dying  
But you're gonna get that brand new bike  
  
Oh joy  
  
It's pudding time  
It's pudding time, children!!!  
  
Pudding time, children
