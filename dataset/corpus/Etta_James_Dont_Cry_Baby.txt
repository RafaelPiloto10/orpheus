Don't cry, don't cry baby  
Don't cry baby  
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again  
And oh, 'cause you know  
You know I didn't mean  
To ever treat you so mean  
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart  
And let's try it over again  
  
And oh, don't cry  
Don't cry baby  
Don't cry, don't cry  
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again  
And oh, 'cause you know, you know I didn't mean  
To ever treat you so mean  
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart  
And let's try it over again  
  
Don't cry, don't cry baby  
Don't cry baby  
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again  
And oh, 'cause you know  
You know I didn't mean  
To ever treat you so mean  
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart  
And let's try it over again
