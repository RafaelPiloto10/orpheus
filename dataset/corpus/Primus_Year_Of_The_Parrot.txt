In the year of our Lord  
Call it 1994  
A fine vintage of mimicry  
  
There are those that take their sound  
From someone else's toil  
Liking to parrots you see  
  
I've seen the likes of Kate Bush  
And Van Morrison  
Teaching the parrots to sing  
  
Take a Zeppelin riff  
And you alter it a bit  
And make lots of money  
It's called plagiarism  
  
You want some of that cheese  
Just take a big ol' bite  
Careful not to choke on it please  
  
Now here we go  
It's called plagiarism
