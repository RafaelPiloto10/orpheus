Got my faith baby  
  
In the Lord  
  
Got my faith baby  
  
In the Lord Lord Lord  
  
And I know  
  
He'll make everything alright  
  
No matter where a child roam  
  
That child's gonna have a home  
  
If he's got his faith alright  
  
I don't believe in no car  
  
I don't believe in General Motors  
  
I don't believe in the President  
  
Or the League of Women Voters  
  
I don't believe in these things  
  
All these things might fail  
  
I don't believe it's gonna snow  
  
It might sleet rain or hail  
  
But I believe in the Father  
  
I believe in the Son  
  
I believe there's a Spirit  
  
For everyone  
  
I believe in the Father  
  
I believe in the Son  
  
I believe there's a Spirit  
  
For everyone  
  
That's not all  
  
That's not all  
  
I'm gonna tell y'all  
  
Let's do the faith call  
  
I said F----F  
  
I said A----A  
  
I said I----I  
  
I said T----T  
  
I said H----H  
  
What's that spell---Faith  
  
What's that spell---Faith  
  
Oh Faith
