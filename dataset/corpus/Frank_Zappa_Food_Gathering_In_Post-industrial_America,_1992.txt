"Food Gathering In Post-Industrial America, 1992."  
  
When the last decrepit factory has dumped its final load of toxic waste into
the water supply and shipped its last badly manufactured, incompetently
designed consumer thing, we gaze in astonishment as the denizens of NU-PERFECT
AMERICA, dine on rats (mmmmm), poodles, Styrofoam packing pellets, all
floating in a broth of tritium-enriched sewage, roasting the least diseased
body parts of abandoned wild children accumulating since the total ban on
abortion a few years back.
