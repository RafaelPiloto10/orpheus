You're only acting like  
You are somebody  
But I don't love to say  
You're not nobody  
  
Don't exhaust our painted face, girl  
'Cause underneath that face  
You're just have disgrace  
  
And you're just a brand new second hand  
You'll make no one fool  
You're just a brand new second hand  
I only confess you  
  
You're brand new second had  
Dirty golden rule  
You're just a brand new second hand  
  
What you've got, girl  
That I don't know  
Why you really really got to  
Exalt yourself so  
  
Mama used to tell me  
A long time ago, girl  
It's not everything you own  
That glitters is gold  
  
So you're just a brand new second hand  
No man no want no  
Brand new second hand  
You better go back round so girl  
  
Brand new second hand  
Don't you show us  
Brand new second hand  
  
If you think it's the dress you wear  
That makes you a lady  
Get that out of your mind  
You must be crazy  
  
You're just a brand new second hand, yes girl  
No man no want  
Brand new second hand, yes girl  
No bother come show off so  
You're just a brand new second hand
