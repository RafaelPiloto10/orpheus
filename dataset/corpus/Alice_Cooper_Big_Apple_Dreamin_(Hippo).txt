We're so young and pretty, we're so young and clean  
So many things that we have never seen  
Let's move from Ohio, sell this dam' old store  
Big Apple dreamin' on a wooden floor  
  
Skyscrapers and subways and stations  
Staring up at the United Nations  
  
New York is waiting for you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down  
New York, we're coming to see what you're made of  
Are you as great as you sound  
  
Heard about them massages, and all those dirty shows  
I read somewhere some places never close  
While we waste time on yokels, comin' through the door  
Big Apple dreamin' on a wooden floor  
  
Skyscrapers and subways and stations  
Staring up at the United Nations  
  
New York is waiting for you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down  
New York, we're coming to see what you're made of  
Are you as great as you sound  
  
New York is waiting for you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down  
New York, we're coming to see what you're made of  
Are you as tough as you sound  
  
Oh, New York is waiting for you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down, whoo-oo  
New York, we're coming, to see what you're made of  
Are you as tough as you sound  
  
Yeah, New York is waiting, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down,  
New York, we're coming, see what you're made of  
You can't be as tough as you sound  
  
Oh, New York, you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down,  
New York, we're coming see what you're made of  
Are you as great as you sound  
  
Oh, New York, Oh, New York we're coming  
Oh, we're coming to see what you're made of  
Oh, you can't be as tough as you sound  
Me and my baby, we're coming  
Oh, we're coming  
  
They're waiting for you and me, baby  
Oh... (Fading out dialog?)
