I like the snake on your tattoo  
I like the Ivy and the  
Ink blue, yayo, yeah you, yayo  
  
You have to take me right now  
From this dark trailer park  
Life now, yayo, how now, yayo  
  
Put me onto your black motorcycle  
Fifties baby doll dress for my 'I do"  
It only takes two hours to Nevada  
I wear your sparkle  
You call me your mama  
  
Let me put on a show for you daddy  
Let me put on a show  
Let me put on a show for you tiger,  
Let me put on a show  
  
I need you like  
A baby when I hold you  
Like a drug  
Like I told you  
  
Yayo, yes you, yayo  
  
Put me onto your black motorcycle  
Fifties baby doll dress for my 'I do"  
It only takes two hours to Nevada  
I wear your sparkle  
You call me your mama  
  
Let me put on a show for you daddy  
Let me put on a show  
Let me put on a show for you tiger  
Let me put on a show  
  
Hello Heaven  
You are a tunnel lined with yellow lights  
On a dark night (Dark night)  
  
Yayo, yes you, yayo  
  
Put me onto your black motorcycle  
Fifties baby doll dress for my 'I do"  
It only takes two hours to Nevada  
I wear your sparkle  
You call me your mama  
  
Let me put on a show for you daddy  
Let me put on a show  
Let me put on a show for you tiger  
Let me put on a show
