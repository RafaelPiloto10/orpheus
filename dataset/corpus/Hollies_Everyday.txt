Every day, it's a-getting closer  
Going faster than a roller coaster  
Love like yours will surely come my way  
  
Every day, it's a a-getting faster  
Everyone says go ahead and ask her  
Love like yours will surely come my way

Every way loves a little stronger  
Come what may, do you ever long for  
True love from me?
