Yeah, sup Ro, sup Grace, this your boy Den Den  
To jump on this track with you boys, knowI'mtalkingbout  
It's all about the third baby, third coast, yeah I got this  
  
See I'm mentally ready, fuck those is testing me  
Progress is so sweet, ain't tripping with envy  
Slip and slide like a snake, pop up the world like a quake  
Mashing hard on the gas, with the coast on the plate  
  
Roll on cowards and busters, peeping them soldiers and hustlers  
Got an eye for them fuckers that trying P.H. with snorkels  
Got a trunk full of clutches, blinding mine make you stutter  
I blow like a hurricane, so close all your shutters  
  
See I wants everything and everything I'm gone have  
Roll out my red carpet just to go to my stash  
Third coast, blind and shine like a brand new slab  
On my birthday, I'm throwing me a fortune on pad  
  
[Chorus]  
If you living shife, don't fuck with third coast  
These niggas can't fade third coast, these niggas can't fade  
Third coast  
You could lose your life, don't fuck with third coast  
These niggas can't fade third coast, these niggas can't fade  
Third coast  
  
This how we ride in third, blow up serve, blow herb  
From lane to lane we grip the grain and 20's chop up the curb  
We popping flippers on sippers, hey those g's on the rise  
With bubble eyes and customized and chrome twenty inches wide  
  
Entertainment center be lit up, and all the trunks gone lift up  
Button rims they grip up, the talkers mouths gone zip up  
It's that time and here we come, third coast take a stand  
We drew it up and screwed them up and see went through with the  
  
Plan  
Jumped in the mix with hundred bricks and now a mobbing gorilla  
You had to miss go get her, about the scrilla my nigga  
Stay loaded up and we ready, Box City working that jelly  
  
Burning more streets than pereddy, while cutting up like  
Machetes  
No doubt screwed up candy paint, killer think straight drink  
  
Down here we swinging the tank, and every thought be bout bank  
I'm a be T from the S.U.C. pay dues got stripes that be ranks  
That boy G-are-A-see-E third ward born caught off game  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I done took a lot of losses now it's time to win  
No more signing dotted lines and I stay dollars spend  
I want convertible benz, with the blue bubble lens  
I'm worth a million off the corner when I'm pimping my pen  
  
See bubble gray is my choice, pearl white Rolls Royce  
Don't need no natural lemon tea I don't be training my voice  
I'm signed over by nature, suckers, punchers, simps and fakers  
A click full of back breakers and more in a Studebaker  
  
The Mo City don, I wave a truck like it's a warrant  
Hit the ATM machine, ain't no need for me to pawn  
'Cause I'm paid, my game sharper than a razor blade  
Bald faded and X-rated, my Gucci's is tailor made  
  
I bubble in the sauna as I smoke marijuana  
From Daytona to Arizona no longer on the corner  
World wide, I got to keep the dream alive  
Tupac and Biggie done died, so now they ready for the south side  
  
Top, dropping, body rocking the Fat Pat  
Dirty rats get splat when I pull out my black mac  
'Cause it's over, the fat lady done sung the song  
From California to Rome, these hoes pussies stay warm  
  
And on to the Alamo Dome, then right back home  
Ain't no regular we hydro as 4 54  
On the boards, be spinning flipping with yellow boned women  
Swimming in dividends cause I'm cold when I'm pimping  
  
[Chorus]
