[Chorus]  
Breath of God, breathe on us  
We adore You, come before You  
To magnify Your name  
  
Breath of God, fill this place  
With your spirit drawing near us  
We'll never be the same  
  
Mighty God  
You are endless in power and mercy  
Be glorified  
We exalt You and lift up Your name  
Lord of all  
King of heaven and earth  
You are holy, holy  
  
Breath of God, breathe on us  
Come so sweetly and completely  
As we seek Your face  
  
Breath of God, reign in our hearts  
And restore us, stay before us  
To lead us all our days  
  
[Chorus][  
Breath of God  
You are endless in power and mercy  
Breathe on us  
We exalt You and lift up Your name  
Lord of all  
King of heaven and earth  
You are holy, holy, holy, holy  
Breath of God, breathe on us
