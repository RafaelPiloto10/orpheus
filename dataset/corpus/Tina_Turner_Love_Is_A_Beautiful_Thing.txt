Been so long since I left you  
Do all the things you used to do  
In all this time I can't forget you  
Everywhere I turn I think of you  
And I, I want to trust you baby  
You, you're all I need  
Soul to soul, Fire to fire  
Nothing like this man's desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one, you and me  
Baby it's our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing  
Love is such a sweet emotion  
I want to share it all with you  
With your trust and endless devotion  
There ain't nothing in this world we can't do  
Tonight, I want to thank you baby  
You, you make my life complete  
Soul to soul, fire to fire  
Nothing like this man's desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one, you and me  
Maybe it's our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing  
Tonight, I want to thank you baby  
You, you make my soul complete  
Soul to soul, fire to fire  
Nothing like this man's desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one, you and me  
Maybe it's our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing
