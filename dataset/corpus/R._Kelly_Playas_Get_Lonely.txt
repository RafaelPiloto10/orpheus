Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too...  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too...  
[Verse 1:]  
From, my iPhone to my sidekick  
Jet planes, schedule hectic  
My love life, I neglect it  
Had a fast car, but I wrecked it  
Plenty chances to fall in love man  
So many weekends, I went to clubs man  
In the fast lane, my life's a picture flick  
Let my drink decide, who is the next chick  
I ain't gone lie,all the blanck it matter to me  
She say she me love me, but it's just chit chatter to me  
But deep inside I was always missing something  
But I'm a thug so I'm always on something  
So many girls always drinking and having fun  
Life's a beauty shop and I keep my hair done  
Seem like I'm on a marry go ride  
Man it makes a thug wanna settle down,  
[Chorus:]  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too...(oh I do)  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too... (... and you know I do)  
[Verse 2:]  
I wanna settle down with you  
Baby you and me  
A Life that's brand new  
Quit running these streets  
Take away your pain  
Chase away the rain  
Off my love game  
I might even change my name  
[Chorus:]  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too..(oh I do)  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too (... and you know I do)  
[Verse 3:]  
Uh, uh V.I.P.  
Uh, uh R.O.B  
Always in the spot light  
Living the good life  
All of that something still just ain't right  
Videos and all of these interviews  
When all I really want is to be next to you  
I spend more time with my cars now  
Land of the Hollywood sign, I'm a star now  
My life is more than the cars and awards  
It gets lonely and I can't ignore  
Always in the streets going hardcore  
I spend a couple of G's when I'm bored  
[Chorus:]  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too (oh I do)  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... (oh I do) too (... and you know I do)  
[Verse 4:]  
Party lights mixed with lonely  
Nights mixed with birds grass  
Flights mixed with,  
Nobody to share it with  
Out of all the, after parties  
I still need somebody  
To be there when a playa's going through some shit  
To be there when a playa can't ever see...  
[Chorus:]  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too  
Holdin in my drop,tilling on top and it don't stop no...  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too  
Every now and then I need somebody...  
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes  
Playas get lonely too... too (oh I do,I do...)  
Playas get lonely,R.O.B,12 play 4th quarter,players get lonely too
