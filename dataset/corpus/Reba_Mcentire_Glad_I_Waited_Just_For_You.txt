Use to be (Use to be)  
Love was mean to me  
Every love I tried my heart cried that won't do  
Now you see (Now you see)  
Love's been good to me I guess my love was waiting just for you  
You and me (You and me) (You and me)  
Go so well as we  
Fit right to a T  
Can't you see we do  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Gotta say (Gotta say) (Gotta say)  
Your love's got a way  
Of making me glad  
I waited just for you  
I should have known  
That my heart could not be wrong
