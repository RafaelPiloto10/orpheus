You were pure to me as fresh untraveled snow  
Skin as soft as a petal, of an uncut rose  
I gave you all I had everything I own  
Right down to the pedestal, I put you on  
And it was so easy to love you  
So hard to walk away  
Well this morning when I woke up  
I knew everything had changed  
But it ain't so simple for a man  
Whose whole world he has to rearrange  
  
[Chorus]  
Said you found something in another  
You just couldn't find in me  
Baby I love you so much  
But I guess I'll have to set you free  
And it was so easy to love you  
So hard to walk away  
I've been pleading with my maker  
To ease this pain and take my pride  
But it still feels like my hearts been  
Laid open wide  
My hands are shaking and I think  
Of all I have to do  
My life will never be the same  
Not like it was with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lord it was so easy to love you  
so hard to walk away
