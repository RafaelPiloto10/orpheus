Me and Jimmie Rodgers used to ride them rollin' boxcars in the summer time  
Jimmie he'd play his guitar I'd lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine  
Me and Audie Murphy used to crawl out on our bellies through the German lines  
Audie I won't leave you here  
I'll pull you through cause you know you're a friend of mine  
Me and Phil Rizzuto didn't we move like lightnin' round there on the double
play  
I'd look over in the stands and Marilyn would see me and she'd smile and wave  
Hell no Coach Lombadi this old broken back ain't nothin' if the game is saved  
And fellers if I don't pull through just put a little golden football on my
grave  
John Wayne he once said to me them Japs they'll take that Island  
And we've got to save the old Red White and Blue  
Someone's got to swim out to that submarine and warn 'em  
You know T I hate like hell to ask you to  
Me and Sugar Ray we used to spar together up there an old Stillman's Gym  
Knowin' someday it would be the garden and the championship for me or him  
And Coop if no one in this town is man enough to back you when Frank Miller
comes  
Come High Noon I'll walk with you I've had a few but I know how to use a gun  
[ ac.guitar ]  
Betty Grable don't you cry you know you can be a star  
And with my drinkin' I'd just hold you back  
So go on sign the contracts kid  
I'll read about you in some old newspaper from some rack  
Cause me and Jimmie Rodgers we still ride them rollin' boxcars in the summer
time  
Jimmie he plays his guitar I lay back and watch the stars and sip my wine  
Me and Audie Murphy we still crawl out on our bellies through the German lines  
At away there's scooner shoot that ball to me and I swear we'll get two this
time  
(So what's old Hank I said Hank I wrote a real good song and he said lemme
hear it  
I went out of a truck to give my guitar to rest is hist'ry)
