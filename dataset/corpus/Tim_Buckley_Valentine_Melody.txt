You came to me with fire inside  
Your movements and your pride  
And asking to be rescued from  
The pain you had become  
I tore apart the prison and I hid you in my hand  
In the blue light of Christmas-time, Santa Claus was kind  
I wonder if you'll ever grow  
Oh far enough to throw  
Away the lies of no and yes  
And love my quietness  
Or will you only freeze and frown and lose what you have found?  
In the white light of Easter seas'n will you live again?  
Today the coin is in the air  
And we are here and there  
And where and when have caught us in  
The web of violence  
I pray to all the world as one that day will bring the sun  
In the scarlet light of Valentine's our paper hearts are blind
