I met her... But I never thought  
She'd belong to me  
I just wanted someone I could sing to  
Who'd listen to every song  
Oh, I just wanted someone I could cling to  
Cling to all night long  
  
So I kissed her... But I never thought  
She'd belong to me  
And when I felt her lips I skipped a heartbeat  
'Cause I was so in love with this girl  
Oh, and how many times does your heart meet  
The most beautiful girl in the world  
  
So I thought and thought about her  
I just couldn't stop thinking about her  
And I died when she called me up and said  
She couldn't stop thinking about me  
  
Now I love her... but I never thought  
She'd belong to me  
Now guys are calling wanting to be boyfriends  
But they're going to have to answer to me  
Oh, 'cause I'm going to tell all those toy friends  
That she belongs to me
