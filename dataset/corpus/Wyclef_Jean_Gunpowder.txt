she said your brother had... he just died  
  
Well I told him not to go outside  
  
he said he had to fight for his country's right  
  
But don't you know that mo-mother  
  
don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no  
  
Because the war is not over  
  
until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence  
  
But I smell gunpowder (pow)  
  
my brother's been dead ever since  
  
I didn't believe it, but when I saw him I was convinced  
  
Two shots to the head he was already dead Lord,  
  
I headed for revenge in the city of Port Au Prince  
  
Screaming bro-brother  
  
don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no  
  
Because the war is not over  
  
until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence  
  
But I smell gunpowder (Pow)  
  
Zion's gunpowder (pow)  
  
L.A.'s gunpowder (pow)  
  
I want to know why  
  
Christians pray for a new day  
  
we don't need no, we don't need no, we don't need no  
  
But its still the same way  
  
I want to know why  
  
ghetto people pray for a new day  
  
hey, hey, heeey  
  
and its still the same way  
  
But the preacher man told me  
  
good things come to those who wait  
  
do good things come to those who wait?  
  
I want to know tell me  
  
good things come to those who wait  
  
do good things come to those who wait?  
  
we want to know, we want to know, we want to know [pause]  
  
Pe-people  
  
don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no  
  
because the war is not over  
  
until you can feel love, peace, and hear the silence  
  
but I smell gunpowder (gunpowder)  
  
Brooklyn's gunpowder (gunpowder)  
  
Shaolin's gunpowder (gunpowder)  
  
Uptown's gunpowder (gunpowder)  
  
Jersey's gunpowder (gunpowder)

Australia's gunpowder (gunpowder)
