Where hath the apostles gone?  
Joining hands with wicked ones  
Revelation has come to pass  
New world order will hold the mass  
  
A book written by the man  
Used to control and command  
All rights will be denied,  
Without the mark you shall die  
  
[Chorus]  
No confession, all is known, all is known  
New world order, you shall be shown shall be shown  
No confession, all is known, all is known  
New world order, you shall be shown shall be shown  
  
Monitoring all wages  
New world order comes in stages  
Currency is obsolete  
Feel the agony of defeat  
  
Symbol of society today,  
A must have or you shall pay  
As humans flesh leads the mind  
Just as a pawn the last martyr dies  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where hath the apostles gone?  
Joining hands with wicked ones  
Revelation has come to pass  
New world order complete disorder, will hold the mass
