Alone on my steel horse I ride  
The engine echoes in the night  
Through a concrete jungle a wasteland i call home  
No fears and no regrets  
No apologies for the things I've said  
And believe me child it's the life I've known  
  
I will ride on through the night  
From this hell I will survive  
It's all I've done, it's who I am  
Just know this  
I've done the best I can  
  
I see fallen angels and broken dreams  
I'm still surviving on these streets  
Like forgotten soldiers left here to die  
All your pain I understand  
Give me your love, you take my hand  
And from this wasteland we will ride  
  
We will ride on through the night  
From this hell we will survive  
Give me your faith give me your hand  
All I know we've done the best we can  
  
I will ride on through the night  
From this hell I will survive  
It's all I've done, it's who I am  
Just know this  
I've done the best I can  
  
We will ride on through the night  
From this hell we will survive  
Give me your faith give me your hand  
All I know we've done the best we can
