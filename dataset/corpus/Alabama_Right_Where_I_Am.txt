Subways runnin' under the city  
Condos reachin' to the sky  
Each of this own, but I feel at home  
Standing on this mountain high  
  
And right where I am  
Is where I want to be  
It's all I want  
It's all I need  
Forever in your arms  
It's alright with me  
'Cause right where I am's where I want to be  
  
Talk on the cell phone, checkin' her e-mail  
The fax is a way of life  
She's shoppin' at home with QVC on  
And surfin' on-line  
  
And right where I am  
Is where I want to be  
It's all I want  
It's all I need  
Forever in your arms  
It's alright with me  
'Cause right where I am's where I want to be  
  
Satellite feed out in the country  
Oh what a way of life  
Turn off the tv  
Shut down the pc  
And click off the world tonight  
  
And right where I am  
Is where I want to be  
It's all I want  
It's all I need  
Forever in your arms  
It's alright with me  
'Cause right where I am's where I want to be  
  
Yeah  
Right where I am  
Where I want to be  
  
Subways runnin' under the city  
Satellite feed out in the country  
Each to his own I feel at home  
Standin' on this mountain high  
Right where I am  
Right where I am, where I want to be  
Where I want to be
