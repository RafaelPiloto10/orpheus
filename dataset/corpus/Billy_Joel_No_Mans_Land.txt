I've seen those big machines come rolling through the quiet pines  
Blue suits and bankers with their Volvos and their valentines  
Give us this day our daily discount outlet merchandise  
Raise up a multiplex and we will make a sacrifice  
Now we're gonna get the big business  
Now we're gonna get the real thing  
Everybody's all excited about it  
Who remembers when it all began  
Out here in no man's land  
Before they passed the master plan  
Out here in no man's land  
Low supply and high demand  
Here in no man's land  
There ain't much work out here in our consumer power base  
No major industry, just miles and miles of parking space  
This morning's paper says our neighbor's in a cocaine bust  
Lots more to read about Lolita and suburban lust  
Now we're gonna get the whole story  
Now we're gonna be in prime time  
Everybody's all excited about it  
Who remembers when it all began  
Out here in no man's land  
We've just begun to understand  
Out here in no man's land  
Low supply and high demand  
Here in no man's land  
I see these children with their boredom and their vacant stares  
God help us all if we're to blame for their unanswered prayers  
They roll the sidewalks up at night, this place goes underground  
Thanks to the condo kings there's cable now in Zombietown  
Now we're gonna get the closed circuit  
Now we're gonna get the Top 40  
Now we're gonna get the sports franchise  
Now we're gonna get the major attractions  
Who remembers when it all began  
Out here in no man's land  
Before the whole world was in our hands  
Out here in no man's land  
Before the banners and the marching bands  
Out here in no man's land  
Low supply and high demand  
Here in no man's land
