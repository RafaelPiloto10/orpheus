Cause it's a bittersweet symphony this life  
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah  
No change, I can't change, I can't change, I can't change,  
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold  
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next  
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
Well I never pray,  
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah  
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah  
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now  
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now  
  
No change, I can't change, I can't change, I can't change,  
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold  
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next  
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
(Well have you ever been down?)  
(I can't change, I can't change)  
  
Cause it's a bittersweet symphony this life  
Trying to make ends meet, trying to find some money then you die  
You know I can't change, I can't change, I can't change,  
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold  
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next  
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)  
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)  
(It's just sex and violence melody and silence)  
(Been down)  
(Ever been down)  
(Ever been down)
