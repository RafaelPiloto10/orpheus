There you go making mountains  
Out of such a little hill  
Here I go mixing mortar  
For another wall to build  
There's a struggle in this life we lead  
It's partly you  
It's partly me (but)  
Every road that's traveled  
Teaches something new  
Every road that's narrow  
Pushes us to choose  
And I'd be lying if I said  
I had not tried to leave a time or two  
But every road that leads me  
Leads me back to you  
Here we stand in the middle  
Of what we've come to know  
It's a dance, it's a balance  
Holding on and letting go  
But there is nothing that we can't resolve  
When love's at stake  
When love's involved
