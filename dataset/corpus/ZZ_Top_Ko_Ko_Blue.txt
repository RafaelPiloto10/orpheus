One, two, whatcha gonna do?  
Can you come and see me tonight?  
Black, white, feel alright  
if you could in broad daylight.  
  
If I could get to see her  
you know I'd try to please her,  
oh my Ko Ko.  
Don't try to ask me why,  
she set my soul on fire,  
oh my Ko Ko Blue,  
oh my Ko Ko Blue.  
  
You're hot, the cold, I'm rollin' low,  
jukin' down to twelve midnight  
on ice cream, you know what I mean.  
I think I got flavor you'll like.  
  
If I could get to see her  
you know I'd try to please her,  
oh my Ko Ko.  
Don't try to ask me why,  
she set my soul on fire,  
oh my Ko Ko Blue,  
oh my Ko Ko Blue.  
  
Hillbilly Willy, he's quite a guy  
from eatin' some of Ko Ko's pie.  
She's nice if you ask her twice.  
Ask him and he'll testify.  
  
If I could get to see her  
you know I'd try to please her,  
oh my Ko Ko.  
Don't try to ask me why,  
she set my soul on fire,  
oh my Ko Ko Blue,  
oh my Ko Ko Blue.
