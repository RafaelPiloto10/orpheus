Annie, girl, let's play house  
And you can show me what that's 'bout  
Girl, nobody beat the pussy up like me  
Who you know that beat the pussy up like me?  
Girl, I'm gonna lay you on your back  
Bam-bam, beat it like that  
I'mma do it to ya, do it to ya  
I'mma do it to ya, if you, if you let me  
Girl, I'll do it to ya, I'll do it to ya  
Girl, I'll do it to ya, do it to ya  
Eat it, beat it, bang like ah!  
  
I know you had a long day baby, I know!  
The 9 to 5 shift probably seem like all day baby  
You're 'bout your money so you're probably working overtime huh?  
'Cause that minimum wage just ain't enough  
Long as your'e getting it, more power to ya  
Make a nigga wanna be the guy to give it to ya  
Long as you're not sitting up on your ass  
That'll make a real man say hallelujah!  
You got a son and you're raising him by yourself  
You need a real one in your life  
It ain't no probably, it's obvious that  
Your baby daddy didn't do you right  
I got a mama, girl I know how to treat a woman  
I like dessert, girl I know to eat a woman  
Lay with it, then play with it, I beat it up  
I know I'm sinning but before I eat it I'll say my grace in it (What)

Girl, I'll do it to ya, do it to ya  
Eat it, beat it, bang like ah!  
  
I'm going down on you first  
The real definition of down to earth  
I ain't the one you ask to buy you a purse  
I'm the one to make your insides hurt  
From the back with your face in the pillow  
From that position I know that you can only take a little  
But missionary she can take the whole thang  
It's so good I have her screaming out my government name  
And she ain't never got to tell me how she want it  
I'm a real one baby, I'm already knowing  
She said her nigga's shit's weak  
'Cause he ain't make her nut and they was fucking 'til the morning  
You know it fire when she's telling you to nut in her  
But I'm a nigga, I'm thinking something up with her  
I know the homies might think a nigga's krazy  
But you could fuck around and have my first baby  
What?

Girl, I'll do it to ya, do it to ya  
Eat it, beat it, bang like ah!  
  
I said face down ass up  
That's the way we likes to fuck  
Do my dirt on the low  
That's the way shit's 'sposed to go  
  
But I be tryna hit it right at the wrong time  
I said it's yours, you say it's mine, shit we both lying  
We both tryna 69 and some more time  
My girl tryna FaceTime hitting both lines
