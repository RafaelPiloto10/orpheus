Then we saw  
Mission is dark  
Trapped between the rocks  
Blocking the waterfall  
The songs of dust  
The world would end  
The night was always falling  
The peacock in the snow  
  
And I tell myself,  
I don't know who I am  
And I tell myself,  
I don't know who I am  
My father ran the prison  
My father ran the prison  
  
I can only love you  
By hating him more  
That's not the truth,  
It's too big a word  
He believed  
That love is theft  
Love and war,  
The theft of love  
  
And I tell myself,  
I don't know who I am  
And I tell myself,  
I don't know who I am  
My father ran the prison  
My father ran the prison  
But I am a seer, I am a liar  
I am a seer, but I am a liar  
My father ran the prison  
My father ran the prison
