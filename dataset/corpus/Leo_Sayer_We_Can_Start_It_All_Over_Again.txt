Oh babe, what can I say to you  
Change what you're feeling inside?  
Oh babe, I've got to get close to you  
Please don't cast me aside  
You know I hate to see you looking so sad  
I can't stand to watch this good love go bad  
Let's stop and think about the good times that we had  
  
[Chorus]  
We can start it all (start it all) all over again  
And we can have it all (have it all) just a one more time  
We can start it all (start it all) all over again, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oo babe, don't look that way at me  
You know you're breaking my heart  
Oo babe, I'm as sorry as I can be  
Don't let this tear us apart  
Now let's forget about the tears that we cried  
It's gone, there ain't nothing to hide  
Come on baby, why can't we give it one more try?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just think about it babe, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Just think about it babe  
Oh baby, I acted like a fool  
You just trust me baby and I'll make it up to you  
  
I see your smile's returning  
I know you understand  
Come on baby  
All you got to do is take my hand  
I love you baby, we're gonna start it all again  
We'll have it down like nothing before, ah  
  
One more time, we can start it all (start it all) all over again  
We can have it all (have it all) yeah everything  
We can start it all (start it all) all over again  
We can have it all (have it all) yeah everything
