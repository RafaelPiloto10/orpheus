Oh I know it's hard for you to say it's over  
Well it's twice as hard for me to let you go  
Out there I hope you find a softer shoulder  
But before you leave there's something you should know  
  
[Chorus]  
I was glad to give my everything to you  
Yeah we almost made our every dream come true  
And though we didn't have the chance to see it through  
I was glad to give my everything to you  
  
Oh you say you need a little room for breathing  
Somehow I guess you know I'd understand  
And though you're hurting me  
I still can't help in believing  
I'd be glad if I could do it all again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I was glad to give my everything to you
