Get out of town  
Before it's too late my love  
Get out of town  
Be good to me please  
  
Why wish me harm  
Why not retire to a farm  
And be contented to charm  
The birds off the trees  
  
Just disappear  
I care for you much too much  
And when you're near, close to me dear  
We touch too much  
  
The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet  
That darling, it's getting me down  
So on your mark get set  
Get out of town
