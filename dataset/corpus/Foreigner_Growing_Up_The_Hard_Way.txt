He's got nothing to say, he's got no excuse  
He's just made that way, and he's gonna stay that way  
Like a dog on the loose in a firework display in a world of his own  
No, no, no, he won't back down or go running back home  
  
He's come a long way in life  
He's got a long way to go  
He don't even know, he don't care because  
He's growing up the hard way  
In and out of trouble every day  
Growing up the hard way  
Now no tellin' where you'll end up, boy  
  
And he's got nothing to say, like he's lost for the worlds, his mind is in a
daze  
That's his way, it's just a little game he plays  
He's got nowhere to run while the city sleeps he wanders alone  
Cuttin' through the steel and the hearts of stone  
  
He's come a long way in life  
He's got a long way to go  
He don't even know, but he don't care because  
He's growing up the hard way  
In and out of trouble every day  
Growing up the hard way  
You'd better walk the straight and narrow  
  
Growing up the hard way  
In and out of trouble every day  
Growing up the hard way  
Never know what you're in for, boy  
  
He's come a long way in life  
He's got a long way to go  
He don't wanna know, and he don't care because  
He's growing up the hard way  
In and out of trouble every day  
He's growing up the hard way  
Yeah, and he's gonna stay that way  
You see, he's growing up the hard way  
Walk the straight and narrow yeah, maybe someday  
But still he's growing up the hard way  
It's just the way he's grown up  
Yeah, growing up the hard way  
There ain't no other way  
Growing up the hard way
