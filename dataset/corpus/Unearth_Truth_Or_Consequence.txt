We've bid our time  
All patience claimed  
Content with nothing  
Our lives lived not in vain  
  
Not in vain  
It's calling,  
It's calling  
I fear the hold as met is end  
  
It's truth or consequences  
Each wall built must fall  
It's truth or consequences  
This wall will fall  
  
I fear the hold as met is end  
  
I'm drowning  
Anger my bitter breath  
I'm drowning  
  
We've bid our time  
All patience claimed  
Content with nothing  
Our lives lived not in vain  
  
It's truth or consequences  
Each wall built must fall  
It's truth or consequences  
This wall will fall  
  
I'm drowning  
Anger my bitter breath  
It's calling  
Anger my bitter breath
