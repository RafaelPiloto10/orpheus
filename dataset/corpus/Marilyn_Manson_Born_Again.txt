Do you or don't you want this to be your song?  
It doesn't take a rebel to sing along  
This art is weak in its pretty, pretty frame  
And I'm your monkey with a misspelled name  
  
"I'll put down your disco  
And take your heart away  
I'll put down your disco  
And take your heart away"  
I'll be born again  
  
I'm someone else, I'm someone new  
I'm someone stupid, just like you  
I'm someone else, I'm someone new  
I'm someone stupid, just like you  
  
Do you don't you want to take this hit  
Does it make you feel like a part of "it"  
"And I'll put down your disco  
And take your heart away  
I'll put down your disco  
And take your heart away"  
I'll be born again  
  
I'm someone else, I'm someone new  
I'm someone stupid, just like you  
I'm someone else, I'm someone new  
I'm someone stupid, just like you  
I'm someone else, I'm someone new  
I'm someone stupid, just like you  
I'm someone else, I'm someone new  
I'm someone stupid, just like you  
  
The valley of the dolls  
Is the valley of the dead  
The valley of the dolls  
Is the valley of the dead  
  
I'm someone else, I'm someone new  
I'm someone stupid, just like you  
I'm someone else, I'm someone new  
I'm someone stupid, just like you  
"I'll put down your disco  
And take your heart away  
I'll put down your disco  
And take your heart away"  
I'll be born again  
I'll be born again  
I'll be born again  
I'll be born again
