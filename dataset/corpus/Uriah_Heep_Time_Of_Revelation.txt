Won't you take  
A chance my brother  
Follow me to a time of revelation  
Can't you see that  
Destiny will take a turn  
And show you  
There's no need to fight  
'Cause you know it's right  
  
And I finally see where I'm going  
I finally know what I'm knowing  
Now our journey's only just begun  
  
You won't need to ask forgiveness  
What you find  
Will be your inspiration  
You don't have to pray for glory  
All is equal, no more pain  
You know it's true, it's up to you  
  
'Cause I finally see where I'm going  
I finally know what I'm knowing  
Now our journey's only just begun  
  
Over the bridge  
Where you start to believe  
Down at the edge of the rainbow  
Dark is the night  
But we've seen another time  
Follow the light of the shadow  
  
Right or wrong, there is no reason  
There will be no hidden destination  
With the strength that you discover  
You can show the way  
How it was meant to be  
For all to see  
  
'Cause I finally know  
What I'm knowing  
I finally see where I'm going  
Now our journey's only just begun
