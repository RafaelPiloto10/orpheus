She's my kind of rain  
Like love in a drunken sky  
She's confetti falling down all night  
She sits quietly there  
Black water in a jar Says baby why you trembling like you are  
  
So I wait  
And I try  
I confess like a child  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's my kind of rain  
Like love from a drunken sky  
Confetti falling down all night  
She's my kind of rain  
  
She's the sunset's shadow  
She's like Rembrandt's light  
She's the history that's made at night  
She's my lost companion  
She's my dreamin' tree  
Together in this brief eternity  
  
Summer days  
Winter snow  
She's all things to behold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I wait  
And I try  
I confess all my crimes  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
She's my kind of rain  
Ohhhhh rain on me  
She's my kind of rain
