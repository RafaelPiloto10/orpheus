Friday night, seventeen  
Got my hands on the wheel  
But my mind is on Jeen  
Her silhouette  
I can't forget  
I'm gonna ask her yet  
My brothers truck, my Sunday slacks  
I've been working all week  
And I've got five bucks for gas  
And just for luck  
My grandfathers flask  
It's gonna take some nerve to ask  
Dance, Dance with me one more time,  
One more time  
Dance, Dance with me one more time  
Before the band is done  
Before your Daddy comes  
Dance, Dance with me one more time  
She's the apple of his eye  
And there's no way in hell  
He'll let her out of his sight  
There'll be trouble  
Maybe a fight  
If he knew what I had in mind  
I see it now, as plain as day  
A church and a chaplain  
On our wedding day  
Dressed in white  
She looks so fine  
You never know, she just might  
I'm gonna have to ask her tonight
