A warning sign  
I missed the good part, then I realized  
I started looking and the bubble burst  
I started looking for excuses  
Come on in  
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in  
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones  
That I started looking for a warning sign  
  
When the truth is  
I miss you  
Yeah the truth is  
That I miss you so  
  
A warning sign  
It came back to haunt me, and I realized  
That you were an island and I passed you by  
When you were an island to discover  
Come on in  
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in  
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones  
That I started looking for a warning sign  
  
When the truth is  
I miss you  
Yeah the truth is  
I miss you so  
And I'm tired  
I should not have let you go  
  
Oooooooo  
  
So I crawl back into your open arms  
Yes I crawl back into your open arms  
And I crawl back into your open arms  
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
