We who have so much to you who have so little  
to you who don't have anything at all  
We who have so much more than any one man does need  
and you who don't have anything at all, ah  
Does anybody need another million dollar movie  
does anybody need another million dollar star  
Does anybody need to be told over and over  
spitting in the wind comes back at you twice as hard  
  
Strawman, going straight to the devil  
strawman, going straight to hell  
Strawman, going straight to the devil  
  
Strawman  
strawman  
Strawman  
strawman, yes  
  
Does anyone really need a billion dollar rocket  
does anyone need a 60, 000 dollars car  
Does anyone need another president  
or the sins of Swaggart parts 6, 7, 8 and 9, ah  
Does anyone need yet another politician  
caught with his pants down and money sticking in his hole  
Does anyone need another racist preacher  
spittin' in the wind can only do you harm, ooohhh  
  
Strawman, going straight to the devil  
strawman, going straight to hell  
Strawman, going straight to the devil  
  
Strawman  
strawman  
Strawman  
strawman  
  
Does anyone need another faulty shuttle  
blasting off to the moon, Venus or Mars  
Does anybody need another self-righteous rock singer  
whose nose he says has led him straight to God  
Does anyone need yet another blank skyscraper  
if you're like me I'm sure a minor miracle will do  
A flaming sword or maybe a gold ark floating up the Hudson  
when you spit in the wind it comes right back at you  
  
Strawman, going straight to the devil  
Strawman, going straight to hell  
Strawman, going to the devil  
  
Strawman, strawman  
strawman, ...., ah  
Strawman  
strawman
