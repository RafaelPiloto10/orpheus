And today, I leave you  
But I'll be back someday  
And as I fly away  
My hope is that we'll meet again  
I'm off to my home away from home  
I will miss you  
But I know  
I know you know  
  
I'm coming home to Arizona  
I'm coming home to Arizona  
  
I'll take you everywhere I go  
I'll show you everything I see  
And as we say so long  
I know your tears wish me well  
It won't be long till I'm back again  
We will meet again  
We will meet again  
You will see, oh  
  
I'm coming home to Arizona  
I'm coming home
