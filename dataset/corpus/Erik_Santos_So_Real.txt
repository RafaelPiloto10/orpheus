You are the one in my life  
And I know it's you  
And all that I own and I have will give to you  
Oh all the love in this world  
This I offer you  
My love, my heart and my soul  
I'm giving it all  
  
I'm giving it all when I'm with you  
Living a life that's all brand new  
Oh nothing has ever made me feel so right  
Alright  
  
All of the things I do  
I do 'em all for you  
In love I will stay and remain  
  
That's what I would do  
For you are the love of my life  
And I promise you  
My love, my heart and my soul  
I'm giving it all  
  
[Bridge:]  
Life is all that I could spare  
This I want to share with you  
To prove my love for you  
Oh oh love  
Believe in me  
Forever I will cherish you
