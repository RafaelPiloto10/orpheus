What am I supposed to do with this time  
It tears so many holes, I stay afloat but I'm  
Feel out of control, so petrified  
I'm petrified  
  
What am I supposed to do to get by  
Did I lose everything I need to survive  
'Cause its 4 a.m. and the sweat sets in  
Did you get my message, did it send  
Or did you just get on with your life, oh  
  
I've taken time to think and I  
Don't think it's fair for us to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
I have this feeling when I  
Finally found the words to say  
But I can't tell you  
If you turn around and run away, run away  
  
What am I supposed to do with these clothes  
It's my twisted way of keep you close  
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man  
Did you get my message, did it send  
Or do you get along on your own, oh  
  
I've taken time to think and I  
Don't think it's fair for us to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
I have this feeling when I  
Finally found the words to say  
But I can't tell you  
If you turn around and run away, run away  
  
And it breaks me down when I see your face  
You look so different but you feel the same  
And I do not understand, I cannot comprehend  
The chills your body sends, why did it have to end  
  
I've taken time to think and I  
Don't think it's fair for us to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
I have this feeling that I  
Finally found the words to say  
But I can't tell you  
If you turn around and run away, run away  
  
I've taken time to think and I  
Don't think it's fair for us to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
And I have this feeling that I  
Finally found the words to say  
But I can't tell you  
If you turn around and run away, run away  
  
Runaway, runaway  
Turn around and runaway, runaway  
Runaway, runaway  
But I can't tell you if you runaway, runaway  
Turn around and runaway
