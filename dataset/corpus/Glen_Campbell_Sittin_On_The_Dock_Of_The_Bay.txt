Sittin' in the mornin' sun  
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes  
Watchin' the ships roll in  
Then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah  
  
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide roll away  
Just sittin on the dock of the bay  
Wastin' time  
  
I left my home in Georgia  
Headed for the Frisco Bay  
I have nothing to live for  
Look like nothing's gonna come my way, yeah  
  
So I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide roll away  
Yes, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Wastin' time  
  
Look like nothing's gonna change  
Everything still remains the same  
I can't do what ten people tell me to do  
So, I guess I'll remain the same  
  
Sittin' hear resting my bones  
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yeah  
But two thousand miles I roam  
Just to make this dock my home, yeah  
  
Now I'm sittin' at the dock of the bay  
Watching the tide roll away, yeah  
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Wasting time
