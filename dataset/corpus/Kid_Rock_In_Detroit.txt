"Bad Ass" on draught, and big Ford trucks  
We spend the day on the line and the nights lit up  
We rock blue jeans, tees, old English D's  
So baby you best to believe that's how we do it in detroit  
That's how we do it in detroit,  
Up in the d, d, d  
  
We're the real deal trick, 'bout as real as it gets  
We don't pay that high class hollywood shit  
We don't start drama, but if it's around,  
Say hello to a motown throw-down in detroit  
That's how we do it in detroit,  
That's how we do it in detroit,  
Up in the d, d, d  
Yeah that's how we do it in the d baby  
Blue and gray all the way, and we came to play  
So what's up now dawg?  
  
With the big brown fist, with the "can't stop soul"  
The hot rod city always ready to roll  
We get ya what you gotta get to see this through  
Cause tough times don't last, tough people do  
In detroit,  
That's how we do it in detroit,  
That's how we do it in detroit,  
Up in the d, d, d, d, d  
In detroit,  
For all my people in detroit  
That's how we do it in detroit,  
Up in the d, d, d,  
All the time in detroit  
For all my people in detroit  
That's how we do it in detroit,  
Up in the d, d, d, d
