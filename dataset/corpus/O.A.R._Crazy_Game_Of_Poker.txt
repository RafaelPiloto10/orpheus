Ohh myyyy  
20 throw down in my fist of rage  
And the man to my left has folded down  
Well johnny doubled up with a royal flush  
I had three jacks and a pair of nines  
My mind is turning - just two shots more  
There's not much left to play  
Well then dude walks in, black hat on top  
What a mop, I'm lucky  
Wasn't a county cop  
Cause I'm just runnin out of time  
Who's up for game two  
What to do  
My wallet's gettin thin  
And I just lost my watch last night  
Well I gotta problem  
Just one answer  
Gotta throw it all down  
And kiss it goodbye  
Yeah!  
That was a crazy game of poker  
(That was a crazy game of poker)  
I lost it all  
(I lost it all)  
But someday I'll be back again  
And I, never to fold.  
(Never to fold)  
Who's up for game three  
I can barely see the bourbon drowning next to me  
And I just lost it all  
Well there's a man sittin next to me  
Red, was smiling  
Cause it's funny  
I don't have no money tonight  
Yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh  
That was a crazy game of poker  
(That was a crazy game of poker)  
I lost it all  
(I lost it all)  
But someday I'll be back again  
And I, never to fold.  
(Never to fold)  
Ba da ba bap bap biddy bop, ba bi bop bop bop, bibidy bopbop bop bop bop a
bid-ily bop bop...  
I say now skittleedat dat,  
Well how bout that?  
I'm coming out the front never coming out the back  
And I walked into the bar yesterday  
Cause I had something to do, something to say  
And Johnny walked in right behind me and I didn't turn around  
Til I heard the sound of his feet falling on the ground  
I looked over my shoulder and I saw a clown  
And I said what'cha doin' in the bar tonight.  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said, how bout a revolution?  
And he said right.  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah  
Day day oh!  
And I said, what'cha looking at?  
He hit me across the face with a bat  
I grabbed my. 45 and I said let's get out and go  
So he opened the door and said do what you're here for  
I said I'm wandering round the road four to four  
And I said I been walking for about a thousand years.  
And my feet are growing tired  
My eyes a little wired  
Don't know what to do unless I retire  
And he just said let's play some crazy poker  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said, how bout a revolution?  
And he said right.  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah  
Jah oh!  
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw  
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw  
But I'm not gonna quit and I'm not gonna stop  
Don't give a shit cause I got the drop  
Johnny just got two eyes just like mine  
And I'm feeling kinda funky, kinda fine  
And I drank a bottle of whiskey, 'fore I came  
Came to the bar to see what's the same  
I saw my man named Johnny sittin' across the table from me  
And to my left was a man, he had no chance  
Didn't really think about starting a scene  
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice  
He looked kinda mad and I felt bad  
Beacuse I took his money last night it's kinda funny  
But now I'm just struggling  
I need a honey-bunny.  
I don't know what to say anymore  
So I'm just gonna go out, anywho...  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said, how bout a revolution?  
And he said right.  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah
