My situation never changes - or very little  
My little world -- my little world--is due for a shakeup  
Or a shakedown would be acceptable  
And I can't understand--can't understand  
Why people think I'm so respectable  
I believe, I believe, I believe  
Outrageous, outrageous, outrageous  
Outrageous things are gonna happen to me  
They're gonna happen to the other side  
They're gonna happen to somebody  
It's gonna happen to the kids to the people next door  
And it really isn't funny  
And I said my situation never changes  
But I'm not too sure  
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe  
That something's gonna happen real soon (something scary)  
I know, I know, I know  
Outrageous, outrageous, outrageous  
Outrageous things are gonna happen to me  
They're gonna happen to me.  
Everywhere I go--outrageous  
Everything I see  
Everytime I talk--outrageous  
I'm gettin into trouble  
Open my big mouth--outrageous  
Words keep fallin out  
Open my big mouth--outrageous  
Now I'm in trouble  
I believe, I believe, I believe
