I climb up, spending daylight  
Slide down drunken on the other side  
Some sweet girl, playing my wife,  
Runs off with a boy whose bike she'll ride  
  
Playground (it's a playground)  
Marked by the masters and bruised by the bullies in the  
Playground (it's a playground)  
Never stop rehearsing, rehearsing for the big square world  
  
Bells will ring, door flings open  
Hare and greyhound in the old kiss chase  
You've been caught, game has ended  
Smack on kisser from her slap on face  
  
Playground (it's a playground)  
We're marked by the masters and bruised by the bullies in the  
Playground (it's a playground)  
Never stop rehearsing, rehearsing for the big square world  
  
Watch the leaves all tear away (one by one)  
Leaving you but lined like an exercise book  
What did your report once say (know the one)  
This boy must try harder to please  
From down on his knees  
  
Playground, playground, playground, playground, playground,  
Playground, playground, playground  
  
Brain gets bent, heart gets broken  
You can't jump off once the page is turned  
School is out but never over  
That's the only lesson you can learn  
  
Playground (it's a playground)  
We're marked by the masters and bruised by the bullies in the  
Playground (it's a playground)  
Never stop rehearsing, rehearsing for the big square  
  
Playground (it's a playground)  
Go for the high jump if you let 'em push you in the  
Playground (it's a playground)  
There's no escaping, escaping from their big square world  
  
You may leave school, but it never leaves you
