A lifetime waiting for the light to shine  
Suddenly you were here, like an angel appeared  
And the world that I knew changed into a wonderland  
Then you called out my name, Looked around and I found You were gone  
Like the rays of the sun, disappeared into never ending nights  
  
Chorus:  
Where everything real has turned to stone  
And the songbird has flown (you're gone)  
Now I know a rose can change a shade of blue  
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
A shade of blue  
  
My body's hurting, crying and yearning  
Sometimes I feel like I'm loosing my mind  
And I think about you, knowing only you could understand  
Here alone in my room, I can feel all the walls closing in  
Feeling trapped in a shell, wishing that I could spin the wheels of change
