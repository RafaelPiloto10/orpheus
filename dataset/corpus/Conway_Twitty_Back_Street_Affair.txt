You didn't know I wasn't free  
When you fell in love with me  
And with all your young heart, you learned to care  
It brought you shame and disgrace  
The world has tumbled in your face  
Because they call our love a back street affair.  
  
They say you wrecked my home  
I'm a husband that's gone wrong  
They don't know the sorrow that we've had to bear  
For the one that I'm tied to  
Was the first to be untrue  
And yet they call our love a back street affair.  
  
We have each other now  
That's all that matters anyhow  
For the judgement of gossip's never fair  
We'll just be brave and strong  
Then some day they'll see they're wrong  
So let 'em call our love a back street affair.  
  
We'll be free to love someday  
When all the talk has died away  
And the happiness we hoped for then we'll share  
I'll climb a mountain high  
And then the world can hear me cry  
That our love's not a back street affair...
