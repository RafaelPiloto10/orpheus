I know the damage that he's done  
And I know the damage that he'll do  
I know when you knock on my door  
I'll always open it to you.  
  
There is a time, there is a place  
But it's not here and now's not safe  
So don't take more than I can give  
And leave my heart out of this.  
  
CHORUS:  
You leave my heart out of this  
You're too much to resist  
I don't have the strength to pull away  
No is getting hard for me to say  
I'd love to be the way your heartache ends  
But till it does we can't be more than friends  
I'm only trying to do what's best  
It's gonna hurt you more unless  
You leave my heart out of this.  
  
I know confused is how you feel  
Afraid to make it on your own  
I know the way your hurt to heal  
And I know the empty of alone  
So take my shoulder take my hand  
Take what you need I'll understand  
Just don't take more than I can give  
And leave my heart out of this.  
  
repeat CHORUS
