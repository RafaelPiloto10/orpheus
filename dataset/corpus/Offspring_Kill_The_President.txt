In a world without leaders  
Who'd start all the wars?  
The world that your saving  
Will always be yours  
Kill the President  
Listen to the voice of reason  
Unify with that single line  
Stop the man with the power  
Of the government  
A leader's not the center  
Of democracy  
In a world without leaders  
Who'd make people starve?  
The world that we're saving  
Will always be ours  
Everyone says  
Well maybe I'll make a difference  
Thinking they've got plenty of time  
But you're squeezed  
A little tighter everyday  
Finished before you can commit a crime  
In a world without leaders  
Who'd start all the wars?  
The world that your saving  
Will always be yours  
Kill the President  
Listen to the voice of reason  
Unify with that single line  
Stop the man with the power  
Of the government  
A leader's not the center  
Of democracy  
America  
All of your enemies  
Come from within  
But you lash out so  
It is seen  
Like some frightened child  
In an angry world  
Or the fall of Rome  
Your demise comes  
From your own hands  
In a world without leaders  
Who'd start all the wars?  
The world that your saving  
Will always be yours  
In a world without leaders  
We might have a chance  
But we'll never see it  
As long as there's
