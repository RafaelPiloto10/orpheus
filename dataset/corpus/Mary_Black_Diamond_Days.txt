I have written this song  
For you to take with you  
When you go away  
Something to sing and slowly swing to  
On your colder days  
I have made a start  
With a verse and a chorus  
The rest I leave to you  
And when next I see your smiling face  
We might sing it right through  
Chorus  
I'll be your sweetheart always  
And I'll love the memories of the diamond days  
I'll keep a candle burning  
'till we sing again the diamond days  
If the words don't rhyme  
Then I will forgive you  
That won't be the crime  
But the staring space  
Upon the page  
That might look like mine  
I have made a start  
With a verse and a chorus  
The rest I'll leave to you  
And when next I see your smiling face  
We might sing it right through  
Chorus
