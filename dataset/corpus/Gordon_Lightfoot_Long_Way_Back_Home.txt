From the railhead to the boatyard  
From the factory to the farm  
From the mine to the mill yard  
I've weathered the storm  
From the bar room to the bedpost  
I've wasted my days, all I have is my drink  
And the time left to think  
While time slips away  
Just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
You'll see what I'm after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
It's a long way back home  
Now in case you should ask me  
What it is that I've done  
I'd say I'm a soldier  
Who once had a son  
But my son doesn't know me  
That's his right to choose  
Oh say, can you see? My best friend is me  
I'm a friend I could use  
Just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
You'll see what I'm after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
It's a long way back home  
Now the pages have faded  
The story grows cold  
And the plot falls to ashes  
Like the ruins of old  
Those rats in my rafters  
They're after my shoes  
And anything else they can find on the shelf  
I've said they could use  
And just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
You'll see what I'm after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
It's a long way back home  
It's a long way back home
