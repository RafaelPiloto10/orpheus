Nine times out of ten, baby, I've told you  
And I aint gonna tell you just nine times again  
Aah, just how much I aim to hold you  
Again and again and again  
  
Little girl, its nine times out of ten, you've refused me  
And then say that you refuse me nine times again  
But I wont stop until you choose me  
Again and again and again  
  
(Well,) don't try to fight it  
Cause its no use  
Youre gonna find that  
I'm stubborn as a doggone mule  
  
Nine times out of ten I've tried to kiss you  
And I aint trying just nine times again  
Well, if I missed the nine times that I've tried, baby  
Ill bet my life, Ill get you on number ten  
  
(instr break)  
  
Well, don't try to fight it  
Come, baby, it ain't no use  
Youre gonna find that  
I'm stubborn as a doggone mule  
  
Nine times out of ten I've tried to kiss you  
And I aint trying just nine times again  
Well, if I missed the nine times that I've tried, baby  
Ill bet my life, Ill get you on number ten
