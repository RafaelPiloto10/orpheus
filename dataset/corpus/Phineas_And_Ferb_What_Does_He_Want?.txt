What kind of present does he dream about  
A leather wallet or a singing trout  
What I should get him is a mystery  
And if it's lame, will he still want me?  
What does he want?  
A dvd or some video games  
What does he want?  
Or maybe one of those new digital frames  
What does he want?  
Something to fit his personality  
What does he want?  
The perfect present is eluding me  
My friends all tell me that I shouldn't obsess  
But how can I avoid the stress?  
I need to know, but right now all I can do is guess  
What does he want?  
A fancy cell phone or a tube of grout  
What does he want?  
I don't know, but I'll figure it out  
What does he want?  
Rear-view mirror glasses as seen on tv  
What does he want?  
I only wish I knew what he got me...  
'Cause I hear it's perfect.  
What does he want?
