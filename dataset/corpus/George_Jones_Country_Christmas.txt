In our little country settlement there's harmony a-ringing  
The echo flowing softly through the hills of silent night  
All the shinny decorations on the big tree in the church yard  
Will make the folks for miles around sing I Saw the Light.  
  
We're gonna have a country christmas  
We're gonna Christmas the old time away  
We'll let the church bells ring as we gather 'round to sing  
And show our love for Jesus as we pray.  
  
We'll have lots of homemade candy and presents for the children  
And let the elders grace the table filled with the food and wine  
There's not a better way to say happy birthday Jesus  
Than to have a good old gospel singing country Christmas time.  
  
We're gonna have a country christmas  
We're gonna Christmas the old time away  
We'll let the church bells ring as we gather round to sing  
And show our love for Jesus as we pray.  
  
Jesus as we pray...
