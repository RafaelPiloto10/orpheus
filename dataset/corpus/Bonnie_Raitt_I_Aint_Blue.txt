I ain't blue, baby  
Just a little bit lonesome for some lovin'  
Everything is fine  
Just don't want to be all by myself  
On a rainy day  
I'm feelin' kind of funny  
Dreaming 'bout some loverman who'll call me honey  
Yeah and a good lookin' man  
My heart inside  
A lonely smile and lovin' in his eyes  
No I ain't blue, baby  
But I'm just a little bit lonesome for some love again  
Everything is fine  
Just don't want to be all by myself  
Sit around the house  
Readin' magazines  
All the time thinkin' 'bout those same sweet dreams  
Yeah, walk down the street  
My heart jumps a beat  
Every time I see some sweet man I want to meet  
No I ain't blue, baby  
But I'm just a little bit lonesome for some love again  
Everything is fine  
I just don't want to be all by myself
