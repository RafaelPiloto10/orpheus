The lakes and pines they bleed of beauty and grace  
And the rivers they run wild like an endless race  
The forests soar so high then fall to the sea  
As church bells ring and sing in harmony  
  
I heard them say they're shuttin' Detroit down  
But I won't leave 'cause this is my hometown  
  
And it's times like these we can't replace  
It's times like these we must embrace  
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees  
It makes us who we are, in times like these  
  
The concrete and steel stand strong against the wind  
With the memories of what was and what has been  
The sounds of sweet soul music and blue-collar blues  
There were seventeen colors for a Chevy all red white and blue  
  
I heard them say that you can't save that town  
But I won't leave, I will stand my ground  
  
And it's times like these we can't replace  
It's times like these we must embrace  
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees  
It makes us who we are, in times like these  
  
The ice and snow give way to a new spring bloom  
In the wake that hope and faith they will be home soon  
A new day dawns as the good Lord shines from above  
'Cause in the rubble and rust there remains a whole lotta love  
  
And I was here watchin' it all go down  
And I'll still be, when it comes back around  
  
And it's times like these we can't replace  
It's times like these we must embrace  
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees  
It makes us who we are, in times like these  
It makes us who we are in times like these
