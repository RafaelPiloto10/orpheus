This world that I live in is empty and cold  
This loneliness cuts me and tears at my soul  
I'm no child of destiny, no fortune's son  
I've just chased you so long now, I'm too weak to run  
So here I return to a back street of thrills  
Back to any warm shoulder till she's got her fill  
And then I treat shame like an old friend from home  
That I can lean on till the misery is gone  
A new day is here yet nothing is new  
You're still gone and I tremble for you  
I cry out at bedtime no, please not tonight  
But again there's your footsteps and I turn on the light  
Of course you're not there, no, you never are  
Then I try to forget that there's always a bar  
And well, I win that battle, yes, sometimes I do  
But sleep doesn't come when I tremble for you
