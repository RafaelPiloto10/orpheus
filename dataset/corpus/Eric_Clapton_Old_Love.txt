I can feel your body  
When I'm lying in bed  
There's too much confusion  
Going around through my head  
  
And it makes me so angry  
To know that the flame still burns  
Why can't I get over?  
When will I ever learn?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Old love, leave me alone  
Old love, go on home  
  
I can see your face  
But I know that it's not real  
It's just an illusion  
Caused by how I used to feel  
  
And it makes me so angry  
To know that the flame will always burn  
I'll never get over  
I know now that I'll never learn  
  
[Chorus]
