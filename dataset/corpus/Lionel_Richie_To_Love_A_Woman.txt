[Enrique]  
I don't know what it is but she drives me crazy  
I don't know what she does but she drives me wild  
If only she could let me be the man I want to be  
Well she can leave me helpless as a child  
  
[Lionel]  
I don't know how it is but she has the power  
She can make me laugh when I want to cry (oh yeah)  
She tells me that I'm in control but I know it's just a lie  
  
And I don't mind oh  
Will she love you tomorrow like she loves you today  
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays  
And that's what it feels like  
To love a woman  
To love a woman  
  
[Enrique]  
When you're looking in her eyes you can see forever (forever)  
You're captured by the beauty of her soul (oh yeah)  
  
[Lionel]  
You know you're never gonna find a woman like this again  
  
So don't let go oh (don't let go)  
Will she love you tomorrow like she loves you today  
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays  
And that's what it feels like  
To love a woman  
To love a woman  
  
Oh she can make your day  
Oh she can take it away (take it all way)  
And oh whether it's wrong or right  
You know it in the end you'd do it all again  
To love a woman  
Just to love a woman (uh huh)  
  
Oh you know (yes I know, yes I know)  
She loves you tomorrow like she loves you today (well she love you)  
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays (she's yours if
she stays)  
And that's what it feels like (I'm gonna say it)  
And that's what it feels like (what it feels like oh)  
And that's what it feels like  
To love a woman  
To love a woman (mm hmm)  
Yea
