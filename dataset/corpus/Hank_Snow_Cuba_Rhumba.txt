Now if you're gonna cruise be sure that you'll choose Habana  
Where the waters are green by that old Caribbean sea  
And if you stay awhile you'll soon like their style of rhythm  
You'll learn the Cuba Rhumba the dance that everyone does  
And when you dance with the sweet senorita you meet in the moonlight  
You'll forget way of prom and you'll never want to come home  
And in a tropical way you'll learn how to say manana  
And the Cuba Rhumba will have you under its spell  
If you'll hear Spanish guitars out under the stars in Cuba  
While the dancers are swayin' as long as I'm playin' tune  
And if you're tappin' your feet in the beat of that native music  
Then the Cuba Rhumba has got you under its spell  
Beneath the tropical sky you'll be tryin' to step to the rhythm  
And you'll shout all day in the way the native all do  
And then you'll walk in a trance and just want to dance to Rhumba  
Yes the Cuba Rhumba will have you under its spell
