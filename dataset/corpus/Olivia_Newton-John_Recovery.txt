I live on an island far away  
All by myself, there's no one else  
Nobody calls but that's okay  
Don't need their help, I'm by myself  
Nobody here to make a career  
Of hurting me, deserting me  
Your crazy life ain't ever gonna get me  
Don't worry about my recovery  
'Cause lover, you won't recover me  
I'm not too low, I'm not too high  
I'll get by makin' my recovery  
When I go wrong as people do  
There's only me to answer to  
Nobody here to bring me down  
No feelings I need step around  
Trouble and care are waiting out there  
But I'm alright, I'm safe tonight  
Your crazy life ain't ever gonna get me  
Don't worry about my recovery  
'Cause lover, you won't recover me  
I'm not too low, I'm not too high  
I'll get by makin' my recovery  
Don't need your sympathy, save all your tears  
I've lived without tenderness for too many years  
Why would I need it now?  
Nobody here to make a career  
Of hurting me, deserting me  
Your crazy life ain't ever gonna get me  
Don't worry about my recovery  
'Cause lover, you won't recover me  
I'm not too low, I'm not too high  
I'll get by makin' my recovery
