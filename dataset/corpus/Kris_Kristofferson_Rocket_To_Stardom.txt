It started when the neighbors saw my fancy new T.V  
That opens up the gate outside my home  
And let's me let in anyone I really want to see  
And keep out all them other dudes I don't  
  
Then one by one they started comin' over to perform  
And someone played "Temptation" on kazoo  
Nellie got as naked as the day that she was born  
And it sure was all over Baby Blue  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've got electric eyes, two big dogs, and a mine-field  
And miles and miles, and miles of barbed-wire fence  
But the biggest show in town is in my driveway  
And we ain't had a good night sleepin' since  
  
Orville Baker's showin' us the fastest draw in town  
Cora Lee's clackin' on her spoons  
Ol' Jesse's trick dog sure does look dead lyin' on the ground  
And Jesse's wife is a-howlin' at the moon  
  
Charly's ugly daughter sure can tap dance  
Mable Thatcher's walkin' on her hands  
And just as I was leavin' for the kitchen for a snack  
Ol' Lulla Bell amazed us with her fans  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Froney's got an act that's hard to follow  
Norman plays a nimble tamborine  
You should see what Sara Lee can swallow  
And ol' Billy does a wicked "Mr. Clean"  
  
Good Lord, if I'd've known this future when I started  
Believe you me, I'd never change a thing  
I got a closed circuit circus in my bedroom  
And a world full of whackos in the wings  
Get 'em Burt!  
  
[Chorus]
