You jump in front of my car when you, you know all the time that  
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive.  
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain.  
You say you just want me to take you for a ride.  
  
You're just like crosstown traffic, so hard to get through to you.  
Crosstown traffic, I don't need to run over you.  
Crosstown traffic, all you do is slow me down  
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town.  
  
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run,  
Tire tracks all across your back, uh-huh, I can see you had your fun.  
But a darling, can't you see my signals turn from green to red  
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead.  
  
You're just like Crosstown traffic, so hard to get through to you.  
Crosstown traffic, I don't need to run over you.  
Crosstown traffic, all you do is slow me down  
And I got better things on the other side of town.  
  
Yeah now crosstown traffic, look out, look out, baby, let me through.  
Crosstown traffic yeah, look out.  
Crosstown traffic yeah, look out, look out, look out.  
Crosstown traffic yeah, look out, watch that street.
