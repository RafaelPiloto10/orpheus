Love is a wild animal  
It breathes you it looks for you  
It nests upon broken hearts  
And goes hunting when there are kisses and candles  
It sucks tightly on your lips  
And digs tunnels through your ribs  
It drops softly like snow  
First it gets hot then cold in the end it hurts  
  
Amour Amour  
Everyone just wants to tame you  
Amour Amour in the end  
Caught between your teeth  
  
Love is a wild animal  
It bites and scratches and steps towards me  
It holds me tightly with a thousand arms  
And drags me into it's love nest  
It devours me completely  
And retches me back out after many years  
It drops softly like snow  
First it gets hot then cold in the end it hurts  
  
Amour Amour  
Everyone just wants to tame you  
Amour Amour in the end  
Caught between your teeth  
  
Love is a wild animal  
You fall into it's trap  
It stares into your eyes  
Spellbound when it's gaze hits you  
  
Please please give me poison  
  
[1] "Amour" is French for "love".
