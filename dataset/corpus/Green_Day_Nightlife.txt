Taking a ride to my old haunt  
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife  
My favorite color's candy apple, girl  
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife  
  
What's that I hear? You wanna go for a ride?  
Don't be afraid, boy, to come inside  
I got the thing that you want, the fix that you need  
Chase this with a little lust and greed  
I'll be the devil on your shoulder saying, hey boy, come on  
My black heart beats crimson and clover?  
Operator, operator patch my boy in  
This is nightlife and I'll get under your skin  
  
Taking a ride to my old haunt  
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife  
My favorite color's candy apple, girl  
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife  
  
What a thrill, heart beats fast  
Sounds like love but you know it won't last  
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit  
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route  
Red velvet walls  
Line the sugar-coated halls  
Girls on your bar stools from late last calls  
This town is filled with snakes, mistakes and whiskey shakes  
It's too late I already cut the brakes  
  
I'm rollin', strollin' into town  
Is it me or am I going crazy?  
This dirty city is my sugar town  
My little angel of death is my nightlife  
  
You better make a move before I get bored  
If you wanna explore my vocal chord  
Leave the girl a go-go dance in the cooch  
One hand on my knee one hand on the hooch  
Why don't you stick around for one more round?  
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown  
'Cause I'm a ring leader  
I run the show  
And only when I tell ya  
Will it be time to go  
  
Taking a ride to my old haunt  
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife  
My favorite color's candy apple, girl  
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife  
  
(Hey boy) She is my night life  
(hey boy) She is my night life  
(Haha hey boy) She is my night life  
(See you later) She is my night life
