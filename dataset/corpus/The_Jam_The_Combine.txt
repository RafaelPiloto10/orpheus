And life is very difficult, when you're in the crowd  
When you're in the crowd, you see things as they really are  
You can smell the fear and hate, generated by all around -  
I want to breakaway, but the ties are too strong  
want to go on holiday, but the crowd says I can't  
See life is very different, when you're in the crowd  
Oh, sometimes in the night, I wish I was faraway  
But then I realize, even escape will be in vain  
I want to close my eyes and be like the rest  
I mean, nobody wants to die, although the crowd say they do  
Look, life is very intricate, when you're in the crowd  
Life becomes the movies  
And everyone has a role  
It's easy being the actor  
When the combine's the only star -  
Sunday papers  
And the dailies

War in Rhodesia  
Far away  
In a distant land  
But we're alright  
We're nice and warm here  
No one to hurt us  
Except ourselves
