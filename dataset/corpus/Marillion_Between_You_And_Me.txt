Today! I saw music in the sky  
I drove towards it in my car  
And I turned left and I turned right  
But I could never lose the light  
That shines towards tomorrow night  
  
Who can say what it means?  
What goes on in between  
And what gets in between  
It's just somethin'  
Between you and me  
Between you and me  
Between you and me  
It's as sweet as can be.  
  
Today! I saw music in the sky  
It sang around me. I went blind.  
Like a masterpiece in a disguise  
Couldn't stop it pulling at my eyes  
  
Who can say what it means  
What goes on in between  
And what gets in between  
Ice and fire  
Between you and me  
Between you and me  
Sweet as can be  
Between you and me  
  
Monday.. Tuesday.. Blow a fuse day  
Fix it in the usual way  
Meet me at the church and we'll get in a state  
Stay up late and I'll wake up feeling like  
A kid swingin' on heavens gate  
With no God to complain  
Or point the finger of blame  
We'll get it all down on video 8  
You comin' out to play?  
Could be quite a day  
  
And I sang that pretty tune  
An open airy song  
And my heart looped the loop  
Well I could do no wrong.  
  
Who can say what it means?  
What goes on in between  
Who can say what you see  
And what gets in between you and me  
  
Between you and me  
Sweet as can be  
Between you and me.
