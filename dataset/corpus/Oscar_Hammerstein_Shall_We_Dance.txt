(Anna sings)  
We've just been introduced  
I do not know you well  
But when the music started something drew me to your side  
So many men and girls are in each others arms  
It made me think we might be similarly occupied  
  
Shall we dance, on a bright cloud of music  
Shall we fly  
Shall we dance  
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye  
Or per chance, when the last little star has left the sky  
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other  
And shall you be my new romance  
On the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen  
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance  
  
[Interlude:]  
  
Shall we dance, on a bright cloud of music  
Shall we fly  
Shall we dance  
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye  
  
(The King Sings)  
Or per chance, when the last little star has leave the sky  
  
(Anna Sings)  
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other  
And shall you be my new...  
  
(Both Sing)  
Romance  
On the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen  
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance
