Christmas toys all over the place  
Little Shelby wears a funny smile on his face  
Shelby has a secret  
And the secret he must share  
He wants to tell somebody  
So he tells his teddy bear  
  
[Chorus:]  
I saw Mama kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
She didn't see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek(it says peep but go with peek)  
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
Then, I saw Mama tickle Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
Oh, what a laugh it would have been  
If Daddy had only seen  
Mama kissing Santa Claus last night  
  
[Repeat Chorus]
