[Verse 1]  
Days are long, life's so short  
It's a crazy world, the moment we call life  
Taking off across the sea  
Touchdown, city full of lights  
Looked around when there is no one in the room  
There's a bar and they call for me and you  
Floating up like there's water underneath  
From the desert to the shining sea  
  
[Chorus]  
Just what I wanted, you're just what I wanted  
Just what I wanted, oh, my, my (Oh, my, my)  
Look around, you're just what I wanted (Just what I wanted)  
Just what I wanted (Just what I wanted)  
Just what I wanted, I'm alright  
I'm alright (Just what I wanted, just what I wanted, you're just what I
wanted)  
Oh my, my (Just what I wanted, just what I wanted, you're just what I wanted)  
I'm alright, I'm alright  
[Verse 2]  
Days are long, life's so short  
It's a crazy world when we meet, we try  
Taking across the sea  
Touchdown, festivals, night  
Looked around at the faces in the room  
People shouting, they're saying parlez-vous  
Floating up like there's water underneath  
I'm the desert, you're the shining sea  
  
[Chorus]  
Just what I wanted, you're just what I wanted  
Just what I wanted, oh, my, my (Oh, my, my)  
Look around, you're just what I wanted (Just what I wanted)  
Just what I wanted (Just what I wanted)  
Just what I wanted, I'm alright  
I'm alright (Just what I wanted, just what I wanted, you're just what I
wanted)  
Oh my, my (Just what I wanted, just what I wanted, you're just what I wanted)  
I'm alright, I'm alright  
  
[Bridge]  
All that I've seen, I could feel it (I've been to so many places)  
Show me your eyes (I've seen the brightest lights, the darkest nights)  
All that I've seen (All the things that I have seen)  
You are (I swear that you are) you are  
  
[Chorus]  
Just what I wanted (come on, come on)  
You're just what I wanted  
All my life  
I found you  
You're just what I wanted (You are)Just what I wanted  
All my life  
Look around you (Oh, oh, come on)  
Oh my, my (yeah)  
  
[Outro]  
Just what I wanted (Just what I wanted)  
Just what I wanted (Just what I wanted)  
You're just what I wanted all my life  
Oh my, my
