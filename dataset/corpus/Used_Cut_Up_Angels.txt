If we cut out the bad  
Well then we'd have nothing left  
Like I cut up your mouth  
The night I stuffed it all in  
And you lied to the angels  
Said I stabbed you to death  
If we go at the same time  
They'll clean up the mess  
  
I lost my head  
You couldn't come  
This loss to my brain almost feels like a gun  
  
Watched you bite into the bottle  
Watched me kick out the chair  
Let you chew up the glass  
And laughed at you just hung there  
I have thought of rose petals mostly perfect and pure  
Then I thought of your petals  
And the abuse they've been through  
  
I lost my head  
You couldn't come  
This loss to my brain almost feels like a gun  
You lost your head  
I couldn't come  
This loss to my brain almost feels like a gun  
Whoa whoa  
  
I told the angels  
Can't stay in heaven  
I asked the devil  
If we cut out the bad well then we'd have nothing left  
Like I cut up your angels  
Yeah you stabbed me to death  
  
I lost my head  
You couldn't come  
This loss to my brain almost feels like a gun  
You lost your head  
I couldn't come  
This loss to my brain almost feels just like a gun
