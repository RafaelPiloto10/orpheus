Where did we come from?  
Why are we here?  
Where do we go when we die?  
What lies beyond  
And what lay before?  
Is anything certain in life?  
  
They say, "Life is too short,"  
"The here and the now"  
And "You're only given one shot"  
But could there be more,  
Have I lived before,  
Or could this be all that we've got?  
  
If I die tomorrow  
I'd be all right  
Because I believe  
That after we're gone  
The spirit carries on  
  
I used to be frightened of dying  
I used to think death was the end  
But that was before  
I'm not scared anymore  
I know that my soul will transcend  
  
I may never find all the answers  
I may never understand why  
I may never prove  
What I know to be true  
But I know that I still have to try  
  
If I die tomorrow  
I'd be alright  
Because I believe  
That after we're gone  
The spirit carries on  
  
"Move on, be brave  
Don't weep at my grave  
Because I am no longer here  
But please never let  
Your memory of me disappear"  
  
Safe in the light that surrounds me  
Free of the fear and the pain  
My questioning mind  
Has helped me to find  
The meaning in my life again  
Victoria's real  
I finally feel  
At peace with the girl in my dreams  
And now that I'm here  
It's perfectly clear  
I found out what all of this means  
  
If I die tomorrow  
I'd be alright  
Because I believe  
That after we're gone  
The spirit carries on
