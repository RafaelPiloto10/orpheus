Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful, she's so true, oh yeah,  
Her dreams are tumblin', her world is crumblin' because of you, uhh uh.  
One day you'll hurt her just once too much,  
And when you finally lose your tender touch, hey, hey,

Her feet may wander, her heart may stray, oh yeah,  
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo- be-doo-da-dee.  
You gonna send your baby straight to me,  
  
I'm gonna give her all the lovin' within my heart, oh yeah,  
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream you tore apart, understand me?  
And when she tells you she's cried her last tear,  
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near, oh yeah,

Baby you didn't know that thing.  
  
You're gonna leave her once too many times and when you come back  
That girl's gonna be mine, all mine, hey, hey.

Her feet may wander, her heart may stray, yeah, yeah
