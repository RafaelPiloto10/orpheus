He walked along Broadway  
They called him Beau James  
The city streets were his pals  
The lights were his gals  
His favorite flames  
He wrote on the sidewalk in big white chalk  
Jimmy Walker loves New York  
Oh how that love affair  
Lit up Times Square  
He walked along Broadway and blew her a kiss  
The many years have gone by  
You still hear her sigh  
No kiss was like this  
And though the town fell out of love with him  
And called him a few unkind names  
Yet one will always remember, remain  
Beau James, Beau James, Beau James  
He walked along Broadway and blew her a kiss  
The many years have gone by  
You still hear her sigh  
No kiss was like this  
And though the town fell out of love with him  
And called him a few unkind names  
Yet one will always remember, remain...  
Beau James, Beau James, Beau James
