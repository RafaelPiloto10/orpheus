Took a boat Sunday, down by the sea  
It just felt so nice, you and me  
We didn't have a problem or a care  
And all around was silence, everywhere  
  
You are the reason I was born  
Be with you through all seasons  
I'll always hear you when you call  
We'll keep the love light shining  
  
Through each night and day  
A lonely life behind me  
Oh what a change you've made  
  
So down here on the ocean we will stay  
Went through a lot of changes  
Turned a lot of pages  
When I took a boat Sunday  
  
To know you as I know you now  
That is all I need  
And we will get along somehow  
If we both believe  
  
So down here on the ocean we will stay  
Went through a lot of changes  
Turned a lot of pages  
When I took a boat Sunday
