Sitting all alone, inside, today Jane.  
The other girls are home, we're playing a new game.  
The voice is very, very close, you like it that way,  
and we're feeling rather warm inside.  
  
Are you smiling or afraid?  
You can have it either way.  
  
Lady Jane your eyes are wide today,  
and the world is looking very strange, you must proclaim!  
It's quite a scary, scary ride we take, Lady Jane.  
  
Yesterday seemed very dark, but now it's bright,  
your clouds have gone away.  
Sensory perception peaking at this time,  
electric waves of sound are filling Janie's mind today  
calling out to Janie as you drift away, "Don't be afraid,  
they're only your illusion anyway."  
  
Lady Jane your eyes are wide today.  
and we're sure you won't forget the things  
you've seen today!
