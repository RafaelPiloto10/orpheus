Oh ...  
  
Now women is losers  
Now women is losers,  
Women is losers, oh,  
And then women is losers.  
Well, I know you must-a heard it all,  
I said now  
Men always seem to end up on top anyway.  
Oh...  
  
Well you know, if they told you they want you  
They'll come around by your door.  
Whoa I say now, if they don't desert you,  
They'll leave you cryin' for more.  
  
Women is losers,  
Now women is losers,  
Women is losers, oh!  
Ah then women is losers,  
And now I know you must-a heard it all,  
I said now men always seem to end up on top anyway.  
Alright, alright.  
  
Remember they'll use you and confuse you,  
They'll leave you with no one else around to play.  
Babe I'm all upset too,  
You'll watch out for 'em and you'll wonder  
Why the hell there ain't another way, oh!  
  
Women is losers  
Women is losers  
Women is losers, ah.  
And then women is losers.  
Now I know you must-a heard it all,  
I said now men always seem to end up on top, anyway!  
  
Oh, they wear a nice shiny armor  
Until there is a dragon for to slay.  
Any day now,  
Course with men beggin' to pay 'em  
Then they'll turn and run away, oh!  
  
Women is losers,  
Yeah, women is losers,  
Yeah, women is losers, oh!  
And then women is losers,  
So I know you must-a heard it all,  
I said now  
Men always seem to end up on top anyway!
