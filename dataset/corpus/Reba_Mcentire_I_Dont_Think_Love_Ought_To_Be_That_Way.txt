Oh, I'm feeling so fine and you're looking so good  
And I'd like to get together  
Oh Lord, I wish we could  
But there's someone at home  
Who's depending on me  
And boy they'd never know it  
If I set my passions free  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
  
You say a precious moment  
Is all that it would be  
That I'd forget about you  
And you'd forget me  
Oh I love what you're saying  
It's tempting me so  
And though I love to hear it  
There's no way that I'll let go  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
  
No  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way
