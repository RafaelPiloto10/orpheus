I've been so... Been so blue  
Oh, is that all I was to you  
A pretty face with a name  
I guess that you can't explain  
How you went away...  
I hope you, you will find that special girl  
And you make her shine  
Baby, gave you heart and soul  
All you did was play a role...  
Baby boy now you are gone  
Oh, Mystic Man, tell me who are you today?  
Oh Mystic Man  
Do they know they're all being played?  
Oh Mystic Man  
Baby, tell me what is this?  
I'm out the door I can't take no more of your.... Shhhh(it)
