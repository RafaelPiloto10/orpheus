Dropping you this line to give you peace,  
And to set your weary mind at ease  
I know that it's rough when you're so far away  
Listen to the words I have to say  
  
Sometimes when you're gone, I don't know why  
I find the simple need to sit and cry  
It's not that I'm lonely or, that I'm blue  
It's just that I need to be with you  
  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
  
When I know our love is going strong  
And I have all I need to carry on  
And my mind and body seem to understand  
That for me you are the perfect man  
  
Our love, our love, our love  
Will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever
