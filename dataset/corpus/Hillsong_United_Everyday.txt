What to say, Lord? It's  
You who gave me life and I  
Can't explain just how  
Much You mean to me now  
That You have saved me, Lord  
I give all that I am to You  
That everyday I can  
Be a light that shines Your name  
  
Everyday, Lord, I'll  
Learn to stand upon Your word  
And I pray that I  
That I might come to know You more  
That You would guide me with every single step I take, that  
Everyday I can  
Be Your light unto the world  
  
[Chorus]  
Everyday, it's You I live for  
Everyday, I'll follow after You  
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord  
  
Everyday, Lord, I'll  
Learn to stand upon Your word  
And I pray that I  
That I might come to know You more  
That You would guide me with every single step I take, that  
Everyday I can  
Be Your light unto the world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's You I live for, everyday  
It's You I live for, everyday  
It's You I live for, everyday  
It's You I live for, everyday  
  
[Chorus: x2]
