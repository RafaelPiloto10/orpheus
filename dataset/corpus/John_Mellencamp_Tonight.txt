Written by John Mellencamp  
  
Well I get up in the morning  
Have a smoke, have a drink  
Then I get dressed  
I don't want to get to work too late  
'Cause that bossman he's a real mean son-of-a-bitch  
Everything is so fast and so crazy  
But the day still slowly slips on by  
And when that five o'clock whistle starts to blow  
I'll be gone in a wink of an eye  
  
Chorus  
Tonight, I'm gonna see my baby again  
And that long haired girl will be smiling  
When she sees me walkin' in  
Well all right, she looks so good  
That she just hasta be a sin  
Tonight, I'm gonna see my baby again  
  
We'll walk over to the East Street Montgomery Pier  
She says she likes holding something dangerous  
She pulls me close and whispers in my ear  
She says, "Come here little boy  
I'll put my pussy right on your face  
Because my fever is runnin' hot and high  
And you're the boy that makes me feel like I'm alive"  
  
Chorus
