Always you will be part of me  
And I will forever feel your strength  
When I need it most  
You're gone now, gone but not forgotten  
I can't say this to your face  
But I know you hear  
  
I'll see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know I'll see you again  
  
When I'm lost, I'm missing you like crazy  
And I tell myself I'm so blessed  
To have had you in my life, my life  
  
I'll see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know I'll see you again  
  
When I had the time to tell you  
I never thought I'd live to see the day  
When the words I should have said  
Would come to haunt me  
In my darkest hour I tell myself  
I'll see you again  
  
I'll see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know I'll see you again  
  
I'll see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know I'll see you again  
  
I will see you again  
I'll see you again  
I miss you like crazy  
You're gone but not forgotten  
I'll never forget you  
Someday I'll see you again  
I feel you walk beside me  
Never leave you, yeah  
Gone but not forgotten  
I feel you by my side  
No this is not goodbye
