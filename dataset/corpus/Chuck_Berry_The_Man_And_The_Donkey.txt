The man and the donkey  
  
Down the road came a tired little donkey,  
Much he was loaded till his head hung down.  
Upon this back so heavy set a big man,  
Singin' such a sad song  
As he rode into town.  
  
And the man, the man sing to the donkey,  
But he sing such a sad song, and the guitar he broke.  
The donkey stop, the man he reach to get a big jug,  
Him and the donkey take a sip o' the drink.  
  
Down the road, oh the dancing donkey,  
Head swingin' so high, all the pain now gone.  
The man he sing, some song was a gay song,  
And the little donkey kept a-dancin' on.  
  
Down the road was the man and the donkey,  
So good feel the donkey, so gay was the man.  
How plain when the wind blow was the sound of the gay song,  
When the man and the donkey kept a-movin' on down the road.
