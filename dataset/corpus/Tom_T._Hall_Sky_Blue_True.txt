If you ever worry, will I be true  
Don't you worry, I'll be true  
And I'll be true, sky blue true  
I'll be true, sky blue true  
As blue as the skies, as blue as your eyes  
As bright as the sun, as sweet as you hon  
I'll be true, sky blue true  
If you ever wonder, do I love you  
Don't you wonder I love you?  
And I'll be true, sky blue true  
I'll be true, sky blue true  
As blue as the skies, as blue as your eyes  
As bright as the sun, as sweet as you hon  
I'll be true, sky blue true  
And when the sun sets over our lives  
We'll be together beyond the skies  
And I'll be true eternally true  
I'll be true, sky blue true
