If it were just another day  
You know I might have stayed  
But I couldn't hang around  
To be beaten to the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
You asked me for something  
You know I couldn't lend  
You tried to make me break  
But it hurt too much to bend  
And the more I see of what used to be our love, I find  
That we've just been going nowhere  
And we're never gonna get there  
And we're wastin' our time  
  
If I were just another guy  
You know I might have tried  
To fit into you schemes  
And to have a plastic dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was just another lie  
I couldn't swallow when I tried  
Just enough to realize  
I'd been pretendin' all the time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You asked me for something  
You know I couldn't lend  
You tried to make me break  
But it hurt too much to bend  
And the more I see of what used to be our love, I find  
That we've just been going nowhere  
And we're never gonna get there  
And we're wastin' our time  
  
And the more I see of what used to be our love, I find  
That we've just been going nowhere  
And we're never gonna get there  
And we're wastin' our time  
And we're wastin' our time
