I burned all the letters that you never wrote  
I broke all the promises you never spoke  
I swallowed my pride till I thought I would choke  
Given bout all I can take I've given bout all I can take  
You want somebody guess we all do you've got a heart that won't let it come
true  
And I never was one to fake given bout all I can take  
I've given bout all I can take  
  
I cried over milk that never was spilled  
And I've danced to waltzes and you just stood still  
Time is much too precious to kill given bout all I can take  
I've given bout all I can take  
You want somebody...  
Oh I've given bout all I can take
