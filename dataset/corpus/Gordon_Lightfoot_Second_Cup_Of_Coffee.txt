I'm on my second cup of coffee and I still can't face the day  
I'm thinking of the lady who got lost along the way  
And if I don't stop this trembling hand from reaching for the phone  
I'll be reachin' for the bottle, Lord, before this day is done  
  
I'm on my second cup of coffee and I still can't face the day  
The room was filled with laughs as we danced the night away  
But my sleep was filled with dreaming of the wrongs that I had done  
And the gentle sweet reminder of a daughter and a son  
  
Sitting alone, my friends have all gone home  
You never know when they'll come droppin' in  
Thinking of girls with their fingers in my curls  
Too young to understand how love begins  
  
I'm on my second cup of coffee and I still can't face the dawn  
The radio is playin' a soft country song  
And if I don't stop this trembling hand from reaching for the phone  
I'll be reachin' for the bottle, Lord, before this day is done
