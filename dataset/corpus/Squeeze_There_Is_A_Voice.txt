There is a voice within us all  
That says destruct  
Go to the wall  
And you can't choose when this voice speaks  
Deep in our souls  
This voice will sleep  
There is a voice within us all  
That says destruct  
And you will crawl  
From your own pit into the deep  
Where you will sink  
Until it speaks  
  
Each day is a night  
Then your lifetime is gone  
  
There is a voice inside us all  
That says rebuild  
  
And when it's called  
All that is wrong can be put right  
There in your soul  
To change your life  
Each day's a hope each day's a prayer  
That I might build  
And I'll repair  
The parts in me that may have slipped  
Deep in my soul  
When I lose my grip  
  
And there's ropes and chains  
Slowing me as I walk  
I feel hope through pain  
As the road ahead forks  
To the left and the right  
To the right and the wrong
