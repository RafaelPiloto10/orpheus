No I can't take it no longer I'm goin' out of my mind  
Baby since you been goner you know I cry all the time  
I'm gonna crawl right back to you on my knees  
Cryin' take me back please baby please please please  
I can't take it no longer I got to be in your arms  
You know it really is a wonder I ain't in the funny farm  
Cause the sun ain't shinin' and it's nine eight degrees  
But I'm shiverin' and shakin' and bout to freeze  
I can't take it no longer I can't take it no longer  
  
[Steel]  
  
I ain't gonna pay no attention to my pride  
Cause without your sweet love I get to be tired  
I can't take it no longer I'm goin' out of my mind  
Baby since you been goner you know I cry all the time  
I'm gonna crawl right back to you on my knees  
Cryin' take me back please baby please please please  
I can't take it no longer I can't take it no longer  
I can't take it no longer I can't take it no longer
