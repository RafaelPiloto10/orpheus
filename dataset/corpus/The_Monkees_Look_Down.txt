I'm holding my hand out, keeping my head high,  
Trying to get out of mechanical nights,  
When I get to the top of the clear, crystal mountain,  
I'm going to stay up there as long as I can.  
And look down,  
Dig in the sights all around,  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down,  
And look down and look in.  
And my mind sends me reeling, breathing and feeling,  
I remember the time when I tried to come clean,  
But my interests collided, besides I was misguided,  
And who do you confide in when you trip on a dream?  
And look down,  
Dig in the sights all around,  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down,  
And look down and look in.  
If you want to come with me and tell me what you see,  
Just step in beside me and do what you want,  
And you may see clearly, though it sometimes is lonely,  
To be free is the only possession that counts.  
I'm holding my hand out, I'm keeping my head high,  
Trying to get out of mechanical nights,  
When I get to the top of the clear, crystal mountain,  
I'm going to stay up there as long as I can.  
Dig in the sights all around,  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down,  
And look down,  
And look down,  
And look down,  
Look down,  
Look down,  
Look down,  
Hold on, I'm coming.
