On a hillside in Hazzard  
Sets a new double-wide  
God's little acre  
Your paradise  
  
A poor boy found heaven  
With a good country girl  
He had all he wanted  
She was his whole world  
  
But working the coal mine  
Can wear a man down  
He started spending  
Too much time in town  
  
He found temptation  
Fell under it's spell  
And hillbilly Heaven  
Went to honky tonk Hell  
  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
From a warm home fire burning  
To a cold, cheap motel  
And an angel is crying  
'Cause her good man fell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
  
Somewhere in Hazzard  
On a dark, dead-end street  
Where whiskey and heartache  
And old memories meet  
  
He looks for salvation  
In a bottle each night  
And just goes on livin'  
Though he's lost his life  
  
Now there's a job in the coal mine  
That needs to be filled  
And a heartache in Hazzard  
That won't ever heal  
  
He had it all  
Now it's all for sale  
And hillbilly Heaven's  
Gone to honky tonk Hell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
From a warm home fire burning  
To a cold, cheap motel  
And an angel is crying  
'Cause her good man fell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
  
He's gone from hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell
