I'm not Lisa,  
My name is Julie.  
Lisa left you  
Years ago.  
  
My eyes are not blue,  
But mine won't leave you  
Till the sunlight  
Has touched your face.  
  
She was your morning light,  
Her smile told of no night.  
Your love for her grew  
With each rising sun.  
  
And then one winter day  
His hand laid her away,  
She left you here  
Drowning in your tears,  
Here, where you've stayed for years,  
Crying,
