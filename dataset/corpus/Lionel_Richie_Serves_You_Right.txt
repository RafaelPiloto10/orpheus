You and I were so in love.  
You were all I was thinkin' of.  
There was so much magic in your eyes.  
Then one day you said we were through.  
You said you found somebody new.  
And then you turned and you walked right out the door.  
Baby I told you his love wasn't true.  
You didn't hear me, so now I say these words to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye.  
Now you say you're sorry.  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye.  
Baby.  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye.  
Now you see who's sorry now.  
Oh, oh,oh.  
  
I remember you standin' there, sayin' to me you didn't care.  
And I was begging baby, please don't go.  
Now you're crying, telling me what went wrong.  
Girl you stayed away too long,  
Can't you see I've got you off my mind.  
(change)  
Thinkin''bout the pain that you put me through.  
I can't help you-because it feels good telling you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(rap) "see mama, what I'm tryin'to say.  
To you is that, I'm ,you know, I love ya,  
But ya - yaa hurt me so bad, I can't take it no more girl,  
I just can't take it, no, hell no"  
  
"no! no, no, I don't wanna hear it,  
Don't say it anymore, don't talk  
No more, I'm tired of you're lyin',  
I'm tired of your cryin' girl, tell  
Me, don't tell me."  
  
(change)  
Thinkin' 'bout the pain that you put me through,  
I can't help you-because it feels good telling you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"givin' up on your love girl, never  
Gonna believe you anymore,  
'cause all you wanna do is hurt me, and treat me bad"  
feels good telling you  
  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
Girl, I just don't need you  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
All you do is use my love,  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
Can't let you hurt me anymore.  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
Don't say you're sorry baby.  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
Cause your words don't mean a thing  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
It's you who's sorry now
