Last time she jumped out the window,  
Well, she only turned and smiled.  
You might think she would say something,  
But you'd have to wait a while.  
  
Well the lady don't mind.  
No, no, no, the lady don't mind  
She just turns her head and disappears,  
I kinda like that style  
  
Little boat that floats on a river,  
it's drifting through a haze  
She stops by whenever she wants to,  
well, there she goes again  
  
Well, it's no trouble at all.  
No, no, no trouble at all  
Well, what she does  
Is all right with me, and  
I kinda like that style  
  
Come on. come on. I go up and down.  
I like this curious feeling. I know, I see.  
It's like make believe.  
Cover your ears so you can hear what I'm saying.  
I'm not lost but I don't know  
Where I am. I got a question.  
All right. All right.  
This is what we like.  
Who knows, who knows,  
What I'm thinking  
  
She says love is not what she's after,  
And everyone knows.  
Each time she looks in the mirror,  
She lets her feelings show.  
  
Well, the lady don't mind  
No, no, no, the lady don't mind.  
Well, what she says is all right by me,  
And I kinda like that style  
  
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here we go again  
I don't know, I don't know,  
What I'm sayin'.  
Hey man. Hey man.  
I sure don't feel the same  
She likes to say what she's feeling  
Hey. Did I get a big surprise.  
I know you think so.  
Come on. Come on. She says anything.  
Who knows, who knows,  
What she's thinking.
