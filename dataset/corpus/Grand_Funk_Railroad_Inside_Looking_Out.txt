I'm sitting here lonely like a broken man.  
I serve my time doin' the best I can.  
Walls and bars they surround me.  
But, I don't want no sympathy.  
  
No baby, no baby,  
All I need is some tender lovin'.  
To keep me sane in this burning oven.  
And, when my time is up, you'll be my reefer.  
  
Life gets worse on God's green earth.  
Be my reefer, got to keep smokin' that thing.  
No, no, no, no, no, no.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
  
I said now baby baby let me smoke it smoke it  
Makes me feel good feel good, yes, I feel good ah  
Yes, I feel alright feel alright yes, I feel alright feel alright  
Yes, I feel alright ah  
Oh  
  
Ice cold water is runnin' through my veins.  
They try and drag me back to work again.  
Pain and blisters on my mind and hands.  
I work all day making up burlap bags.  
  
The oats they're feeding me are driving me wild.  
I feel unhappy like a new born child.  
Now, when my time is up, you wait and see.  
These walls and bars won't keep that stuff from me.  
  
No, no, baby,  
Won't keep that stuff from me.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
  
I need you right now mama.  
I need you right now baby.  
Right by my side, honey.  
All night long.  
  
Make me feel alright  
Yes, all yes, all yes, all alright.  
  
You better come on up and get down with me.  
I'll make you feel real good, just you wait and see.  
  
Make me feel alright yes, I feel alright  
Yes, all yes, all yes, alright.
