Angel, lady in white, stay away, you know my forces, devil eyes  
I'll take you to hell, you're inside my spell, in lucifer's mirror  
And I am his killer, I'm devil eyes  
Angel, lady in white, you've had your time, now you are mine, devil eyes  
I'll take you to hell, you're inside my spell, in lucifer's mirror  
And I am his killer  
Oh yeah, I'm devil eyes, oh yeah, I love my eyes, oh yeah, those evil  
Eyes,  
Oh yeah, I love my eyes (I'm gonna get you)  
I am heading for the gates of hell, bringing a victim, she's angel eyes  
I took her to hell, in lucifer's spell, I am his mirror  
And still I'm his killer, still I'm his killer, devil eyes, devil eyes.
