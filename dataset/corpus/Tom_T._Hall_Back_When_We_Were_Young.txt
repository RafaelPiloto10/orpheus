Back when we were young everybody came to see us  
Everybody wanted to be us back when we were young  
We loved each other so all our friends told one another  
And we even told each other back when we were young  
  
It was laughin' it was dancin'  
I was cigarettes and bourbon flavored kisses  
It was alligator shoes and new blue suits  
And anything that money wishes  
It was sittin' up all night and waitin'  
For the dawn to bring another wondrous day  
It was holding hands and thinking  
That tomorrow is a million years away  
  
Back when we were young everybody came to see us  
Everybody wanted to be us back when we were young  
We loved each other so all our friends told one another  
And we even told each other back when we were young  
  
It was rolling seventh of a time  
And thinking it was never ever gonna end  
Back then we even thought of time itself  
As being something as a passing friend  
It was buyin' one another things we didn't need  
And birthdays were so corny  
Back then we even had some friends  
Live as far away as California  
Back when we were young
