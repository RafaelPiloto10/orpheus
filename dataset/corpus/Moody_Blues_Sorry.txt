Just look at me know  
Because I'm tired of yelling  
Look at me now  
It's only me I'm selling  
I'm not willing to trade  
My life to make the sale  
You turn me around  
You put me down  
Look at me now  
  
I'm hanging out my heart to dry  
For the last time  
I'll tell you the reason why  
It's for the last time  
  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - lie  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - wear disguises  
Sorry a word they only use too late  
Sorry is a word that only ever means forgive my yesterdays  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - lie  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - wear disguises  
And sorry that's a word they can only use too late  
Sorry is a word that only ever means forgive my yesterdays  
(Sorry)  
  
Here I am loving you  
You lay you lay so quietly  
I can feel your breath upon my skin  
Afterglow came suddenly  
With you it always did  
  
I'm hanging out my heart to dry  
For the last time  
I'll tell you the reason why  
It's for the last time  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - lie  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - wear disguises  
  
They say sorry that's a word  
They only use too late  
Sorry is a word that only ever means  
Forgive my yesterdays  
  
(Uptown people lie)  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - wear disguises  
They say sorry  
That's a word they only use too late  
Sorry is a word that only ever means forgive
