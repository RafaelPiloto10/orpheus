[Children's choir singing in the background]  
  
Have no fear  
When darkness falls  
'Cause there's a light that shines  
Within us all  
  
Although this world  
Can turn so cold  
When we reach inside  
We find our warmth  
  
'Cause there's a flame that burns  
In every heart  
And it's the will we have  
That lights the spark  
  
[Chorus]  
Once in every lifetime  
There's a chance to stand apart  
We can show the world  
Our very best  
Reveal what's in our heart  
So the story goes and glory  
Never will end  
Inspiration lights the fire within  
  
And if we fall  
We won't stay down  
We will get back up  
And use the strength we've found  
  
And we will rise  
Like champions  
Every obstacle  
We'll overcome  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if we just stay strong  
Then our hearts will move us on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Each heart there burns desire  
Inspiration lights the fire within
