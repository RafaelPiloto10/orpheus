Baby girl  
You know my situation  
And sometimes I know you get impatient  
But you don't put to on a show to get patience  
Take it to court and go through litigations  
And I respect ya gangsta  
Treat you like a princess  
And put something on your neck to thank ya  
She's my pinch hitter  
When the starting lineup ain't playing right  
I come off the bench wit her  
It might sound like I'm gassing ya  
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger  
We been creeping and sneaking  
Just to keep it from leaking  
We so deep in our freaking  
That we don't sleep on the weekend  
Wifey  
A little bit uptight  
Wondering why he coming home in the middle of the night  
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight  
But I said it'll be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
I really want to be with you (be with you)  
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)  
I can't leave you alone (lone)  
And I know I'm living wrong  
But I can't let ya go  
Your the one I want in my life (want in my life)  
Already got a wife (got a wife)  
Can't leave you alone (lone)  
And I know I'm living wrong  
But I can't let ya go  
  
You ain't ever step out of line  
Or get out a pocket  
So I made sure canary sent out your locket  
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it  
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket  
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through  
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through  
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through  
So I cop her one, and cop you one too  
You always get a daily page, weekly ring  
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things  
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger  
I worry about you telling the whole world I'm your new Allen Springer  
At first you were something I denied  
Something I would slide  
Just do something in the ride  
But shorty  
There's something that you provide  
Cause the entree ain't as good without something on the side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh oh, I might be leaving the earth soon  
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume  
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back  
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback  
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper  
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper  
So keep it on the down low call the carsely  
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R. Kelly  
  
You know I get from you  
Anytime this chick is there for you  
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you  
Which makes it a Lil Mo clear for you  
  
[Chorus]
