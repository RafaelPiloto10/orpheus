The fortune teller looked into my eyeballs  
The wrinkles on her face about to crack  
She said 'you best believe it,  
You ain't goin' nowhere, unless you get that  
Monkey off your back'  
I made believe the devil made me do it  
I was the evil leader of the pack  
You best believe I had it all and then I blew it  
Feedin' that fuckin' monkey on my back  
If you put it a spoon man I would boot it  
Some king whose mental house was just a shack  
Where do you draw the line when all your friends are dyin'  
You got to get that monkey off your back  
Uh, uh, uh....  
Your crystal ball is where you chase the dragon  
She said, 'now' I bring me home his head inside a sack  
But now you find your crystal balls are draggin'  
Got to get that monkey off your back
