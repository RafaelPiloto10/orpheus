There are stars in the southern sky  
Southward as you go.  
There is moonlight and moss in the trees  
Down the Seven Bridges Road.  
  
Now I have loved you like a baby...  
Like some lonesome child,  
And I have loved you in a tame way,  
And I have loved you wild.  
  
Sometimes there's a part of me  
Has to turn from here and go...  
Running like a child from these warm stars  
Down the Seven Bridges Road.  
  
There are stars in the southern sky.  
And if ever you decide you should go,  
There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey  
Down the Seven Bridges Road.
