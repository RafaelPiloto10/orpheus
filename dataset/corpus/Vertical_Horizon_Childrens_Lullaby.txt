Little girl was down by the waterside  
The sun so hot and the roses so red where she lie  
As little boys sit and watch as she twirls all around  
Sunny smiles not a raincloud could bring that girl down  
But now...  
  
What's behind those big brown eyes  
Do you dream at night  
Without your lullaby  
  
Little boy sits alone as he sings in the dark  
Wondering if his own dreams had pulled them apart  
He sings a song of tomorrow he never can see  
Mostly sings of a lost little girl's memory  
And now...  
  
As his dreams go flashing by  
He begins to hear  
A lonely lullaby  
  
Well now...  
We used to sing  
And we used to cry  
Through everything  
In our children's lullaby  
  
Little girl on the street with nobody around  
Has her head in the air dirty feet on the ground  
She shuts her eyes and wonders if this is a mistake  
Now she's gone from the warmth of her little boy days  
And still...  
  
She believes that she'll get by  
On her own without  
Her little boy's lullaby  
  
Little boy prays to God to answer his song  
To hold her hand when everyone else's are gone  
Time goes by and the wounds slowly turn into scars  
So he makes his final wish on the midnight stars  
And he screams...  
  
Little girl won't you hear my cry  
Won't you come back home  
To your lover's lullaby  
  
Little girl down by the waterside  
Goodbye
