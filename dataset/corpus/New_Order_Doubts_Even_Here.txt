Those steps which seem to take a lifetime  
When eyes just turn and stare  
The day begins, collapsing without warning  
You fade from sight, there's nothing there  
  
No hope allowed, calls are answered daily  
Questions are on your side  
Deeply moved, beyond all consolation  
You felt the pulse, now hear the cry  
  
In my mind, thoughts are becoming clearer  
I'm watching every move you make  
Counting time spent in observation  
A single blow a false mistake  
  
Then you revealed to me  
All that I need to know now  
(The close went down to times  
too, too much behind us)  
Then please don't turn away,  
Why can't I talk to you now?  
(The number of forgotten years  
Where my honor isn't deepest  
Grows the deepest feeling and it  
Grieved for safety and despair)  
There's nowhere left to go  
Where is this taking her and how?  
(The torish threats forevermore  
Over our natural favor  
And us and he's and I'll fall  
Far in it, and it sees enough  
In our failures and it's not time.)  
There's nothing more I want  
To know beyond your trust now  
(I missed his promised time again  
For my friend)  
Don't throw our joy away  
Why must you just you leave now?  
(Has God forgotten to approach us?  
Has He rememberd to not despise us?)  
Memories are all that's left  
I need you near to me now  
(There, now, now, don't come to mind my deeds  
And call out in defiance of times gone by)
