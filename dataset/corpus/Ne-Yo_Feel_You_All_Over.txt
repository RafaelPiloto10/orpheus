Feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
  
Would be beyond understatement to  
To simply say that I miss you  
And the sky outside is blue  
But my mind inside is too  
  
Don't think about it  
I only think about it  
When gets old  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
God never makes mistakes I know  
So there's a reason you had to go  
There's a reason for no more lies  
I just wish I knew what it was  
  
Don't think about it  
I only think about it  
When gets old  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
And don't think about it, no  
Suffer when the wind blows  
Don't think about it  
Suffer every time my heart goes  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
Feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
Feel you all over me  
(Feel you all over)
