Her mama picked him up in south Minnesota  
He promised her the world but they never got that far  
For he was last seen in that '59 DeSota  
When Sally was born in the black hills of Dakota  
She was washed in the blood of the dying Sioux nation  
Raised with a proud but a wandering heart  
And she knew that her roots were in the old reservation  
But she had stars in her eyes and graeter expectations  
No rings on her fingers no bells on het toes  
With bugs on her headlights  
And runs in her hose  
Through the valley of the shadow of Roosevelt's nose  
Adios, South Dakota, adios Sally Rose  
They've got a national monument carved out of stone  
On the side of a mountain where her forefathers roamed  
Playing cowboys and Indians right under the nose  
Of Theodore Roosevelt and the sweet Sally Rose  
So she left Rapid City in the blue moonlight hour  
With her eye on the highway and her foot on the floor  
And turnin' the dial she was pulled by the power  
Of the word coming out of that broadcasting tower
