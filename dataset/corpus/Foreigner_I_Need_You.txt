Selling your soul ain't the right way of givin'  
Oh with you I could change  
This misguided goal I've been livin'  
Anything, anything, you might need or desire  
Just call on me, 'cause my heart's on fire  
  
And I need you  
Do you need me too?  
Yes I need you, yes I need you  
  
Many is the time I've cursed the lord's creations  
Ah but you touched my hand  
I loved this new sensation  
It was very strange, what a change  
Of you I did not tire  
So call on me, my heart's on fire  
  
Well I need you  
Do you need me too? need me too?  
Yes I need you, ah  
  
Yes I need you  
Oh I need you  
And I need you  
Say you need me too  
Yes I need you  
Oh I need  
Say you need me too  
  
Yes I need you  
And I need you  
Oh I need  
Yes I need you  
Oh I need  
Say you need me too  
Say you need me too  
Say you need me too  
Say, say baby  
Say you need me too  
Yes I need you  
Oh I need you too  
And I need you
