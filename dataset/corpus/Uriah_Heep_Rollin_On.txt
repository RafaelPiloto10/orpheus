It came as the daybreak  
Must surely arrive  
Opened my eyes just  
To be sure I was alive  
Another day  
They're much the same  
Twentyfour hours for me  
To try again  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
  
It came as a judgement  
We all have to face  
Fickle hour you bring me joy  
You bring me disgrace  
I'll take your challenge  
Man against emotion  
I'll wager my beliefs  
Against my sin  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
Well, I'm rollin' on  
  
Rollin' on and on and on forever  
Yes, I am  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on together  
Rollin' on and on and on forever  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on  
  
Yes, I'm rollin' on  
To where I don't care  
Crystal ball  
You let me down again  
Rollin' down a road  
I've never seen  
Meeting people  
Seeing places I've never been  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
  
Rollin' on and on and on forever  
Yes, I am  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on together  
Rollin' on and on and on forever  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on together  
  
I'm rollin' on. I'm rollin' on  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
Crystal ball  
You let me down again  
I'm rollin' on  
Well, I'm rollin'
