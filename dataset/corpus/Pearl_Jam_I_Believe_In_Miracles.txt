I used to be on an endless run  
Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one  
I've been blessed with the power to survive  
After all these years I'm still alive  
  
I'm out here kickin with the band  
I am no longer a solitary man  
Everyday my time runs out  
Live like a fool, that's what I was about  
  
Oh I belive in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
Oh Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
  
Tattooed your name on my arm  
I always said my girl's a good luck charm  
If she can find a reason to forgive  
Then I can find a reason to live  
  
I used to be on an endless run  
Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one  
I've been blessed with the power to survive  
After all these years I'm still alive  
  
Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
Oh Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
  
I close my eyes and think how it might be  
The future's here today  
It's not too late, it's not too late oh  
  
I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you
