On a day like no other  
In a time unique, in a place divine  
Keep your eye on the Ikon  
Shining in the light of eternal mind.  
  
I went to sleep a blind man  
But when I awoke I saw  
The legions of the lonely  
See their faces, hear them call.  
  
See how they hang on  
Each one in a world of his own design  
Listen to the Ikon  
Ringing in the sound of eternal mind.  
  
And the music plays forever  
And it captures every ear  
And the sound of barriers crashing down  
Is the sweet harmony you hear.  
  
Still, be still  
To strong, so be still  
Much too long, come down  
Be still, look around  
Listen here, be still  
Hear the sound, be still.  
  
Still we are here  
We are still  
Will we sing sweet  
Sing we will  
Still we are here  
We are still  
Nil is a fear all is nil  
Still we are here we are still  
Spill it let go let it spill.  
  
The question comes to mind  
About what should be done  
And how much of the old will die  
That the new may be begun  
But you don't have to be afraid  
Of being alone with nowhere to run.  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
To look yourself in the eye  
You don't have to be afraid not to lie.  
  
Someone knows who you are  
Someone watches over you  
Someone knows how you feel  
And someone feels the same.  
  
So you don't have to be afraid  
Never fear, for you are living in eternal mind  
  
For those who still recoil  
For those who fear the pain  
Of peering o'er the edge of  
A new and different plane.  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
Whenever you go you come back again  
So you don't have to be afraid  
We live and we die  
You don't have to be afraid to know why.  
  
You do
