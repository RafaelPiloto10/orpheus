Boy and girl fall in love  
Dreamin' under stars above  
Meanwhile push comes to shove  
Around the world.  
  
Leaders fall, leaders rise  
Terror wears a thin disguise  
Not much room for compromise  
Around the world.  
  
Surfers from seven seas  
Sharing with the submarines  
Experts count war machines  
Around the world.  
  
People sweat in planted fields  
Students study what is real  
Someone builds a laser shield  
Around the world.  
  
Fashion change, style change  
Fashion change, style change  
Fashion change, style change.  
  
Hey! What's that you got on?  
You're sure looking good tonight!  
Where'd you pick that up anyway?  
Wow! You're looking beautiful!  
Hey! You are somethin' else tonight, so skin tight.  
Yeah! Come on, lets go out! Come On!  
  
Why do we have to hate  
Why do we incinerate  
Why don't we illuminate  
Around the world.  
  
Why don't we illuminate  
Why don't we illuminate  
Around the world.
