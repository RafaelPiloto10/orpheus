It's been a long time coming  
Ye it's been a long time coming  
But you know you had it coming  
You know you had it coming  
  
Everyone's running from something but we don't know when it's coming  
So we keep running and running  
  
Now I'm looking up the bible trying to find a Loophole  
Ye I'm living for revival, dying for a new soul  
Now there's no light to guide me on my way home  
Now there's no time to shine my rusty halo  
  
It's been a long time coming  
Ye it's been a long time coming  
It's been a long time coming  
Been so long but I gotta Shine my Rusty halo  
  
Now I'm running for the light in the tunnel but it's just the train  
Ye I'm looking for the right type of pleasure but all I find is pain  
Now there's no light to guide me on my way home  
Now there's no time to shine my rusty halo  
  
It's been a long time coming  
Ye it's been a long time coming  
It's been a long time coming  
Been so long but I gotta Shine my Rusty halo  
  
Everyone's running from something but we don't know when it's coming  
So we keep running and running
