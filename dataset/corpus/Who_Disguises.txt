I used to know everything about you  
But today when I tried to point you out to one of my friends  
I picked the wrong girl again  
Don't see you in the crowd anymore  
I think it's you, but I can't be sure  
You're wearing disguises  
Occasionally a girl surprises me  
When she turns out to be you  
Wearing disguises  
  
I don't think you want me to see you ever again  
And today I saw you dressed as a flower bed  
  
Last week you had a wig on your head  
Directing traffic in the street  
And your shoes were too big for your feet  
You were wearing disguises  
Occasionally a girl surprises me  
When she turns out to be you  
Wearing disguises  
  
I used to know everything about you  
But today when I tried to point you out to one of my friends  
I picked the wrong girl again  
Don't see you in the crowd anymore  
I think it's you, but I can't be sure  
You're wearing disguises  
Occasionally a girl surprises me  
When she turns out to be you  
Wearing disguises  
  
Wearing disguises  
Wearing disguises  
Wearing disguises  
Wearing disguises
