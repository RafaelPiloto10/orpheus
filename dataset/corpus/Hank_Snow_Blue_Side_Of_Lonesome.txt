I'm calling to tell you it's over yes darling you're now free to go  
You're saying you're sorry you hurt me but you hurt me much more than you know  
You're asking me where this call comes from oh I hope that you won't interfere  
In your new romance turns out a failure here's where you'll find me my dear  
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome right next to the Heartbreak Hotel  
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops on a barstool not doing so well  
The hands of the clock never alter for things never change in this place  
There's no present no past and no future for the ones who have lost in love's
race  
  
The hands of the clock
