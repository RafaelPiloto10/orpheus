You can hear, hear it comin'  
Like a train out of control  
Surely leaves you wonderin'  
Exactly where your ticket goes  
Scream at the conductor  
He's been deaf for twenty years  
Hear the other people laughin'  
As he grinds through every gear  
  
You go to grab your nerve, you find that its been missin'  
Seems you've lost your faith in everyone you know  
Well I surely hope that you don't plan on winnin'  
Better start payin' more attention to the ones that throw you clear  
You are seconds from the impact, but you're movin' way too slow  
  
You say time will surely mold you  
Into something you don't like  
Now you're runnin' like a rabbit  
Stick your finger in the dike  
  
Look around your room you find the paint is peelin'  
Your reflective skin is fallin' off your bones  
Well, I must admit I know just how you're feelin'  
Must grab each others collar, must rise out of the water  
'Cause you know as well as I do that it's no fun to die alone  
  
After all that I've been through, you're the only one that matters  
Climb to safety  
You never left me in the dark here on my own  
Climb to safety  
I can feel the water rising, let me be your ladder  
Climb to safety  
I promise you'll be dry and never be alone  
  
You tell me love, has always scared you  
Like the things under your bed  
Baby, we can walk on water  
Like some junkies swore they did  
  
You call me on the phone, you say that it is crucial  
Stick your fingers in your ears 'til they explode  
It's just business, and it rolls along as usual  
Must grab each others collar, we must rise out of the water  
'Cause you know as well as I do that it's no fun to die alone  
  
After all that I've been through, you're the only one that matters  
Climb to safety  
You never left me in the dark here on my own  
Climb to safety  
I can feel the water rising, let me be your ladder  
Climb to safety  
I promise you'll be dry and never be alone  
  
After all that I've been through, you're the only one that matters  
Climb to safety  
You never left me in the dark here on my own  
Climb to safety  
I can feel the water rising, let me be your ladder  
Climb to safety  
I promise you'll be dry and never be alone  
  
Yeah, climb to safety  
Ooh, climb to safety, safety  
Yeah  
Climb to safety
