Tell me actions speak louder  
But there's something about her words, that hurt  
Closing up and it's so late and  
I'm the last one still waiting for ya, to lock the door  
  
On our way home I realize  
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes  
Only veiled by a thin disguise  
  
Now that I've done my time  
I need to move on and I need you to try  
'Cause we're out of goodbyes  
We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes  
  
Never asked you to change  
But sadly you don't feel the same, about me  
I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand  
Like this man  
  
On our way home I realize  
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes  
Only veiled by a thin disguise  
  
Now that I've done my time  
I need to move on and I need you to try  
'Cause we're out of goodbyes  
We're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes  
Oh, ooh
