I Used to think that we've come too far to give up now  
Now I see that you're really not the one for me  
I constantly try to show my love, do everything  
But now I think if I voice my love how wrong could it be  
  
[Chorus]  
I never knew it before, I always thought I'd be sure  
I plan to be with only you forever  
But how can we just go on  
Now that I know it's so wrong  
We can't spend another day together  
  
You should go, I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye, cause I don't need you with me  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time, and it's all because of you  
  
I was blind, couldn't see the writing on the wall  
In my mind, you were the only one to be with me  
I can't believe, that it took so long to figure out  
The games you play, now the truth is clear I have no doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You should go, I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye cause I don't need you in my life  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time, and I won't waste my time with you no more  
You should go, I don't want to feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye, you can leave, you can leave  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time, and I never knew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You should go, I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time  
Everything I tried to do, but it did not work  
You should go, I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time
