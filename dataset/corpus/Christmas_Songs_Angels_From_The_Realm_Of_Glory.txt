Angels from the realms of glory  
Wing your flight over all the earth  
Ye, who sang creations story  
Now proclaim Messiah's birth  
Come and worship, come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King  
  
Shepherds in the fields abiding  
Watching over your flocks by night  
God with man is now residing  
Yonder shines the Infant light  
Come and worship, come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King  
  
Sages leave your contemplations  
Brighter visions beam afar  
Seek the great Desire of nations  
Ye have seen His natal star  
Come and worship, come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King  
  
Saints before the alter bending  
Watching long in hope and fear  
Suddenly the Lord, descending,  
In His temple shall appear  
Come and worship, come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King
