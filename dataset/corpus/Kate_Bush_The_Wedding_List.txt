No, I'll never give the hunt up,  
And I won't muck it up.  
Somehow this is it, I knew.  
Maybe fate wants you dead, too  
We've come together in the very same room,  
And I'm coming for you!  
  
Do you think I'd ever let you  
Get away with it, huh?  
He swooned in warm maroon.  
There's gas in your barrel, and I'm flooded with Doom.  
You've made a wake of our honeymoon,  
And I'm coming for you!"  
  
"All of the headLines said 'Passion Crime"  
'Newly weds Groom Shot Dead  
'Mystery Man.' God help the bride  
She's a widow, all in red,  
With his red still wet. She said--"  
  
I'll put him on the wedding list!  
I'll put him on the wedding list!  
I'll get him and I will not miss.  
  
Now, as I'm coming for you,  
All I see is Rudi.  
I die with him, again and again.  
And I'll feel good in my revenge.  
I'm gonna fill your head with lead  
And I'm coming for you!  
  
And when it's all over you'll roll over  
The butt of my gun:  
One in your belly, and one for Rudi.  
You got what you gave by the heel of my bootie.  
Bang-bang--Out! like an old cherootie,  
I'm coming for you!  
  
"All of the headLines said 'Passion Crime:  
'Newly weds Groom Shot Dead  
'Mystery Man.' God help the bride!  
She's a widow, all in red,  
With his red still wet. She said--"  
  
She sure got him on the wedding list  
I'll got him on the wedding list!  
I'll got him and I will not miss.  
I'll put him on the wedding list!  
  
"And after she shot the guy,  
She committed suicide.  
I'm coming, Rudi!  
"And later, when they analyzed,  
They found a little one inside.  
"It must have been Rudi's child."  
I shot, I shot, I shot him honey!  
"Never mind, she got the guy."  
He hit the ground, Rudi!  
"An eye for an eye."  
Ashes to ashes  
"Eye for an eye."  
I hit him, hit him  
Rudi!, Rudi!  
I'm coming coming coming honey  
"Eye for an eye."  
Rudi!
