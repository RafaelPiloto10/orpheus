There's this girl that's been on my mind  
All the time, Sussudio oh oh  
Now she don't even know my name  
But I think she likes me just the same  
Sussudio oh oh  
  
Oh if she called me I'd be there  
I'd come running anywhere  
She's all I need, all my life  
I feel so good if I just say the word  
Sussudio, just say the word  
Oh Sussudio  
  
Now I know that I'm too young  
My love has just begun  
Sussudio oh oh  
Ooh give me a chance, give me a sign  
I'll show her anytime  
Sussudio oh oh  
  
Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now  
I've got to get closer but I don't know how  
She makes me nervous and makes me scared  
But I feel so good if I just say the word  
Sussudio just say the word  
Oh Sussudio, oh  
  
Ah, she's all I need all of my life  
I feel so good if I just say the word  
Sussudio I just say the word  
Oh Sussudio I just say the word  
Oh Sussudio I'll say the word  
Sussudio oh oh oh  
Just say the word
