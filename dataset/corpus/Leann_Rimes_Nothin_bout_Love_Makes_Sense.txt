Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky  
Ice shouldn't burn or a bumble bee fly  
If you feel so happy, then why do you cry  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
  
Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea  
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas  
Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me  
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
  
[Chorus]  
Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'  
You can win when you're losin'  
Stand when you're fallin'  
I can't figure it out  
Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation  
Nothin' short of amazin'  
Wish I could explain it  
But I didn't know how  
  
The way that we dance  
The reason we dream  
That big Italian tower  
Oh, how does it lean  
Somethin' so strong shouldn't make me this weak  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like the lights of Las Vegas glowin' out of the sand  
A jumbo shrimp or a baby grand  
How you touch my heart when you hold my hand  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense
