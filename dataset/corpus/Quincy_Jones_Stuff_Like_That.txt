Walked in the joint  
They were lined up back to back  
Anything you can name, no shame  
Uh, uh, an' stuff like that  
Do it, do it, do it, do it  
  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
  
Before my eyes was the promise of paradise  
Is she real, can she feel, is she a dream  
If you know what I mean  
'Cause she was built out of stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
  
I knew I was captured  
By the rhythm of the magic flute  
Pulling and urging me  
To taste the forbidden fruit  
  
And though I felt naive  
I did not want to leave, fever was in the air  
And all of us sudden and I didn't care  
And no reason why, I just had to testify  
  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it  
  
I knew I was captured  
By the rhythm of the magic flute  
Pulling and urging me  
To taste the forbidden fruit  
  
And though I felt naive  
I did want to play, fever was in the air  
And all of us sudden and I didn't care  
And no reason why, I just had to testify  
  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
  
Stuff like that, stuff like that  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
  
I can't tell you, what I saw  
Made you one was it against the law  
It was not how you could you go  
Thought exactly how low  
  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
  
All of a sudden, I didn't care  
And no reason why, had to testify  
  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
  
Stuff like that, stuff like that  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?  
  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it, do it  
Stuff like that  
  
Stuff like that, stuff like that
