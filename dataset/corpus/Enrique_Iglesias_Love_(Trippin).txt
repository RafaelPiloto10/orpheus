They say I'm crazy, the way you got me open, baby  
They say I'm buggin', the way I'm tight sweatin' your lovin'  
They all sit and wonder why the reason this I cannot hide  
It ain't a question of pride  
  
They say I'm trippin', the way you got my whole life flippin'  
They say I'm losin' it, just can't seem to keep my grip, baby  
We all cry when we feel pain, when love is gone we're not the same  
It ain't a question of brains  
  
Crazy, the way you got me open, baby  
They say I'm buggin', the way I'm tight sweatin' your lovin'  
  
They say I'm slippin' the way you got my whole life flippin'  
They say I'm losin' it, just can't seem to get my grip, baby  
  
They all sit and wonder why the reason this I cannot hide  
It ain't a question of pride
