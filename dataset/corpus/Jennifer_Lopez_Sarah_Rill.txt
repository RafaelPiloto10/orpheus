He was always such a nice boy  
The quiet one  
With good intentions  
He was down for his brother  
Respectful to his mother  
A good boy  
But good don't get attention  
One kid with a promise  
The brightest kid in school  
He's not a fool  
Reading books about science and smart stuff  
It's not enough, no  
Cause smart don't make you cool, whoa  
  
He's not invisible anymore  
With his Father's 9 and a broken fuse  
Since he walked through that classroom door  
He's all over primetime news  
  
Mary's got the same size hands  
As Marilyn Monroe  
She put her fingers in the imprints  
At Mann's Chinese Theatre show  
She coulda been a movie star  
Never got the chance to go that far  
Her life was stole  
Now we'll never know  
  
No no no no oh  
  
They were crying to the camera  
Said he never fitted in  
He wasn't welcomed  
He showed up to the parties  
He was hanging in  
Some guys puttin' him down  
Bullying him round round  
Now I wish I woulda talked to him  
Gave him the time of day  
Not turn away  
If I woulda been the one to maybe go this far  
He might have stayed at home  
Playing angry chords on his guitar  
  
He's not invisible anymore  
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains  
Since he walked through that classroom door  
Everybody knows his name  
  
Mary's got the same size hands (Oh)  
As Marilyn Monroe  
She put her fingers in the imprints (Ooh)  
At Mann's Chinese Theatre show  
She coulda been a movie star  
Never got the chance to go that far  
Her life was stole  
Now we'll never know  
(Now we'll never know, oh)  
  
Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away (20 feet away)  
He had a tryout with the Sixers  
Couldn't wait for Saturday (Saturday)  
Now we're never gonna see him slam  
Flying high as Kobe can  
His life was stole (Stole)
