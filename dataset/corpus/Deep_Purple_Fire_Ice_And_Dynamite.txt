If you find me tugging at your sleeve  
Oh yeah well maybe you'd better believe  
I'm searching for the one to love  
That's all I'm thinking of  
  
I believe in taking chances  
Gonna see what your romance is  
I'll be risking my life tonight  
Fire, ice and dynamite  
In the fire, ice and dynamite  
If you see me running to extremes  
Oh yeh well I'm only chasing my dreams  
If you see me coming close the door  
I'm coming back for more  
  
I believe in taking chances  
Gonna see what your romance is  
I'll be risking my life tonight  
Fire, ice and dynamite  
In the fire, ice and dynamite  
Fire and ice..... And dynamite  
  
Don't you worry if it starts to rain  
Step aside if you can't stand the pain  
From the mountain top to the valley below  
Oh yeh well I'm fighting with the flow  
I maybe burning in the frozen sun  
Cos I'm gonna be number one  
  
I believe in taking chances  
Gonna see what your romance is  
I'll be risking my life tonight  
Fire, ice and dynamite  
Fire, ice and dynamite  
Fire, ice and dynamite  
Fire, ice and dynamite  
Cos I believe..... In taking chances
