Draw me a circle that's perfectly round  
One curving line, simple and fine  
Now add two ears, and a lopsided nose,  
And if you care, add some hair  
Now draw two eyes and make them bright  
Because they've just seen a beautiful sight  
Sketch in a mouth with a radiant grin  
One coming deep from within  
You've drawn me a circle and now that you're through,  
It's a picture of me after being with you...
