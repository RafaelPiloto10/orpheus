Watchin' lovers walkin'  
Hand in hand they pass me by  
Wish I was one of them  
Wish I had somebody  
  
Wakin' up beside me  
Looking into my eyes at night  
I want a love to call my own  
I want someone that I can hold  
  
Want someone wanting me  
want to feel how it feels to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Somebody's somebody  
Somebody's someone  
Some sweet lover's lover  
I want to be that one  
Someone faithful to someone faithful  
Someone kind to someone kind to me  
Somebody to somebody who loves me  
Who loves me  
  
Spending all of my time  
Spending all my time on me  
Where is that someone who  
I can give my time to  
  
Searching for that lover  
With the love that will change my life  
I want two arms to hold me close  
I want the thing I need most  
  
Somebody needing me  
So I can feel how it feels to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What I'm looking for  
Is someone to love me more  
Than I've been loved before  
With love so right  
  
What I need to find  
Is someone to hold me tight  
What I mean is i want to be  
  
[Chorus]
