I'm gonna tell my friends about you  
Tell them about the things that you do to me  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be  
Tell them you're everything that's good so good to me  
I want to be always close to you  
To give a helping hand if ever you're in need  
I want to be always close to you  
Don't have to try you out for size  
You fit my heart so comfortable and warm  
The only one I have no doubt no fear about  
Without you what would my life be  
I want to be always close to you  
To give a helping hand if ever you're in need  
I want to be always so close to you  
I want to be always close to you  
To give a helping hand if ever you're in need  
I want to be always close to you  
Don't have to try you out for size  
You fit my heart so comfortable and warm  
The only one I have no doubt no fear about  
Without you what would my life be  
Without you what would my life be  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be
