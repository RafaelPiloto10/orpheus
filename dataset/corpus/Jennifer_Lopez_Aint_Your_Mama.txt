[Chorus]  
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama  
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama  
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama  
When you're gon' get your act together?  
I ain't your mama  
No, I ain't your mama  
No, I ain't your mama, no  
  
[Verse 1]  
Wake up, rise and shine, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Let's get to work on time, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
No more playing video games, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Things are about to change, 'round here, 'round here  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We used to be crazy in love  
Can we go back to how it was?  
When did you get too comfortable?  
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that  
Just remember that, hey

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama  
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama

When you're gon' get your act together?

No, I ain't your mama  
No, I ain't your mama, no  
  
[Verse 2]  
Lucky to have these curves, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Stop getting on my nerves, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
You still tryna ride this train? Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Cause some things have gotta change, 'round here, 'round here  
  
[Pre-Chorus]
