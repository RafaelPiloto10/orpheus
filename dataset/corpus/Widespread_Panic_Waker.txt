My name is the Waker  
And I'm bringin' you the morning sun  
I've pushed the old man up forever  
Still I feel I've just begun  
  
I've just begun  
  
My name is treetop  
And I'm higher than you'll ever be  
I'm married to my roots here  
Still I feel like I am free  
  
Feelin' I'm free  
  
My name is blue sky  
And I'm bluer than all of you  
I've watched you run around forever  
Always searching for something new  
  
There's nothing new  
Feelin' I'm free  
I've just begun  
I'm always young  
Love's always new
