I'm a street walking cheetah  
With a heart full of napalm  
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb  
I am the world's forgotten boy  
The one who searches and destroys  
  
Honey gotta help me please  
Somebody gotta save my soul  
Baby, detonate for me  
  
Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology!  
Ain't got time to make no apology  
Soul radiation in the dead of night  
Love in the middle of a fire fight  
  
Honey gotta strike me blind  
Somebody gotta save my soul  
Baby, penetrate my mind  
  
And I'm the world's forgotten boy  
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy  
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy  
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy  
Forgotten boy, forgotten boy  
Forgotten boy said  
Hey forgotten boy
