Well, my temperature's risin'  
Got my feet on the floor  
Twenty people rockin'  
Sayin' more, more, more  
Come on, pretty baby  
I don't know what you've got  
But you'd better take it easy  
This place is hot  
And I'm so glad you made it  
So glad you made it  
Won't you come on  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin' every day  
Well, now I feel so good  
Everybody's gettin' high  
I'm gonna take it easy  
'Cause the place is on fire  
Come on, pretty baby  
I don't know what you've got  
But you'd better take it easy  
This place is hot  
And I'm so glad you made it  
So glad you made it  
Won't you come on  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin'  
Gimme some lovin' every day  
Well, I feel so good  
Everybody's gettin' high  
I'm gonna take it easy  
'Cause the place is on fire  
Been a hard day  
Nothin's been too good  
Now I'm gonna relax, honey  
Everybody should  
And I'm so glad you could made it  
So glad you could made it  
Yes, I'm so glad you could made it  
So glad you could made it  
Won't you come on  
Gimme some lovin'
