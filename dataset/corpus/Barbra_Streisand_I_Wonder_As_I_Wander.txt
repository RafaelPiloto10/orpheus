I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
How Jesus the savior, did come for die  
For poor orn'ry people like you and like I  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
  
When Mary birthed Jesus, t'was in a cow'stall  
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all  
And high from gods heaven a starlight did fall  
And the promise of ages, it then did recall  
  
If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing  
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing  
Or all of gods angels in heaven to sing  
He surely could've had it, 'cause he was the king  
  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
I wonder as I wander  
  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
How Jesus the savior, did come for die  
For poor orn'ry people like you and like I  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
  
I wonder as I wander out under the, sky
