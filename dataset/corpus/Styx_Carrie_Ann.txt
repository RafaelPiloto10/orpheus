Time stands still, baby when I touch you  
I can't believe the way I'm feelin'  
Please don't speak, it's taken me all this time  
To find the strength just to say  
  
That I never knew what love was til I met you  
Never thought that I could act this way  
But I'm still afraid to show how much I need you  
Tell me, what makes a man like me this way  
  
Carrie Ann, don't ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann, words can't explain  
The way that I feel in my heart  
  
Lovers' hearts never quite beat in time  
They never find that perfect rhythm  
You know I let you down many times  
But this I promise to you  
That I'll never lead you through doors of deception  
I won't bind you to a chain of lies  
Though I know my love for you won't be perfection  
What I give to you will last all time  
  
Carrie Ann, don't ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann, my words can't explain  
The way that I feel in my heart  
  
Take a little time to realize  
I'll love you faithfully  
Just take a little time and you'll see  
That baby it's me  
  
Carrie Ann, don't ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann, my words can't explain  
The way that I feel in my heart
