Here's the story of a man and his family  
And a big trip that they took  
Well, I heard all about in a restaurant  
And I read it in a history book  
They rented a car at the Erie Canal  
But the car didn't have no brake  
Said ma to pa "My God this car  
Is gonna fall into the bottomless lake"  
Well, mama turned to daddy with a pale face  
Said "I've done something horribly wrong  
Well, the waters still runnin' in the bathtub  
And I think I left the kitchen light on"  
Then I heard a crash, the car when splash  
The compass rolled around and around  
Oh, for Heaven's sake! We fell in a lake  
And I think we're all gonna drown  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
There was plenty of food in the backseat  
And the windows were rolled up tight  
So we all nibbled on a chicken leg  
Told stories way through the night  
Well, pa told one that he told before  
And the baby got a bellyache  
Said ma to pa "My God this car's  
Falling down a bottomless lake"  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
Well papa played the music on the radio  
Mama rocked the baby to sleep  
He said, he would've taken the other road  
But he didn't think the lake was that deep  
Well, if the ferry had been there at the end of the pier  
We'd be half way to Uncle Jake's  
Instead of looking at fish out the window, I wish  
We'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  
'Stead of looking at fish out the window, I wish  
We'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
So if you're ever goin' on a big trip  
You better be careful out there  
Start everything on your good foot  
Wear clean underwear  
Take along a Bible in the backseat  
Read of David and Solomon  
For if you make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again  
If you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again  
If you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again, that's right
