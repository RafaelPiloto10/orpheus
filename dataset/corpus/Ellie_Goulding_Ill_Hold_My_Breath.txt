Breathe air you're not used to, tread floors you don't fall through  
Make waves  
You crash a symbol hard  
Follow no one, always play the wrong card  
Waste days, in foreign places  
Shed lights, on your better side  
Reassure me that you'll wait for me, wait for me as long as it takes!  
  
And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath  
  
Until you see me in your dreams  
We'll stay awake beneath the trees  
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust  
A sky of diamonds just for us  
You are the risk I'll always take  
The only branch I'll never break  
Those fears we'll blow them all way  
  
Fight fires in your best clothes, touch skin with your eyes closed  
Chase thunder  
With the volume down  
Pack a suitcase, wonder to the next town  
Force quit, on your losing streak  
Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek  
Tell me that we're still too young, that we're still too young and I'll my
tongue  
  
Until you see me in your dreams  
We'll stay awake beneath the trees  
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust  
A sky of diamonds just for us  
You are the risk I'll always take  
The only branch I'll never break  
Those fears we'll blow them all way  
  
I'm here, I'm here to save you  
No fall, I will swim to save you  
  
Until you see me in your dreams  
We'll stay awake beneath the trees  
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust A sky of diamonds just for us  
You are the risk I'll always take  
The only branch I'll never break  
Those fears we'll blow them all way
