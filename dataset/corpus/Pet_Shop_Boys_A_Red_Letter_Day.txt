Go to work and take your calls  
Hang the fruits of your labour on the walls  
Such precision and care  
What does it matter  
If there's no one here to share  
The flowers in the garden the wine  
The Waiting for the Godot  
And so much modern time?  
All I want is what you want  
I'm always waiting for a red letter day  
The years perfecting a stance of  
Measured cool fade into insignificance  
The moment one starts to understand  
What on earth does it profit a man?  
All I want is what you want  
I'm always waiting for a red letter day  
For something special somehow new  
Someone saying ?I love you'  
Baby I'm waiting for the red letter day  
You can sneer or disappear behind a veneer  
Of self-control  
But for all of those who don't fit  
In who follow their instincts  
And are told they sin  
This is a prayer for a different way  
All I want is what you want  
I'm always waiting for a red letter day  
Like Christmas morning  
When you're a kid  
Admit you love me and you always did  
Baby I'm hoping for that red letter day today
