This indecision got me climbing up the wall  
Been cheating gravity and waiting on the fall  
How did this come over me, I thought I was above it all  
Our hopes gone up in smoke, swallow your crown  
  
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you  
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you  
  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now  
Give me some rope I'm coming, out of my head, into the clear when you, go,  
I, go, no  
  
These premonitions got me crying up a storm  
Leave your condition, this position does no harm  
  
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you  
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you  
  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now  
Give me some rope I'm coming, out of my head, into the clear when you, go,  
I, go, noose  
  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now  
Give me some rope I'm coming through, I'm coming out, yeah  
Give me some rope, I'm coming out of my head, into the clear when you go,  
I go, go
