Where did ya go when the snow lay on the ground  
What did ya do when the rain began to fall  
How did it feel when I looked through your soul  
When was the last time you wanted my love  
How many nights did you cry your dreams to sleep  
Why did you hide what you knew would not stay hidden  
How could you put yourself through like you did  
I'm not the kind that would hold you that way  
Drop me a line if ya wake up feelin' bad  
I'm still a friend and I'd like to hear from you  
Where does it say love should last forever  
When was the last time I told that to you  
Farewell to annabel, farewell  
Farewell to annabel, farewell  
Farewell to annabel, fare thee well  
Farewell to annabel, farewell
