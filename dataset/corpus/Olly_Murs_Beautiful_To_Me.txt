She  
Ties her hair up, tight  
Puts her armor on  
When she steps outside  
She  
Is in black and white  
And the color's gone  
But it's in her eyes  
Time and time again we're going back to the start  
And I'm trying, try again to bring some light to the dark  
You know every day's a battle and it tears her apart  
And I don't know why  
And I'm picking up the pieces when we fall to the feet  
We confide in other demons, though she'll never be free  
We could hide it in the shadows, though it's hard to believe  
And I don't know why  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love, don't ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
Ohh  
  
She,  
She never gets it right  
And it feels like rain on a perfect night  
And I  
I'd be a hand to hold  
You can push me hard, but I won't let go  
Time and time again we're going back to the start  
And I'm trying, try again to bring some light to the dark  
You know every day's a battle and it tears her apart  
But, don't you cry,  
  
[Chorus:]  
My love don't ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
  
Love, I'll be your ordinary goal,  
You're so amazing, don't you know?  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
Ohh  
  
The light breaks through your hair and  
They're all stopping and staring  
I'd go anywhere  
Oh, why can't you just see that?  
I'm crazy about you  
I can't live without you  
You don't see it,  
But you're beautiful to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love, don't ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful  
Ohh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love, don't ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
Come'on  
  
Love, I'll be your ordinary goal,  
You're so amazing, don't you know?  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
You're beautiful to me
