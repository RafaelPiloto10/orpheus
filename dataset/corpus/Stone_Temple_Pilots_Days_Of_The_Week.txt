Monday, back from the dead  
I'm letting it go, back for another one  
  
Tuesday, shoot me in the head  
I'm takin' it back , takin' it back  
I'll take it back  
  
Wednesday, she's lookin' for a friend  
She'll get what she wants  
Can't seem to get enough  
  
Thursday, it's more than I can stand  
I'm holdin' her down, holdin' her down  
She's down again  
  
I gotta find a way to find her  
Where could she be?  
Four days of the week  
She thinks I'm the enemy  
  
One day, left me for dead  
Woke up on the floor, time for another one  
Two days, she's leavin' me again  
Can't take it no more  
Out through the open door  
Three days, she's found herself a friend  
She got what she wants  
Still never get enough  
Four days she's back with me again  
She's pullin' me down, pullin' me down  
I'm down again  
  
Monday's gone  
Tuesday's fadin'  
Wednesday's gone  
Thursday's all but wasted now
