People in their pride believe it's easier for them to leave  
Their problems in the arms of others, running to their mothers  
Lasting love is such a funny thing  
When you're in love you're on the wings  
You're not in love, it's good for you  
'cause you can do the things you want to do  
  
It's you big chance, to take it baby  
It's you big chance, you'll make it baby  
  
When you're high and mighty you'll remember how I loved you  
You'll be thinkin' how you hurt me when I needed you beside me  
In the night is such a lonely time  
I dream of you and that's a sign  
It means that I am still a fool  
And I am still so much in love with you  
  
It's your big chance, so take it baby  
It's your big chance, don't fake it baby  
  
Big chance  
Hot chance
