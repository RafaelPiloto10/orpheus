[Verse 1]  
I'm George IV, the regent king  
Which means I was just standing in  
Acting king because my dad  
George III had gone barking mad!  
(Banana)  
Great palaces, I did design  
Buckingham was one of mine  
Art and fashion, I so rated  
And wives? That's more complicated!  
  
[Chorus]  
Actresses and duchesses  
The great loves of my life  
I loved more girls than I ate pies  
But I couldn't stand my wife  
(He couldn't stand his wife!  
Go away!)  
  
[Verse 2]  
I only married Queen Caroline  
When my debts began to climb  
'Cause if I agreed to tie the knot  
I said I'd pay off the lot!  
  
[Verse 3]  
But the wedding caused all sorts of strife  
'Cause I already had a wife  
A divorced Catholic? Dad did sigh  
But the mad old goat just wouldn't die!  
(Still here! Oh, spoke too soon!  
At last, I can go solo!)  
  
[Verse 4]  
As true king, my reign began  
Though I was now older than your nan  
And as the ruler of our nation  
I banned my wife from my coronation  
  
[Verse 5]  
And knowing now that I did hate her  
She promptly died just three weeks later  
But all those pies that I got through  
Meant ten years later, I died too!  
(Hello, have we met? I'm a kangaroo!)  
  
[Chorus]  
Actresses, duchesses  
The great loves of my life  
I loved more girls than I ate pies  
But I couldn't stand my wife  
I had just ten years on the throne  
Do you remember that?  
No, all that you remember is...  
I was really fat!
