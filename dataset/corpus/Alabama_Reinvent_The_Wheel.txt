Seems like everywhere I look  
There's another version of the same old book  
And someone telling me it's new  
Every song on my radio sounds like one I heard a long time ago  
Different windows, same old view  
Yeah  
Uh-huh  
  
All the clothes in the magazines I could swear I've already seen  
In my closet years ago  
Hairstyles and super-malls, you've seen one well you've seen them all  
Tell me something I don't know  
  
But in a world that's mostly imitation  
It's hard to recognize the real  
It takes a brave heart to resist temptation  
To take the easy way and reinvent the wheel  
(Yeah)  
  
A friend of mine finds Mr. Right every other Friday night  
At a smoky singles bar  
And she can't seem to understand why life don't go like she plans  
She goes on wishing on a star  
Yeah  
  
But in a world that's mostly imitation  
It's hard to recognize the real  
It takes a brave heart to resist temptation  
To take the easy way and reinvent the wheel  
(Yeah)  
  
But in a world that's mostly imitation  
It's hard to recognize the real  
It takes a brave heart to resist temptation  
To take the easy way and reinvent the wheel  
(Yeah)  
  
Reinvent the wheel  
Reinvent the wheel
