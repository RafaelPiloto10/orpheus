Bill Barret has a simple dream  
He calls it his plan b  
Buildings in the sky and the air is sugar free  
And everyone is very friendly  
Plan b arrived on a holiday  
Took a cab to the shopping malls  
Bought and ate until he could do neither anymore  
Then found love on channel 44  
  
[Chorus]  
La la la la la he wants to go to magic america  
La la la la la he'd like to live in magic america  
With all the magic people  
  
Bill barrett sent his postcards home  
To everyone he'd ever known they read  
Fifty nine cents gets you a good square meal  
From the people who care how you feel  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
With all the magic people
