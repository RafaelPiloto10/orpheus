If we could sit together a moment  
And talk forever just to pass the time  
I would smile as the shivers and chills  
Run down my spine  
And your eyes are locked on mine  
Oh, we'll fill the metro skies with country air  
And when you close your tired eyes  
I'll meet you there  
  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
  
Deep inside of you  
There's a ruby glow  
And it gets brighter  
Than you and I will ever know  
There's a rushing sound  
That surrounds us  
When we walk alone  
And it's everything we've never known  
  
(Wonder down the street and I will be the pavement beneath your feet)  
  
If we could just be immobile for some time  
And finally figure out the way we feel  
About the missing puzzle pieces and cloudy question marks  
That still look a bit surreal  
Oh, I tend to disappear  
Here and there  
So concentrate and you'll feel me  
Everywhere  
And we'll fill the metro skies with country air  
If you're lost when you close your eyes  
I'll meet you there  
  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
You could be anywhere  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
You could be anywhere  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
Open your eyes and see  
You could be anywhere  
Everything you can be  
I'll meet you there  
Open your eyes and see  
You could be anywhere  
Everything you can be  
I'll meet you there
