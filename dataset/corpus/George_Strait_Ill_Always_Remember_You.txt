It all started back in 1981.  
Our life together had just begun.  
I didn't know what my future would hold,  
But you gave me a chance,  
So I set out on the road.  
  
It wasn't easy going then.  
There were times I almost threw that old towel in,  
But you kept callin' me back to the stage,  
And I finally found my place in each and every face.  
  
I'm not sayin' I'm through by any means.  
There's still things that I want to say and do.  
I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams.  
And just know that I'll always remember you.  
  
When I first set out on the road, I figured  
I had maybe five good years to sing my songs for you folks.  
Well, it's goin' on thirty now  
And I still love it just as much as I ever did.  
When I hear that announcer say my name,  
And I walk through those curtains  
And see your smilin' faces,  
My feet don't touch the ground again  
Til I walk out and get back on that bus that got me here.  
I don't know how many more years I've got left to do this,  
But I figure a few.  
I do want you to know, though,  
That when I do walk off this stage for the last time,  
And I'm all settled in, away from all this,  
You won't be far away.  
I'll still hear your screams and cheers in my mind.  
And I'll always remember you.  
  
I'm not sayin' I'm through by any means.  
'Cause there's still things that I want to say and do.  
I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams.  
And just know that I'll always remember you.  
  
You've pulled me through some hard times.  
Hope I've pulled you through a few.  
And just know that I'll always remember you.
