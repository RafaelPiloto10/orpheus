Oh when the night creeps  
Up over the hillside  
Oh it's so quiet up here  
You can hear your thoughts from the inside  
Oh well it took me a while  
To take in the atmosphere  
Dark clouds of evil all around  
  
You're only dreaming  
You're only dreaming  
You're only dreaming  
You're only dreaming  
  
There is no hooded killer  
No dracula  
No frankenstein  
Oh well it's all psychological  
Oh it's all in your mind  
  
Oh when a boy  
We'd visit a haunted house  
And there were demons inside  
Of that there isn't a doubt  
And I would hide behind my hand every night  
With fear right there on my brow  
  
Oh I see danger in living  
I'm on a runaway train without wheels  
Now I'm crawling through a tunnel  
With bloodhounds at my heels  
Everywhere I turn there are screams all around  
Behind trees wolves howl
