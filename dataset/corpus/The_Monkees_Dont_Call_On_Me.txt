Don't call on me  
When you're feelin' footloose  
And fancy free,  
You've done that before,  
And like a fool I  
Came back for more  
  
It's all over now  
I've finally seen my way  
I need you no more  
Not now or any other day.  
  
Okay little girl,  
Live for yourself in your own little world.  
I know that you'll find  
Someone who'll play at love  
Be just your kind  
Be just your kind
