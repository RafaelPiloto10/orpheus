Monogram: Perry the platypus  
Is a lovely shade of teal  
From his duck-billed nose  
To his web-bed toes  
And his nerves were made of steel.  
  
Carl: What does this have to do with Christmas?  
  
Monogram: Well, I'm just describing him so that people have a mental  
Picture. It matches the original song.  
  
The night before Christmas  
Was a crisis at the Pole  
Cause old Doofenshmirtz  
He had done his worst  
And a sleigh that day, he stole  
  
Doof too it on a joyride  
Just as far as he was able  
But Doof, that goof, lost control  
Ran into the reindeer stable  
  
Now all the reindeer  
Were on crutches or in traction  
So old Agent P  
He knew that he must spring right into action  
  
Look at that platypus  
Look at that platypus  
Look at that platypus go  
Look at that platypus  
Look at that platypus  
Flying o'er the snow  
  
Carl: O'er sir?  
Monogram: It's a contraction. It means over.  
Carl: It's a bit archaic.  
Monogram: It's traditional Carl, get o'er it.  
  
So the reindeer were out of commission  
And Santa's sleigh was trashed  
I'd explain it more  
But we've been there before  
It doesn't need to be rehashed  
  
Santa Claus was freaking out  
Thought he'd have to scrap his run  
He was torn inside  
For without a ride  
He knew Christmas Day was done  
  
But then o'er the horizon  
Came a light bright as a star  
Cutting through the night  
Was the two headlights  
Of Perry's hovercar  
  
Perry the platypus  
Had a mission at the Pole  
If he could lend a hand in the frozen land  
He'd help Santa reach his goal  
  
There must have been some magic in that platypus-themed hovercar  
For when Santa saw the gas gauge  
He knew it could take him far  
  
Carl: Really sir?  
Monogram: They want this album yesterday, alright?  
  
Perry the platypus  
Took Santa on his way  
And he came through  
Like we knew he'd do  
And saved our Christmas Day
