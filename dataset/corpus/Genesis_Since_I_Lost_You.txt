It seems in a moment, your whole world can shatter  
Like morning dreams they just disappear  
Like dust in your hand falling to the floor  
How can life ever be the same  
  
'Cause my heart is broken in pieces  
Yes my heart is broken in pieces  
Since you've been gone  
  
It's all too easy to take so much for granted  
But it's so hard to find the words to say  
Like a castle in the sand the water takes away  
How can life ever be the same  
  
'Cause my heart is broken in pieces  
Yes my heart is broken in pieces  
Since I've lost you  
  
Ooh now you'll never see  
Ooh now you'll never know  
All the things I planned for you  
Things for you and me  
  
I held your hand so tightly  
That I couldn't let it go  
Now how can life ever be the same  
  
'Cause my heart is broken in pieces  
Yes my heart is broken in pieces  
Since you've been gone
