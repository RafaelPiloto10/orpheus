Loneliness is the worst thing in the world  
To be alone all the day long  
No ring on the phone, yeah this is wrong  
Low down loneliness  
  
This loneliness, I must confess  
Yes it's a mess of this loneliness  
Low down loneliness, loneliness all around  
Loneliness, you have found me loneliness  
  
Oh loneliness, all of the time  
Such loneliness, you're so unkind  
Low down loneliness  
Loneliness everywhere  
Loneliness, I've got more that my share  
  
Oh loneliness, my destiny  
Yeah loneliness, was I born to be  
In low down Loneliness? Loneliness
