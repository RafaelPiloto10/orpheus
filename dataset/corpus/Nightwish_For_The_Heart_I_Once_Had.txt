Heaven today has gone away  
To a place I once called home  
Heart of a child, one final sigh  
As another love goes cold  
Once my heart beat to the  
Rhythm of the falling snow  
Blackened below, the river now flows  
A stream of mountain virgin snow  
  
[Chorus]  
For the heart I'll never have  
For the child forever gone  
The music flows because it longs  
For the heart I once had  
  
Living today, without a place  
To understand the weight of the world  
Faded and torn, old and forlorn  
My weak and hoping heart  
For the child, for the night  
For the heart I once had  
I believe and foresee  
Everything I could ever be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Time will not heal  
A dead boy's scars  
Time will kill  
  
[Chorus]
