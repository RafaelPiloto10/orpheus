Yeah  
In the beginning there was darkness and there was light  
At the dawn of creation there was fear in the dead of night  
There was thunder, there was flame  
The whole wide world is driving me insane  
  
Don't want to run, don't want to hide  
I keep the fire burning deep inside  
I howl at the moon, I pray to the sun  
I've got a one-way ticket to kingdom come  
  
I'm going back to the stone age  
I'm going back where I belong  
I'm going back to the stone age  
Back where I come from  
  
Telling the world I'm going back where I belong  
To a place where the sky is clear, the wind is strong  
Climb the mountains, cross the seas  
Clear in my soul I want to be free  
Sit on the throne, let 'em kiss the ring  
'Cause I'm a stone age man (yeah)  
  
(I'm the king) back to the stone age  
Back where I belong  
I'm going back to the stone age  
Back where I belong  
  
I like it  
  
Yeah  
  
Back to the stone age (I'm going back)  
Back to the stone age (I'm going back)  
Back to the stone age (yeah)  
Bye-bye, so long
