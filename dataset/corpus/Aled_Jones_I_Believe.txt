One day I'll hear the laugh of children  
In a world where war has been banned  
One day I'll see, men of all colours  
Sharing words of love and devotion  
  
Stand up and feel, the holy spirit  
Find the power of your faith  
Open your heart to those who need you  
In the name of love and devotion  
  
'Cause I believe in the people  
Of all nations  
To join and to care for love  
I believe in a world  
Where light will guide us  
And giving our love  
We'll make heaven on earth  
  
The things we never said come together  
The hidden truth no longer haunting me  
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken  
That kind of understanding sets me free
