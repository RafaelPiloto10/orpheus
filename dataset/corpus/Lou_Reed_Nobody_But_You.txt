I really care a lot  
although I look like I do not  
Since I was shot  
there's nobody but you  
  
I know I look blase  
Party Andy's what the papers say  
At dinner I'm the one who pays  
for a nobody like you  
  
Nobody but you  
a nobody like you  
Since I got shot  
there's nobody but you  
  
Won't you decorate my house  
I'll sit there quiet as a mouse  
You know me I like to look a lot  
at nobody but you  
  
I'll hold your hand and slap my face  
I'll tickle you to your disgrace  
Won't you put me in my proper place  
a nobody like you  
  
Sundays I pray a lot  
I'd like to wind you up and paint your clock  
I want to be what I am not  
for a nobody like you  
  
The bullet split my spleen and lung  
the doctors said I was gone  
Inside I've got some shattered bone  
for nobody but you  
  
Nobody but you  
a nobody like you  
Shattered bone  
for nobody but you  
  
I'm still not sure I didn't die  
and if I'm dreaming I still have bad pains inside  
I know I'll never be a bride  
to nobody like you  
  
I wish I had a stronger chin  
my skin was good, my nose was thin  
This is no movie I'd ask to be in  
with a nobody like you  
  
Nobody like you  
a nobody like you  
All my life  
  
It's been nobodies like you
