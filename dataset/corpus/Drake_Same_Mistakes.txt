[Verse:]  
Can I, can I save you from you?  
Cause you know there's something missing  
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all
the time  
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah  
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen  
To the things that I must say to make you mine  
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine  
Trying to convince myself I've found one  
Making a mistake I never learned from  
  
[Hook:]  
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type  
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I believe in people like you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl  
I bet there's a reason for it all  
You say that you're nothing like the last girl  
I just pray that you don't let me down right now  
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours  
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break  
And end up like before  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober  
Telling me how you moving away and starting over  
Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit  
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit  
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it  
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it  
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson  
It's feeling like the second chance and it's the first impression  
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new  
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you  
Talking to myself but I never listen  
Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different  
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go  
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about  
How reckless I have been  
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in  
Making all the same mistakes  
And I swear I'm just trying to correct it  
And I fall...  
  
[Hook:]
