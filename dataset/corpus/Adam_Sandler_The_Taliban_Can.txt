Hey, alright, gather round,  
The Taliban is here!  
What bombs do you want?  
I got big bombs, little bombs,  
Cos I'm the Taliban,  
  
Who can take Osama,  
And hide him all around?  
Run away an' hide,  
When the bombs are fallin' down,  
The Taliban, (the Taliban)  
Yes the Taliban can, (the Taliban can)  
The Taliban can cos they mix a lotta nuts and screw the world real good,  
(screw the world real good)  
  
They tipple their own country,  
And keep their people down,  
And muster up a place to hide their damn Bid Laden crown,  
The Taliban, (the Taliban)  
Yes the Taliban can, (the Taliban can)  
The Taliban can cos they mix a lotta nuts and screw the world real good,  
The Taliban takes,  
The opium they make  
And turn it into their own riches,  
Oh, but they don't ever get their wishes,  
We're gonna bomb those sons of bitches!  
Just wait until tomorrow, (until tomorrow)  
We're gonna make 'em scream, (gonna make 'em scream)  
Drop all their bombs and destroy all of their dreams,  
You know that we can, (you know that we can)  
Yes, you know that we can, (yes, you know that we can)  
You know that we can destroy the Taliban and make the world real good,  
(make the world real good)  
You know that we can destroy the Taliban and make the world real good,  
(make the world real good)  
You know that we can destroy the Taliban and make the world real good,  
(make the world real good)
