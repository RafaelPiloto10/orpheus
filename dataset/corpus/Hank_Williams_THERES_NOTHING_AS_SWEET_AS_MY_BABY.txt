I like candy, I like cake, I like jam but goodness sake  
There's nothin' as sweet as my baby  
  
Golden hair and big blue eyes she could win a beauty prize  
There's nothin' as sweet as my baby  
  
If I ever lose her I'll lay me down and die  
If sugar seems sweet then you ought to meet  
My honey coated sweetie pie  
  
I like candy, I like cake, I like jam but goodness sake  
There's nothin' as sweet as my baby  
  
I like candy, I like cake, I like jam but goodness sake  
There's nothin' as sweet as my baby  
  
I feel like a honey bee, when she's buzzing round with me  
There's nothin' as sweet as my baby  
  
Got pounds of candy kisses, but I can't spare an ounce  
She's sweeter than wine and brother she's mine  
And that's the only thing that counts  
  
I like candy, I like cake, I like jam but goodness sakes  
There's nothin' as sweet as my baby
