Hello everybody!  
Get a ride to the west side  
Kiss the girl with her tongue tied  
  
Hello everybody!  
Work it out 'cause you don't care  
Shut down like software  
  
Hello everybody!  
Take a sip for the hip-hop  
Fuel up at the rest stop  
  
We're just physical creatures of the underworld  
She is the queen of the fra-disco scene  
  
Retro dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance)  
Singing retro dance beats  
Retro dance, freak!  
Undercover the girl needs a lover  
  
What's up everybody?  
Take a ride on an airplane  
Take a bath in champagne  
  
What's up everybody?  
Watch the girls all curtsy for the paparazzi!  
  
Let's go everybody!  
It's time that we rotate, 'cause it's getting real late  
  
We're just physical creatures of the underworld  
She is the queen of the fra-disco scene  
  
Retro dance, freak! (retro, retro, dance)  
Singing retro dance beats  
Retro dance, freak!  
Undercover the girl needs a lover
