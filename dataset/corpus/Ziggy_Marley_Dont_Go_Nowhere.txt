Don't go nowhere  
Oh can't you see  
That I still care  
And my love it is strong  
  
With all of my heart I do  
With all of my breath I say  
Wanting to see you  
Each and everyday  
  
Some good things are gone  
Some are on their way  
And I'm telling you  
I'm begging you  
Please stay  
  
Don't go nowhere  
Oh can't you see  
That I still care  
My love yes it strong  
  
Speak no word  
Utter no sound  
I wanna tell you  
I got to tell you  
How I'm feeling right now  
  
My love is all  
My heart is still fond  
I mean my hopes and my dreams  
Can come true wsith only one  
DOn't go nowhere  
  
Oh can't you see  
That I still care  
My love yes I strong  
All emotions you will feel  
  
I will fill your empty needs  
I'm not promising you heaven  
But as close as we could be  
  
You're more than a blessing  
You're a miracle to me  
And I can't do without you  
No way  
You see you're my everything  
So I'm giving in  
Don't go nowhere  
  
Oh can't you see  
That I still care  
My love it is strong  
Don't go nowhere  
  
I need you  
Don't go nowhere  
I love you  
Don't go nowhere  
My heart yearns  
Don't go nowhere  
Can you understand me baby  
My love is all  
Don't go nowhere  
My heart is still fond  
Don't go nowhere
