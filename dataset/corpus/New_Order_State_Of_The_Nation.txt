You can walk, or you can run  
You don't have to be someone  
I went on a summer cruise  
Upon an ocean born to lose  
My brother said that he was dead  
I saw his face and shook my head  
Can you see where we can't be  
We're losing our blood in the sea  
'Cause it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Yes, it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Oh, the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation  
Oh, the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation  
  
From my home I traveled far  
I drove in my stolen car  
When it broke down, I kissed the ground  
'Cause I don't kiss when you're around  
I don't find that I have been  
The portrait of an only son  
If that's the case, then who could tell  
Where my story had begun?  
Cause it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Yes, it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Yes, the state of the nation  
That's causing deprivation  
Oh, the state of the nation  
That's causing deprivation  
  
Even now, I'm all alone  
Behind a wall that's made of stone  
I think about where we have been  
And all the sights that could be seen  
I know it all could be worthwhile  
If only I could force a smile  
Now we turn our backs to the sea  
The shame of a nation we'll never be  
Cause it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Yes, it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Oh, the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation  
Yes, the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation
