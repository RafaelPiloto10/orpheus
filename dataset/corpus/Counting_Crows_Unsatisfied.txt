Look me in the eye  
Then, tell me that I'm satisfied  
Was you satisfied?  
Look me in the eye  
Then, tell me that I'm satisfied  
Hey, are you satisfied?  
And it goes so slowly on  
Everything I've ever wanted  
Tell me what's wrong  
Look me in the eye  
And tell me that I'm satisfied  
Were you satisfied?  
Look me in the eye  
Then, tell me I'm satisfied  
And now are you satisfied?  
Everything goes  
Well, anything goes all of the time  
Everything you dream of  
Is right in front of you  
And every dream is a lie  
Look me in the eye  
And tell me that I'm satisfed  
Look me in the eye  
Unsatisfied  
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied  
I'm so dissatisfied  
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied  
I'm so unsatisfied  
Well, I'm-a  
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied  
I'm so dissatis, dissattis...  
I'm so
