Why do I tell myself these things that happen  
Are all really true  
When in my heart I know  
The magic is my love for you  
  
You sign the song begins  
You speak and I hear violins, it's magic  
The stars, desert the skies  
And rush to nestle in your eyes, it's magic  
  
Without a golden wand or mystic charms  
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms  
  
When we walk hand in hand  
The world becomes a wonderland, it's magic  
How else can I explain those rainbows  
When there ain't no rain, it's magic  
  
Why do I tell me myself  
These things that happen are all really true  
When in my heart  
I know the magic is my love for you  
  
Magic, magic, magic, magic
