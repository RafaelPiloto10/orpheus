I spent the morning at an old friend's grave  
Flowers and Amazing Grace, he was a good man  
He spent his whole life spinnin' his wheels  
Never knowin' how the real thing feels  
He never took a chance or took the time to dance  
And I stood there thinking as I said goodbye  
Today is the first day of the rest of my life  
  
I'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on  
And learn how to face my fears  
Love with all of my heart, make my mark  
I want to leave something here  
  
[Chorus]  
Go out on a ledge, with out any net  
That's what I'm gonna be about  
Yeah I want to be runnin'  
When the sand runs out  
  
'Cause people do it everyday  
Promise themselves they're gonna change  
I've been there, but I'm changin' from the inside out  
  
That was then and this is now  
I'm a new man, yeah, I'm a brand new man  
And when they carve my stone they'll write these words  
"Here lies a man who lived life for all that its worth"  
  
I'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on  
Learn how to face my fears  
Love with all of my heart, make my mark  
I want to leave something here  
  
Go out on a ledge, with out any net  
That's what I'm gonna be about  
Yeah I want to be runnin'  
When the sand runs out  
  
And as the cold wind blows  
Across the graveyard  
I think I hear the voice  
Of my old friend  
Whisper in my ear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to be runnin' when  
The sand runs out  
Ooo, yes I do
