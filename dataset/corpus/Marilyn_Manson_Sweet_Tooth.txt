Her heart shivers in my hand  
She's melting on me like cotton candy  
I make the faces that make you cry  
I want you more when afraid of my  
Disease, disease is draining me  
Anymore your not so "pretty please"  
Disease, disease is draining me  
I want you more when your afraid of me  
I will break you inside out, you are mine, you are mine  
I will break you inside out, you are mine, you are mine  
Her hair hangs in swollen strings,  
I'm choking on her it feels so  
Sickening  
I make the faces that make you cry,  
I want more when your afraid of my  
Disease, disease is draining me,  
I want you more when your afraid of  
Me
