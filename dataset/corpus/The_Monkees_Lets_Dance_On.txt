Let's dance on,  
Oh, baby, come on.  
Let's dance on 'til the dawn,  
Have fun 'til the music's all gone.  
  
We've been dancin',  
Nearly all night long.  
Let's keep it up baby,  
Cause the music's still strong.  
We're doin' the Pony  
Now you're doing the Jerk.  
A come on, baby,  
Let me see how you work.  
  
Let's dance on,  
Oh, baby, come on.  
Let's dance on 'til the dawn,  
Have fun 'til the music's all gone.  
  
The way you're movin'  
Girl, you look so fine.  
You been doin' the Shotgun,  
Let me see you do the Twine,  
Let's see the Watusi,  
And the Action too,  
Now hang on, baby,  
I'll do the sloopy with you.  
  
Let's dance on,  
Oh, baby, come on.  
Let's dance on 'til the dawn,  
Have fun 'til the music's all gone.
