I used to trust nobody, trusting even less their words,  
Until I found somebody, there was no one I preferred,  
My heart was made of stone, my eyes saw only misty grey,  
Until you came into my life girl, I saw everyone that way.  
Until I found the one I needed at my side,  
I think I would have been a sad man all my life.  
  
I think I see the light coming to me,  
Coming through me giving me a second sight.  
So shine, shine, shine,  
Shine, shine, shine,  
Shine, shine, shine.  
  
I used to walk alone, every step seemed the same.  
This world was not my home, so there was nothing much to gain.  
Look up and see the clouds, look down and see the cold floor.  
Until you came into my life girl, I saw nothing, nothing more.  
Until I found the one I needed at my side,  
I think I would have been a sad man all my life.  
  
I think I see the light coming to me,  
Coming through me giving me a second sight.  
So shine, shine, shine,  
Shine, shine, shine,  
Shine, shine, shine.
