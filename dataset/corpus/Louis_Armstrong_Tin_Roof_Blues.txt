Yes, a New Orleans woman  
She's alright with me  
I said New Orleans woman  
She's alright with me  
That's my hometown I'm talking about  
'Cause when she cooks  
That good old Gumbo fillet  
I'm happy as can be  
I love my baby  
I'm gonna tell you the reason why  
Let you know the secret out  
Yes I love my baby  
Well, I'm gonna tell you the reason why  
Never told you this before  
'Cause there ain't a chance for a cutout  
You've got to stay with me till the day I die
