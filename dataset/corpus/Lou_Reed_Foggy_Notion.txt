He's over by the corner  
Got her hand by her side  
They hit her harder, harder, harder  
Till they thought she might die  
  
Well, I've got a foggy notion, do it again  
Oh, over by the corner, do it again  
I've got my calamine lotion, baby, do it again  
Well, I've got a foggy notion, do it again  
  
I'll do something that I never did before  
I'll first track down to a flower store  
I bought her a boundle, a beautiful badge  
Don't you know something, she sent it right back, alright  
  
Sally Mae, Sally Mae  
Sally Mae, Sally Mae, ooohhh  
Sally Mae, Sally Mae  
Sally Mae, Sally Mae, alright

I bought her a boundle, a beautiful badge  
Now, baby, don't you know something, she sent it right back, ooohhh  
  
Oh, Sally Mae, Sally Mae
