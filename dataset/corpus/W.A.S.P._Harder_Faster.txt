I don't care if you track me down  
Like an animal that's on the run  
Tie me down spread-eagle  
Leave me dyin' in the sun  
Cause I scream bloody murder  
When you writhe and when you squeeze  
You smell my blood and you come runnin'  
Taste me if you please  
  
Lick it hard, lap it up, do it now baby, touch it, touch it  
Lick your lips and flash your paws  
Shuck me suck me eat me raw  
  
Oooh, Harder faster  
Yeah, that's what I need cause  
Now that's what I'm after  
Come do that wicked deed aha  
  
I can hear those cries of love  
A wolf howls at the moon  
A heart attack, a sex maniac  
With rock salt in my wounds  
Cause I can feel my pulsing vein  
Make it last, last all night long  
I taste the bliss I wet the lips  
And I don't care if it's wrong  
  
Lick it hard, lap it up, do it now baby, touch it, touch it  
Lick your lips and flash your paws  
Shuck me suck me eat me raw  
  
Oooh, Harder faster  
Yeah, that's what I need cause  
Now that's what I'm after  
Come do that wicked deed Aha  
  
Slippin' slidin' strokin' the devil's hand of sin  
Screamin wild and smokin' the ecstacy begins  
Listen to your woman here  
She say she don't want none of this slow down crap  
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?  
  
Oooh, Harder faster  
Yeah, that's what I need cause  
Now that's what I'm after  
Come do that wicked deed aha
