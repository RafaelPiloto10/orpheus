Up against the world as you face your destiny  
Don't let today's regrets affect tomorrow's dreams  
When you shoot for the moon and you miss your mark  
Baby you'll still end up so high among the stars  
  
Anyone can give up when it's time to risk it all  
Knowing where you stand and you'll never fall  
  
If you can see how you imagine your life  
You want to dream now then you know that anything is possible  
It's not who you are, it's where you wanna go  
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible  
  
Take it brick by brick, throw away the stone  
Take a chance on something, build a castle you call home  
Live for the moment, you can't put into words  
Don't keep a song inside, let your voice be heard  
  
Find a true desire, don't be afraid to cry  
Better to reach for something, than to never have tried  
  
It's time to see how you imagine your life  
You want to dream, you know that anything is possible  
It's not who you are, it's where you wanna go  
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible  
  
It's not who you are, it's where you wanna go  
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible  
  
It's time to see how you imagine your life  
You want to dream, anything is possible  
It's not who you are, it's where you wanna go  
You don't need a miracle, anything is possible  
  
It's the choice you make, it's the time you take  
It's the risk you take, you know that anything is possible  
It's a choice you make, it's the time you take  
It's a risk you take, believe that anything is possible
