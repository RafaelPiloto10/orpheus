I say a prayer every night  
Whatever I do, I'll get it right  
With no regret, no guilt or shame this time (no not this time)  
Once I surrender, I won't dare look back  
'Cause if I do, I'll get off track  
Move ahead in faith  
And patiently await your answer  
What will it be  
  
Sight beyond what I see  
You know what's best for me  
Prepare my mind, prepare my heart  
For whatever comes, I'm gone' be ready  
Strength to pass any test  
I feel like I'm so blessed  
With you in control, I can't go wrong  
'Cause I always know  
I'm gonna be ready  
  
I was free to do what I wanted to  
Lost everything, but I still had you  
You showed me your grace  
Now my life's renewed and I thank you (yes... I thank you)  
So I'll tell anyone who'll listen, I'll testify  
About how good you were to me when so call friends passed me by  
The fact that you would show somebody so broke down  
So much mercy...  
  
Sight beyond what I see  
You know what's best for me  
Prepare my mind, prepare my heart  
For whatever comes, I'm gonna be ready  
Strength to pass any test  
I feel like I'm so blessed  
With you in control, I can't go wrong  
'Cause I always know  
I'm gonna be ready  
  
So use me as you will  
I'll pay the price  
'Cause made the ultimate sacrifice  
It's all because of you that I even have life  
And I'll give my love as a tribute to how great you are...  
  
Sight beyond what I see  
You know what's best for me  
Prepare my mind, prepare my heart  
For whatever comes, I'm gonna be ready  
Strength to pass any test  
I feel like I'm so blessed  
With you in control, I can't go wrong  
'Cause I always know  
I'm gonna be ready  
  
I'm gonna be ready  
I'm gonna be ready  
I'm gonna be ready  
I'm gonna be ready  
I'm gone... be ready
