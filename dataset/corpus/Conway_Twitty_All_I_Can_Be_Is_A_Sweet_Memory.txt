All I can be is a sweet memory  
That drifts through your mind from time to time  
I could never be more than a knock on your door.  
Just a shadow that's gone with the sunshine.  
  
For you know I'm not free and I never can be  
And you're bound to get restless in time.  
All I can be is a sweet memory  
That drifts through your mind.  
  
Tonight I'll she'd a silent tear while lying here with you.  
The sands of time have trickled down to just a precious few.  
You're young and so beautiful and I'm so glad I'm here  
But the ending painfully clear.  
  
All I can be is a sweet memory  
Of someone you had to leave behind.  
Who loves you and needs you but never could give you  
A ring for your finger so fine.  
  
So tonight let's just borrow one memory for tomorrow  
'Til we find we've run out of time.  
All I can be is a sweet memory  
That drifts through your mind.  
  
All I can be is a sweet memory  
That drifts through your mind.
