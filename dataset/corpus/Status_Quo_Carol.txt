Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away  
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day  
  
Well come in to my machine so we can cruise on out  
I know a swinging little little joint where we can jump and shout  
It's not too far back off the highway, not so long a ride  
You park your car out in the open, you can walk inside  
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her, ma'am  
Cause every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed  
  
Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away  
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day  
  
Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away  
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day  
  
Well, you want to hear some music like the boys are playing  
Hold tight, catch your foot, don't let him carry it away  
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud  
Oh, don't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd  
If you can dance, I know you wish you could  
I got my eyes on you baby ''cause you dance so good  
  
Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away  
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day  
Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away  
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
