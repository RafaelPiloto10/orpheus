I was in your presence for an hour or so  
Or was it a day?  
I truly don't know  
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low  
By that soft and shining sea  
Did you respect me for what I did  
Or what I didn't do, or keeping it hid?  
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid  
Of everything you see?  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
I got the heart and you got the blood  
We cut through iron and we cut through mud  
Then came the warning that was before the flood  
That set everybody free  
Fools they made a mock of sin  
Our loyalty they tried to win  
But you were closer to me than my next of kin  
When they didn't want to know or see.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs  
Poverty and shame were theirs  
But all that suffering was not to be compared  
With the glory that is to be  
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave  
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved  
It'll go with me unto the grave  
And into eternity.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.
