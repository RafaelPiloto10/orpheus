Many times my mind is wrapped up in trouble and my heart gets so heavy too  
Sometimes when I sink so long I touch bottom  
I kneel down to reach out and he pulls me through  
I pray my way out of trouble and I ask my dear Lord to help me each day  
I pray my way out of trouble and the dear nail scared hand wipes my teardrops
away  
  
The smallest prayer from the world's bigger sinner brings a smile to his
sadden face  
So I just go to him any time I am in trouble  
Wash my heart in the waters of my Saviour's grace  
I pray my way...
