Out for a thrill  
Got time to kill  
Just livin' up my dreams  
for heaven's sake  
  
She's on the make  
A twisted vicar's queen  
And then one night we took a ride  
She was all over me  
  
Outrageous  
Just ain't real  
I was too wasted to see  
  
Before you get in too deep  
And you get burned by the heat  
Oh yeah  
She'll take you there  
You know it happened to me  
  
She'll make your heart break  
She'll give you fever  
She'll tell you everything but don't believe her  
A perfect stranger  
  
She knows the game  
She'll promise heaven on earth  
But don't believe her  
  
Out on the street of broken dreams  
Where no one ever wins  
Just when you thought you'd made a start  
You're back where you begin  
  
Before you get in too deep  
And you get burned by the heat  
Oh yeah  
She'll take you there  
I think you know what I mean  
  
She'll make you crazy  
She's such a teaser  
Says you're the only one but don't believe her  
She deals in danger  
  
The girl's insane  
She'll promise heaven on earth  
But don't believe her  
  
Before you get in too deep  
And you get burned by the heat  
Oh yeah  
She'll take you there  
You know it happened to me  
  
Don't believe her (Don't believe her)  
Don't believe her (Don't believe her)  
Don't believe her (Don't believe her)  
I can't believe her (Don't believe her)  
  
She'll make your heart break  
She'll give you fever  
She'll tell you everything but don't believe her  
A perfect stranger  
She knows the game  
She'll promise heaven on earth  
  
She'll make you crazy  
She's such a teaser  
Says you're the only one but don't believe her  
She deals in danger  
  
The girl's insane  
She'll promise heaven on earth  
But don't believe her  
  
Don't believe her  
Don't believe her  
Don't believe her  
Don't believe her
