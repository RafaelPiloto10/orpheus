Dim all the lights sweet darling  
'Cause tonight it's all the way  
Turn up the old Victrola  
Gonna dance the night away  
  
Love just don't come easy  
No it seldom does  
When you find the perfect love  
Let it fill you up  
  
Dim all the lights sweet darling  
'Cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby  
Turn up the old Victrola  
Gonna dance the night away  
  
Love just don't come easy  
No it seldom does  
When you find the perfect love  
Let it fill you up, hey baby  
  
Dim all the lights sweet honey  
'Cause tonight it's you and me  
No need to worry darlin'  
'Cause it's for eternity  
  
Love just don't come easy  
This you know I understand  
Want to be your woman  
If you'll be my man  
Let yourself go freely and I'll  
Show you things that you've dreamed of  
Don't think that your dreaming  
We've found the perfect love  
And I'm like a cup, come fill me up  
  
Dim all the lights sweet darling  
'Cause tonight it's all the way, whoa baby  
Turn up the old Victrola  
Gonna dance the night away  
  
Do what you want  
You can use me all up  
Take me bottom to top  
Don't leave anything undone  
  
No, no, no do it tonight  
You know the moments are right  
Turn my brown body white  
Come on dim all the lights  
  
Dim all the lights sweet darling  
'Cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby  
Turn up the old Victrola  
Gonna steal your heart away, hey baby  
  
Dim all the lights sweet darlin'  
Dim all, dim all  
And dance the night away  
Dim all the lights sweet honey  
Gonna steal your heart away
