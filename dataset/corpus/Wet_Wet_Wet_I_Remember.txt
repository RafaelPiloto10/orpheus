I should've known better, c'mon  
I should've known better, c'mon  
How l long for those warm summer nights  
Of playing the fool and getting uptight  
Crush my precious wish to the ground  
You are the sunshine taste of forgive and forget  
  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
You have touched my mind, my soul and my everything  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
Please, oh please help me  
  
Looking back at what we had  
Say I still want you so much  
Say I was loving you for just one reason  
Loving you for just one season  
You're required for desire  
  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
You have touched my mind, my soul and my everything  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
Please, oh please help me  
  
Oh I remember  
Oh I remember  
  
Say I was, say I was, loving you, loving you, loving you  
Loving you, loving you, loving you  
Please, oh please help me  
  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
Please, oh please help me  
Please, oh please help me  
Please, oh please help me  
  
And I try to act naturally
