And I will stroll the merry way and jump the hedges first  
and I will drink the clear clean water for to quench my thirst  
And I shall watch the ferry-boats and they'll get high  
on a blue ocean, against tomorrow's sky  
And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain  
and I will never grow so old again  
Oh sweet thing, sweet thing  
my, my, my, my, my sweet thing  
And I will stroll the merry ways and jump the hedges first  
and I will drink the clear clean water for to quench my thirst  
And I shall watch the ferry-boats and they'll get high  
on a blue ocean against tomorrow's sky  
And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain  
and never ever ever ever ever get so old again  
Ooh...  
sweet thing  
My my my...  
And I shall drive my chariot down your streets and cry  
"Hey, it's me! I'm dynamite and I don't know why"  
And you shall take me warm in your arms again  
and I will not remember that I ever felt the pain  
And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain  
and never ever ever ever ever get so old again  
Ooh  
sweet thing  
Yeah yeah yeah...  
sweet thing  
My my my...  
And I will raise my hand up into the night time sky  
and count the stars there shining in your eyes  
Just to dig it all an' not to wonder, that's just fine  
and I'll be satisfied not to read in between the lines  
And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain  
and never ever ever ever ever get so old again  
Sugar-baby with your champagne eyes  
and your saint-like smile....  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take this broken wing and learn to fly  
all your life you were just waiting for this moment to arrive  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
take your sunken eyes, learn to see  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to be free...
