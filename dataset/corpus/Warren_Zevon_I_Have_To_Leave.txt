This time I have to leave  
It's all to clear  
It's plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
Like a dog that whines and cries  
This time I have to leave  
  
Did you hear that I'm attached  
I'm on a dead end path  
Can't you see it hurts me so  
But I really got to go  
This time I have to leave  
  
Well, I'm gonna disappear  
Stayed too long, I'll shake my tears  
You gave your all we weren't shy  
So thanks again it's been nice  
But this time I have to leave  
It's all too clear  
It's plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
They tell me I'm outta bounds  
This time I have to leave  
  
Well, it looks as though I'll be gone for awhile  
So try not to get too riled  
There'll be another time  
When we can unwind  
But I got to get it on down the line  
  
This time I have to leave  
It's all too clear  
It's plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
You'll get by somehow  
This time I have to leave  
  
But love won't go away  
I feel I've got to stay  
And go on living a lie  
With you I know there's no goodbye  
This time I have to leave  
It's all too clear  
It's plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
After all, anyway, anyhow  
This time I have to leave
