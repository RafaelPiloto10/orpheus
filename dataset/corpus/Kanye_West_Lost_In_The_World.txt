I'm up in the woods  
I'm down on my mind  
I'm building a still  
To slow down time  
  
I'm up in the woods  
I'm down on my mind  
I'm building a still  
To slow down the time  
  
I'm up in the woods  
I'm down on my line  
I'm building a still  
Down the time ooh  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
And I'm down for the night  
Down for the night  
Said shes down for the night  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
But I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
  
Your my devil, your my angel  
Your my heaven, your my hell  
You're my now, you're my forever  
You're my freedom, your my jail  
You're my lies, your my truth  
You're my war, you're my truce  
Your my questions, your my proof  
Your my stress your masseuse  
Mama say mama say mama gos-an  
Lost in this plastic light  
Let's break out of this fake ass party  
Turn this into a classic night  
If we die in each others arms  
Still get laid in that afterlife  
If we die in each others arms  
Still get laid yea  
  
I'm up in the woods  
(Run from the lights, run from the night  
Run for your life  
I'm new in the city  
And I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night)  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
And I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Who will survive in America?  
Who will survive in America?  
Who will survive in America?  
Who will survive in America?  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
But I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
But I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
  
Hey oh wow oh  
Hey oh wow oh  
Hey oh wow oh  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Hey oh wow oh
