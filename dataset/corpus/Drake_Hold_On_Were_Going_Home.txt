I got my eyes on you,  
You're everything that I see  
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly  
I can't get over you,  
You left your mark on me  
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly  
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
You act so different around me  
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it  
I know exactly who you could be  
  
Just hold on we're going home  
Just hold on we're going home  
It's hard to do these things alone  
Just hold on we're going home, ho oh
