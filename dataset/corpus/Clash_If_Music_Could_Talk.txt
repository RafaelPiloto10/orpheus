Make sure!  
Taking cover in the bunker tonight  
Waiting for Bo Diddley's headlights  
I feel alright  
Gotta Fender Stratosphere  
I can do anything tonight  
It's in neon lights an' global rights  
Frank? He's on the phone  
There ain't no German girl outside  
But who cares when its warm inside?  
With music  
Special mystery of music tragically  
Exchanging slaves for majesties  
Modern waves of tragedy  
Packing a two piece colt pair of shoots  
A shiny grey Mexican suit  
The blue eyed traffic can sashay by  
'Cause tonight the sailor boys have hit Shanghai  
The kick-out traffic goes creaking by  
I smash my glass and shout shanghai  
My drummer friend comes shooting by  
He said Errol Flynn will never die  
Oh no! Who am I to question why?  
And are you lonesome tonight  
And do ya need a country cowboy  
Who's just thin and tight in those  
Br' bus depot jeans  
With a squirt resistant stud stud  
Hey stoner  
  
Get over there in the spliff bunker one  
Because London Bridge was sold somehow  
But it was too old anyhow  
When Uncle Sam has broken down  
We'll make him down in old Japan  
Say ye'  
  
Well there ain't no better blend  
Than Joe Ely and his Texas Men  
Where the wind blows  
I ain't seen none like that scenery  
You can see from a bus if you pay the price  
  
Wave my arms around  
Flag one of those taxi's maybe  
I saw a girl somewhere somehow  
Forever sticks in my mind somehow  
I've just got three lines  
And a pair of two's  
Like a lucky roll of dice that you  
You cast  
  
If music could talk!  
Which means  
Whatever your mind can bring  
Like the apple fell off the tree  
Pah! Fell right on his head  
Yeah many years ago  
  
There was a man who said  
I am a shaman  
A voodoo shaman  
Got in trouble so he's going out  
Mixing up and Haiti! Oh!  
And the crickets  
Buddy Holly said it was  
Br' br' yee'  
  
If music could talk you know  
  
I feel kinda lonely  
Standing out on the floor  
Of Electric Ladyland  
  
'cause this is a good question Samson  
Are you partly Arabic?  
  
Chi man! Whatcho all about  
  
I don't want to I can't hope to  
Say it all in one go  
Occasionally once or twice  
A day I feel alive enough to say  
Let's hear what the drummer man's  
Got to say about  
He said is it Errol Flynn's birthday or not?  
Sept twelfth until October  
If they pack two piece  
Colt pair of shoots  
We got the shiny grey Mexican suits  
I'm just wasting a great big  
Corporation and the entire fund  
The girders of Wall Street  
And the temples of money  
And the high priests  
Of the expense account  
And I'm wasting the whole thing  
I come down in Yamaha-ha  
They make the best pianos-time to step-up
