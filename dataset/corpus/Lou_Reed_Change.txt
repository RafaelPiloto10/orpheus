The only thing constantly changing is change  
And change is always for the worse  
The worm on the hook always eaten by a fish  
The fish by bird man or worse  
A spot on the lung, a spot on your heart  
An aneurysm of the soul  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
And it comes equipped with a curse  
  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
And it's always for the worse  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
And it's always for the worse  
  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
The living only become dead  
Your hair falling out, your liver swelled up  
Your teeth rot your gums and your chin  
Your ass starts to sag, your balls shrivel up  
Your cock swallowed up in their sack  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
And it's always change on your back  
  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
And it's always for the worse  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
And it's always for the worse, baby  
  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
Ashes to ashes to dusk  
The deer and the rabbit, the musk of your hole  
Filled up with myriad dread, ooohhh  
The dread of the living, the dread of the living  
The frightening pulse of the night, ah  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
It's changes that will kill us with fright  
  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
And it's always for the worse  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
And it's always for the worse  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
The only thing constantly changing is change  
And it comes equipped with my curse
