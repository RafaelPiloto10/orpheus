I've got the key to the highway  
Billed out and bound to go  
Gonna leave here runnin'  
Walkin's most too slow  
  
I'm goin' back to the border  
Baby, where I'm better known  
Because you haven't done nothin', baby  
But drive a good man from home  
  
When the moon beats on the mountain  
Little girl, I'll be on my way  
I'm gonna roam this highway  
Until the break of day  
  
Oh, give me one more kiss darlin'  
Just before I go  
'Cos when I leave this time, little girl  
I won't be back no more  
  
I got the key  
(I got the key)  
To the highway  
(To the highway)  
  
Billed out and bound to go  
(I gotta go, I gotta go)  
I'm gonna leave here runnin'  
Walkin's most too slow
