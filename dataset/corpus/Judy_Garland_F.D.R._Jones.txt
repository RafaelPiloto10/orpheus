I hear tell there's a stranger in the Jones household  
(Yes siree, yes siree)  
That's what I'm told  
I hear tell there's a new arrival six days old  
(Yes siree, yes siree)  
Worth his weight in gold  
Come right in and meet the son  
Christening's done, time to have some fun  
(Yes siree, yes siree, yes siree)  
Yes siree, yes siree, it's a big holiday everywhere  
For the Jones family has a brand new heir  
He's the joy heaven sent and they proudly present  
Mister Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones  
When he grows up he never will stray  
With a name like the one that he's got today  
As he walks down the street folks will say  
"Pleased to meet, Mister Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones"  
What a smile and how he shows it  
He'll keep happy all day long  
What a name, I bet he knows it  
With that handle how can he go wrong?  
And the folks in the town all agree  
He'll be famous, as famous as he can be  
How can he be a dud or a stick in the mud  
When he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones?  
(Yes siree, yes siree, yes siree)  
'Cause he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones
