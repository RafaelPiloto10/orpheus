Here's to the good life or so they say  
All those parties and games that all those people play  
They tell me this is the place to be  
All those beautiful people and nothing to see  
  
Chorus:]  
Sometimes I feel like something is gone here  
Something is wrong here  
I don't belong here  
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town  
And I've lost what I've found  
It'll all turn around  
In a little while I'll be thinking about you  
In a little while I'll still be here without you  
You never gave me a reason to doubt you  
In a little while I'll be thinking about you baby  
I'll be thinking about you baby  
  
On the other side of a coin there's a face  
There's a memory somewhere that I can't erase  
And there's a place that I'll find someday  
But sometimes I feel like it's slipping away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some things are lost, some left behind  
Some things are better left for someone else to find  
Maybe in time I could finally see  
I just wonder, wonder if you think about me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be thinking about you baby  
I'll be thinking about you baby, baby, baby
