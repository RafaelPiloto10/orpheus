Stood out in the rain  
Let it soak me down  
Before I called you . . . I called  
You didn't see me there  
Hidden by the rain  
Beneath your window . . . but I saw you  
  
Putting on your face before the  
Mirror on the wall  
Dreaming that the looking glass was me  
Catching your fondest gazes  
Living through your fickle phases  
I love you  
  
And it's getting easier each day  
To weep about you  
Harder every night to sleep without you  
How many years must I be driven  
By this dream  
Of love with you?  
  
Spend my dimes on phones  
Trying just to talk but  
You don't answer . . . you let it ring  
  
Spend my nights alone  
Catching falling stars to  
Give to you, love  
They're just for you  
  
For stars fall every time a  
Lover has to face the truth  
And far too many stars have fell on me  
And as they trail the skies  
And burn their paths upon my eyes  
I cry
