I've been a martyr for love  
And I will die in the flames  
As I draw my last breath  
As I'm closing on death  
I will call out your name  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
Nailed up on the cross  
While you're having your fun  
As the damage is done  
I'm assessing the cost  
  
I knew what I was letting myself in for  
I knew that I could never even the score  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
I need to be by your side  
I have knelt at your feet  
I have felt your deceit  
Couldn't leave if I tried  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
Tortured every hour  
From the day I was born  
I've been moved like a pawn  
By the greatest of powers  
  
I knew that I would have to suffer in vain  
Aware that I would never outgrow the pain  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
I've been a martyr for love  
I've been a martyr for love
