Don't think they know the truth  
Say they saw (A-A-to the L-I-Y-A-H)  
I don't think they know, how could they know  
I don't think they know the truth  
Say they saw  
I don't think they know, how could they know  
  
Don't let them tell you any different  
Yea yea yeah they don't know about us, they don't know about it  
I owe it all to you  
Yea yea yeah they don't know about us, they don't know about it  
And as much as I messed up, always give me your best love  
Yea yea yeah they don't know about us, they don't know about it  
Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you  
Yea yea yeah they don't know about us, they don't know about it  
They gon' talk about it (gon' talk about it)  
Gon' try to change your mind about it  
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear  
But we good. (Don't worry 'bout it)  
So when they talk about (they talk about it)  
Just let 'em know we already got it  
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good (Don't worry 'bout it)  
  
I don't think they know the truth  
Say they saw  
I don't think they know, how could they know  
I don't think they know the truth  
Say they saw  
I don't think they know, how could they know  
  
Don't listen to (How could they know)  
What people say (How could they know)  
They don't know about (How could they know)  
'Bout you and me (How could they know)  
  
At my best you love me  
Yea yea yeah they don't know about us, they don't know about it  
Even though I act my worse  
Yea yea yeah they don't know about us, they don't know about it  
And I know that it's different, feels like we're best friends, we connected  
They don't know about us, they don't know about it  
What did I do to deserve you  
Yea yea yeah they don't know about us, they don't know about it  
They gon' talk about it (gon' talk about it)  
Gon' try to change your mind about it  
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear  
But we good. (Don't worry 'bout it)  
So when they talk about (they talk about it)  
Just let 'em know we already got it

They don't know about us, they don't know about it (How could they know)  
How could they know  
They don't know about us, they don't know about it (How could they know)  
  
I thank you for the autographs  
And the cheers over the years  
You stood by me you didn't doubt me  
I think you want some more  
I do more than sing,  
I'm older now, actin' now  
Plus I got my own movie now  
After all the awards  
That they gave me you still found me  
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me  
Think you want some more  
I truly believe that  
If it wasn't all for you  
I don't know what I would do  
  
I don't think they know the truth  
Say they saw  
I don't think they know, how could they know  
I don't think they know the truth (they don't know)  
Say they saw  
I don't think they know, how could they know  
  
Don't listen to (How could they know)  
What people say (How could they know)  
They don't know about (How could they know)  
'Bout you and me (How could they know)
