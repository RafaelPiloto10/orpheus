Are you happy?  
I met a pretty girl on a date last night,  
And let me tell you now, she was groovy.  
And I kissed the pretty girl, and I held her tight,  
Let me tell you now, she was groovy.  
  
And now, no matter what I try to do  
My mind's drifting back to you.  
  
Are you happy?  
And now, no matter what I try to do  
My mind's drifting back to you.  
  
Are you happy?  
To you.  
Are you happy?  
Oh, I love you.  
Please, tell me now that you're happy,  
Please, tell me now that you're mine.  
  
Please, tell me now that you're happy,  
Please, tell me now that you're mine.  
  
I want to tell you I love you.  
Are you happy?
