Is that the clown service I'm callin'?  
I've made a fool of myself again  
There's a hole in my pocket a patch on my pants  
My shoes let in water I'm feeling you're here  
Look up the smile service operator  
I've got some frown lines that need to be read  
I look in the mirror, I sigh all the time  
The face that I see, I know it ain't mine  
Ooh we lady, if I had my baby  
I wouldn't be wastin' your time  
Ooh we lady, if I had my baby  
I wouldn't be blockin', blockin' your line  
Is that the love service I'm callin'?  
Come on over mend my broken heart  
Was it so silly, was Cupid so stupid  
Or maybe it wasn't to be that way at all?  
Ooh we lady, if I had my baby  
I wouldn't be wastin' your time
