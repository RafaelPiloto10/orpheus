All they know  
Is when we fight  
They never see us in the loving times  
What do they know?  
They don't know a thing  
  
They don't know  
How the laughter flies  
Only the stories  
Most of which are lies  
What do they know?  
They don't know a thing  
  
[Chorus]  
How can you understand a love so strong  
When you've never shared that with someone  
And when all the lies are dead and gone  
We'll still be here  
We'll prove them wrong  
  
Because they don't feel  
You're touch at night  
The way your head falls in the morning light  
What do they know?  
They don't know a thing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Because all they know  
Is how to critisise  
They never take a chance  
In their own lives  
What do they know?  
They don't know a thing  
  
And all I know  
Is they don't know a thing
