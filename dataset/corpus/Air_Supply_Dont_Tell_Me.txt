You were late last night, the candle burned so low  
And in my darkest hour I knew you had to go  
Did he hold you like I held you once before  
Is there someone else that loves you even more  
Don't tell me  
  
Standing face to face the words just fall away  
But in my loneliness I knew just what to say  
Did he touch you where I touched you long ago  
Please don't answer, I don't really want to know  
  
So don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
  
I have no more to give you  
I have no room to share  
I know the road I follow going nowhere  
  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
  
Should I close my eyes and say I'm giving up  
Can we compromise the darker side of love  
Did he hold you like I held you once before  
Since I lost your love I need you even more  
Don't tell me lies  
  
I have no more to give you  
I have no room to share  
I know the road I follow going nowhere  
  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me
