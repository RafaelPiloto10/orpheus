Can I show you this state of mind  
For it is not mine  
Can I not show you this state of mind  
For she is not mine  
I will not entertain this state of mind  
For it is not mine  
I will not entertain you  
For it is not mine  
Siamese almeida  
Siamese almeida, ooh  
Siamese almeida  
Siamese almeida, ooh  
I will not undo these twisted bones and sinew  
I will not look to find who lives in you  
I will not hold my hand on fire  
Take it off my head  
I will not entertain this state of mind  
For she is not mine  
Siamese almeida  
Siamese almeida, ooh  
Siamese almeida  
Siamese almeida, ooh  
I will not change my ways to suit this day  
I will not change my face  
I'll hide it from you  
All twisted bones and sinew  
I will not change what's in you  
I will not change for you  
I will not change what I hate in you!  
All twisted bones and sinew...  
I will not change what's in you  
I will not change what's in you!  
Siamese almeida  
Siamese almeida, ooh  
Siamese almeida  
Siamese almeida, ooh  
Siamese almeida  
Siamese almeida, ooh  
Siamese almeida  
Siamese almeida, ooh
