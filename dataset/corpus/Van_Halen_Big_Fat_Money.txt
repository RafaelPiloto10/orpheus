Some say money is bad for the soul  
Bad for the rock, bad for the roll  
Bad for the heart, bad for the brain  
Bad for damn near everything, oh  
Yeah  
It must be good for something  
Come on pay the rent  
Telephone, telefax, telefunkin',  
Teletrash  
Tell a cop, tell a friend  
Think we've hit the stoney end  
Nothing left, nothing right  
Now they want a bigger bite  
Everybody wants some  
Everybody wants big money, oh yeah  
They want big fat money  
That's what I want  
Big fat money  
Too much temptation  
Enough to kill a generation  
Space station, starvation, premature  
Ejaculation  
This ain't groovin', this ain't funky  
It's on my back  
But it ain't my monkey, no  
Oh yeah, gimme some of that big big  
Money  
That's what I want  
Big fat money  
Big big money  
Smoke this, eat that  
My ol'lady's gettin' fat  
High rise, high rent  
Before it's earned, it's all been spent  
Where's it gonna come from?  
Who's it gonna go to?  
Ain't beatin', but I'm being eatin' by  
Money, oh yeah  
Big big money, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Some of that big money, alright  
That's what I want  
Well alright, oh, big big money  
Now gimme, gimme, gimme  
Some of that big money  
That's what I want  
That's all I need  
Gimme big fat money  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme some of that big fat money
