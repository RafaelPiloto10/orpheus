Crowds that scream at superstars  
Where bouncers show their battle scars  
I've been the first to sign on every wall  
Down the road and round the bend  
We pray to god it never ends  
I've been, I've seen, we've screamed to everyone  
  
We'll see you at the show  
If you don't come we'll never know  
You stand off in the back  
You still stand out while you're wearing black  
You jump onto the bus  
And ride around with all of us  
We'll go out onto the town  
And light it up 'til we burn it down  
  
After hours and alcohol  
Every club, we've seen 'em all  
As long as we don't need to stand in line  
Party scenes and billboard dreams  
The ladies love those limousines  
You know were gonna show up every time  
  
Well see you at the show  
If you don't come we'll never know  
You stand off in the back  
You still stand out while your wearing black  
You jump onto the bus  
And ride around with all of us  
We'll go out on the town  
And light it up 'til we burn it down  
(burn it down)
