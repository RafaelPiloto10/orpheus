This is war with no weapons, marching with no stepping  
Murder with no killing, I'll in every direction  
First, no sequel, do the math, no equal  
A John with no Yoko  
More power, less people  
And yeah I'm not afraid of that, print in your paperback  
Every rapper's made in fact, to act as a delayed attack  
Every phrase a razor blade, and save it till they play it back  
Slay em leave em laying on the paper bank, fade to black  
  
In the wastelands of today,  
When there's nothing left to lose  
And there's nothing more to take  
But you force yourself to choose  
In the wastelands of today  
When tomorrow disappears  
When the future slips away  
And your world turns into fear  
In the wastelands of today  
  
Roll credits, forget it, the show's done,  
They're talking for just talkin,  
Meaning they got none,  
None of you come proper,  
They talk like a shotgun  
But how many of you got bred with integrity, not once  
So no, I'm not afraid to see you suckas hold a blade to me,  
Ain't no way to shake the ground I built before you came to be,  
Take it how you take it,  
I'm the opposite of vacancy,  
And this not negotiation,  
I can hear you, wait and see!  
  
In the wastelands of today,  
When there's nothing left to lose,  
And and there's nothing more to take,  
But you force yourself to choose,  
In the wastelands of today,  
When tomorrow disappears  
When the future slips away,  
And your world turns into fear,  
And your world turns into fear,  
In the wastelands of today!  
  
In the wastelands of today  
When there's nothing left to lose  
And and there's nothing more to take  
But you force yourself to choose  
In the wastelands of today  
When tomorrow disappears  
When the future slips away  
And your world turns into fear  
And your world turns into fear  
In the wastelands of today  
  
In the wastelands of today  
  
In the wastelands of today
