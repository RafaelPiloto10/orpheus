Midnight rolling in, sunlight  
Reaching out for your return  
  
[Chorus]  
As you were running through the tunnel of life  
And soon you'll dance around the fire of fright  
Tonight  
  
When you're standing on the corner  
And the sun is getting hot  
Does this day begin to worry you a lot  
  
You are, what you are, too far  
Golden star, a ruby light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you're standing on the corner  
And the sun is getting hot  
Does the day begin to worry you a lot
