I walked into a diner  
And the blonde behind the counter  
She asked if she could help in any way  
Hell, I knew by her smile  
Her number I could dial  
If I was in the need of company  
But as I bought some Java  
Instead she brought me a cup of chicory  
I got those Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee  
You know that I'll stay high  
I'll drink coffee 'till I die  
Don't pour me water just fill up my cup  
You know it takes a lot just to keep me up  
Cost may be more than you care to pay  
What good is money compared to fightin' pain  
Don't try to cheat  
It's impossible to beat  
The only pick me up that's here to stay  
I got those Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, oh coffee  
Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
You know that I'll stay high  
I'll drink coffee 'till I die  
The taste of Java is like a cocaine rush  
Nobody's gonna stop me from drinkin' too much  
Down in Bolivia the people are insane  
They want as much for coffee as they do for cocaine  
Don't try to cheat  
It's impossible to beat  
  
The only pick me up that's here to stay  
I got those Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
The coffee's got me now  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee  
You know that I'll stay high  
I'll drink coffee 'till I die  
I got the Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
Oh the coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, oh coffee  
Java Blues!
