Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
  
Silk and satin make me wonder  
Just who I am  
To be with you in times of slumber  
Makin' me a man  
  
I haven't known you for a very long time  
But it's on my mind what I want to do  
A trip to the skies we begin to fly  
Oh  
  
All the riches I have taken  
From you every night  
Pay you back someday with interest  
'Cause your loving makes it right  
Yeah  
  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever, ever had  
Oh yeah  
  
Best thing
