There's no stronger wind than the one that blows  
Down a lonesome railroad line  
No prettier sight than looking back  
On a town you left behind  
There is nothin' that's as real  
As a love that's in my mind  
  
Close your eyes  
I'll be here in the morning  
Close your eyes  
I'll be here for a while  
  
There's lots of things along the road  
I'd surely like to see  
I'd like to lean into the wind  
And tell myself I'm free  
But your softest whisper's louder  
Than the highways call to me  
  
All the mountains and the rivers  
And the valleys can't compare  
To your blue lit dancin' eyes  
And yellow shining hair  
I could never hit the open road  
And leave you layin' there  
  
Lay your head back easy, love,  
Close your cryin' eyes  
I'll be layin' here beside you  
When the sun comes on the rise  
I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails  
And the lonesome bluejay cries.
