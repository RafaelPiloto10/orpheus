"Soon"  
  
Like a new winter's coat  
I'm wearing your last embrace  
Like a cold quenching glass of water  
I hold a clear picture of your face  
  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you?  
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty  
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty  
  
I'm hearing your last telephone call  
Ringing louder and clearer than the rest  
I hear your invitation to see it all  
Better written I am smitten no protest  
  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you?  
Soon I'll be bored and lonely  
Soon I'll be bored and lonely  
  
Like a story well told  
Your conversation can hold me or soothe me  
Like a funny time to share you were there  
And your comfort and support me  
  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you?  
Soon I'll be restless and weary  
Soon I'll be restless and weary  
  
Like another man  
I want hold you within me  
Like a good day without care  
I just want you to last  
I just want you to last  
  
I'm tasting the last glass of your wine  
The sweet taste linger left on lips  
I think of your kisses with mine  
The sweet taste lingers left on lips  
  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you? (Quickly)  
Where are you?  
Soon I'll be sober and unkissed  
Soon I'll be sober and unkissed
