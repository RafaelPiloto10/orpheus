You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
  
As time goes by  
And when two lover's woe  
They still say I love you  
And that you can rely  
  
No matter what the future  
Brings, as time go by  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman meets man  
And man must have his mate  
  
That no one can deny  
  
[Chorus]  
It's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by
