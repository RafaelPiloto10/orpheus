Hey mister can you help me  
I'm a loner on the run  
I'm just looking for tomorrow  
And I ain't gonna hurt no one  
  
I jumped headfirst into a bottle  
I was looking for a friend  
Came up just short of nothing  
I didn't find the truth I only found an end  
  
So tell me who's gonna save me  
Or my father or my son  
When the only justice a man can see  
Is the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
I been broke and I've been hungry  
I think they're both my middle name  
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough  
Still guess I can't complain  
  
'Cause what you get in life you take it  
You've gotta hold on and make it last  
They say good things come to those who wait  
But it's life that goes so fast  
  
And when there's just one rule you live by  
Each day you kiss the rising sun  
When you live and die by the life we breathe  
In the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
Guns talk to me in my sleep at night  
And a gun somewhere is burning  
With my name  
  
Winners are losers  
And losers will have to face  
All those yesterdays  
And all of the dreams they blew away  
  
So mister can you help me  
Or are you my gun  
Have the ghosts of justice  
Brought you here to me to taste  
The barrel of a loaded gun  
  
There's justice in the barrel  
Of a loaded gun
