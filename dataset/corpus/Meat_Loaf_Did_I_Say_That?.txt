So this is what it feels like  
To be the one left behind  
To give it all you've got, then find  
You've already changed your mind  
  
And this is what it sounds like  
Crying on the bed that we both made  
Waiting for a sign that you just can't give me  
Any kind of sign  
  
I don't want to be here wide-awake  
Clinging to a love that can't be saved  
Hanging off the edge of every word  
That you say  
  
So I asked myself, "Do I love you so much  
That I'm willing to let you go?"  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was "yes"  
But, at the bottom of my heat I'm wondering  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
  
And you know I'd drag myself through fire at your side  
And you know the gates of Heaven are surely open wide  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I need someone to call my own  
I'm standing in the light of my mistakes  
And begging you, "come home."  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're choking on your pride  
  
So I asked myself, "Do I love you so much  
That I'm willing to let you go?"  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was "yes"  
But, at the back of my mind I'm wondering  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
But I said that  
  
And I wish I could take it all back  
  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I want a love to call my own  
I want to take you in the back seat now  
And slowly drive you home  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're  
Choking on your pride  
I don't want to be this wide-awake  
  
Fighting for a love that I can't save  
And hanging off the edge of every word you say  
Knowing that it might make me cry  
I don't want to be this complicating  
You can drag it out but I'll be waiting  
I stumbled on "I love you" tonight  
But it sounded like goodbye  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause if  
Would have been a matter of fact  
  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm not letting go  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll have and I'll hold  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause it  
Would have been a matter of fact  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm walking through fire  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll feed your desire  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll stand by your side  
Did I say that?  
This time I will be your pride  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm not letting go  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll have and I'll hold  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm walking through fire  
Did I say that?  
And I wish that I could take it all back  
  
So this is what it feels like  
To be the one left behind  
To give it all you've got then find  
That you've already changed your mind
