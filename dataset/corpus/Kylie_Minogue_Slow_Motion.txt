Slow Motion  
Kylie Minogue  
Sink into srenity,  
Speak in lovers tounge,  
Give into delicious dreams,  
The future has begun,  
Dare to drown in pleasures found,  
I'm just surrendering.  
Coz' I don't want to miss a thing.  
I'm living in slow motion,  
Wish I could freeze this space in time.  
Everything's wide open,  
Now that you're here, it's unspoken,  
It's all in the way your hands it mine,  
Skin on my skin,  
I think it's love, I've fallen into.  
Savouring the pure desire the passions come undone,  
With every kiss,  
The colors change, bleeding into one.  
In days gone by, I'd be wandering if this feelings gonna last,  
But I don't even have to ask.  
Coz were living in slow motion,  
Wish I could freeze this space in time,  
Everything's wide open,  
Now that you're here, it's unspoken,  
It's all in the way your hands it mine,  
Skin on my skin,  
I think it's love, I've fallen into.  
I'm living in slow motion.
