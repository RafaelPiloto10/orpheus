A still small voice will speak to you one day.  
A still small voice will call to you and say,  
"I am the earth, the sky, the brightest star on high,  
The tallest tree, the smallest drop of dew."  
  
A still small voice one day will say to you!  
The still small voice from every voice apart,  
Will whisper in the language of your heart,  
" I am the night, the day, the blessing and the way,  
  
The dream that keeps a lonely heart aglow!"  
Once you have heard the word a still small voice will say,  
Your heart will answer,  
"Yes, I know!"
