Now Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts oh Lord how they could love  
Swore to be true to each other true as the stars above  
He was her man but he wasn't doin' her wrong  
Now Frankie went down to the corner just for a bucket of beer  
She said Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here  
He's my man he wouldn't do me wrong  
I don't want to cause you no trouble woman I ain't gonna lie  
But I saw your lover an hour ago with a girl named Nellie Blie  
He's your man but he's doin' you wrong  
Now Frankie looked over with transom she saw to her surprise  
There on the cab sat Johnny making love to Nellie Blie  
He's my man but he's doin' me wrong  
Frankie went back to comoda took out her little 44  
Rutty too-too three times she shot right through that hardwood door  
Shot her man he was doin' her wrong  
  
Now bring out your rubber tied hearses bring out the rubber tied hatch  
I'm taken said the man to the graveyard but only six of 'em called him back  
He was my man but he done me wrong  
Bring round a thousand policemen bring 'em around today  
To lock me down in that dungeon cell and throw that key away  
I shot my man he was doin' me wrong  
Now Frankie she said to the warden what are they goin' to do  
The warden he said to Frankie it's the electric chair for you  
You shot your man he was doin' you wrong  
Now this story has no moral this story has no end  
This story just goes to show that there ain't no good in man  
He was her man but he done her wong
