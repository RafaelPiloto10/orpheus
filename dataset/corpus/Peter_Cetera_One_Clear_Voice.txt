The whole world is talkin', drownin' out my voice  
How can I hear myself with all this noise  
But all this confusion just disappears  
When I find a quiet place where I can hear  
  
One clear voice callin' out for me to listen  
One clear voice (that) whispers words of wisdom  
Close my eyes till I find what I've been missin'  
If I'm very still I will hear one clear voice  
  
I'm always searchin' for which path to take  
Sometimes I'm so afraid to make mistakes  
From somewhere inside me stronger than my fears  
Just like the sound of music to my ears  
  
One clear voice callin' out for me to listen  
One clear voice (that) whispers words of wisdom  
Close my eyes till I find what I've been missin'  
If I'm very still I will hear one clear voice
