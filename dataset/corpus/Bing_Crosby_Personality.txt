When Madam Pompadour was on a ballroom floor  
Said all the gentlemen "Obviously,"  
"The madam has the cutest personality"  
  
And think of all the books about do Barry's looks  
What was it made her the toast of Paree?  
She had a well-developed personality  
  
What did Romeo see in Juliet?  
Or Figaro in Figarette?  
Or Jupiter in Juno?  
You know!  
  
And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced  
No doubt it must have been easy to see  
That she knew how to use her personality  
  
A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well  
And never sit on the boss's left knee  
Unless she's got a perfect personality  
  
A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair  
Or even just a bit bowed at the knee  
If she can show a faultless personality  
  
Why are certain girls offered certain things  
Like sable coats and wedding rings?  
By men who wear their spats right?  
(That's right!)  
  
So don'tcha say "I'm smart and have the kindest heart"  
Or "what a wonderful sister I'd be"  
Just tell me how you like my  
"Rufff!  
(Personality)  
  
Baby, you've got the cutest  
Personality!!
