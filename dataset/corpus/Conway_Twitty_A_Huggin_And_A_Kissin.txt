Didn't know what I was missin'  
All those nights of a huggin' and a kissin'  
Making love on a night in June  
Looking at the stars around the silvery moon.  
  
Next day the sun was shinin'  
The whole world had a silver linin'  
The moonlight so alone and blue,  
No more nights making love without you.  
  
Last night we did our hearts command  
We went to see the preacher man  
Now I know what I've been missin'  
Too many nights without a huggin' and a kissin'.  
  
All around town it's been told  
Now you wear a band of gold  
If that's the way it was meant to be,  
Before you and you for me, aww.

I need your huggin' and kissin',  
I gotta have your huggin' and kissin'.  
  
Got to have your huggin' and kissin',  
Oh baby, I need your (huggin' and kissin')
