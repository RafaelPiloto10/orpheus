Well, I knocked down on your door, baby,  
To see if you were at home.  
Your shade was down, there wasn't even a sound  
But something told me you weren't alone.  
What in the world can a nasty dog do  
But try to get next to you?  
  
Don't laugh 'cause it ain't funny.  
Look how it happened to me.  
It could happen to you, you could be a fool too  
And it'd leave you in misery.  
I guess there's nothin' more funky king can do  
But to try to get next to you.  
  
Mm, well.
