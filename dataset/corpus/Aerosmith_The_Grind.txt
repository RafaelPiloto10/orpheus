I never thought a first time love would ever last  
How could a kiss like that  
Knock me flat on my ass  
  
The burning bed  
The roses dead  
And now I'm dancing with myself  
  
Yeah,  
I'm missing you  
Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off of my mind  
  
Yeah,  
Your sweet talking hip shaking wobble gonna blow a man away  
Kiss butt, and guess what  
Even double crossin' dogs have their day, ha  
So forget about, regret about, you're right I ain't afraid to say  
  
Yeah, I'm missing you  
Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off  
  
And the more I try  
Leads to the same old why  
You made me slip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off of the cloud we was on  
And now it's all gone  
Tell me why, why, why, why  
Why ain't I getting through  
Ain't no lie there out of love, love, love  
  
Tell me was it good, for you  
  
Tell me what you want  
  
Yeah, cause I'm missing you  
Just like you knew I'd do  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get'choo off  
And I know I tried  
Leads to the same old why  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't, can't, can't get you  
Get you [Repeat: x4]  
Get you [Repeat: x3]  
  
Off of my mind
