Now is the glimmering spinning beginning  
Of something I've prayed for and counted the minutes  
To be in the shadows of sheltering meadows  
Of night, here with you in my arms.  
  
This is the moment that pauses to hold us  
As you and I move in a background of wonder,  
Surrounded by countless enclosures  
Of nocturnal unspoken music of joy.  
  
Counting times you have stood at the foot of my ivory tower  
And waited, and called out my name by the hour,  
And counted on the wings of my heartstrings  
To carry the sound, I have counted on pleading,  
You see how I need you, come down.  
  
And now between twilight and midnight I come to you,  
Down in my gown of soft moonbeams and starlight,  
Bright is the evening, the breezes have fenced us  
And nestled against us  
  
You're here  
And warm.  
  
And mine till the time  
When the dawn will awake you,  
The morning will shake you,  
The highway will take you.  
  
But now all the rays of the moon making bouquets  
Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights  
We count on the night to hold everything even,  
And count on forgetting that you will be leaving,  
And destinies folded and then in the dawn you'll be gone.  
  
But now as the gardens of softening night time  
Are blossoming slowly around where we are,  
You and I come together  
And walk through the dreams of the stars.  
  
So here while the song of the deepening evening  
Is singing to me from the light in your eyes,  
We can count on each other to move to the beach of tomorrow  
And know where we've been.
