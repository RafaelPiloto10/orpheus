Why do I go on fooling myself When I know you love somebody else?  
Only a fool breaks his own heart  
I pretend I don't see you walking with him on the street  
Only a fool breaks his own heart  
  
I have to admit even though it hurt me so I can't forget  
If I'm a man, I'll let you go  
There's no sense in holding on to an old love that's gone  
Only a fool, breaks his own heart  
  
I have to accept even though it hurt me so I can't forget  
If I'm a man, I'll let you go  
There's no sense in holding on to an old love that's gone  
Only a fool, breaks his own heart  
Only a fool, breaks his own heart
