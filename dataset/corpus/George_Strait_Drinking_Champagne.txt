I'm drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
I'm having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind  
  
Guilty conscience I guess  
I must confess  
I never loved you much when you were mine  
  
So I'll keep drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
Having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind  
  
Guilty conscience I guess  
I must confess  
I never loved you much when you were mine  
  
So I'll keep drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
I'll keep having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind
