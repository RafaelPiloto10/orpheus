It's the way that you kiss me  
It's the way that you don't  
It's the way that you'll miss me  
When you swear that you won't  
  
There's a feeling you give me  
When we talk on the phone  
God, I hope you outlive me  
So I'm never alone  
  
Whatever you do, I will be there for you  
Through the thunder, the wind and the rain  
And whatever you do, I will promise to you  
I will be there, I'll be there for you  
  
I may lack social graces  
But I won't swallow my pride  
There are millions of places, places  
I could be but I'm here by your side  
  
And whatever you do, I will be there for you  
Through the thunder, the wind and the rain  
(Be there for you)  
And whatever you do, I will promise to you  
I will be there  
(Be there)  
I'll be there for you  
  
Though there's nothing to guide us  
We will weather the storm  
Till the heavens divide us  
I will keep you from harm  
  
Whatever you do, I will be there for you  
Through the thunder, the wind and the rain  
(Be there for you)  
And whatever you do, I will promise to you  
I will be there  
(Be there)  
I'll be there  
  
Whatever you do, I will be there for you  
Through the thunder, the wind and the rain  
(Be there for you)  
I will always be true, this I promise to you  
I will be there  
(Be there)  
I'll be there for you
