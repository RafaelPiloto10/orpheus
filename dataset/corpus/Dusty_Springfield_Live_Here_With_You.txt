You ask me to live here with you  
If I could, love, you know I would  
I can't give you my heart or my hand though you want it  
I can't give you the love I know I should  
And I tell you there's nobody else  
It's not you, I'm just afraid  
Will you show me the way?  
So, I'm sure that I love you  
Show me how true love is made  
If I could I would give you my heart and my hand  
I'd give you the sea, I'd give you the land  
If I found love to give you  
I would give you my life, mmm, mmm, mmm, ooh, hoo, hoo, mmm  
In my sorrow I've called out your name  
In my dreams I've known only you  
Is this love that I feel?  
Am I foolin' myself when I wish for my dreams to come true?  
If I could I would give you my heart and my hand  
I'd give you the sea, I'd give you the land  
If I found love to give you  
I'd give you my life, mmm, mmm, mmm, ooh, hoo, hoo, mmm  
All the pain on my life would be gone  
Oh, my love, if you only knew  
You'd be kissin' away all the tears of my joy  
When you ask me to live here with you
