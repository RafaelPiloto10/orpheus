Because You're mine the brightest star I see  
Looks down my love and envies me  
Because you're mine  
Because you're mine  
  
Because you're mine the breeze that hurries by  
Becomes a melody and why  
Because you're mine  
Because you're mine  
  
I only know for as long as I may live  
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may  
give me  
And when we kiss  
That isn't thunder dear  
It's only my poor heart you hear  
And it's applause  
Because you're mine  
  
And when we kiss  
That isn't thunder dear  
It's only my poor heart you hear  
And it's applause  
Because you're mine
