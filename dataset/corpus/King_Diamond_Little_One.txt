"Mommy... mommy... mommy... mommy"  
  
Later that Night in her Room, Abigail was drifting off to sleep.  
All of what she had seen Today, was hard to believe.  
  
Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain  
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy  
And that's a shame  
  
Abigail was quickly on her feet  
Down the stairs and into the dark, Abigail was following the sound  
And there she was: the child  
  
It was clearly a ghost, the ghost from the gate in the storm  
"Little girl, tell me who you are?"  
"I am your spirit twin from years ago, I'm little one"  
  
That brought back memories of Abigail when turning six  
Sneaking out of bed, like she always did  
  
Hiding in the dark, listening to the men  
Tell their stories from way back then  
She remembered the story of Jonathan  
  
And they'd been talking about the Little One  
  
Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain  
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy  
And that's a shame  
  
Abigail she knew she had to stay  
Saving Little One and breaking the chain, breaking the chain
