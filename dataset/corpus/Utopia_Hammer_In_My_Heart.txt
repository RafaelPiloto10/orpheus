There's a hammer in my heart  
Pounding out your name  
There's a hammer in my heart  
Here it comes again  
  
I hear a certain sound  
And it just won't go away  
It sends a message out  
What's it gonna be today?  
  
It wakes me up at dawn  
And as the day goes on  
I try to turn it off but the beat goes on  
It never lets me rest  
  
I can't get a minute's peace  
I lay awake in bed  
Wondering will it ever cease?  
It's like a top ten song  
  
I hear it all day long  
I try to turn it off but the beat goes on
