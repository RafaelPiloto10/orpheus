I wake with the morning light  
Makin' love all through the night  
Was I dreaming  
Lyin' there I watch you sleep  
One kiss before I leave, what you've done to me  
I'm gonna tell the world... yeah  
  
Chorus:  
  
I got a reason to feel alive  
You put the smile on my face  
There'll be no more lonely nights in this town  
Oh no... no... 'cause I got a reason  
  
I used to be a restless soul  
All the dreams I could not hold  
I was searchin'...  
I reached out and you were there  
I never though someone would care  
The way you do...  
You got me shakin' now girl  
  
I got a reason to feel alive  
You put the smile on my face  
There'll be no more lonely nights in this town  
Oh no... no... 'cause I got a reason  
Oh no... no...  
  
I want your love... want you to stay... oh yeah  
You know you got me night and day  
Every day...  
  
I got a reason to feel alive  
You put the smile on my face  
There'll be no more lonely nights in this town  
Oh no... no... 'cause I got a reason... yes I do  
Oh no... no... 'cause I got a reason... yeah  
  
Now I got a reason... yeah
