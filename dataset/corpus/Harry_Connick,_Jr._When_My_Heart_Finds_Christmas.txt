In my eyes are valentines  
And easter eggs and new year's wine  
But when my heart finds christmas  
My eyes will shine like new  
  
All the days are kind to me  
But fall too far behind to see  
But when my heart finds christmas  
I hope it finds you too  
  
Let the angels sing around us  
Christmas time is here  
Let our children's love surround us  
Laughing and filled with cheer  
  
My heart told me once before  
To find my dream and search no more  
And when my heart finds christmas  
I hope it finds you too
