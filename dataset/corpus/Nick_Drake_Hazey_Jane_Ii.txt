And what will happen in the morning when the world it gets  
So crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning.  
  
What will happen in the evening in the forest with the weasel  
With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.  
  
And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe  
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.  
  
What will happen  
In the morning  
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window  
In the morning.  
  
Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair  
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.  
And now that the family  
Is part of a chain  
Take off your eye shade  
Start over again.  
  
Now take a little while to find your way in here  
Now take a little while to make your story clear.  
Now that you're lifting  
Your feet from the ground  
Weigh up your anchor  
And never look round.  
  
Let's sing a song  
For Hazey Jane  
She's back again in my mind.  
If songs were lines  
In a conversation  
The situation would be fine
