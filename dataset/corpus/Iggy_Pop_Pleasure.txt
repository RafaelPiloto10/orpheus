Sooner or later baby  
I'm gonna squeeze you just like a tomato  
Sooner or later baby  
I'll probably peel you like some old potato  
Just give me some pleasure  
It's my life  
  
Sooner or later baby  
I'm gonna bleed you  
Sooner or later baby  
You're gonna feel something for me  
Just give me some pleasure  
It's my life  
  
I gotta do that  
I gotta do that  
Just give me some pleasure  
It's my life  
Just give me pleasure  
I got no wife  
Just give me pleasure  
I got no wife  
It's my pleasure  
I got no wife  
It's my pleasure  
That's what I'm living for  
  
I gotta do that  
I gotta do that  
Pleasure  
Pleasure  
Give me some pleasure please  
Pleasure  
Give me some pleasure please  
I'm gonna squeeze you like tomato  
I'm gonna peel you like a what?  
Like a potato  
It's my life  
It's just my life  
It's just my life
