Ask the sky above  
And ask the earth below  
Why I'm so in love  
And why I love you so  
Couldn't tell you though I tried do  
Just why I'm yours  
When you went away  
You left a glowing spark  
Trying to be gay as  
Whistling in the dark  
I am only what you make me  
Come take me  
I'm yours  
  
How can I happy  
I would be to beg or borrow  
For sorrow  
With you  
Even though I knew  
Tomorrow  
You'd say we were through  
If we drift apart  
Then I'll be lost and alone  
Though you use my heart  
Just for a steppin' stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you  
I'm yours  
  
How can I happy  
I would be to beg or borrow  
For sorrow  
With you  
Even though I knew  
Tomorrow  
You'd say we were through  
If we drift apart  
Then I'll be lost and alone  
Though you use my heart  
Just for a steppin' stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you  
I'm yours
