When the day falls where do you go?  
Six thirty, city windows dirty.  
Office nightclubs, drinks, dates and movie stubs.  
Be wary all secretaries.  
And eyes roam for who takes who home  
As the rain's coming down to Friday night.  
Don't let me down again.  
  
Passport pictures with charts and figures.  
Daily nightly. Oh, like me tightly.  
When the day falls where do you go?  
Ten thirty, like me tightly.  
  
And eyes roam for who takes who home  
As the rain's coming down to Friday night.  
Don't let me down again.  
  
Don't let me down again.
