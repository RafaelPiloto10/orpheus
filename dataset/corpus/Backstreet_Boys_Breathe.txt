The roses you left me slowly fading to grey  
Your coat on the chair and the scent of your hair I miss  
The clock on the wall it reminds me of all the better times  
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark  
Yeah we laughed and cried  
  
And I never knew alone wherever you are is home  
  
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
  
Ooh I walked by the store where we sat on the floor and we ate like kings  
And someone said hey we're locking the door no time to play  
  
And I never knew alone wherever you are is home  
  
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
  
We're not over  
We're not over  
  
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine  
And no I can't  
You know I can't breathe  
  
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
I can't breathe
