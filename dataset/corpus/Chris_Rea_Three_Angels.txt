Nine dollars, two cents  
No money, no rent  
8759 that's the number  
Be on time  
Bring something, don't care  
Whatever, be there  
Good woman, good loving, good feeling  
Three angels  
  
Eight castles, wants nine  
Unhappy all the time  
Gold headlights, can't see  
Sure could help him, feel free  
Five aces, no calls  
Easy action on the walls  
One burning, two custom, all waiting  
Three angels  
  
Burns, Hofner, white flats  
All together feeding back  
No mixer, no lights  
Good fixer, be all right  
Dream wishing, downtown  
In the windows, locked sound  
One burning, two custom, all waiting  
Three angels
