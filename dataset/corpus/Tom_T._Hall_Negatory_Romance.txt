He's wantin' her more than he's wantin' his wife  
Buddy that's a good way to screw up your life  
He sneaks off to see her when he gets a chance  
That's a perfect example of a negatory romance  
Sneakin' in the back door that ain't no 10-4 it's a negatory romance  
It's a real breaker maker when your heart is a taker it's a negatory romance  
Now girl don't go chasin' a man who ain't free  
You know there are plenty of fish in the sea  
So girl don't go chasin' whatever wears pants  
That's another example of a negatory romance  
Sneakin' in the back door...  
Slippin' around on the back streets of life  
Changin' your handle for one cheatin' night  
Slidin' off your gold band just so you can dance  
That's another example of a negatory romance  
Sneakin' in the back door...
