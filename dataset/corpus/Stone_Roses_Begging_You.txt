I'm begging you  
  
The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it  
And he knew what to do with it, everybody saw it  
Saw the dust that he made  
  
King bee in a frenzy, ready to blow  
Got the horn good to go, wait, oh his sting's all gone  
Now he's begging you, begging you  
  
Here is a warning, the sky will divide  
Since I took off the lid, no, there's nowhere to hide  
Now I'm begging you, begging you  
  
This is a mystery not to be solved  
But be minded, like minded, I'm gone, still I'm with you  
I'm begging you, begging you  
  
Give it over, give it over  
Give it over, give it over  
Give it over, give it over  
Give it over, give it over  
Yeah I'm begging you (I'm begging you)  
Give it over, give it over  
Give it over  
Yeah, I'm begging you, I'm begging you  
  
Weigh it and say it, is it all in a name  
Does it call you or maul you and drive you insane  
Can it make you remember, time is a place  
How I'm begging you, I'm begging you  
  
The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it  
And he knew what to do with it, everybody saw it  
Saw the dust that he made  
  
Make all the dust that you can  
Make all the dust that you can  
  
King bee in a frenzy, ready to blow
