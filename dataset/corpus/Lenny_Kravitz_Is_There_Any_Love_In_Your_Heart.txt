Oooh Yeah  
Tell me baby what can't you see  
That I'm feeling down  
If you open your eyes you'd see  
  
That I'm wearing a frown  
You'd think about yourself  
If you thought I was dead  
Aw yeah  
  
Baby baby you walk around  
Like you own this town  
You whole life is a fantasy  
And I'm playing the clown  
  
You talk behind my back  
And spend up all my bread  
  
Is there any love in your heart ooh yeah  
Is there any love in your heart ooh  
  
Babe you say I'm the only one  
But you're fucking all my friends  
Baby all that you care about  
Is gucci and Mercedes Benz  
  
You're just the kind that's up on all the latest trends  
Is there any love in your heart oo yeah  
Is there any love in your heart oo
