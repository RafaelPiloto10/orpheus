Right now  
I am an anti-Christ  
And I am an anarchist  
Don't know what I want, but I know how get it  
I want to destroy, possibly?  
  
'Cause I want to be anarchy, no dog's body  
Anarchy for the U.S.A.  
It's coming sometime, it may be  
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light  
Your future dream is a shopping spree  
  
'Cause I want to be anarchy, in the city  
Of many ways to get what you want  
I use the best, I use the rest  
I use the enemy  
I use anarchy  
  
'Cause I want to be anarchy, it's the only way to be  
Is this the M.P.L.A.?  
Is this the U.D.A.?  
Is this the I.R.A.?  
I thought it was the U.S.A., or just another country  
And other cunt-like tendencies  
'Cause I want to be anarchy, 'cause I want to be  
Anarchy, you know what I mean?  
  
'Cause I want to be anarchist, again I'm pissed  
Destroy!
