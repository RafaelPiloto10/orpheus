Hey! fly away with me to extacy  
Fly away with me to extacy  
Love can drive away your sorrows, yeah  
Love can drive away your fears  
Now let me take you somewhere where tranquillity is the key  
You and I alone baby making sweet love, you know  
Take a ride upon my magic carpet  
Fly away with me with perfect secret  
Let me show you things never seen before  
To distant stars we float amongs the cosmo  
Fun and laughter, watch your pretty glow  
That's my treat and baby that's my show, oh yeah  
Girl I love you more than words can tell  
You are in heaven, why should I give you any?  
Girl I love you more and more each day  
Pinchers promise, tell me you will stay  
'cause love can drive away your sorrows  
Love can drive away your fears  
In you I see my bride tomorrow  
I know love is here to stay  
While we float upon' our magic carpet  
Galactic winds are blowing underneath it  
And it will take us anywhere we wanna go, yeah  
I stop at mars to rock over to venus  
And in your hear a sprinkle gold and stardust  
Braise for love I am gonna give you instant love  
'cause love can drive away your sorrows, yeah  
Love can drive away your fears, yeah  
In you I see my bride tomorrow  
I know love is here to stay  
I love it when your dancing on top of my feet to the rhythm of our heartbeat  
I love it when your dancing on top of my feet to the rhythm of our heartbeat  
Fly away with me to extacy  
Fly away with me to extacy  
You know, love can drive away your sorrows  
Love can drive away your fears, my fears, your fears  
In you I see my bride tomorrow

The rhythm we are giving is the rhythm of our home  
I got to know this woman she's a bone of my bone  
And dancin on top of my feet to the rhythm of our heartbeat  
Fly away with me to extacy  
Fly away with me to extacy  
I told you that tranquillity would be the key...(fading)
