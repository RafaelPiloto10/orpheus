  
  
I danced before I had two feet.  
  
Sang before I had a tongue.  
  
I laughed before I had two eyes.  
  
Loved before my heart was young.  
  
I swam before I had two hands  
  
and held the distance in my toes.  
  
Before I heard the stars I knew  
  
the wild compulsion of the rose.  
  
I bore the fruits of many lies.  
  
Before I came into this day.  
  
I knew before my grave was made,  
  
the worms eat only death away  
  
the worms eat only death away  
  
I danced before I had two feet  
  
I danced before I had two feet  
  
I danced before I had two feet  
  
I danced before I had two feet.
