I married Isis on the fifth day of May  
But I could not hold on to her very long  
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away  
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.  
  
I came to a high place of darkness and light  
The dividing line ran through the center of town  
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right  
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.  
  
A man in the corner approached me for a match  
I knew right away he was not ordinary  
He said "Are you looking for something easy to catch ?"  
I said "I got no money". He said "That ain't necessary".  
  
We set out that night for the cold in the North  
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word  
I said "Where are we going ?" He said "We'd be back by the fourth"  
I said "That's the best new that I've ever heard".  
  
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold  
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace  
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.  
  
How she told me that one day we meet up again  
And things would be different the next time we wed  
If I only could hang on and just be her friend  
I still can't remember all the best things she said.  
  
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  
He said "There's a body I'm trying to find  
If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize"  
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.  
  
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous  
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn  
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious  
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.  
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had  
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly  
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.  
  
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside  
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover  
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied  
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.  
  
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes  
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.  
  
She said "Where ya been ?" I said "No place special ?"  
She said "You look different" I said "Well I guess"  
She said "You been gone" I said "That's only natural"  
She said "You gonna stay ?" I said "If you want me to, Yeah ".  
  
Isis oh Isis you mystical child  
What drives me to you is what drives me insane  
I still can remember the way that you smiled  
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
