Narrator  
  
So back in Canaan the future looked rough  
Jacob's family were finding it tough  
Brothers  
  
For the famine has caught us unprepared  
We are thin  
We are ill  
We are getting scared  
It's enough to make anyone weep  
We are down to our very last sheep  
Reuben  
  
We will starve if we hang around here  
Zebulun  
  
But in Egypt there's food going spare  
Asher  
  
They've got corn  
They've got meat  
They've got fruit and drinks  
Dan  
  
And if we have the time  
We could see the Sphinx  
Narrator  
  
So they finally decided to go  
Off to Egypt to see brother Jo  
So they all lay before  
Joseph's feet  
  
Brothers  
  
Mighty prince, give us something to eat  
Narrator  
  
Joseph found it a strain  
Not to laugh because  
Not a brother among them  
Knew who he was  
Joseph  
  
I shall now take them all for a ride  
After all they have tried fratricide
