Hey girls, gather round  
Because of what I'm puttin' down  
Oh, baby, I'm your handy man  
I'm not the kind that uses pencil or rule  
I'm handy with the love and I'm no fool  
I fix broken hearts, I know I really can  
  
If your broken heart needs repair  
I'm the man to see. I whisper sweet things  
You tell all your friends, and they'll come running to me  
Here is the main thing I want to say  
I'm busy twenty four hours a day  
I fix broken hearts, I know I really can
