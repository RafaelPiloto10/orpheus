The night was black, the roads were icy  
Snow was fallin', drifts were high  
And I was weary from my driving  
And I stopped to rest for awhile  
  
I sat down at a truck stop  
I was thinking about my past  
I've had a long streak of that bad luck  
But I'm praying it's gone at last  
  
[Chorus]  
Gone at last, gone at last  
Gone at last, gone at last  
I had a long streak of bad luck  
But I pray it's gone at last  
Oo, oo, oo...  
  
I ain't dumb  
I kicked around some  
I don't fall too easily  
But that boy looked so dejected  
He just grabbed my sympathy  
  
Sweet little soul now, what's your problem?  
Tell me why you're so downcast  
I've had a long streak of bad luck  
But I pray it's gone at last  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Once in a while from out of nowhere  
When you don't expect it, and you're unprepared  
Somebody will come and lift you higher  
And your burdens will be shared  
  
Yes I do believe, if I hadn't met you  
I might still be sinking fast  
I've had a long streak of that bad luck  
But I pray it's gone at last  
  
[Chorus]
