Seven seconds to the rise  
Can't believe I'm still alive  
And heaven was waiting for me  
I thought this would be the end  
But I know you'll understand  
All that is keeping me here  
  
I dream of a stairway to the skies  
My angel is coming down from heaven to take me  
I reach out but then you fade away  
Whenever you call for me  
Know that I'm only one step behind  
  
I sense this time I may have changed  
But one this still remains  
I'm torn and the hate still lingers  
I slowly start to realize  
We won't reunite  
I still have to march on through  
  
I dream of a stairway to the skies  
My angel is coming down from heaven to take me  
I reach out but then you fade away  
Whenever you call for me  
Know that I'm only one step behind  
  
Is it a curse or a fortune?  
Have I been blinded by regret?  
Redemption awaits  
My soul is at stake  
Will I find a stairway to the skies  
In the end?  
  
I dream of a stairway to the skies  
My angel is coming down from heaven to take me  
I reach out but then you fade away  
Whenever you call for me  
Know that I'm only one step behind  
Know that I'm only one step behind
