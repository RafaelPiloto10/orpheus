This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
First of all there's no one to talk to  
When there is they just don't seem to hear  
Words don't seem to matter much anyway  
They can't describe the pain  
They can't explain the fear  
  
Then the nights grow cold and hard to live through  
Still you hate to see the morning come  
Somehow tomorrow doesn't matter much anymore  
The future holds no promise  
Your life's already done  
  
This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
The you find your heart no longer flutters  
You no longer look through a lover's eyes  
What's to see when the world falls down around you  
You simply can't believe it  
But it comes as no surprise  
  
This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
What's the sense of failure  
It's such an incredible loss  
It's all the things you'll never do  
And all the dreams that will never come true  
  
This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
Oh this is just the way a true love ends  
I don't believe a true love ever ends
