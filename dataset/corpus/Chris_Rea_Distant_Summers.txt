Sweet serenade, in your shade  
May I rest  
Just for a while, won't stay long  
I'll do my best  
To help you help me to find some friends  
That I have lost  
Who lie in lands where memories  
And dreams are lost  
  
The breeze that blew around her hair that day  
The timeless dress that flowed in endless sway  
I almost touched her shoulder, she almost turned to face me  
A thousand distant summers, away
