We are led by the light at the end of the tunnel  
We are guided by the fires of our burning dreams  
We're inspired by our ideals and driven by conscience  
To cross what the cynics perceive as naive  
  
We the people want it straight for a change  
We the people are getting tired of your games  
We the people want the answers laid out on the lines  
No more of your cheap propaganda  
And stop talking tic-tac-toe  
  
We the people fight your arms dealers wars  
We the people want our futures secure  
We the people want a peace staying all the way  
So cut out your message  
And take all your talking tic-tac-toe  
  
Everyone needs a symbol  
If you don't know of the reason  
Well how can you take a stand  
You need to return to an open  
Take a lesson from me  
Take a lesson from me  
That children play tic-tac-toe
