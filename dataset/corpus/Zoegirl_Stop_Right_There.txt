You have never changed your ways  
You think that you can own me like a slave  
And I want to walk away  
But every time I try you're in my face  
You say, I could have it all  
Trust you, you will never let me fall  
And my heart feels bound to your control  
But my spirit says, no, no, no  
  
[Chorus]  
Stop right there  
Suddenly temptation's flying  
Everywhere  
And you think you've got me down  
Well think again, I'm not your friend  
It's plain to see, I'm not your property  
Stop right there  
Suddenly temptation's flying  
Everywhere  
And you think you've got me down  
Well think again, I'm not your friend  
Don't play with me, I'm not your property  
  
Ring! It's you once again  
Begging me to listen to your plan  
But you see I've found the truth  
Cause I have been redeemed and so we're through  
You say, I could have it all  
Trust you, you will never let me fall  
I don't have to give into your demands  
The power's not in your hands  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't have to do anything you want me to  
I don't need you to make me feel like I want more  
Cause God has shown His love is your weakness  
He is above and beyond all you can do  
  
[Chorus: x2]
