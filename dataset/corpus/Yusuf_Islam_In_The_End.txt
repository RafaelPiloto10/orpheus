You can't bargain with the truth  
Cause whether you're right or you're wrong  
We're gonna know what you've done  
We're gonna see where you belong in the end  
  
You can't bargain with the truth  
Cause whether you are black or you're white  
We're gonna know who's right  
We're gonna see you in the light in the end  
  
Oh and every little thing you do  
You better know it's coming back to you  
  
You can't bargain with the truth  
Cause one day you're gonna die  
And good's going high  
And evil's going down in the end  
  
You can't bargain with the truth  
Cause whether you're old or young  
We're gonna see what you've done  
There'll be nowhere else to run in the end  
  
You can't bargain with the truth  
Cause whether you're rich or you're poor  
You're gonna meet at the same door  
You're gonna know the real score in the end  
  
And if you want to help your fellow man  
You better start with what is in your hand  
  
You can't bargain with the truth  
Cause whether you're right or you're wrong  
We're gonna know what you've done  
We're gonna see where you belong in the end  
  
You can't bargain with the truth  
Cause if the world you chose  
No further than your nose  
Will be where the doors will close in the end  
  
You can't bargain with the truth  
Cause for those who were deceived  
There'll be no reprieve  
Or there'll be no time to believe in the end  
  
Oh with every little thing you do  
You better know it's coming back to you  
  
You can't bargain with the truth  
Cause one day you're gonna die  
And good's going high  
And evil's going down in the end
