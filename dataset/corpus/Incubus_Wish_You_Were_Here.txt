I dig my toes into the sand  
The Ocean looks like a thousand diamonds  
Strewn across a blue blanket  
I lean against the wind  
Pretend that I am weightless  
And in this moment I am happy happy)  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
  
I lay my head onto the sand  
The sky resembles a backlit canopy  
With holes punched in it  
I'm counting UFOs  
I signal them with my lighter  
And in this moment I am happy happy)  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
Wish you were here  
  
The worlds a roller coaster  
And I am not strapped in  
Maybe I should hold with care  
But my hands are busy in the air saying)  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were.  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
Wish you were here.
