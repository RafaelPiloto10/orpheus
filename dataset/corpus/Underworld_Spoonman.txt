Watched you cry  
Watched you fly  
Watched you die  
  
I'm the spoonman  
Talks to god

Watched you cry  
Watched you fly  
Watched you die  
  
I'm the spoonman  
She's a wound  
Nice bikini  
Steppin razor  
I'm the spoonman  
She's a wound  
Nice bikini  
Steppin razor  
  
Watched you cry  
Watched you fly  
Watched you die  
  
Don't put your hand  
Where you wouldn't put your face  
She said a dollar rubber rat utah plates  
Brilliant green substance unknown with a face like a peeled onion  
Sheep in drag horseback automatic  
To make your home clean make it sani-flush  
She said now I'm a new skin-free  
Crispy with this urge to phone into  
The nosmoking zone of stainless steel  
Tokyo me and big white dog got  
To hijack pecan tarts for babylon bambi out of mercer street  
Where the crackheads catwalk  
Charity  
Where teenage sex rides a stoned rhythm  
Trading its chiliskins to the screamers come  
To hunt their meat to the gold diggers  
In kissboots and the recycled blondes in theirstack heeled snatches  
The monster trucks the rolling rocks  
The poodle boys  
With their little bone diggers and dark stuff comes oozing out the apple core
tonight  
Like a beggars dog tasting the wind  
  
Into the blood
