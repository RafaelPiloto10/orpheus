Sailors have the seven seas and four strong winds that blow  
Drifters have the next town down the road.  
Gamblers have the chance to bet the ace that's in the hole  
Soldiers have the hope of coming home.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And the flowers have the early April rain,  
Believers have what they have never seen,  
And the dreamers have tomorrow if today does not come true.  
You have eyes that shine, and I have you.  
  
Heroes have their names engraved forever in a stone,  
Hermits have their peace of mind alone.  
Lovers have each other and a small slice of the moon.  
God still bless the child who has his own.  
  
[Chorus x 2]
