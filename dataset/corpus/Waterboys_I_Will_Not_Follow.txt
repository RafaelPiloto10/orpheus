You say that you will carry the torch  
You say that you will beat the winning drum  
You'll be there when the saints roll in  
With a bat made of rubber, half made out of tin  
How many times does the snake crawl out of its skin?  
You change your spots  
But I will not  
  
You say you'll put your trust in that old American flag  
You say there is still no place like home  
That you'll still go to war when your papers come  
Surrender your nerve to a Gatling gun  
Come back home mate  
Tell everyone you'll be happy with the time that you've got  
But I will not  
  
I will not follow! [Repeat: x3]  
  
You say that you'll wear the colors, blue and gray  
You say you'll wear the colors, black and red  
You wear whichever color shines most, bright so  
You can shine like Blake's eternal tiger in the night  
You say that you will carry the torch  
You say that you will beat the winning drum  
You say that there is still no place like home  
No place like home, sweet home  
You say that everyone's gotta change their spots  
But I will not  
No, I will not  
  
I will not follow! [Repeat: x4]  
No!
