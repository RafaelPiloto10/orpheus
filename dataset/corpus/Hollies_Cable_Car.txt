(sylvester)  
Cable car, flying high  
Passing stars or wondering why  
Did she go or did she die  
I don't know  
Mountainside, not so green  
Snow is more than ever seen  
Will she come back in a dream  
I don't know  
Thoughts of her reminding me  
Of a time I couldn't see  
Anything but you and me together  
Colored cloud, on you go  
To a land you may not know  
If you see her  
Tell her I'm so alone  
Verse 4
