Remember me I'm the one who hurt you, dear  
Hurt you, hurt you, dear.  
  
Remember me I'm the one who loved you, dear  
Loved you, loved you, dear.  
  
I'm the one who ran away and left you all alone  
I'm the one who broke your heart and scorned the love I've known.  
  
Remember me I'm the one who's sorry now,  
Sorry, sorry, now.  
  
I'm the one who ran away and left you all alone  
I'm the one who broke your heart and scorned the love I've known.  
  
Remember me I'm the one who's sorry now,  
Sorry, sorry, dear.
