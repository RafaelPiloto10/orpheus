I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana  
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her  
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child  
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
A replay of last night's events roll through my mind  
Except a scene or two erased by sweet red wine  
And I see a truck stop sign ahead, so I change lanes  
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
Operator, won't you put me on through  
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge  
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line  
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time  
  
Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine  
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time  
But until then, I'll spend my money up right down to my last dime  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
Operator, won't you put me on through  
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge  
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line  
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
Sweet Baton Rouge
