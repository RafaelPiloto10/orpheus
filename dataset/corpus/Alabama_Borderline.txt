In a cloud of dust cross Texas, south of San Antone  
The lawman and the cowboy pushed their horses on  
Racin' toward the Rio running out of time  
They had to catch the outlaws before they crossed the borderline.  
  
Well, the lawman wanted justice the cowboy revenge  
They tracked the Outlaws' horses up to the river's edge  
And there across the Rio a badge ain't worth a dime  
The law was in their own hands once they crossed the borderline.  
  
So they ride to the desert wind down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back  
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline  
  
In the safety of the badlands the outlaws stopped their run  
The campfire rings with laughter of evil things they've done  
How they'd taken all they wanted and killed the cowboy's wife  
And knew no one would follow them, cross the borderline.  
  
The lawman and the cowboys stepped out of the dark  
And it was two against the twenty and every bullet found its mark  
And so goes the legend that out there in the night  
The two still ride together somewhere beyond the borderline.  
  
So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back  
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline.  
  
They ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back.  
  
They ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back
