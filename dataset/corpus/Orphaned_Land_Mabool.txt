Hebrew lyrics (1)  
  
May the lord eternal save his troubled child  
As he passes through rain and storm  
Behind the walls of this hallowed ark of wood  
Our prophets found a revelation, which they have understood  
Onto the lands of fearful heaven comes a flood erasing all  
Landing as if a ruthless bird of prey to crush all human souls  
  
The lighting colors the sky with flames of light  
Hell shines above us and the fires bright  
Erasing the works of the common man, all we hold dear is set alight  
  
Hebrew lyrics (2)  
  
Shattered glass reflects this shattered world barren is the landscape here  
Thunder roars as a lion caged, heat that comes like waves of fear  
Oceans rise and rage as we watch the world powers fall  
Redeeming their sinful ways with their souls  
May the truth fill their hearts, let them see the light, when they embrace
their gods  
  
Hebrew lyrics (3)  
  
Seas cover the works of timeless art  
That once brought joy to human hearts  
In halls of infamy this day shall live  
Like the burning of rome and betrayal of Eve  
Like the fire raised at the witches' stakes  
  
Return all earthly possessions  
As ashes you return to earth, child of God, to face the divine lord who sits
upon the throne - eyes sad  
Go in peace and thy faith  
Evolve thy self and lose all hate  
So a heaven you may create  
  
In this world of sorrowful ways  
None shall live to see the light of day  
Some may survive to tell this tale  
If their belief shall conquer this gale  
Damnation is the punishment bestowed  
El Norra Alila the vengeful God
