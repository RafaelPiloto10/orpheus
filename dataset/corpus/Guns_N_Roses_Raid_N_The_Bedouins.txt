Raid N' the Bedouins  
Had a plan, and thought they'd win  
But I don't give a fuck 'bout them  
Cause I am crazy  
  
Oh, my salvation  
N' all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
No one had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh  
  
Raid N' the Bedouins  
Say that's a war that you can't win  
But I have had enough of them  
And who can blame me  
  
Sands of time and desert winds  
Nomads and Barbarians  
I won't bend my will to them  
You aggravate me  
  
Oh, my salvation  
N' all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
No one had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh

Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh  
  
Oh, sweet salvation  
N' all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
If you ignore this world  
Somewhere in time  
When will I, get there?  
  
Oh, sweet salvation  
And my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
If you had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh  
  
Raid N' the Bedouins  
Had a plan, and thought they'd win  
  
Raid N' the Bedouins  
Crossed the line and lost again
