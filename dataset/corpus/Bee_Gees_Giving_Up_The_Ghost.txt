One, two  
There's a young girl lost on the edge of town,  
Don't see no future, it's blind.  
Don't give up when you're upside down,  
You just keep it inside.  
  
You know we all cry when we're alone,  
Someone like you  
And the promise that we won't be.  
  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost  
Never you and I  
Giving up the ghost.  
  
Giving up the ghost  
We can never stop  
Giving up the ghost.  
  
Don't be a hero in the name of love,  
Don't leave me waiting in line.  
No ties that bind, no ball and chain,  
The ghost is waiting outside.  
  
I'm searching so high,  
I'm searching low  
Someone like you.  
Baby, I'm not  
  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost  
Never you and I  
Giving up the ghost.  
  
Giving up the ghost  
We can never stop  
Giving up the ghost.  
  
You know we all cry when we are alone,  
Someone like you, we know oh,  
I'm searching so high,  
I'm searching low,  
Someone like you,  
We know oh, oh, oh.  
  
Giving up the ghost  
Giving up the ghost  
Never you and I  
Giving up the ghost.  
Giving up the ghost
