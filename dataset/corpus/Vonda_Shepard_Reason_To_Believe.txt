If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
Someone like you makes it hard to live without  
Somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give  
Never think about myself  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
Someone like you makes it hard to live without  
Somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give  
Never think about myself
