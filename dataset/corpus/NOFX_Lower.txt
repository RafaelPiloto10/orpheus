I will never feel the ribbon break  
I will never taste sweet victory  
I don't want to leave the rest behind  
I don't want inscription on a plaque  
  
Never first or second place  
I won't ever run your rat race  
I will always be lower than you  
I won't be your competition, lowest  
Totem pole position is where I'd rather  
Stay than be like you  
  
I don't feel the animal instinct  
I am not on top of the food chain  
The only battle I will fiercely fight  
Is one that hibernates inside my head  
  
Be the best, climb the ladder  
Do it better, higher, faster  
I refuse to participate  
If I go up it will be slow I'm bringing  
Everyone I know and stopping on the  
Sixth of seventh rung  
  
On a pedestal, isn't the veiw great  
You better watch your step cause it's  
A nasty fall, when no one's there to  
Catch you when you call
