I know the night is silent I'll be insane  
Got to find a new place where I can hide from the rain  
I'll wait for the weekend to get wasted and then  
Gonna get on up so I can fall down again  
  
Party down, party down, party down  
  
This world is crazy, everybody party down  
  
You bring the bottle baby I'll bring the glass  
I'll be the animal,you can be the class  
I know that memory that can shed us some light  
This kind of magic keeps me flyin' all night  
  
Party down, party down, party down  
  
This world is crazy, let's all party down  
  
I'm just tryin' to feel better  
I just want to feel better  
Don't waste your life away  
Eeverybody party down  
  
Gonna shimmer my shoes on down to the red dog saloon  
Just waitin' for the sunset to give way to the moon  
Been sleepin' all day so I can party all night  
Hallucinating at the northern lights  
  
Party down, party down, party down
