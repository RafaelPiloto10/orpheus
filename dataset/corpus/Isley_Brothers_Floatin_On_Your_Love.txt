Do you want to float on, yeah  
Do you want to float, yeah  
  
Float on, float on, float all your love  
Float on, float on, float all your love  
  
I call my baby's name  
She gives me everything  
She takes me higher and higher  
She plays with my desire  
She knows my pleasures on  
And works it all night long  
Her love is slow and slick  
Told me don't come too quick  
  
Every day I pray our love  
Floats on and on and on  
Hear me calling out to you girl  
It's all that I can do girl  
  
Float on, float on, float all your love  
Float on, float on, float all your love  
  
I know what's on his mind  
He wants it all the time  
He's always at my door  
Keeps asking me for more  
Says he can't get enough  
Sometimes he likes a rub  
Ya know I'm gonna treat him right  
Gonna do it day and night  
  
Every day I pray our love  
Floats on and on and on  
Hear me calling out to you boy  
That's all that I can do boy  
  
Float on, float on, float all your love  
Float on, float on, float all your love  
  
Float on, float on, float all your love  
Float on, float on, float all your love  
  
Do you want to float on  
Do you want to float on  
  
Float on, float on, float all your love  
Float on, float on, float all your love
