Little girl don't you want to stay?  
I want to be your lover man  
All by myself  
All by myself  
  
I don't need no one to love you  
I'm gonna love you all by myself  
  
You'll find, little girl, you know it too,  
Don't you know I'm in love with you  
All by myself  
All by myself.  
  
I don't want no one to love you  
I want to love you all by myself  
  
Meet me in the parlor 'bout half past one,  
We'll go on down and have some fun  
All by ourselves,  
All by ourselves,  
We don't need nobody with us  
We gonna do it all by ourselves.
