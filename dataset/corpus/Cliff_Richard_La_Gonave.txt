La Gonave I see your mist  
La Gonave well I know you're kissed  
By the same sea of trouble  
That stretches back home  
La Gonave  
You've got troubles of your own  
  
Yes I got troubles  
Won't you come on and see  
I got my needs just follow me  
But they gonna ease by and by  
If you tell all the people  
That it's no lie  
  
You only came for forty eight hours  
Didn't realize how useless I was  
Came to you for the nation sells lies  
Lord knows but I still feel helpless  
  
La Gonave I don't feel good  
La Gonave do you think I should  
Turn my back and walk away  
La Gonave tell me what to say  
  
If I'd been at home  
Would you telephone me  
I'm situated across the sea  
But it's a small world from any point  
Of view  
Spare a thought  
This could have been you  
  
You shook my senses  
Took my time  
Froze my feeling  
Broke my mind  
La Gonave you've played your part  
La Gonave you sure got heart  
  
Didn't leave my heart in San Francisco  
Didn't want to stay in Omaha  
Never got fooled by New York city  
But I lost my heart to la Gonave  
  
Didn't leave my heart in San Francisco  
Didn't want to stay in Omaha  
Never got fooled by New York city  
But I lost my heart to la Gonave  
  
Didn't leave my heart in San Francisco  
Didn't want to stay in Omaha  
Never got fooled by New York city  
But I lost my heart to la Gonave
