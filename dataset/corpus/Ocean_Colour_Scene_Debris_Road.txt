She nails down moon beams  
And talks in double time  
Stumbling down to wherever she goes  
I live in the meantime  
And I get frustrated  
So I put my wager on Debris Road  
  
[Chorus]  
It keeps me running down Debris Road  
I'm not scared but it's somewhere I cling to  
All the places I (still) want to go  
They won't cast a shadow on my Debris Road  
  
I get frustrated looking for moonbeams  
They always fall where I never go  
'Cause I like the daylight and I like a good life  
Running so fast down Debris Road  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someone got moon-faced and someone gets tearful  
Talking so much that they really don't know  
Sitting up all night singing songs 'till daylight  
Striking a match with the devil below  
  
[Chorus]
