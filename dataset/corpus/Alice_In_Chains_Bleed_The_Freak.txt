My cup runneth over  
Like blood from a stone  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
  
When the pig runs slower  
Let the arrow fly  
When the sin lies bolder  
I'll pluck out thine eye  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
  
If you scorn my lover  
Satan got your thigh  
If you steal in hunger  
I will kick you when you try  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
"all these things that you've done for me,  
Have left me so  
Fucking tired  
  
I'm not saying that you haven't done a lot of good,  
But if there's one thing you can do,  
You can bleed for me, bleed for me"  
  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me
