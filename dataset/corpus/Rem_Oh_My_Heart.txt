The kids have a new take  
A new take on faith  
Pick up the pieces  
Get carried away  
  
I came home to a city half-erased  
I came home to face  
What we faced  
This place needs me here to start  
This place is the beat of my heart  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
(Oh my heart)  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
(Oh my heart)  
  
The storm didn't kill me  
The government changed  
Hear the answer and call, hear this song re-arranged  
Hear the trees, the ghosts and the buildings sing  
With the wisdom to reconcile this thing  
  
It's sweet  
And it's sad  
And it's true  
How it doesn't look bitter on you  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
(Oh my heart)  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
(Oh my heart)  
  
Mother and father  
I stand beside you  
The good of this world might help see me through  
This place needs me here to start  
This place is the beat of my heart  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
(Oh my heart)  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
(Oh my heart)  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
(Oh my heart)  
  
Oh my heart  
Oh my heart  
(Oh my heart)
