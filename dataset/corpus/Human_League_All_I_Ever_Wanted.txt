What are you going to say and what are you going to do ?  
What are you going to say and what are you going to do ?  
Too good  
You could  
Be so misunderstood  
Snow pure  
Demure  
Don't feel so insecure  
Heaven would be lonely without you  
You satisfy the need in me  
No-one makes me feel the way you do  
  
What are you going to say and what are you going to do ?  
What are you going to say and what are you going to do ?  
Maligned  
You'll find  
A strength to ease your mind  
Trust fate  
Relate  
This trial you'll tolerate  
Summer would be bitter without you  
You satisfy the need in me  
Sunshine couldn't warm me like you do  
Devotion's what you read in read  
  
All I ever wanted  
Was to be with you just to be with you  
All I ever wanted  
Just to be with you to be free with you  
Review

From now
