I try so hard I don't know what to do  
I'm gonna lose my mind if I can't have you  
The brake lights are on and nobody's home  
I can hear you talking on the telephone  
And my baby has the blues again  
Somehow they just seem to hit him  
And I'm breaking up again with another long term boyfriend  
  
I believe that you're leaving  
And I believe you're already gone  
You're already gone  
  
If you can't find love, you've gotta find a method  
Of learning to live in the world today  
I don't know what it was that I expected  
I guess I'm a fool to want perfection  
And I'm breaking up again with another long term boyfriend  
  
I believe that you're leaving  
And I believe you're already gone  
I better believe what I'm seeing  
'Cause I believe that it's so long  
It's so long (as in "see ya")  
  
I try so hard I don't know what to do  
It's obvious I won't end up with you  
The brake lights are on and it's so clear  
You can't pretend you want to be here  
This train of thought has arrived at the station  
We don't need anymore contemplation  
And I'm breaking up again with another long term boyfriend
