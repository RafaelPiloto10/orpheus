Wanna see my passin' flames?  
Don't waste a drop, baby, I ain't first  
Where I was born, no escape  
There ain't even no good bad drugs  
In the city, is it true?  
If you don't, you act like you do  
Feast of fools, I can't wait  
Give 'em a taste of my misfit love  
  
Complicate  
Incarcerate  
Feel my heart wake up?  
  
Ain't born to lose, baby  
I'm born to win  
I'm so goddamn sick, baby, it's a sin  
It's a sin  
  
Transforming is becoming...  
Transforming is becoming on me  
  
Do me first, do your worst  
Gimme what I want some of  
One-track mind, no time to waste  
  
Sidewalks, feel me strut so good  
Gutter, don't forget this face  
Let 'em taste my misfit love  
I'll show you all my dirty tricks  
Then show 'em again I'm so proud of 'em  
It's cruel to be constantly  
Feel my heart play dumb  
  
Ain't born to lose, baby  
I'm born to win  
I'm so sick, baby, it's a sin  
It's a sin  
  
Just a dead man, walking through the dead of night  
And if you're going anywhere tonight...  
Just a dead end walking through the dead of night  
And if you are going, can I get a ride?  
Just a dead man walking through the dead of night  
It's impossible to wait until the light  
'Cause I'm already gone  
If you bet on me, you've won  
'Cause I'm already gone  
If you bet on me, you've won  
'Cause I'm already gone  
If you bet on me, you've won  
'Cause I'm already gone  
If you bet on me, you've won
