Baby, look across the street  
I know that you're alone  
I've been waiting out in the dark  
That surrounds your home  
'Cause after midnight I'll be calling  
C'mon, answer the phone  
And baby, you know there's no getaway  
I belong with you  
I'll be calling every night and day  
'Till you want me too  
Baby, I've seen every movie  
That you've ever made  
Now I'm waiting  
I know all the parts  
That you've ever played  
And baby, you know there's no getaway  
I belong with you  
I'll be calling every night and day  
'Till you want me too  
Oh baby, do you read my letters  
I'm so excited about you  
But I'm still waiting, I've had no reply  
What about our rendezvous?  
'Cause after midnight  
Ooh, while you're sleeping  
You know I'm looking for you  
And baby, you know there's no getaway  
I belong with you  
I'll be calling every night and day  
'Till you want me too
