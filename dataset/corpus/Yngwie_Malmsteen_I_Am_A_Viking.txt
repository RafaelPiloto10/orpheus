I am a Viking in going out to war  
And I've got death upon my mind  
As I was leavin' oh yesterday  
I've got no fear in my heart  
  
As the shores of my home disappear  
I sail over the sea without fear  
Dragon ships are charging through the waves  
Just want to sail away into the sea yeah yeah  
  
I am a warrior my mind is set to kill  
Life or death is on the line  
I am a slayer and you will taste my steel  
I've got your life right in my hand  
  
As the shores of my home disappear  
I sail over the sea without fear  
Dragon ships are charging through the waves  
Just want to sail away into the sea yeah yeah  
  
You are a loser and it's such a shame  
That you're a fool and you don't know  
That in a viking I'll walk all over you  
And by my sword you will die  
  
As the shores of my home disappear  
I sail over the sea without fear  
Dragon ships are charging through the waves  
Just want to sail away into the sea yeah yeah
