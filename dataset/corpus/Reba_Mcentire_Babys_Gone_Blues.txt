I feel the blues coming on  
Cause I feel you being gone  
It's something I wish I could lose  
Baby's gone blues  
  
There ain't no sunshine in sight  
Cause you're gonna leave me tonight  
My heart is sure feeling bruised  
Baby's gone blues  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, love has gone wrong  
It's so hard on my heart going from good into gone  
There ain't no easy way back into nights before you  
Baby's gone blues  
Baby's gone blues  
  
It's like a razor on me  
Knowing you want to be free  
I'm standing here feeling used  
Baby's gone blues  
  
There ain't no dreams coming true  
I won't recover from you  
There ain't no heartache like you  
Baby's gone blues  
  
[Chorus]
