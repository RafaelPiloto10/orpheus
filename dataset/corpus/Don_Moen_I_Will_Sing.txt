Lord, You seem so far away  
A million miles or more, it feels today  
And though I haven't lost my faith  
I must confess right now  
That it's hard for me to pray  
But I don't know what to say  
And I don't know where to start  
But as You give the grace  
With all that's in my heart  
I will sing, yes, I will praise, even in my darkest hour  
Through the sorrow and the pain  
I will sing, I will praise, lift my hands to honor You  
Because Your word is true, I will sing  
Lord it's hard for me to see all the thoughts  
And plans You have for me, yes it is  
But I will put my trust in You  
Lord we made Your die to set me free  
Oh thank God You did  
But I don't know what to say  
And I don't know where to start  
But as you give the grace  
With all that's in my heart  
I will sing, I will praise, even in my darkest hour  
Through the sorrow and the pain  
I will sing, I will praise, lift my hands to honor You  
Because Your word is true  
I will sing, I will praise, even in my darkest hour  
Through the sorrow and the pain  
I will sing, I will praise, lift my hands to honor You  
Because Your word is true, I will sing, I will sing, I will sing  
Oh, we sing to You Lord  
Oh, we sing to You Lord tonight  
Halleluiah, we sing to You Lord  
Oh, we lift our voices and sing to You  
Worship You Lord, we sing to You Lord  
We sing, we sing, We sing, we sing  
Oh, we worship you Lord, oh, thank You Lord  
I will sing, oh yes I will, I will sing
