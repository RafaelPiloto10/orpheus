Shower in the dark day  
Clean sparks diving down  
Cool in the waterway  
Where the baptized drown  
Naked in the cold sun  
Breathing life like fire  
Thought I was the only one  
But that was just a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I heard it in the wind  
And I saw it in the sky  
And I thought it was the end  
And I thought it was the 4th of July  
  
Pale in the flare light  
The scared light cracks and disappears  
And leads the scorched ones here  
And everywhere no one cares  
The fire is spreading  
And no one wants to speak about it  
Down in the hole  
Jesus tries to crack a smile  
Beneath another shovel load  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'm in control  
Now I'm in the fall out  
Once asleep but now I stand  
And I still remember  
Your sweet everything  
Light a roman candle  
And hold it in your hand  
  
[Chorus]
