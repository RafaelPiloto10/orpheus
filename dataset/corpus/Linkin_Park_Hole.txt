I would have sailed away  
If I'd known that nothing would change  
Staring out my window sill  
In my wasted prison cell  
  
And I know what you want  
And I know what you fear  
As I cradle your loving  
And watch you disappear  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I feel your heartbeat  
Pounding in my head  
I like to control you  
Cause I can't control myself  
Myself  
  
Rain,  
Come my way  
Mold my head  
Like a ball of clay  
Softly wither into my grave  
Never to see, the sun again  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
All alone in a crowd by myself  
So sorry, wish I could find a way  
Back into your hole again  
But I've become your enemy  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Hole  
  
(Diffrent is good)
