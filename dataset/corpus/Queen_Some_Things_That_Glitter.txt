Once I loved a butterfly  
Don't wonder how, don't ask me why  
But I believed what I'd been told  
All things that glitter can't be gold, ooh yeah  
All things that glitter can't be gold  
Those jealous minds conspired to say  
Just let that creature fly away  
How can it be she has it all?  
Her pride is headed for a fall, ooh yeah  
All things that glitter can't be gold  
Oh Lord, what races we run  
Seeking our place in the sun  
Reaching and hoping  
We'll find the right one  
Now every day a new joy waits  
My butterfly grew golden wings  
It seems we find as we grow old  
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah  
Some things that glitter may be gold  
So let us mind what's there to see  
Before our hearts become too cold  
In spite of all that we've been told  
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah  
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah  
Some things that glitter may be gold
