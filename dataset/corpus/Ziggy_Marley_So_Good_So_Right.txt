This one is special for all the ladies  
You never know I was that type of man  
So good so right so good so, so good so  
Right so good so  
So good so right so good so, so good so  
Right so good so  
  
[Chorus]  
Feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
Feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
Feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
Feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
  
But you keep on watching the time,  
Wondering what's on my mind  
So you say you can't stay too long, cause  
You know what I'm all about  
What I'm all about, what I'm all about  
I don't have to sing and shout, what I'm  
All about  
You know what I'm all about  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes it's the truth it's the fact, I'm coming  
To you straight from  
The back in a mastering room style  
Don't be shy, don't you lie, look into my  
Eye  
I'll tell you why, I'll teach you about  
Feeling high  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never before have you seen this, so I say  
This feeling sink within my head, oh yea,  
Oh yea  
Never before have you believe it, so I mean  
What I say  
You just got to be yourself  
  
Feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
Yea, feel so good about something so  
Right could it last another night  
A feel so good about something so right  
A feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
So good so right so good so, so good so  
Right so good so  
So good so right so good s, so good so  
Right so good so  
  
Yes it is the strife of my life, to explain  
What's in my brain  
If you believe what I say, baby, baby  
A check in, check in, check check, check in  
Check in  
Check in, check in, check in, a check in,  
Check in, check into my hotel  
  
A feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
A feel so good about something so right  
Could it last another night  
So good, so right, so good, so right, so  
Good, so right  
So right, I feel so good could it last  
Another night  
  
A feel so right could it last another  
Night  
A feel so good something so right, so  
Good  
Lord, I said I feel so right  
A feel so good, oh could it last another  
Night  
A feel so right, oh could it last another  
Night  
A feel so good oh could it last another  
Night  
A feel so right oh could it last another  
Night  
So good, o right, so good, so right, so  
Good, so good, so right
