I heard that she's back in town  
Heard she's been seen around  
I hear she gets  
What she wants everytime  
  
I know what she put you through  
I know what you'd like to do  
'Cause I lost my heart  
To her sometime ago  
  
So come on  
Wipe your tears away  
It's all that you can do  
A broken heart never mends  
  
Crying tears til the very end  
At home on the boulevard  
Cheap whiskey and tarot cards  
Man she's outrageous  
  
She wants the best in life  
Sugar daddies with agin' wives  
She's expensive everything she does  
So come on  
  
Wipe your tears away  
It's all that you can do  
A broken heart never mends  
Crying tears til the very end  
  
She knows what it must be like  
Living in paradise  
If you ain't got money she don't want to know  
I know what she put you through  
  
I know what you'd like to do  
I lost my heart to her sometime ago  
So come on  
Wipe your tears away  
  
It's all that you can do  
When you've got a broken heart  
Come on  
Wipe your tears away  
  
It's all that you can do  
Oh yeah
