In the early mornin' rain  
With a dollar in my hand  
And an achin' in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
  
I'm a long way from home  
And I miss my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big 707 set to roll  
But I'm stuck here on the ground  
Where the pavement never grows  
  
The liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
Well there she goes, my friend  
She's movin' out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wings on high  
She's away and westward bound  
High above the clouds she'll fly  
  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines.  
She'll be flyin' o'er my home  
In about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down  
Ain't no earthly good to me  
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
  
You can't hop a jet plane  
The way you can a freight train  
So I'll just be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain  
  
You can't hop a jet plane  
The way you can a freight train  
So I'll just be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain
