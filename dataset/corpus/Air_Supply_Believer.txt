Believer  
I got no where to go  
Believer  
The only one I know  
Between us I'm the stranger  
Who never does the things that people do  
I let it through  
  
  
Believer  
We always seem to shine  
Believer  
You're always reaching high  
  
  
And I'm just drifting  
You understand the problems passing through  
I'm still with you  
It's like a storybook romance  
Everything is so right with the prince in the trees  
Waiting underneath the window for you  
Any moment he'll sing you a melody  
When you're hard and start a life on your own  
If you always knew the ending had to come true  
  
  
Believer  
I've got a troubled mind  
Believer  
We've got to break it down  
Somewhere inside is a weakness  
That wants to be discovered  
Just like you  
I'll help you too  
  
  
It's like reading a storybook romance  
Everything is so right with the prince in the trees  
Waiting underneath the window for you  
Any moment he'll sing you a melody  
When your hard and start a life on your own  
If you always knew the ending had to come true  
  
  
Believer  
We always seem to shine  
Believer  
You're always reaching high  
  
  
And if you're just drifting  
You understand the problems passing through  
I'm still with you  
Believer  
Believer  
Believer...
