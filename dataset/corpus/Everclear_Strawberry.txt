Never been here never coming back  
Never want to think about the things  
That happened today  
Want to lay down on the warm ground  
I think I'm going to need  
A little time to myself  
Don't fall down now  
You will never get up  
Don't fall down now  
I ask you for a slow ride  
Going nowhere  
You look like Satan  
You ask me if I want to get high  
Couple of bags down in old town  
You tie your arm and  
Ask me if I wanted to drive  
Don't fall down now  
You will never get up  
Don't fall down now  
Last thing I recall  
I was in the air  
I woke up on the street  
Crawling with my strawberry burns  
Ten long years in a straight line  
They fall like water  
Yes, I guess I fucked up again  
Don't fall down now  
You will never get up  
Don't fall down now
