Lying on the bed I say  
Everybody feels this way  
But anybody else, and me  
And are you worried about the way you know  
You're worried about your fancy clothes  
But anybody else, believe  
  
Not afraid  
I'm not alone  
I'm just hanging on way too long  
Let me out, let me in  
Oh let me stumble when I fall  
You noticed me, I noticed you  
But it's the simple things I feel you knew  
Let me out, let me in, again  
  
And are you worried about how I feel you know  
Funny I've been hit to know  
But anybody else, believe  
And are you going on you know you say  
I'm bleeding blood of yesterday  
But anybody else oh, believe  
  
Not afraid  
I'm not alone  
I'm just hanging on way too long  
Let me out, let me in  
Let me stumble when I fall  
You noticed me, I noticed you  
But it's the feeling that I feel you knew  
Let me out, let me in, again  
  
Let me out, let me in  
Let me know I feel you when  
You wanted more  
You wanted this  
You wanted more  
More more more  
More more more  
More more more  
  
Let me say, Let me know  
Let me feel I know you'd fall  
You wanted more  
You wanted this  
You wanted simple things I miss  
Well again, again  
  
It's like the sky is falling down  
It's like the weigh in the ground  
It's like the sight in the night  
Like the feeling, but I am just alright  
I know, I know, and I know  
  
Not afraid  
I'm not alone  
I'm just a hanging on way too long  
Let me out, let me in  
Let me stumble when I fall  
You noticed me, I noticed you  
But it's the simple things I...  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that...
