She's like death on two legs  
She is raw pink shame  
Please stop the God film  
It's all wrong  
But I'm not to blame  
  
These boys of image  
Carry banners  
Believe in slogans  
Kill policeman  
  
Say it's 'freedom'  
Say it's 'goodness'  
Say it's 'peaceful'  
I'm lonely  
I'm feeling down (everyone I know has been and gone)  
  
It's such a sick picture  
She says 'i cure everyone'  
I'm alone in a corner  
I won't ever forgive  
I must be broken  
I don't know  
Who on earth can I blame?
