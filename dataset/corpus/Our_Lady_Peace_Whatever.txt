There's no holding me back  
I'm not driven by fear  
I'm just driven by anger  
And you're under attack  
I'm just climbing up slowly  
I'm the one and only  
The tease, the way you lie  
The stumble in your mind  
The fear, the hope inside  
They hit here  
Hit here  
  
But whatever you need  
'Ever you got  
'Ever you want  
I'll take back again  
Whatever you need  
'Ever you got  
'Ever you want  
  
I'll take back again  
There's no holding me back  
I'm not driven by fear  
I'm just driven by anger  
And you're under attack  
I'm just climbing up slowly  
I'm the one and only  
The tease, the way you lie  
The stumble in your mind  
The fear, the hope inside  
  
They hit here  
Hit here  
But whatever you need  
'Ever you got  
'Ever you want  
I'll take back again  
Whatever you need  
  
'Ever you got  
'Ever you want  
I'll take back again  
Though whatever you need  
'Ever you got  
  
But whatever you need  
'Ever you got  
'Ever you want  
I'll take back again  
Whatever you need  
'Ever you got  
'Ever you want  
  
I'll take back again  
Whatever you need  
'Ever you got  
'Ever you want  
I'll take back again  
But whatever you need  
'Ever you got  
  
Whatever you oh oh  
Whatever you oh oh oh oh  
Whatever you oh oh  
Whatever you oh oh oh oh
