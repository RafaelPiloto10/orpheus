When you won't go along  
Some will feel like you can't find your way  
Heaven knows  
Heaven knows I've seen it all before  
Now don't get me wrong  
I've seen many a life gone astray  
When someone goes  
All your bows won't make it any better so let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
Shut up and take it like a man  
You need us to get a life  
For your own good we'll take you by the hand  
'Cause you need a little more  
  
Maybe no one will say it  
Maybe no one's aware it goes on  
All I know  
All I know it's like going off the deep end  
Could you make a decision?  
Could you think for yourself and go on?  
Everyone knows  
Everyone knows you've got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Close your eyes  
Look away now  
Make believe while you can  
So you'd best go along  
Don't let on if you can't find your way  
Many more  
Many more do it for you  
Because heaven knows  
Heaven knows it's like playing with fire  
Your life's a throw  
  
[Chorus]
