Your heart is my need  
And I love what it means to succeed  
As your fate is my prize  
Love you're breathe in me  
It's what keeps me alive  
Hold on 'till forever is gone  
Hold on to whatever it takes  
To go on and on and on, oh baby  
  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
The love that we make is all in the way that we live  
The way that we live  
  
In my dreams I can fly  
In your arms, there's no earth, no sky  
There's one truth, no lies  
There's no distance between us  
Just trust in our lives  
Hold on 'till forever is gone  
Hold on to whatever it takes to go on and on, oh baby  
  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
The love that we make is all in the way that we live  
The way that we live, the way that we live  
  
In our lives there's so much useless information  
The truth is as simple as the air that we breathe  
So many souls with the need for human affirmation  
You and I choose to believe we are free!  
  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
The paths that we take it's all in the way that we live  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
This is the way that we live
