I don't want to  
Go on without you  
It's so bad to be alone  
Oh baby come home  
I need you  
My room is so blue  
I keep seein' your face  
Oh, every place  
Here in the gloom  
Of my lonely room  
I hold her memories  
And smell her sweet perfume  
I can't stand to  
Live on without you  
Oh my darlin' hear my plea  
C'mon back to me  
Here in the gloom  
Of my lonely room  
I hold her memories  
And smell her sweet perfume  
I can't stand to  
Live on without you  
Oh my darlin' hear my plea  
C'mon back to me  
I can't stand to  
Go on without you  
Oh my darlin' hear my plea  
Go on without you  
Can't stand to (no, no, no, no,)  
Go on without you  
Oh my darlin' hear my plea  
Go on without you  
I can't stand to
