I'm keeping an eye on the future, an eye on the past  
And the present in my pocket, just in case I need a door  
Into a brave new world where all solutions  
End up with my head buried to my neck in sand  
  
Enough, enough  
  
Bowing down to disillusion  
Hats off and applause to rogues and evolution  
The ripple effect is too good not to mention  
If you're not affected, you're not paying attention  
It?s too good, too good, not to have an effect  
  
I'm keeping an eye on the pulse, an ear to the track  
And penance in a locket, dropping from the highest floor  
When it hits ground I watch it smash to pieces  
Songs of liberation echo from the dust, the dust  
  
Enough  
  
Bowing down to disillusion  
Hats off and applause to rogues and evolution  
The ripple effect is too good not to mention  
If you're not affected, you're not paying attention  
It?s too good, too good, not to have an effect  
  
Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough  
Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough  
  
Bowing down to disillusion  
Hats off and applause to rogues and revolution  
The ripple effect is too good not to mention  
If you're not affected, you're not paying attention  
It?s too good, too good, too good, yeah
