Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there  
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair  
Picked up a pencil and wrote "I love you" in my finest hand  
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand  
  
Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new  
All alone in California and talking to you  
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned  
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand  
  
Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green  
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream  
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can  
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand  
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
