Last time I was sober, man I felt bad  
Worst hangover that I ever had  
It took six hamburgers and scotch all night  
Nicotine for breakfast just to put me right  
'cause if you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool, you got to run  
On heavy, heavy fuel  
  
My life makes perfect sense  
Lust and food and violence  
Sex and money are my major kicks  
Get me in a fight I like dirty tricks  
'cause if you want to run cool  
Yes if you want to run cool, you got to run  
On heavy, heavy fuel  
  
My chick loves a man who's strong  
The things she'll do to turn me on  
I love the babes, don't get me wrong  
Hey, that's why I wrote this song  
  
I don't care if my liver is hanging by a thread  
Don't care if my doctor says I ought to be dead  
When my ugly big car won't climb this hill  
I'll write a suicide note on a hundred dollar bill  
'cause if you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool  
Yes if you want to run cool, you got to run  
On heavy, heavy fuel
