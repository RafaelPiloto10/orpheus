One o'clock in the morning,  
People piling into the door.  
Drinks are still coming in and  
I'm barely humming and the  
Audience is screaming for more.  
Somebody's locked in the bathroom,  
Manager can't find the key.  
I pay that man but from where I stand,  
It's looking like a prisoner is me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So won't you kick it in second wind  
We got two more hours to go.  
Is there anymore hope of scoring anymore coke,  
And we've still got to do another show.  
  
My mind started to wander,  
In the middle of the second song  
Dreaming I was at sea, just my baby and me  
When the words started coming out wrong.  
Waitresses are picking up glasses,  
The bartender screamed last call.  
When I looked to my right I saw a terrible sight  
And the bass man took a bad fall.  
  
It's three o'clock in the morning,  
Running on adrenalin.  
What I'm trying to say is that tomorrow's the day  
And we've got to do it over again.
