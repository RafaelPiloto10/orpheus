And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
Steals across the meadow of my heart.  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday  
The music of the years gone by.  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights  
Dreaming of a song.  
The melody haunts my reverie.  
And I am once again with you  
When our love was new.  
And each kiss, an inspiration.  
  
But that was long ago.  
And now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song.  
  
Beside a garden wall where stars are bright  
You are in my arms.  
A nightingale sings its fairy tale  
Of paradise where roses bloom.  
  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
That stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain.
