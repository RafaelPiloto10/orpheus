I wonder if my rope's still hanging from the tree  
By the standing pool where you drank me  
And filled me full of thirsty love  
And the memory of water?  
  
I wonder if a king still fishes there  
His back towards the burned-out air  
His laughing catches singing loud  
The memory of water  
  
Your taste is blood and ecstasy  
But I must drink you all alone  
You're freckled like a speckled egg  
A dove, but this bird has flown  
O stay with me sweet memory  
O stay with me  
  
I wonder if my rope's still hanging from the tree  
By the standing pool where you drank me  
As pain flows through me like champagne  
Of the memory of water
