We can make that taxi, go tell it right now  
Adjust the rear view, oh that's the clear view

Ringing my wing til that thing get bigger  
Curve like a trigger, wanna cut you like a scissor  
That's it, baby nearer, I love your high side  
From the back you're a winner  
Thick skirts, thick get it feda prime dinner  
Get it, twerk it, shake it till my knee cap shiver, yeah

Both cheeks shaking at the same damn time  
Shorty be my lady, can't replace that wine  
Presidential status
