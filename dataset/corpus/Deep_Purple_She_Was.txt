She was she was  
She was all that she said she was  
She was all that she said she was  
I couldn't want for more  
But all I want is more  
I just want her more and more  
And more and more and more  
But she's untouchable  
  
And I lay my head down  
I lay my head down  
And then she's lovable  
  
Who were you with last night?  
Who were you with last night?  
Were you thinking of me?  
And were you thinking of me?  
Unforgivable sin unforgivable sin  
Unforgivable  
You're untouchable  
  
And I lay my head down  
I lay my head down  
  
She coming my way  
She coming my way  
I don't know what to say  
She coming my way  
She fading away  
She fading away  
And I lay my head down  
I lay my head down
