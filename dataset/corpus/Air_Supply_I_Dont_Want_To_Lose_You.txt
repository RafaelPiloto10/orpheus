(graham russell)  
I called on you today  
I know it's late to say I'm sorry  
There's so much on my mind  
I feel as though the time is upon me  
Do you know you take my heart through the door  
Are there words to tell you what I live for  
(chorus)  
I don't want to lose you  
I don't want to lose you  
I don't want to lose you  
  
Let me dry your eyes  
Is this the last time I can hold you?  
There's hope in this soul  
And words that will tread where you go to  
  
Is it true, you are leaving what you believe  
Part of you, will always be with me  
  
(chorus)  
You have the hand that I need to get by  
Understand what it is that's turning me down  
  
(chorus)  
Is it true, you are leaving what you believe  
Part of you, will always be with me  
  
(chorus)
