(G) I dreamed that the great judgement (C) morning,  
Had (G) dawned, and the trumpet had (D7) blown,  
I (G) dreamed that all nations had (C) gathered,  
To (G) judgement be- (D7) fore the white (G) throne.  
From the throne came A bright shining (C) angel,  
And he (G) stood on the land and the (D7) sea,  
And (G) swore with his hand raised to (C) heaven,  
That (G) time was no (D7) longer to (G) be.  
Chorus  
And oh what weeping and (C) wailing,  
As the (G) lost were told of their (D7) fate,  
They (G) cried for the rocks and the (C) mountains,  
They (G) prayed, but their (D7) prayers were too (G) late.  
The rich man was there but his money,  
Had melted and vanished away,  
A pauper stood there in the judgement,  
His debts were too many to pay.  
The great man was there, but his greatness,  
When death came, was left far behind,  
The angel that opened the records,  
No trace of his greatness could find.  
Repeat chorus  
The widow was there and the orphan,  
God heard and remembered their cries,  
No sorrow in heaven forever,  
God wiped all the tears from their eyes.  
The gambler was there and the drunkard,  
And they who had sold them the drink,  
With people who gave them the license,  
Together in hell they did sink.  
Repeat chorus  
The moral man to the judgement,  
But self rightousness would not do,  
For the men who had crucified jesus,  
Had passed off as moral men too.  
And the souls that had put off salvation,  
Not tonight I'll get saved by and by,  
No time now to think of salvation,  
At last they had found time to die.  
Repeat chorus
