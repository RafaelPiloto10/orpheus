He's got the whitest legs this side of Montana  
Never seen a situation he couldn't handle  
No he'll never give in and he always helps his friends  
But the world today sure looks strange to him  
His trade mark his big square grey glasses  
He wears t-shirts he don't care about high fashion  
When he plays his guitar, in his mind he's a star  
I'm telling you Hank Hill is the king  
  
Cause a hick is a hick (a hick is a hick)  
And a dude is a dude (a dude is a dude)  
A squirrel is a squirrel and a nut is a nut and I love his attitude  
There's only one show that's worth a damn on the tube  
Yeah he's my hero, a man I'd be proud to know  
I'm telling you Hank Hill is the king  
  
Now our kind of food is barbeque and steaks  
We hate jet skis and beaches  
We like fishing boats and lakes  
Close as heaven I can go is watching hunting and fishing shows  
And hanging out down at the hardware store  
Now Texas that is one beautiful place  
We don't have as many weirdos as New York and L. A,  
We got our ideology and politics just right you see  
He's our only hope, a man we'd be proud tp know  
I'm telling you Hank Hill is the king  
  
Cause a hick is a hick (a hick is a hick)  
And a dude is a dude (a dude is a dude)  
A freak is a freak and a nut is a nut and I love his attitude  
There's only one show that's worth a damn on the tube  
Yeah he's my hero, a man I'd be proud to know  
I'm telling you Hank Hill is the king  
Hank Hill is the king
