I saw an eagle catch a fish crossed my fingers made a wish  
He flew away to clear blue skies the way an eagle flies  
I saw the sun rise o'er the sea through the clouds he winked at me  
Brightened up and seemed to say here is another day  
Out of St George Isle people make you smile  
Won't you bide a while out on St George Isle  
[ sax ]  
I found a penny on the beach in the sand beneath my feet  
Fortune someone had one day and let it slip away  
Oyster boats in disarray scattered all around the bay  
Makes me think of one complaint I wish that I could paint  
Out of St George Isle...  
Out of St George Isle...
