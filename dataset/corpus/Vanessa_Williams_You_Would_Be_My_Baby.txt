From "The Mask" soundtrack  
If I have a secret resepy  
You would be my baby  
If I have the perfect fantasy  
  
You would be my baby  
If the world was mine to redesign  
Then suddenly you would find  
That you'd be my baby  
  
If I wrote you poems that made you cry  
Would you be my baby?  
If I say the sweetest lullaby  
Would you be my baby?  
  
If I promise you the moon and stars  
With heaven waiting in my heart  
Would you be my baby?  
But if I only have  
  
True love to offer you  
Would that be enough  
To make you want me to?  
I would kiss and talk you then each night  
  
You would be my baby  
Then had watch you're sleep and hold you tight  
You would be my baby  
I would make you mine for rich upon  
  
And never need to ask for more  
If you'd be my baby  
You would be my baby  
If I had a chance that we'll romance  
  
If I can chose my circumstance  
Then you'd be my baby  
But if I only have  
True love to offer you  
  
Would that be enough  
To make you want me to?  
If I have a secret resepy  
You would be my baby  
  
If I have the perfect fantasy  
You would be my baby  
If the world was mine to redesign  
Then suddenly you would find  
  
That you'd be my  
You would be my baby-would be my baby
