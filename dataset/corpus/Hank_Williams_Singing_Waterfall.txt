There's a singing waterfall  
In the mountains far away  
That's where I long to be  
At the close of everyday  
That's where my sweetheart's sleepin'  
Down beneath the clay  
I often sit and wonder why  
The Lord took her away  
We'd meet there every evening  
When the sun was sinkin' low  
And we'd listen to the waters  
As they rippled soft and low  
And since she's gone to Heaven  
I miss her most of all  
Tonight my darlin's sleepin'  
By the singing waterfall  
Last night as I lay dreamin'  
I heard my darlin' call  
And then I went to meet her  
By the singing waterfall  
She took me in her arms  
Just like she used to do  
And then I heard her whisper  
"We'll meet beyond the blue"  
We'd meet there every evening  
When the sun was sinkin' low  
And we'd listen to the waters  
As they rippled soft and low  
And since she's gone to Heaven  
I miss her most of all  
Tonight my darlin's sleepin'  
By the singing waterfall
