There'll be no moon tonight  
And the stars won't light the sky  
There are women on the streets,  
But there's no loving in their eyes  
Feeling weary, tired and wishing  
I was standing in your doorway now  
There'll be dancing flames  
Something special cooking slow  
Perfume heavy and all the lanterns turned down low  
Oh that lucky, oh that lucky man  
Who is standing in your doorway now  
I'm a wandering man  
You'll never tie me down  
Lifelong sailor, but how I wish I was homeward bound  
At this moment tired and wishing  
I was standing in your doorway now
