Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go  
Just enough to make your juices flow  
Press play, don't stop, rotate, too hot  
You feel I'm real  
I'm everything you need, so tell me what's the deal  
  
[Chorus]  
Two thousand watts, eight ohms, two hundred volts, real strong  
Too much of that, fuse blown  
Be careful what you say don't overload  
Two thousand watts, eight ohms, two hundred volts, real strong  
Too much of that, fuse blown  
Be careful what you say don't overload  
  
3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby  
Release two or three, when I reach I can go 'til I hit my peak  
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady  
Shorty really want to be there for me  
  
[Chorus]
