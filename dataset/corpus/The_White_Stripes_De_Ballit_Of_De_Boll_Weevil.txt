You can talk about the latest  
The latest of your own  
These boll weevils  
They will rob you of a home  
They are looking for a home  
They are looking for a home  
The first time I seen a boll weevil  
He was sitting on the square  
The next time I seen a boll weevil  
He had his whole family there  
They are looking for a home  
They were looking for a home  
They are looking for a home  
They are looking for a home  
They are looking for a home  
They was looking for a home  
The farmer he took the boll weevil  
Put him on the sand  
The boll weevil said to the farmer  
You treat me just like a man  
And I will have a home  
I will have a home  
The old lady said to the old man  
I'm trying my level best  
To keep these boll weevils  
Out of my brand new cotton dress  
Cause its full of holes  
Yeah, its full of holes  
The old man said to the old lady  
What do you think of that  
These boll weevils got into my brand new stetson hat  
And it's full of holes  
Yeah it's full of holes  
Alright, yeah it's full of holes  
Well it's full of holes  
Yeah it's full of holes  
Well it's full of holes  
Alright now this next verse is about myself  
And when I'm done I hope you'll sing along with me on  
"he's looking for a home" OK?  
I said if anybody asks you people  
Who sang you this song  
You tell 'em it's jackie white  
He's done been here and gone  
And he's looking for a home  
He's looking for a home  
He's looking for a home  
He's looking for a home  
He's looking for a home  
He's looking for a home  
He's looking for a home  
He's looking for a home  
He's looking for a home  
He's looking for a home
