The sea goes on forever  
The sky goes on forever  
It's all a vast unmeasured shore  
  
If you just think about it  
The waves are always sighin'  
The sea birds always cryin'  
Where time means nothing anymore  
  
If I could I would take up the sea  
Join hands with the sky  
I'd melt with the shore  
They're part of all I adore  
And all the love we will share  
One moment more, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Ahh, the sea goes on forever  
The sky goes on forever  
It's something no-one can deny  
If they go on forever  
And they go on forever  
  
Then why not you and I?  
Like sea and sky  
Sea and sky  
Sea and sky
