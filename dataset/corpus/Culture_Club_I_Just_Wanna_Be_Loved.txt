Take a picture of tonight and  
Keep it by your heart  
Love has left us memories  
There's no better way to part  
I will find another love  
Someone who won't me down  
How you tried to level me  
But you never stood your ground  
Fortunately I got wise this time  
Fortunately I had me on my mind  
Oh I just want to be loved  
Don't want to fight you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
I just want to be loved  
Don't want to beg you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
Take a piece of dignity and  
Use it in your life  
Even though you hurt me  
I still want you to survive  
Love was never special  
We were never down  
You will always have someone  
To bring you on the ground  
Fortunately I got wise this time  
Fortunately I had me on my mind  
Oh I just want to be loved  
Don't want to fight you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
I just want to be loved  
Don't want to beg you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
When you love someone  
Don't you know, love is blind  
When you love someone  
It'll be for all time, yeah that's right  
Fortunately I got wise this time  
Fortunately I had me on my mind  
Oh I just want to be loved  
Don't want to fight you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
I just want to be loved  
Don't want to beg you baby  
Love me, love me, love me, love me yeah
