Fist out  
Fist out for the five  
Fist out  
  
I'm a country boy I got no Soul  
Don't sleep at night, the worlds growing old  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
  
Fist out  
Fist out for the five  
Fist out  
  
I'm a country boy I got no Soul  
Don't sleep at night, the worlds growing old  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
  
I'm a country boy I got no Soul  
Sleep at night, the worlds growing old  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones  
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones
