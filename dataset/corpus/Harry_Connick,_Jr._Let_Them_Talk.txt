Let them talk if they want to  
Talk don't bother me  
I want the whole wide world to know  
That I love you so  
  
Let them whisper  
For they know not what's  
Between you and I  
I'll keep on loving you  
Until the day I die  
  
They're tryin' to breakup our romance  
But they don't have a chance  
We have the kind of love  
That's so strong  
We'll be together from now on  
  
Idle gossip comes from the devil's workshop  
But true love will make it stop  
I want the whole wide world to know  
That I love you so  
  
They're envious of everything we do  
But it's so wonderful (wonderful)  
When you love some one (love someone)  
When that someone loves you
