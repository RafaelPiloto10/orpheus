Icy steel shooting through concrete, cool city  
Mountains of glass reflect the sky  
Everybody feels real good in cool city  
Each day brings a new surprise  
Johnny came two-thousand miles to the cool city  
He came to see what makes things tick  
He cut his hair and bought new clothes in the cool city  
Finally found his life's ambition  
  
How to do nothing perfectly  
To do it with style so gracefully  
'Cause life is so delicious in Cool City  
  
Outside no one's on the street  
Don't stop or you'll miss a beat  
  
Someone's standing in a doorway -- cool city  
You open the door and check him out so casually  
The music's blasting all night long in cool city  
They recognize his face, so it's all right  
This one knew the right address  
He even knew someone in a band  
While the others wait all night standing there in  
Cool city  
  
So hard to make the right friends  
You might have to sell some skin  
The nights go on forever  
  
The blacks they all hate the whites  
The whites think they're tough, but they're not, cool city  
The boys go out with each other  
The girls who will be in movies  
  
If you're high, you're in the right place, cool city  
Animals seek out their own kind  
Shake some hands and take a lunch in cool city  
Someone's going to try and tempt you  
Listen to all the brilliant plans in the cool city  
It's all free now, but you'll pay later with your soul  
Pray to the the objects on the wall  
That you'll stay young and never grow old  
So come on, the water's fine  
Have a drink, snort a line  
'Cause the nights get very chilly here in cool city
