My heart goes BBB  
Every time I think of you  
Heart's going BBB  
Lost control what shall I do?  
  
'Cause I want to be your lover  
Till the end of our lives  
I could never miss again  
These loving eyes  
  
My heart goes BBB  
Every time I think of you  
I feel that BBB  
No control of what I'll do  
  
Simplicity, complexity, oh what a tragedy  
Reality, insanity, strange normality  
Incredible, untouchable, but just visual  
And I want you, just you but natural  
  
My heart goes BBB  
When any mind is touching you  
Inside that BB  
Only light inside my gloom
