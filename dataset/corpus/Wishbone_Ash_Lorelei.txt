You shone out of the darkness  
The light in your eyes.  
I could not help myself  
I did not want to try.  
Like the singing of the lorelei  
Your voice rang clear and true  
Mystery and danger was all I got from you.  
Oh, you mesmerized me, oh, you tantalized,  
Like the singing of the lorelei.  
And you knew everything  
There was to know about me.  
Like the singing of the lorelei  
Your voice rang clear and true  
Mystery and danger was all I got from you.  
Oh, you mesmerized, oh, you tantalized  
Like the voice of the lorelei.
