Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the snowman was a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow but the children know how he come to life one day  
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found  
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can  
He led them down the streets of town right up to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry I'll be back again some day
