Gonna cash my check before the drive-through closes  
Get my baby a couple Quick-Sak roses  
Put five dollars worth of gas in my pride and joy  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Gonna take her out to the Tasty-Freeze then  
We'll go dancing at the American Legion  
When ole Bobby does Elvis, you swear it was the real McCoy  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Aw there ain't much to do in the one-light town  
But we don't let that slow us down  
If it's too quiet, we make our own noise  
Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week  
My pretty little girl is ready for me  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
When we've had enough of that shakin' and a shoutin'  
We go fog up the windows in the Smoky Mountains  
Have more fun than a couple of tourists and a Polaroid  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Aw there ain't much to do in the one-light town  
But we don't let that slow us down  
If it's too quiet, we make our own noise  
Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week  
My pretty little girl is ready for me  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy
