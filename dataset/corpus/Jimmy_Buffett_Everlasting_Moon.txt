"This is a little song called Everlasting Moon about what some people did to
preserve the environment."  
  
The sky revealed the rumor  
In a misty gray cocoon  
Some angry baby-boomers  
Stole the everlasting moon  
  
They found a new location  
Clear and poison free  
In a distant constellation  
Oh, they called it lunacy  
  
[Chorus]  
Hangin' in the sky  
The perfect alibi  
Baby come outside with me  
There's a moon you've got to see  
Smiling every place  
With his laser-painted face  
Light of love in each moonbeam  
Want you step into my dream  
Everlasting moon (everlasting moon, everlasting moon)  
  
Back when nature ruled the heavens  
Oh gypsies, fools, and loons  
Were dragged across the ocean  
By that everlasting moon  
  
When it goes from full to crescent  
I move in and out of tune  
It's the envy of the Kremlin  
It's our everlasting moon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shinin' in the sky  
The perfect alibi  
Baby come outside with me  
There's this moon you've got to see  
Smiling every place  
With his laser-painted face  
Light of love in each moonbeam  
Want you step into my dream  
Everlasting moon (everlasting moon)  
Everlasting moon (everlasting moon)
