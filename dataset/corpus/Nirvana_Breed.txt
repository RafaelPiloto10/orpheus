I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care  
I don't care  
Care if it's old  
  
I don't mind  
I don't mind  
I don't mind  
I don't mind  
I don't mind  
Mind, don't have a mind  
  
Get away  
Get away  
Get away  
Get away  
Away, away from your home  
  
I'm afraid  
I'm afraid  
I'm afraid  
I'm afraid  
I'm afraid  
Afraid, afraid of a ghost  
  
Even if you have  
Even if you need  
I don't mean to stare  
We don't have to breed  
We could plant a house  
We could build a tree  
I don't even care  
We could have all three
