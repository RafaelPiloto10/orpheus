I've been out here in this wasteland  
Throwing horseshoes at the stars  
Nickel, Silver, and pearl inlay  
On an old guitar for my new life  
For the playwright and the printer  
Theme cafes and tourist bars  
They're on a permanent vacation  
Like butterflies in killing jars  
How the hell did it get this far  
Let's go now  
Maybe we'll walk  
Maybe we'll fly  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
While we're still young  
Take our dreams and run  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
All the songs I sing were for you  
Though it's something I've denied  
Time is short so let's start running  
To hell with pride  
Cause time moves fast  
See'mon baby make it last  
Let's go now  
Maybe we'll walk  
Maybe we'll fly  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
While we're still young  
Take out dreams and run  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
There's a big sky  
There's a big sky there for you and me  
Got no horizon  
Who needs a compass  
I've got you and you got me  
See'mon baby  
It feels so good to be free  
Maybe we'll walk  
Maybe we'll fly  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
You've got the keys  
Baby I can drive  
See'mon now let's get outta here  
Maybe we'll walk  
Maybe we'll fly  
See'mon now let's get outta here  
You've got that look  
You make it clear  
See'mon now let's get outta here  
Yeah yeah  
Get a piece of big sky  
It's yours and mine  
Yeah yeah  
Big sky  
Big sky
