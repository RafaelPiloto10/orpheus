You like to dance and listen to the music  
I like to sing with the band  
You like your hands splashing in the ocean  
Well I like me feet on the sand  
Does anybody have it any better?  
Isn't it easy to see just how well we fit together?  
  
When I start to sing the blues  
You pull out my dancing shoes  
I think you could be so good for me  
You get brave when I get shy  
Just another reason why  
I think you could be so good for me  
So good.  
  
You like to drive like Mario Andretti  
I like it taking my time  
But let me say wherever you are going  
You know it suits me just fine  
Does anybody have it any better?  
Isn't it easy to see just how well we fit together?  
  
When I start to sing the blues  
You pull out my dancing shoes  
I think you could be so good for me  
You get brave when I get shy  
Just another reason why  
I think you could be so good for me  
So good.  
  
Could be so good for me  
You could be so good  
Could be so good  
Could be so good for me.  
  
You get brave when I get shy  
Another reason why  
You could be so good for  
Good for me baby  
Good for me baby  
When I want to sing the blues  
Good for me baby  
Oh when I want to sing the blues  
Good for me baby  
You could be so good  
Good for me baby  
When I want to sing the blues  
Good for me baby.
