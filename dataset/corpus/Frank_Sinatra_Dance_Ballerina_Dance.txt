Dance, ballerina, dance  
And do your pirouette in rhythm with your achin' heart  
Dance, ballerina, dance  
You mustn't once forget a dancer has to dance the part  
Whirl, ballerina, whirl  
And just ignore the chair that's empty in the second row  
This is your moment, girl  
Although he's not out there applauding as you steal the show  
Once you said his love must wait its turn  
You wanted fame instead  
I guess that's your concern  
We live and learn  
And love is gone, ballerina, gone  
So on with your career, you can't afford a backward glance  
Dance on and on and on  
A thousand people here have come to see the show  
As 'round and 'round you go  
So ballerina, dance  
Dance, dance!
