[Faith hill]  
Hello world  
Hope you're listening  
Forgive me if I'm young  
For speaking out of turn  
There's someone I've been missing  
I think that they could be  
The better half of me  
They're in the wrong place trying to make it right  
But I'm tired of justifying  
So I say to you...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come home  
Come home  
Cause I've been waiting for you  
For so long, so long  
And right now there's a war between the vanities  
But all I see is you and me  
The fight for you is all I've ever known  
So come home...  
  
[Faith hill]  
I get lost in the beauty  
Of everything I see  
The world ain't as half as bad  
As they paint it to be  
When all the sons, all the daughters  
Stopped to take it in  
Then hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin  
It might start now  
But maybe I'm just dreaming out loud  
But until then  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come home  
Come home  
Cause I've been waiting for you  
For so long, so long  
And right now there's a war between the vanities  
But all I see is you and me  
The fight for you is all I've ever known  
So come home...  
  
[Bridge:]  
Everything I can't be  
Is everything you should be  
And that's why I need you here  
  
Everything I can't be  
Is everything you should be  
And that's why I need you here  
So hear this now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come home  
Come home  
Cause I've been waiting for you  
For so long, so long  
And right now there's a war between the vanities  
But all I see is you and me  
The fight for you is all I've ever known,  
Ever known  
  
Come home...  
Come home...
