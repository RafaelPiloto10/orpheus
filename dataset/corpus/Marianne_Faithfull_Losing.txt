You know I see you when you're sleeping  
When you're all insane with dreaming  
I can tell you that you been fighting, baby  
But you've been losing  
  
You know there's clearer ways of thinking  
And there's quicker ways of dying  
But I'm a sucker for your drinking  
And now, I'm losing  
  
I don't know who you think you're cheating  
Or with whom you have been sleeping  
But all the shit that you've been eating  
Says you're losing  
  
When I let my hate pervert me  
And there's no more tears for crying  
I'll just kill you if you hurt me  
I'll kill you  
  
You know I see you when you're sleeping  
When you're all insane with dreaming  
I can tell you that you been fighting, baby  
Fighting hard and losing  
  
Fighting hard, and losing  
Fighting hard, fighting hard, losing
