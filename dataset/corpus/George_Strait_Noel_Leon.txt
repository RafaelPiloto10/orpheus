Leon Dixon leaves his Christmas lights up all year 'round  
It's somethin' different about our town  
We've often wondered why he never takes 'em down  
But Leon leaves his Christmas lights up all year 'round  
There's a big bright noel flashin' off and on  
In the yard where the children play the whole year long  
We've all gotten used to it year by year  
Now it's kinda gotten to be a part of things 'round here  
  
[Chorus]  
Peace on earth, Good will to men  
Christmas time is here again  
Can it be all that wrong  
To feel like Christmas all year long  
  
Leon got sick, it's been back awhile  
Short on luck and money, but he still wore that smile  
And nobody could stand to see him do without  
So we all drove over to see if we could help out  
Yeah, the noel flashed on and the bills stayed paid  
I felt so warm as we drove away  
I had never seen Christmas spelled so clear  
As when I saw ?LEON? flashin' in my rear view mirror  
  
[Chorus]
