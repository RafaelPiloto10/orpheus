Uh, uh  
It was the middle of June, me and my grand mama  
Had some free time, flew to Panama  
I was playin' the bar, sippin' a Margarita  
When this chick from Argentina, her name Armenita  
She told me you could make some fast cash  
You help me change my name from Vasquez to your name  
Take me to your domain  
Trick, you must be out yo' brain  
She said it's no game, my pops got tons of cocaine  
And you could have some if you get me on your plane  
I said here the dealie, you sound silly  
Think hard, there gotta be another way to get you a green card  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
It 'id be like paradise, baby  
  
Rosalie you don't know who I suppose to be  
But whatever you wanna be? You can come go wit' me  
Her last thoughts thinking I'mma get her a passport  
Whatever you need ma, just ask for it  
Now she lunch meat, she look at J like she home free  
  
J, can you really get me in your country?  
  
No lie, I can do whatever I mo' tie, so fly  
Mami started offering me chochas  
Certainly the way she flirt wit' me  
If I get her in the US she work for free  
Though she nice to me, I'm runnin' twice the G  
For the right price, she could be a wife to me  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
It 'id be like paradise, baby  
  
Hey girl, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby  
  
I got a girl out in Asia, name Malaysia  
Who was a real bad chick that owns a Bodega  
She wanted me to save her and make her life greater  
Cuz her dad hates her and rapes her  
She tried to get some paper  
When you wanna leave, I'mma take ya  
In fact, pack ya things, I got a crib in Jamaica  
Mami, mi casa a su casa  
We could do the salsa so, que pasa?  
She said she had money but it was all in trust funds  
But I could get a lump sum if I can get her through customs  
So bring the cake, we gon' swing outta state  
I'mma make you dream when you awake  
Yo Loon, sing the break, what  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
It 'id be like paradise, baby  
  
In the middle of Nicaragua, met a mami named Talia  
Weren't plain, then I caught a boat wit' this dumb dame  
An immigrant, marry her, make her legitimate  
Illiterate, mess wit' Hud, she don't consider it  
She said pa, llevame contigo  
Lean dough and I'mma pay yo' peoples  
This retard chick started looking at me hard  
She gassed up thinkin' I'mma get her a green card  
And she don't know that she ain't coming wit' me  
And I don't stuck up for some hundreds of G's  
And while I see her standing there lookin' around  
Huddy took the money, slid outta town, what? uh?  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
It 'id be like paradise, baby  
Hey girl, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby  
  
I mean this  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?

It 'id be like paradise, baby
