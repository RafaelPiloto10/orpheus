Oh my god waiter,  
We packed up in this bitch,  
And I'm feeling the hater vapors, yeah it's hot up in this bitch!  
But boy you will never faze me,  
And I know why you hate me  
Cause my fucking cleaning lady  
Look hotter than your bitch,  
And you know I'm about to spend  
A hundred racks upon this bar, bar.  
You don't wanna drink you wanna be noisy Mrs. Ard-Vark  
And I know that you not to rejection,  
But if you don't get naked get the fuck up out my section!

All up in the V. I. P that shit look like a cloud  
Guess Aladin got two hundred Jasmines' coming to the house.  
And we're banging on that magic carpet, fucking on the couch  
All the fettuccini say she saw a genie that's that loud  
They say silence is golden, so my chain don't make a sound  
But these bottles I'm holding I'ma give 'em to the crowd!  
Oh, that must be the shit they're talking about  
Can you hear me now or I gotta say it loud?  
  
Chorus:  
I need a hundred fucking bottles

I see you standing in the back, babe  
Let me help you out with that, babe  
You're looking badder than the bitch  
You the baddest in the clique, see you picking up the slacks, babe  
So let me you back to my place  
We're so drunk, so high, babe  
Liquor is over, and over, I ain't got no hang over  
You can tell by the look on my face I need  
  
Chorus:  
I need a hundred fucking bottles
