I've flown around the world in a plane  
I've settled revolutions in Spain  
The North Pole I have charted  
But can't get started with you  
  
Around the golf course I'm under par  
And all the movies want me to star  
I've got a house, a show place  
But I get no place with you  
  
You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you  
scheme, just for a sign of you  
dream, both day and night of you  
and what good does it do  
  
In nineteen twenty nine I sold short  
In England I'm presented at court  
But you got me so downhearted  
Because I can't get started with you  
  
You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you  
scheme, just for a sign of you  
dream, both day and night of you  
and what good does it do  
  
In nineteen twenty nine I sold short  
In England I'm presented at court  
But you got me so downhearted  
Because I can't get started with you
