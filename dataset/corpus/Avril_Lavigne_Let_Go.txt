Hey, yea, ohoh (3x)  
  
I've only got 3 dollars left in my hands,  
I walk down the sidewalk as I pass a dirty man  
Walk up the staircase that leads to my hotel  
I'm living in at a fancy hotel, yeayea  
Then I'll go up to my room  
Fixate on what's the deal  
I'm alone again  
Then I will crawl into the bed,  
And call you up to tell you off  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone  
Before I lose my mind  
Because you lied and so did I  
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y  
If I let you go tonight if I let you go tonight  
Yea, yea, let go  
  
Hey, yea, ohoh  
  
I'll probably wake up a little sad  
But then I'll get up and let go of it all instead  
Because really it's not worth it  
To get in a mess over him  
To bother get stressed over him  
So I'll just go on with my life  
And fixate on everything else but you  
Yea I'll just go on with my life  
I have no reason to please you anymore  
  
'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone  
Before I lose my mind  
Because you lied and so did I  
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y  
If I let you go tonight if I let you go  
  
So find your way out of my sight  
I know it's hard, it's tough to laugh  
It's all messed up, don't play this game  
  
[Chorus:] 2x  
  
Yea, yea  
Getting stressed over you  
Getting messed over you
