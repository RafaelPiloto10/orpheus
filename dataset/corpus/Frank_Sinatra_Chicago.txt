Chicago, Chicago  
That toddlin' town  
Chicago, Chicago  
I'll show you around  
I love it  
Bet your bottom dollar you'll lose the blues  
In Chicago, Chicago  
The town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down  
On State Street that great street I just want to say  
They do things they don't do on Broadway  
They have a time, the time of their life  
I saw a man who danced with his wife  
In Chicago, Chicago my hometown  
Chicago, Chicago  
That toddlin' town  
Chicago, Chicago  
I will show you around  
I love it  
Bet your bottom dollar you'll lose the blues  
I Chicago, Chicago  
The town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down  
On State Street that great street I just want to say  
They do things that they don't do on Broadway  
They have the time the time of their life  
I saw a man who danced with his wife  
I Chicago, Chicago, Chicago that's my hometown!
