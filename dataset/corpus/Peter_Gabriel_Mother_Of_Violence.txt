Walking the street with her naked feet  
So full of rhythm but I can't find the beat  
Snapping her heels clicking her toes  
Everybody knows just where she goes  
  
Fear, fear, she's the mother of violence  
Making me tense to watch the way she breed  
Fear, she's the mother of violence  
You know self-defense is all you need  
It's getting hard to breathe  
It's getting so hard to believe  
To believe in anything at all  
  
Mouth all dry eyes blood shot  
Data stored in microdot  
Kicking the cloud with my moccasin shoes  
T.V. dinner, T.V. news  
  
Fear, fear, she's the mother of violence  
Don't make any sense to watch the way she breed  
Fear, she's the mother of violence  
Making me tense to watch the way she feed  
The only way you know she's there  
Is the subtle flavor in the air  
Getting hard to breathe  
Hard to believe in anything at all, but fear
