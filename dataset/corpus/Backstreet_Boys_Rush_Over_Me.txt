You washed away my sad face  
And flooded all my empty space  
You take away life's heartbreak  
And I know with you it's gonna be okay  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you are rushed over me yeah  
  
There's no more blindness  
When I cry, I'm smiling  
You kept me from dying  
And I know with you I'll keep on living  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you are rushed over me  
  
It's not enough  
Just holding on  
Before I met you  
I was lost  
Now that you're standing here  
I don't want you to go  
'Cause I know, that your love keeps me alive  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you have rushed over me  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you have rushed over me
