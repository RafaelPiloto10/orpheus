I once held that someone special, didn't have to let her go  
I just stood back and watched my future pass  
And for the awful shape I'm in I can only blame myself  
It's no wonder that her love for me wasn't strong enough to last.  
  
Poor it on for all it's worth through all that we got lived  
And for what it's worth we've been less than easy on ourself  
If we could write a book they could'nt keep it on the shelf  
We're just tryin' to get it right with all that we've got left.  
  
I was there when the bar room opened, I've been there at closin' time  
There were things I couldn't handle by myself  
Then the right one picked me up and we left it all behind  
She said I'm all she'll ever need and for me there's no one else  
  
Poor it on for all it's worth through all that we got lived  
And for what it's worth we've been less than easy on ourself  
If we could write a book they could'nt keep it on the shelf  
We're just tryin' to get it right with all that we've got left.  
  
We're just tryin' to get it right with all that we've got left...
