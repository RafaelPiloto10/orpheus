Cool blue reason empties on the page  
Your colleagues are in prison and your enemies in reign  
Cool blue reason comes into your world  
There's two more dead in Texas and it's probably your girls  
Cool blue reason wraps around your throat  
The minutes change like seasons  
Only eight more hours to go  
  
Cool blue reason comes into your life  
There's one more dead in Kansas and it's probably your wife  
Cool blue reason I'm just talking to myself  
Cool blue reason I'm just rearranging Hell  
I'm just talking to myself  
I'm just talking to myself  
  
Cool blue reason wraps around your throat  
The minutes change likes seasons  
Only eight more hours to go  
Only eight more hours to go  
Only eight more hours left to go
