I heard she sang a good song  
I heard she had a style  
And so I came to see her  
To listen for a while  
And there she was this young girl  
A stranger to my eyes  
Strummin' my pain with her fingers  
Singin' my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly, with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly, with her song  
I felt all flushed with fever  
Embarrassed by the crowd  
I felt she found my letters  
And read each one aloud  
I prayed that she would finish  
But she just kept right on  
Strummin' my pain with her fingers  
Singin' my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly, with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly, with her song  
She sang as if she knew me  
In all my dark despair  
And then she looked right through me  
As if I wasn't there  
But she was there, this stranger  
Singing clear and strong  
Strummin' my pain with her fingers  
Singin' my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly, with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly, with her song  
Killing me softly, with her song
