Save me, oh God  
for the waters  
have come up to my neck  
and I am sinking to the bottom where I cannot stand  
I am calling to you  
can you hear my cry?  
  
Oh my God! You've turned your eyes  
and now my heart has come alive!  
  
Chorus  
Only you have come to find me  
Only you have come to pull me out  
Only you have come to save me  
Only you have come to wrap your arms around me  
  
Save me, oh God.  
I have wondered  
and I cannot find your hand  
and I am looking for you, Father, but my eyes fail  
I am calling to you  
can you hear my cry?  
  
Oh my God! You've turned your eyes  
and now my heart has come alive  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
No one has ever loved me  
like the way you loved me  
wrap your arms around  
(repeat)  
  
Chorus  
  
No one (only you have come to find me) has ever loved me  
Like the way you loved me  
(only you have come to pull me out)  
wrap your arms around  
No one (only you have come to save me) has ever loved me  
Like the what you loved me  
(wrap your arms around me)  
wrap your arms around me  
  
Chorus
