(Verse)  
Hmm, I'm anything but regular  
My sex appeal incredible  
No front, no pick, I'm everything, I'm tellin' ya  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
Man, y'all can't tell me shit  
Got money and I made it, bad bitch and I say it  
Since been young and I've been the one and I neva been none to play with  
I knooow (I know, I know, I know, I know)  
  
(Verse)  
We just making sure you know it  
Ain't nothing new I'm bettin' about  
I stay laying these names about  
Bitch, you can't afford, you gotta ask how much it cost  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
Man, y'all can't tell me shit  
Got money and I made it, bad bitch and I say it  
Since been young and I've been the one and I neva been none to play with  
I knooow (I know, I know, I know, I know  
  
(Chorus x2)  
Act like you know what you looking at when you looking at me  
I'm what that nigga want and I'm what that bitch wanna be  
Said I'm feelin' myself and y'all can't tell me shit x2  
  
(Verse)  
(Cause I'm a puppet lady bitch)  
I'm more sexy than a lil' bitch  
No bum bitches, no little dicks  
I like my blunt, my pend to fuck, she'll wait a lil'  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
Man, y'all can't tell me shit  
Got money and I made it, bad bitch and I say it  
Since been young and I've been the one and I neva been none to play with  
I knooow (I know, I know, I know, I know  
  
(Chorus x2)  
Act like you know what you looking at when you looking at me  
I'm what that nigga want and I'm what that bitch wanna be  
Said I'm feelin' myself and y'all can't tell me shit x2
