The afternoon has gently passed me by  
The evening spreads its sail against the sky  
Waiting for tomorrow, just another day  
God bid yesterday good-bye  
  
Bring on the night  
I couldn't spend another hour of daylight  
Bring on the night  
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight  
  
The future is but a question mark  
Hangs above my head, there in the dark  
Can't see for the brightness is staring me blind  
God bid yesterday good-bye  
  
Bring on the night  
I couldn't spend another hour of daylight  
Bring on the night  
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight  
  
I couldn't spend another hour of daylight  
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
