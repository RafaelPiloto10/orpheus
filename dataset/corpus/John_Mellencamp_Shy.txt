[Chorus]  
Can you shelter me  
From this anxiety  
Hey baby don't look me in the eye  
'Cause I'm sexually shy shy shy  
Sexually shy shy shy  
  
I don't know why  
With other girls I'm fine  
But with you baby I'm shy shy shy  
I hate for you to see me like this  
'Cause nowhere else in my life  
Does this exist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time we talk  
I can't catch my breath  
I want a conversation  
But I scare myself  
I really can't hide behind this lie  
'Cause with you baby  
I'm shy shy shy  
  
Woman  
Well I'm ashamed to say  
Woman  
That I'm afraid this way  
Woman  
Yeah  
Woman  
I gotta stop acting so crazy  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
I don't know why  
With other girls I'm fine  
But with you baby I'm shy shy shy  
I don't know why  
With other women I'm fine  
But with you baby I'm shy shy shy  
  
I don't know why  
I don't know why
