When I was young  
They took me to the dentist  
I had a toothache  
But that's okay  
  
They gave me some time  
And that night in my bedroom  
I worked it loose  
Like I used to do  
  
One little boy in a dentist's chair  
Heard a hundred angels  
flying past him  
What a gas  
  
Sitting there  
The same little boy with a few more years  
Took a sniff of this  
A taste of that  
  
What a drag  
Nothing there  
And then one day he saw you walk  
And heard you didn't talk  
  
Saw the writing on the wall  
It didn't thunder anymore  
White lightening it's got nothing on you  
Lucy in the sky with diamonds  
  
Oh it didn't shine like you Lord  
White lightening way out in the blue  
With a million angels singin'  
Oh it didn't sound like you Lord  
  
Come on to tell when I tell you to breathe in  
I will take out everything while you're sleeping  
Always refusing the heavenly music  
When you awake it will have a new meaning  
  
White lightening it's got nothing on you  
Lucy in the sky with diamonds  
Oh it didn't shine like you Lord  
White lightening way out in the blue  
  
With a million angels singin'  
Oh it didn't sound like you Lord  
Come on to tell when I tell you to breathe in  
I will take out everything while you're sleeping  
  
Always refusing the heavenly music  
When you awake it will have a new meaning  
White lightening it's got nothing on you  
Lucy in the sky with diamonds  
  
Oh it didn't shine like you Lord  
White lightening way out in the blue  
With a million angels singin'  
Oh it didn't sound like you Lord
