I really miss you when the nights are long  
And only silence is heard in this world of song  
But life goes on  
And forever more  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
I see you walking through the gates of home  
And then I wake up to find  
I'm still all alone  
I should have known  
But forever more  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
Lonely is the river  
As it tumbles to the ocean  
Searching for our future  
We can find our way back home  
  
My only comfort is the love we share  
And as I walk through this world  
With sadness everywhere  
I've had my share  
And forever more,  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
And forever more,  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
Standing in the doorway  
As the sunrise greets the morning  
Searching for our future  
We can find our way back home  
  
I really miss you when the nights are long  
And only silence is heard in this world of song  
But life goes on  
And forever more  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
Haunted by your love  
Haunted by your love  
Haunted by your love  
Haunted by your love
