Beat-up little seagull  
On a marble stair  
Tryin' to find the ocean  
Lookin' everywhere  
  
Hard times in the city  
In a hard town by the sea  
Ain't nowhere to run to  
There ain't nothin' here for free  
  
Hooker on the corner  
Waitin' for a train  
Drunk lyin' on the sidewalk  
Sleepin' in the rain  
  
And they hide their faces  
And they hide their eyes  
'Cause the city's dyin'  
And they don't know why  
  
Oh, Baltimore  
Man, it's hard just to live  
Oh, Baltimore  
Man, it's hard just to live, just to live  
  
Get my sister Sandy  
And my little brother Ray  
Buy a big old wagon  
Gonna haul us all away  
  
Livin' in the country  
Where the mountain's high  
Never comin' back here  
'Til the day I die  
  
Oh, Baltimore  
Man, it's hard just to live  
Oh, Baltimore  
Man, it's hard just to live, just to live
