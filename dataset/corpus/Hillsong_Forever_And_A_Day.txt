Gloriously You saved me  
You saved me  
So miraculously  
You made me brand new  
You welcomed me with open arms  
Open arms  
Unfailingly  
Your love is a river  
  
So I will praise You  
I will praise You  
  
I'll praise Your name  
Forever and a day  
And I'll live for You into eternity  
I'll praise Your name  
Forever and a day  
And I'll live what I sing  
What I say  
What I'm learning everyday  
  
Generously You gave me  
You gave me  
Marvelously You made me  
You made me  
Relentlessly I follow  
I follow  
Your majesty, breathtaking  
So beautiful
