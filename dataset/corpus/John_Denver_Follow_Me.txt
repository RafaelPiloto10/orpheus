It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done  
To be so in love with you and so alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way and all around  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me  
  
It's long been on my mind  
You know it's been a long, long time  
I've tried to find the way that I can make you understand  
The way I feel about you and just how much I need you  
To be there where I can talk to you  
When there's no one else around  
  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way and all around  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me  
  
You see I'd like to share my life with you  
And show you things I've seen  
Places that I'm going to places where I've been  
To have you there beside me and never be alone  
And all the time that you're with me  
We will be at home  
  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me
