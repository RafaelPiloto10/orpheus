I got your love  
I got your love  
I got your love  
I got your love  
I got your love  
I got your love  
I got your love  
I got your love  
I got your love  
Your love, your love, your love  
I got your love, all I ever think about  
I got your love, every last drop  
I got your love, it's all I ever think about  
It's all I ever think about, all I ever think about  
Baby, in the heart of my heart, I want more  
Of the man who just walked through that door  
The only one that my eyes see  
Baby, as the moments have drifted away  
As the hours became lonely days  
You're the answer to what I have prayed  
I, I will be good to you, I, I will be true  
I got your love, it's all that I got  
I got your love, all I ever think about  
I got your love, every last drop  
I got your love, all I ever think about  
It's all I ever think about, all I ever think about  
Oh, baby, losin' you's all that I fear  
And I'm losing it when you're not here  
I never could go on without you  
Oh, baby, I feel like a shower of light  
And I need you right here by my side  
I'm craving you all of my life  
I, I will be good to you, I, I will be true  
I got your love, all that I got  
I got your love, it's all I ever think about  
I got your love, every last drop  
I got your love, all I ever think about  
It's all I ever think about, it's all I ever think about  
It's all I ever think about  
Aah, you move me, baby  
It's all I ever think about  
You move me, aah, you move me  
You move me, aah, you move me  
I got your love, it's all that I got  
I got your love, it's all I ever think about  
I got your love, every last drop  
I got your love, it's all I ever think about  
I got your love, it's all that I got  
I got your love, it's all I ever think about  
I got your love, every last drop  
I got your love, it's all I ever think about  
All I ever think about, all I ever think about  
All I ever think about
