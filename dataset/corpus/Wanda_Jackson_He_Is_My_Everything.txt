He is my reason for living he is my everything  
I remember my days of darekness without sunshine or sight to lead my way  
Then a whisper of his voice softly called me to the arms of my Saviour to stay  
He is my reason for living he is the king of all kings  
  
I'm proud to be his possession he is my everything  
After the lightning and the thunder after the last bell has rung  
I want to bow down before Jesus and hear him say well done  
He is my reason for living...  
He is my reason for living he is my everything
