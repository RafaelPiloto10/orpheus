Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand  
And the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond"  
And the walls collide, Mona cries  
And the rainman leaves in the wolfman's disguise  
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your man  
I wanna be your lover, baby  
I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours  
Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit  
Turns to the mad man, "Ain't you cute"  
Well, the mad man he jumps up on the shelf  
And he says, "You ain't so bad yourself"  
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man  
I wanna be your lover, baby  
I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours  
Well, jumpin' Judy can't get no higher  
She got bullets in her eyes and then they fire  
Rasputin, he's so dignified  
He touched the back of her head and he died  
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your man  
I wanna be your lover, baby  
I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours  
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass  
Which she lays upon the grass  
She gets all messed up, she faints  
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't  
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your man  
I wanna be your lover, baby  
I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours  
I wanna be yours
