I need you to keep me straight,  
When the world don't seem so great,  
And it's hard enough you know  
I need you to be around  
When my conscience brings me down  
And the world seems so obscure  
I want you to be the one  
Who tells me off when I do wrong,  
And you know I can be bad  
I need you, I need you  
Say you'll stay, make my day  
Now what have I done,  
Was it something I said - oh dear  
I need you to turn me off,  
When you think I've said enough,  
To the extent of being a bore  
I need you to tell me no  
Slap my wrists and send me home  
Tell me I can't come again  
Now why are you crying -  
Have I gone too far - again  
I need you keep me straight,  
when the world don't seem so great  
and its hard enough you know  
I need you, I need you  
Say you'll stay  
Make my day
