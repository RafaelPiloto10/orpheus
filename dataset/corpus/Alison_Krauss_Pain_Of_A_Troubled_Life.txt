And I've lived a dozen lifetimes in twenty-some-odd years  
Got no use for trouble, got no use for tears  
Can't you see it's killing me, I'm old before my time  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
I've had my share of sorrow, more than you could know  
Save your lies and alibis, I've heard that tune before  
Can't you see it's killing me, I'm old before my time  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
You're out all night, asleep all day, so pack it up and leave  
I've got no use for trouble, trouble's using me  
Don't you see my love won't be forever deaf and blind  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
I've had my share of sorrow, more than you could know  
Save your lies and alibis, I've heard that tune before  
Can't you see it's killing me, I'm old before my time  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
I've had my share of sorrow, more than you could know  
Save your lies and alibis, I've heard that tune before  
Can't you see it's killing me, I'm old before my time  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
Can't you see that love can't be forever deaf and blind?
