Hearts of darkness  
Falling down,  
It's raining stones  
Fate is driving  
Now there's no meat  
On the bone  
There's a hurricane coming,  
What a bitter pill  
There's a distant drumming,  
Coming over the hill  
She took everything,  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
I'm just a fighting man,  
A fighting man  
  
Cold Wild Turkey  
Drives a spike right through my brain  
Bar room mothers  
Waiting for the gravy train  
  
It's a cold wind a blowing,  
Gone out of control  
Time is a running,  
Touching my very soul  
She took everything,  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
I'm just a fighting man,  
A fighting man  
  
Solo  
  
Ashes to ashes  
Trash is still trash  
It's only a moment now  
And we're gone in a flash  
  
Silver lining  
Where's the man  
With the master plan  
Hearts of darkness  
Spreading out  
All across this land  
  
There's a hurricane a'coming,  
What a bitter pill  
There's a distant drumming,  
Coming over the hill  
She took everything,  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
I'm just a fighting man,  
A fighting man  
  
She took everything,  
Got my jack in her hand  
I was born so now  
I'm just a fighting man,  
A fighting man  
Just a common man  
Just a common man
