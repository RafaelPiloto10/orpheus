Oh the the night is so still, not a baby will cry  
Not a chill wind will blow, disturbing the sky  
But there's no peace in me, I'm burning for you  
I'm walking the floor in the devil's shoes.  
  
When I get my rewards, I will bring them to you  
I shall ask for your love, and swear mine is true  
Will you cast me aside, and see me no more?  
How can I win your heart when I get my rewards?  
  
They say that your hair can never touch mine  
That a poor boy can't hope for a woman so fine  
But I work till I fall, determined to win  
Driven by need to see you again
