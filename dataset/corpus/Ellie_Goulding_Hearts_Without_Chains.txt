You wake up and you know it's time to go  
With spending heads I lie on what you smoke  
Chase the hands on the wall, can hold you close  
This misery is weightless as a stone  
  
Have you lost the scendings I have lost?  
Do you know that panic I know?  
Would I see the terror in your eyes  
Did you know that fever I know?  
I wish time was still  
We'd stay right here  
With time to keep in our hearts without chains  
  
And if time was still  
We'd have no fear, or scars to heal  
In our hearts without chains  
In our hearts without chains
