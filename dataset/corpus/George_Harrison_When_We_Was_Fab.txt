One! Two!  
Back then long time ago when grass was green  
Woke up in a daze  
Arrived like strangers in the night  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot doo)  
Long time ago when we was fab (Fab!)  
Back when income tax was all we had  
Caressers fleeced you in the morning light  
Casualties at dawn  
And we did it all  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot doo)  
Long time ago when we was fab (Fab)  
In my world you are my only love  
  
And while you're in this world  
The fuzz gonna come and claim you  
But you mo better wise  
When the buzz gonna come and take you away  
Take you away. Take you away  
  
The microscopes that magnified the tears  
Studied warts and all  
Still the life flowed on and on  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot, Gear!)  
Long time ago when we was fab (Fab)  
  
But it's all over now, baby blue  
(Oo! doot, doot doot. Fab!)  
Long time ago when we was fab  
(Fab!) Like this pullover you sent me  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot. Gear!)  
And you really got a hold on me  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot, Gear!)
