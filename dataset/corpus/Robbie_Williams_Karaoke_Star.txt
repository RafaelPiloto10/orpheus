Did you do that girl that was in that soap  
..... Did ya  
Will you save the whale,  
Will you be Bob Hope.... Will ya  
I'll tell you about my Pepsi deal if you like  
A celebrity village bike with a mike  
I get more press when there's a war on  
  
Come sing a song with me  
A simple symphony  
I'll be a karaoke star  
Lush strings and Timpani  
Have got it in for me  
Look how I'm dancing...love  
  
Justify what you get paid..Can ya  
Doctors save lives and you get laid  
...Dont ya  
Apologize for the job that you do  
It would be nice if you were talented too  
I think you better lock up your daughter  
  
Come sing a song with me  
My simple symphony  
I'll be a kareoke star  
Lush strings and Timpani  
Have got it in for me  
Look how I'm dancing...love  
  
(Instrumental
