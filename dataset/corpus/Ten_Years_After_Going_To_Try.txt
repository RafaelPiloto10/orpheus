I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try  
I'm gonna try and get my feet out of the sand  
  
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try  
I'm gonna try and find out where's the promised land  
  
Where are you?  
How do I know you're true, know you're true, know you're true?  
Now I can find what I want out of life, out of life  
  
I want to try, I want to try  
I want to try and find out where's the promised land  
  
I want to try, I want to try  
I want to try and get my feet out of the sand
