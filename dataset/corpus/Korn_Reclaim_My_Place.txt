What the fuck?!  
I'm so dumb, therefore I can't relate.  
I'm so dumb, there is nothing to hate.  
Really is it me, or is it fate?  
Give me peace, or release for fuck's sake.  
Give him something to say.  
Something super fly, never play.  
All I hear is disgrace.  
Erase them all and reclaim my place.  
In the past I was known as a freak.  
Had no friends, picked on 'cause I was weak.  
Save my ass, I got into this band,  
Never thought the band would pick on the man.  
Give him something to say.  
Something super fly, never play.  
All I hear is disgrace.  
Erase them all and reclaim my place.  
Reclaim my place  
  
Say it to my face.  
So I look around at all these stupid little faces.  
Something I can never slap, but I embrace.  
You'll never ever see, you'll never ever be,  
You wanna fuck around, then come fuck with me.  
You think you can't relate?  
You'll never ever find.  
You think you feel my hate?  
Look at me and you will find  
My fate you always raped?  
I will always be the son.  
You want to fuck with me?  
Come on, fucking play!  
  
Now!  
  
You can feel it now or be stoned!  
Yes, you feel it come, right now!  
You can feel it now or be stoned  
Yes, you feel it come, right now!  
You can feel it now or be stoned  
Yes, you feel it come, bow down!  
Bow down!  
  
Give him something to say.  
Something super fly, never play.  
All I hear is disgrace.  
Erase them all and reclaim my place.  
What the fuck?! So, what the fuck?
