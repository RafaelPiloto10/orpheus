You ask how long I'll love you  
It's hard to explain but I'll try  
Tell me how long has the sun been shining  
Above us in the sky?  
  
Till the last day of forever,  
If I have it my way we'll stay together  
Till the rivers run dry I'll be loving you.  
Till the mountains have crumbled  
I'll always be true  
And if for some reason you say goodbye  
Ask me how long I would cry  
Till all the rivers run dry  
  
This path that we're walking  
May be rough and rocky sometimes  
But we'll believe in one another  
Whatever we find  
  
And when you need a hand to guide you  
I will be there walking beside you  
Till the rivers run dry
