I never knew how much i'd miss your touch till you said good bye  
I never knew you'd hurt me too, till you made me cry  
It never seemed you ever dreamed of hurting me this way  
You said we're through what could i do i never knew  
(never knew)  
You left and you went away after saying never ever let me go oh  
  
Now it's over and you're gone and i'm alone to cry  
Oh yes it's true how i love you i never knew  
  
You left and you went away after saying never ever let me go oh  
Now it's over and you're gone and i'm alone to cry  
Oh yes it's true how i love you i never knew  
  
You left and you went away after saying never ever let me go oh  
Now it's over and you're gone and i'm alone to cry  
Oh yes it's true how i love you i never knew  
(I never never knew)
