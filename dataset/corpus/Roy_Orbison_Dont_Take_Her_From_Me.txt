If you don't really love her  
Don't take her from me  
Because I really love her  
And need her desperately  
  
If you don't plan to give  
All your love, for as long as you should live  
Don't take her from me  
  
If she's not something special  
Don't take her from me  
Because she's something special to me  
Can't you see?  
  
If she's not number one  
Every day, till your whole life is done  
Don't take her from me  
  
There is only one for me  
She is all there could ever be  
So don't take her from me
