Through the windswept coastal trees  
Where the dead come rising from the sea  
With a teddy-bear clamped between her knees  
She says, where can my loverman be?  
Well, I'm down here, babe, with the Eskimos With the polar bears and the
Arctic snow  
With a party of penguins who do not know flow  
How I can get back to thee  
Well I'm gonna ask you, babe  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby don't you go  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh no no no  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby, don't you go  
All supernatural on me  
Supernaturally  
  
Once I was your hearts desire  
Now I am the ape hunkered by the fire  
With my knuckles dragging through the mire  
You float by so majestically  
You're my north, my south, my east, my west  
You are the girl that I love best  
With an army of tanks bursting from your chest  
I wave my little white flag at thee  
Can you see it, babe?  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby don't you go  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh no no no  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby, don't you go  
All supernatural on me  
Supernaturally  
  
Now I've turned the mirrors to wall  
I've emptied out the peopled halls  
I've nailed shut the windows and locked the doors  
There is no escape, you see  
I chase you up and down the stairs  
Under tables and over chairs  
I reach out and I touch your hair  
And it cuts me like a knife  
For there is always something  
Other little thing you gotta do  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby don't you go  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh baby, no no no  
Hey! Ho!  
Oh don't you go  
All supernatural on me  
Supernaturally
