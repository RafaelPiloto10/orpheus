Uh! Got no card so I got not soul  
Life is prison, no parole, no control  
Tha jura got my number on a wire tap  
Cause I jack for similac, fuck a Cadillac  
Survive one motive no hope  
Cause every sidewalk I walk is like a tightrope  
Yes I know my deadline sire, when my life expires  
I'm sendin' paper south under tha barbed wire  
Tha mother of my child will lose her mind at my grave  
It's my life for their life so call it a free trade  
"Por vida" and our name up on tha stall  
I took a death trip when I tried ta cross tha white wall  
Walk unseen past tha graves an tha gates, born without a face  
One motive no hope ah, born without a face  
Walk unseen past tha graves an tha gates, born without a face  
One motive no hope ah, yeah, born without a face  
Without a face  
  
Yeah, I tried ta look back ta my past long lost  
A blood donor ta tha land owner holocaust  
Pops heart stopped, in came tha air drop  
Flooded tha trench he couldn't shake tha toxic shock  
Maize was all we needed ta sustain  
Now her golden skin burns, insecticide rain  
Ya down wit DDT yeah you know me  
Raped for tha grapes, profit for tha bourgeois (?)  
War tape boomin' path is Luminoso  
I'm headed north like my name was kid 'Cisco  
To survive one motive no hope, ah  
It's hard ta breathe wit Wilson's head around my throat  
Strangled and mangled another SS curtain call  
When I tried ta cross tha white wall  
When I tried ta cross tha white walls  
Walk unseen past tha graves an tha gates, born without a face  
One motive no hope ah, born without a face  
Walk unseen past tha graves an tha gates, born without a face  
One motive no hope ah, born without a face  
  
You say fortify, reaction, you divide  
And you say fortify, reaction, reaction  
And you say fortify, reaction, reaction  
You say fortify, reaction, you divide
