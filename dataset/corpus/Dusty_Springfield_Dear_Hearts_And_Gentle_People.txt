I love the dear heart, and gentle people  
Who live in my home town.  
Because the dear heart and gentle people will never, ever let you down.  
They read the good book from Friday till Monday.  
That's how the weekends go.  
I have a dream house I'll build there someday  
With picket fence and rambling rose.  
[Bridge:]  
I feel so welcome, each time that I return.  
My heart swells up just like a cloud.  
I love the dear heart and gentle people, who live and love in
