I know that you're sad  
I know that you're lonely  
You lie awake 'till way past when  
I want you to know  
  
That I'm leaving you only  
'Cause I might not get the chance again.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm cold and I'm tired  
And I can't stop coughing  
Long enough to tell you all of the news  
I'd like to tell you  
That I'll see you more often  
But often is a word I seldom use  
Often is a word I seldom use.  
  
Tell me, where did the weekend go?  
Tell me, where did the weekend go?  
Went like thunder, felt like snow.  
Went like thunder, felt like snow.  
  
You must think my life's a circus  
Watching me laughing  
And slapping my thighs  
How'd ya like to die  
  
In the house of mirrors  
With nobody around to close your eyes.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Going down to the Greyhound station  
Going back home  
And get what's mine  
Got me a date  
  
With the ten o'clock special  
Gonna be there at a quarter to nine.  
  
[Chorus]
