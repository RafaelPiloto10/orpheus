It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
I got a lady running through my head  
Ran out of money looking for a night shift.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
I know a lady way down in my country.  
She was so pretty that my eyes threw disguises at me.  
Now we will sit and we'll wonder about our future.  
But now I'm thinking that today sounds fine to me.  
Well I been working five days full time.  
Ain't got no money, but everything is going fine.  
Well, I been tired in my head.  
Well, I been tired in my head.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed  
I got a lady running through my head  
Ran out of money looking for a night shift  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed  
I know this lady whose eyes fly right through me  
And she will sit and stare directly at me.  
And that laugh will take me to my future.  
Throughout my past there is nothing left for me.  
But I been working five days full time .  
Ain't got no money but everything is going fine.  
I been tired in my head.  
Said I been tired in my head.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
I got a lady running through my head.  
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
I feel my lady late night she comes to me.  
Invades my mind reminds me of where we should be.  
So we just sit and we dream about our future.  
Throughout my past there is nothing left for me.  
But I've been thinking five days full time.  
Ain't got no money, but everything is going fine.  
But I've been tired in my head.  
Well I am tired in my head.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
I got a lady running through my head.  
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
My lady won't leave my head.  
I just want to rest my head to bed.  
She won't let me go.  
I don't want to go.
