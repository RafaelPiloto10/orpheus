So here we are tonight,  
You and me together  
The storm outside, the fire is bright  
And in your eyes I see  
What's on my mind  
You've got me wild  
Turned around inside  
And then desire, see, is creeping  
Up heavy inside here  
And know you feel the same way  
I do now  
  
Now let's make this an evening  
Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight  
Stay here with me, love, tonight  
Just for an evening  
When we make  
Our passion pictures  
You and me twist up  
Secret creatures  
And we'll stay here  
Tomorrow go back to being friends  
  
Go back to being friends  
But tonight let's be lovers,  
We kiss and sweat  
We'll turn this better thing  
To the best  
Of all we can offer, Just a rogue kiss  
Tangled tongues and lips,  
See me this way  
I'm turning and turning for you  
Girl, just tonight  
  
Float away here with me  
An evening just wait and see  
But tomorrow go back to your man  
I'm back to my world  
And we're back to being friends  
Wait and see me,  
Tonight let's do this thing  
All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours  
On our way here  
Tomorrow go back to being friends  
  
Go back to being friends  
Tonight let's be lovers, say you will  
And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love  
A thing or two I have to say here  
Tonight let's go all the way then  
Love I'll see you,  
Just for this evening  
Let's strip down, trip out at this  
One evening starts with a kiss  
Run away  
  
And tomorrow  
Back to being friends  
Lovers, love, lovers  
Just for tonight, one night, love you  
And tomorrow say goodbye
