Part of my love used to go to somebody else can't think of who disclosed to
you  
Some of my love used to stay head a way for myself  
Alone with you here's what I must do  
I've got to give you love with all of my heart and my soul  
I've got to feed you baby all of the love you've been hold  
I left the door open and you know just what to do  
I'll wait for you baby I've got to give it all to you  
[ fiddle - ac.guitar ]  
I've got to give you love with all of my heart and my soul  
I've got to feed you baby all of the love you've been hold  
He left the door open and I know just what to do  
I'll wait for you baby I've got to give it all to you
