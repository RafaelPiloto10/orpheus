Sit down darling  
Something I need to say  
I know it's gonna hurt you  
But we can't go on this way  
I can't bear the pain I'm going through  
I can't feel the tears you cry  
But I swear if this means losing you  
That a part of me will die  
  
How can I tell you  
What this heart of mine would say  
When everything I feel for you  
Has turned my head away  
I never meant to hurt you  
Even though I don't know why  
But I swear if this means losing you  
That a part of me will die  
  
  
And I could not stop loving you  
I couldn't do that if I tried  
When I told you all you meant to me  
It was true, I never lied  
Lord knows you've done everything  
To keep me satisfied  
But I swear if this means losing you  
That a part of me will die  
  
  
Oh I swear if this means losing you  
That a part of me will die  
I swear if this means losing you  
That a part of me will die  
Baby I know if this means losing you  
That a part of me will die, oh oh
