Well I wrote to Santa just today I told him I don't plan to stay  
Cause you've been bad yes you've been treatin' me wrong  
So listen to me here's Christmas cheers because you won't be with me here  
I won't decorate your Christmas tree this year  
You can stay out there to toast and cheer with all of your friends  
Don't hang on me a bein' here when you come back again  
Your bags are burnt out and your tinsel don't shine  
I just won't be a waitin' this time  
I won't decorate your Christmas tree this year

Well I won't be here this Christmas Day I wouldn't give the presents anyway  
But have a good time don't be concerned about me  
I'm going back to my mom and dad they love me more than you ever had  
I won't decorate your Christmas tree this year  
You can stay out there...  
No I won't decorate your Christmas tree this year
