The night we met  
The night that I won't forget  
You've seen what I've been waiting for  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
You held me tight  
And everything seemed just right  
I couldn't ask for more  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
She used to smile at me  
And hold my hand like you do  
Then she left me  
And broke my heart in two  
  
See her face  
And feel your warm embrace  
You're all that I adore  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
Oh baby, I've been wrong before
