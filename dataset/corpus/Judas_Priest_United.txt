Look around  
They're moving in  
Hold your ground  
When they begin  
  
We can do it  
We can do it and if they wanna they can try  
But they'll never get near  
Then they can get out of here  
  
Gonna keep on driving  
Never stop  
  
United, united, united we stand  
United we never shall fall  
United, united, united we stand  
United we stand one and all  
  
So keep it up  
Don't give in  
Make a stand  
We're gonna win  
  
We can do it  
We can do it and if they wanna they can try  
But they'll never get near  
Then they can get out of here  
  
Gonna keep on driving  
Never stop

United we never shall fall  
United, united, united we stand  
United we stand one and all
