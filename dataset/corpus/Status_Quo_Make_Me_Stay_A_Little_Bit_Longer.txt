When you look at me tell me what you see  
Do you see a man or just a jagged outline of one?  
Do you hear my words, or do they go straight through you?  
  
We get it together now and then  
But I can feel we won't again  
Still I can't stop this endless strain of you  
  
Listen to my words and talk the sadness that I bring you  
I'll leave you today, 'cos I am nothing to you  
  
Oh-oh make me stay a bit longer  
Make my heart and my body get stronger  
Make me stay, don't send me away or I'll be alone  
Make me stay a bit longer  
Make my heart and my body get stronger  
Make me stay, don't send me away or I'll be alone
