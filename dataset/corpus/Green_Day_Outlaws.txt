[Verse 1]  
Life after youth  
Faded in twilight  
The dawn of a criminal in bloom  
First love  
First forgiveness  
We were delinquants  
Freaks of a faded memory  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Outlaws, When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
We're outlaws of redemption, baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
We're Outlaws of forever, baby  
[Verse 2]  
Scars, broken hearts  
Breaking in cars  
Running in the light of the moon  
Lost souls  
Bottle rockets  
All that we wanted  
It's for our lives beyond stars  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Outlaws, When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
We're outlaws of redemption, baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
We're Outlaws of forever, baby  
  
[Bridge]  
I've got no supervision  
Nothing will change my spirits  
Race around with my innocence  
I'll plead my innocence  
But thats my best defense  
When you are young  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Outlaws, When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
We're outlaws of redemption, baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
We're outlaws all forever  
  
[Outro]  
I found a knife by the railroad track  
You took a train and you can't go back  
Forever now, forever now you'll roam
