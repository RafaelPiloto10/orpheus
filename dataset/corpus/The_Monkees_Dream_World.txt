Walking around with your head in the clouds  
You don't care  
Why must you walk when you know  
You're not going anywhere  
  
[Chorus]  
Why don't you come out of your dream world  
It's not real  
It's not the way it seems to be  
Why don't you come into the real world  
Come with me  
We'll share our thoughts, forget the dreams  
You'll see  
  
Always pretending that everything's fine  
When it's not  
Why must you lie when you know that  
You'll always get caught  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
You'll see  
You'll see
