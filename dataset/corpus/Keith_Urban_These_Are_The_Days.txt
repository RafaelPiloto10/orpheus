My grandma was a wise old soul  
Took me by the hand not long ago  
Said, "Son, what's your hurry, boy slow it down  
Taste the wild honey, listen to the sound  
Of the wind that's blowin' through the trees  
Rivers flowin' to the sea  
Yeah they're all headin' home just like you and me  
Life's for livin' child, can't you see that?"  
  
These are the days we will remember  
And these are the times that won't come again  
The highest of flames become an ember  
And you gotta live 'em while you can  
  
These are the days we will remember [Repeat: x4]  
  
So take 'em by the hand, they're yours and mine  
Take 'em by the hand and live your life  
Take 'em by the hand don't let 'em all fly by  
C'mon, c'mon now  
  
Oh days go by  
Yeah, just like a hand out the window wavin' in the wind as the cars go by  
Days go by
