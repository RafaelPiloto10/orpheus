And I feel that time's a wasted go  
So where ya going to tomorrow?  
And I see that these are lies to come  
Would you even care?  
And I feel it  
And I feel it  
Where ya going to tomorrow?  
Where ya going with that mask I found?  
And I feel, and I feel  
When the dogs begin to smell her  
Will she smell alone?  
And I feel, so much depends on the weather  
So is it raining in your bedroom?  
And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray  
Would you even care?  
And I feel it  
And she feels it  
Where ya going to tomorrow?  
Where ya going with that mask I found?  
And I feel, and I feel  
When the dogs begin to smell her  
Will she smell alone?  
When the dogs do find her  
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
