You could have a steam train  
If you'd just lay down your tracks  
You could have an aeroplane flying  
If you bring your blue sky back  
  
All you do is call me  
I'll be anything you need  
  
You could have a big dipper  
Going up and down, all around the bends  
You could have a bumper car, bumping  
This amusement never ends  
  
I want to be your sledgehammer  
Why don't you call my name  
Oh let me be your sledgehammer  
This will be my testimony  
  
Show me round your fruit cages  
'Cause I will be your honey bee  
Open up your fruit cages  
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be  
  
I want to be your sledgehammer  
Why don't you call my name  
I'm going to be-the sledgehammer  
This can be my testimony  
I'm your sledgehammer  
Let there be no doubt about it  
  
Sledge sledge sledgehammer  
  
I kicked the habit (I kicked the habit)  
She'd my skin (Shed my skin)  
This is the new stuff (This is the new stuff)  
I go dancing in, (We could go dancing in)  
Oh won't you show for me (Show for me)  
I will show for you (Show for you)  
Show for me (Show for me), I will show for you  
  
Yea, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do mean you  
Only you, you've been coming through  
Going to build that power  
Build, build up that power, hey  
I've been feeding the rhythm  
I've been feeding the rhythm  
Going to feel that power, build in you  
  
Come on, come on, help me do  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you  
I've been feeding the rhythm  
I've been feeding the rhythm  
It's what we're doing, doing  
All day and night, come on and help me do, come on and help me do
