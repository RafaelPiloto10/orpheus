Ain't it strange how people change and almost overnight  
Who once was a country girl is now a, a socialite  
We're proud for you, but when you're through  
And seek some common ground  
Oh, we miss you on the old side of town  
We still drink cokes and tell old jokes and bowl at Splits and Strikes  
Country music still plays on the jukebox every night  
Society is not for me, but I can still be found  
Oh, we miss you on the old side of town  
RSVP is not for me and black tie's not my style  
I thought you'd like to know 'cause you ain't been here for awhile  
We read about your tour de force, we're glad you get around  
But we miss you on the old side of town  
We still drink cokes and tell old jokes and we bowl at Splits and Strikes  
George Jones is still a hero on the jukebox every night  
Society is not for me, but I can still be found  
Oh, we miss you on the old side of town  
Babe, we miss you on the old side of town
