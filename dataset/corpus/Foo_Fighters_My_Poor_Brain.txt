Real life is so hard  
We hide in the stars  
That's where our heads are  
My head and your heart  
  
This is a blackout  
Don't let it go to waste  
This is a blackout  
I want to detonate  
  
When you are so far  
I'm falling part  
Lose all my sonar  
You jam my radar  
  
This is a blackout  
Don't let it go to waste  
This is a blackout  
I want to detonate  
  
Sometimes I feel I'm getting stuck  
Between the handshake and the fuck  
You've got me on guard  
I've got my head start  
My head and your heart  
The same in the stars  
  
This is a blackout  
Don't let it go to waste  
This is a blackout  
I want to detonate  
  
Sometimes I feel I'm getting stuck  
Between the handshake and the fuck  
Brain, brain, brain, brain  
Okay
