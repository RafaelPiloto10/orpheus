If you feel today that you can't make it  
Keep holdin' on, cause you can take it  
If you hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on  
  
If you feel it's raining all in your life  
And day by day, there's nothin'  
Nothin' going right  
Just hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on  
Hold on  
  
You gotta hold to His hand  
God's unchanging hand  
You gotta hold to His hand  
God's unchanging hand  
You gotta build your hopes on things eternal  
My God will never let you down  
  
Weeping may endure for the night  
But if you trust in Jesus  
Everything's gonna be all right  
Just hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on  
Hold on
