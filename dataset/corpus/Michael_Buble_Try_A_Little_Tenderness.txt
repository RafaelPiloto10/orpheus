I may get weary  
Women do get weary  
Wearing the same shabby dress  
But to one who's weary  
Try a little tenderness  
  
She may be waiting  
Just anticipating  
All of the things  
She may never possess  
But while she's waiting  
Try a little tenderness  
  
I may be sentimental  
But I've had my griefs  
And my cares  
And just a good word  
Soft and gentle  
Makes it, makes it  
So much easier to bear  
  
She might forget it  
Oh but don't let her forget it  
Love's got a whole  
A whole happiness  
'cause it's so easy  
Try a little tenderness  
  
Oh it's so very easy  
It's so very easy  
Try a little  
Try a little  
Try a little  
Try a little  
Try a little  
  
Try a little, try a little  
Won't you  
'cause it's so very easy  
So very easy  
Won't you try  
Yes, I'll try  
Try a little tender -  
Tender -  
-ness  
I'll try a little tenderness
