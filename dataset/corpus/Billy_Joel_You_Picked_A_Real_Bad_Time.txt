Don't get me wrong,  
I ain't the kind  
To turn away from you  
When something's on your mind.  
  
But you have to know,  
You just have to see,  
I'm having my troubles, babe,  
And they're all too much for me.  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
Tell me, why you try  
To give me aggravation  
You picked a real bad time  
'Cause this man's got the blues  
  
Don't get me wrong,  
You're not alone  
And I'd like to help you  
But I've got problems of my own  
  
It's a bitter phase  
I'm going through  
And I can run from strangers, darlin',  
But I just can't hide from you.  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
Tell me, why you try  
To give me aggravation  
You picked a real bad time  
And I got time to lose  
  
Ain't it the truth  
When they say  
That the only thing worth dying for  
Is our freedom  
Ain't it the proof  
That someday  
We will all be lying on our backs  
Free at last from income tax  
  
Don't you get me wrong  
The mood won't last  
And I'll be myself again  
Soon as this pain has passed  
  
And I'm standing here,  
Don't ask me how,  
I'll make it up to you,  
Someday but not right now  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
You caused a real hard line  
To invade my isolation  
You picked a real bad time  
'Cause this man's got the blues  
  
Ain't it the truth  
When they say  
All you need is love but all you'll want is forgiveness  
Ain't it the proof  
That someday  
Even love will not provide for man  
The way that life insurance can  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me  
Why you tryin' to give me aggravation  
You picked a real bad time, cause this man's got the blues.
