We're living in a constant fight  
Too much pressure everywhere  
And all around  
  
Don't let it pull you down  
Hold on tight  
Cling to your dreams  
  
Don't you depend on someone else  
Think for yourself and win the race  
  
The chance you got comes never twice  
Do your best, (and) do it right  
  
Time will come but don't you hide  
You are on your way  
  
You're led by God but you're not a pawn  
Should live your life, don't care 'bout any scorn  
  
Just let them fool around  
No need to cry  
Don't give up  
  
Try to be as smart as you can be  
I know you own so much ability
