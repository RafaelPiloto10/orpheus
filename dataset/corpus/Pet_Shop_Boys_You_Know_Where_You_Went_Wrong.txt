Two men on the street  
Drinking something cheap  
No home, no family  
It's cold, nowhere to sleep  
Passers-by never catch their eye  
Anywhere, one man drinks, the other swears  
  
[Chorus]  
You know where you went wrong  
You know where you went wrong  
You know  
You know where you went wrong  
You know where you went wrong  
You know  
  
The old man can't understand  
No one will shake his hand  
I gave security, bombs and colour TV  
It cost a few lives  
Someone's son always dies  
No one shakes his hand  
He don't understand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the history of the world  
Of every boy and every girl  
Who don't understand what's going on anymore  
The history of the world  
Of every boy and every girl  
Who don't understand what's going on anymore  
  
Two girls have a photograph  
One looks, the other laughs  
He could have been mine  
Why did I change my mind?  
Then hands on hips  
The other girl says: Admit! Admit!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the history of the world (of the world)  
Of every boy and every girl  
Who don't (who don't) understand (understand)  
What's going on anymore (what's going on?)  
The history of the world (oh)  
Of every boy and every girl (Every boy and girl)  
Who don't (who don't) understand (understand)  
What's going on anymore (what's going on?)  
  
[Chorus: x5]
