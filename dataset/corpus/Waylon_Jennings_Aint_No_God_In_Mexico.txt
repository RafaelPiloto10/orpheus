Down the road a ways I have heard say a new day's comin' on  
Where the woman folks are friendly and the law leaves you alone.  
Well I'll believe it when I see it but I haven't seen it yet.  
Don't mind me just keep on talkin' I am just looking for my hat.  
  
Ain't no God in Mexico  
Ain't no way to understand  
How that border crossing feeling makes a fool out of a man.  
If I had not seen the sunshine Hell I would not cuss your rain  
My feet would fit a railroad track  
I would made one Hell of a train.  
  
Me and Louise Higginbotham use to race across the yard  
Back in 1947 that's when more than times were hard  
Well pity me I didn't see the line in time and like a fool  
In front of God and everybody I politely blew my cool  
  
Ain't no God in Mexico ain't no comfort in the can  
When your down in Matamoras gettin' busted by the man  
If I had not seen the sunshine I would not cuss your rain.  
If my feet would fit a railroad track I guess I would have been a train
