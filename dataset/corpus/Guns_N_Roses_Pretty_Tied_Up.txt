(the perils of rock n' roll decadence)  
  
I know this chick she lives down on Melrose  
She ain't satisfied without some pain  
Friday night is goin' up inside her...again  
Well crack the whip  
'Cause that bitch is just insane  
I'm serious  
  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
I can't tell you she's the right one  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Once there was this rock n' roll band  
Rollin' on the streets  
Time went by and it became a joke  
We just needed more and more fulfilling... uh-huh  
Time went by and it all went up in smoke  
But check it out  
  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
Ohh I can't tell you she's the right one  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Once you made that money it costs more now  
It might cost a lot more than you'd think  
I just found a million dollars  
that someone forgot  
It's days like this that push me o'er the brinks  
Cool and stressing  
[pronounced: cool ranch dres'ing]  
  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
And I can't tell you she's the right one  
Oh she's the right one ...(etc.)  
  
(but I can tell you a thing or two  
'bout somethin' else  
If you really want to know...know what I'm sayin')
