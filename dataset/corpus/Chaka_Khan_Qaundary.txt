I've seen you happy  
I've seen you low  
I've watched your prosper  
I've watched your grow  
But you're so unhappy  
And you should know  
That you need me now  
  
You've got your money  
You've got your pride  
You're so cute, you're so funny  
And you can't hide  
But there's something wrong here  
But I'm on your side  
And you need me now  
  
Chorus:  
You're aching  
There's no mistaking  
I've seen it before  
You're faking  
Your heart is breaking  
Get off the floor  
  
I hope there's something you let me do  
I live and love because of you  
And I set my sights with you in view  
So let's make a vow  
You live in a quandary  
You're blessed and cursed  
They say they love you  
But I saw you first  
And you think you could love me  
But you're unrehearsed  
So I'll show you how  
  
Chorus  
  
You hur inside  
You can't hide  
It's all up to you  
You hurt inside  
You lost all your pride  
It all comes down to you
