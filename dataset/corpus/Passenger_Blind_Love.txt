Trying to hold a love that wants to go  
Is like trying to catch a falling flake of snow  
It glimmers while it can but it will melt between your hands, you know  
To keep alive a love that wants to die  
You teach the birds to swim, and all the fish to fly  
But gills are made for water, and feathers for the sky, y'know  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)  
  
To find a love that's new where do you start?  
It's like trying to find the light switch in the dark  
But falling over mess you left unaddressed inside your heart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)  
  
But I will find love, that's a blind love  
It's the kind of love I need  
Oh well I'll find love, that's a blind love  
It's the kind of love I need  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x4)
