Say you want to rip it up  
Paint the town red  
Wanna do the hot spots  
Get it in the head  
You drive me crazy  
I know your game  
You done it all before  
You'll do it all again  
  
You say yes, I say no  
  
My blood's on fire  
I grit my teeth  
You're nothin' but a teaser  
Gimme some relief  
I'm lookin' at the bottle  
Sinkin' to the floor  
I gotta white knuckles  
Can't take it anymore  
  
You say yes, I say no  
  
What do you treat me so  
What I do, I do for you
