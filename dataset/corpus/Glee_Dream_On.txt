Every time that I look in the mirror  
All these lines on my face getting clearer  
The past is gone  
It went by, like dusk to dawn  
Isn't that the way  
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay  
  
Yeah, I know nobody knows  
Where it comes and where it goes  
I know it's everybody's sin  
You got to lose to know how to win  
  
Half my life  
Is in books' written pages  
Lived and learned from fools and  
From sages  
You know it's true  
All the things come back to you  
  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears  
Sing with me, if it's just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good lord will take you away, yeah  
  
Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, if it's just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good Lord will take you away  
  
Dream on, dream on, dream on  
Dream until the dream come true  
Dream on, dream on, dream on  
Dream until your dream comes true  
Dream on, dream on, dream on  
Dream on, dream on  
Dream on, dream on  
  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, if it's just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good Lord will take you away  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laugh, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, if it's just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good Lord will take you away
