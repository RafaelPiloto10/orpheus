Well you're walking on the moon  
But there's nothing  
No there's nothing left to do deep inside  
And you can't believe it's real  
Got ya thinking boy  
(You) may be better off to stay than to slide  
Lucky boy!  
But now she's falling close to you  
And there are things that just cannot last forever  
And there is nothing I can say that is possibly kind  
But I'm about to make the time  
Cause I'm about to lose my mind  
And you think you're on the move  
But there's nothing  
No there's nothing left to breathe deep inside  
And you say it's in the wheels,  
God it's stinkin' boy  
Well you know that all you said was a lie  
Lucky boy!  
But now she's falling close to you  
And there are things that just cannot last forever  
And there is nothing I can say that is possibly kind  
But I'm about to make the time  
Cause I'm about to lose my mind  
And I'm about to make the time  
Cause I'm about to lose my mind  
Yes I'm about to make the time  
Oohhhh  
I do it  
We're gonna do it  
Gotta stop and take it slow  
You blew it  
They're gonna screw it  
Gotta stop and steal the show  
You count the ways  
You stop it!  
And you say you're on the move  
But there's nothing  
No there's nothing left to do deep inside  
And you can't believe it's real  
Got ya thinkin' boy  
Maybe better off to stay than to die  
Thinkin' boy  
But now she's falling close to you  
And there are things that just cannot last forever  
And there is nothing I can say that is possibly kind  
But I'm about to make the time  
Cause I'm about to lose my mind  
And I'm about to make the time  
Cause I'm about to lose my mind  
But I'm about to make the time  
Oohhhh!
