Sipping a sangria with a girl named Julia  
Hot Jamaican sand beneath our feet  
She purred like a cat in a Panama hat  
She said my passport picture was unique  
I said I did impersonations would you like to see  
Turned around to buy her one more round  
  
Then suddenly she disappeared  
Like I feared with another guy  
Love always seems to let me down  
Can be found anywhere around  
  
The carnival had passed  
And my heart was beating fast  
All these married women, it ain't fair  
Nervously I said would you like to come to bed  
A cold silence pierced the evening air  
Instantly she recognized my insecurities  
Changing subjects quickly I agreed  
  
Then suddenly she disappeared  
Like I feared with another guy, oo baby  
Love always seems to let me down  
Can be found anywhere around  
Nowhere around  
  
The tourist had all gone, winter's coming on  
The hotel chambermaid didn't seem to care  
Sharing a pina colada we broke into laughter  
I'll never know how we made it up the stairs  
We spent the night together  
And she woke up in my arms  
Kissed me tenderly and said goodbye  
  
Then suddenly she disappeared  
Like I feared with another guy, oo baby  
Love always seems to let me down  
Can be found anywhere around  
Nowhere around  
  
Love always seems to let me down  
Maybe I'll wait until next year, next year, next year
