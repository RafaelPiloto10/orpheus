I was born by a river  
Rolling past a town  
Given no direction  
Just told to keep my head down  
As I took my position  
A man fired a gun  
I was so steeped in tradition  
That I could not run  
I was raised by a river  
Weaned upon the sky  
And in the mirror of the waters  
I saw myself learn to cry  
As my tears hit the surface  
I saw what had been done  
I gave feet to my freedom  
And I did run  
Someday later  
I saw the writing in the dust  
It told me how I should travel  
It told me who I was  
I ran far from the river  
Far as I could see  
And as the sun hit my shoulders  
I felt it burning me  
How I longed for the waters  
As the fire raged  
How I longed for the river  
As I aged  
I will die by a river  
As it rolls away  
Bury me in the nighttime  
Do not waste the day  
High above the waters  
That roll on to the sea  
All the angels in heaven  
Will laugh at me  
They will laugh at me  
My life was naught but a river  
Rolling through my brain  
Made of so many teardrops  
Made of so much pain
