They say evrything can be replaced,  
Yet every distance is not near.  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
They say every man needs protection,  
They say every man must fall.  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some place so high above this wall.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,  
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.  
All day long I hear him shout so loud,  
Crying out that he was framed.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.
