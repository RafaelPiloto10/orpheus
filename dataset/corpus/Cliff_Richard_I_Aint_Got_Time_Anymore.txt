Got no time to stop to speak to friends passing by  
Got no strength to wipe away the tears from my eyes  
I don't care what's going on  
Only know she's gone  
  
The sun don't shine anymore  
And I don't feel fine anymore  
She ain't mine anymore  
No, I don't feel fine anymore  
I ain't got time anymore  
  
Seems to be such sadness in each place I go  
The people laugh and still I just wouldn't know  
Never stop to see who's there  
Once I used to care  
  
But the sun don't shine anymore  
I don't feel fine anymore  
She ain't mine anymore  
No, I don't feel fine anymore  
I ain't got time anymore  
  
I can't get used to being left on my own  
It takes up all the time just trying to be alone  
Used to take an interest in the state of affairs  
Now I only know how much I'm missing that girl  
Hope the world will understand I can't lend a hand  
  
'Cause she ain't mine anymore  
I don't feel fine anymore  
She ain't mine anymore  
No, I don't feel fine anymore  
Ain't got time anymore  
  
She ain't mine anymore  
I don't feel fine anymore  
Ain't got time anymore  
She ain't mine anymore  
No, I don't feel fine anymore
