Hang glide for my nigga Tical  
Yo, word to God we run this whole shit Son (no doubt)  
Right that's my word, guaranteed you're dealin with the invicible (no doubt)  
(I'm specialized in swordsmanship)  
That's my word, Persian Legacy one time, one time  
That's the science of the black man  
Stationary niggas, have fun on this right here  
Yo Shorty cross your arms  
Gonna rock niggas to sleep this year (throw your leather up)  
  
Blade thrower, sword swinga, killa bee ringer  
Rocky road roll dark greener  
Cream fademas, name your God Ukarema  
Shout out Medina, federaloes Noxzema  
Me jury cleaner, Million Man March screamers  
Rae Cartegna, cut your joint Wolverine  
The Longines, wrapped around the wrist, law seen her  
How I got that yo, threw out the macker named Gina  
Bust a shot, seen her, it richocheted, tapped Tina  
Now I'm out, lampin in Korea with Talima  
We moseyin, sweatsuit Adidas, best believe  
I got the black heater little joint, probably Moschino  
Yo Bobby Robby whattup, Max tried to follow me  
Sadaam loungin, clean up collect, like the laundry  
It's time yo swerve like the Nike line  
Windbreaker Laker throw a jump shot scrape her  
Statuary yo floatin that snatch-uary  
Ayo, blow a hole in your limo, weed pass the dutch  
  
Yo this is MC wizardry, killa bee invasion  
Men of respect, blessed with wisdom of the ancients  
My words are blatant, lacerate necks for statements  
I launch like lead projectiles, straight out the basement  
I suplex your rep, left ruined like the Aztecs  
Parasites, double edge dice your larynx  
My hip-hop, is quarantined locked inside the detox  
Under keep lock, it's like b-block and E-Glocks  
You're ill, your trail end thoughts are frail  
I strike the cypher, and let one survive to tell the tale  
Of my state of grace, I raise the stakes on snakes  
Knock em off like the big eights for takin up space  
Never did fear em, stick em with the truth serum  
Who sent em, arrest em before my charge is ended  
Designated hitter flows split the transistor  
Kinetic globes light when it shine, burns your retina  
Urban journal, plus eternal broadcaster  
Before and after, I be Self Lord And Master  
  
I be the Ironside, get touched, with the chloride  
Take walk with the Nine Finger bandits worldwide  
Shaolin hillside, full of homicides  
Fuck you dissatisfied the double dyed black brown I advise  
  
Yo, box talk sequence, powerhouse kick out  
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out  
I'm direct, golden best, golden chest is blessed  
Scarce chapter, snatcher batcher went to fresh  
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich  
You get buckshot, dumb be clapped, mummy wrapped and stitched  
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Damer sing the song the strongest  
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus  
Shank you with the think tank, harmony cake cut  
A can of ass whoopin' flurry shake, break you fucks  
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin' hooks  
Chef cocaine cook, a marvelous book  
This death bent doctrine, paper for the youth  
What remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth  
  
Last night, I took a trip down to Crown Heights  
Fast life, females are trife, stay tight  
I detect that parasite, satellite  
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows  
My slang sound write secretary type  
Backflip on the mic, I'm the poor black man  
Workin' hard for the grand, I understand clear  
Don't fear, peep my new gear it's different from yours  
My style drop like jaws, you see me on tours  
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street  
Put my technology on the track, just then the core attack  
Wu article CappaFive, CD attack  
But my talk stage live killa beehive  
Bermuda my life angle, rectangle gold fronts  
Bring the gold dangle, never make me throw darts  
Check out my arts, when I release my smarts  
Hot like Pop Tarts, aim me at the charts
