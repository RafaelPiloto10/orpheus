This big town is a shelter for me  
I found a place to hide my misery  
I lost my love so long ago  
And though my heart is hurting so  
The one I love will never know  
As long as I stay  
  
In this big town I find the peace of mind  
That only losers in the game of love can find  
The years have gone crawling by  
This hurt I feel will never die  
Somehow I know deep down inside  
I'll never get away from this big town  
From this big town  
  
In this big town there's a street of misery  
And on the street there's a dwelling place for me  
In the darkness of my room I try  
To sleep but all I do is cry  
And still I realize that  
I am ever lucky to be here  
  
In this big town so no one else can see  
Just what your cheating heart has done to me  
The glimmer of the city lights  
The shadows of the lonely nights  
Will help to hide me while I cry  
A hundred dreaded tears  
  
In this big town  
In this big town  
In this big town  
In this big town  
In this big town
