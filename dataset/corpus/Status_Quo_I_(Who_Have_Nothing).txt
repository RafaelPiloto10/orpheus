I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no-one  
Adore you and want you so  
I'm just a no-one with nothing to give you, but oh  
I love you  
  
He'll, he'll buy you diamonds  
Bright sparkling diamonds  
But believe me, hear what I say  
That he can give you the world, but he'll never love you the way  
I love you  
  
He can take you any place you want  
To fancy clubs and restaurants  
But I can only watch you with  
My nose pressed up against the window pane  
Yeah, you know that you are loved  
  
But I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no-one  
Must watch you go dancing by  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else, when darling, 'tis I  
Who loves you  
  
I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no-one  
Must watch you go dancing by  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else, when darling,'tis I  
Who loves you  
  
(Spoken) I need you girl, I have nothing without you  
I love you girl, I am just nothing without you
