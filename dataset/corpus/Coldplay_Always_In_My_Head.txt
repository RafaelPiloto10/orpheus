I think of you  
I haven't slept  
I think I do  
But I don't forget  
My body moves  
Goes where I will  
But though I try my heart stays still  
It never moves  
Just won't be left  
So my mouth waters to be a fate  
And you're always in my head  
You're always in my head  
You're always in my head  
You're always in my head  
  
You're always in my head  
You're always in my head  
Always in my  
You're always in my  
  
This I guess is to tell you you're choosing out of the rest
