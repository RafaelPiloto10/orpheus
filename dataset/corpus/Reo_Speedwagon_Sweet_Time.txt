When I awaken  
Feelin no pain  
Visibly shaken  
Waitin to touch you again  
My temperature's risin  
But I'm fallin a bit behind  
And that ain't so surprising  
We're gonna take our own sweet time  
  
Baby, we can take our own sweet time  
And spend it when we want to  
'Cus it's yours and mine  
Let our love come easy and we fin  
We can make it  
And we'll take our own sweet time  
  
I know when I hold you  
It's a feelin I can't explain  
But I never told you  
I couldn't take it again  
But now I am ready  
I am ready to make you mine  
So I'm holdin steady  
And we're gonna take our own sweet time  
  
Baby, we can take our own sweet time  
And spend it when we want to  
'Cus it's yours and mine  
Let our love come easy and we find  
We can make it  
And we'll take our own sweet time  
[Repeat]  
  
Baby, we can take our own sweet time  
And spend it when we want to  
'Cus it's yours and mine  
Let our love come easy and we find  
We can make it  
And we'll take our own  
We can make it  
And we'll take our own  
We can make it  
And we'll take our own sweet time
