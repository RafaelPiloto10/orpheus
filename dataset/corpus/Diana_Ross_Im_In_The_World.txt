I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
I must be part of it  
At last convinced  
To the right of it  
I'm in the world  
For some reason or another  
Sometimes I get up  
And sometimes I don't bother  
But I'm here  
I'm here for, oh Lord, who knows?  
My light gets dim  
Then it glows, ooh yeah  
I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
And being what it is  
I've learnt to look  
To look beyond the tears  
I'm in the world  
Though hearts don't break even  
I'll take my chances  
'Cause it ain't about leaving  
I'm here  
I'm here and I won't apologize  
Maybe at the end there'll be a surprise  
Oh, yeah  
'Cause I'm in the world  
Good or bad  
I'm in the world  
Yes, I'm here  
I'm in the world  
I'm here, I'm here  
I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
I'm here  
I'm in the world  
Oh, yes, oh, yes  
I'm in the world  
Good or bad  
I'm here in the world
