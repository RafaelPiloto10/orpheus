I've been praying all the week through  
At home, at work and on the bus  
I've been praying I can keep you  
And to earn enough for us  
  
I can take humiliation  
And hurtful comments from the boss  
I'm just praying by the weekend  
I can earn enough for us  
  
Found a house that won't repair itself  
With it's windows cracking  
And a roof held together with holes  
Just because we're on the bottom of the ladder  
We shouldn't be sadder  
Than others like us  
Who have goals for the betterment of life  
Glad that you want to be my wife, but honest  
I've been praying all the week through  
At home at work and on the bus  
I've been praying I can keep you  
And to earn enough for us  
  
So you're saying that we're going to be three  
Now, a father's what I'll be  
Don't get me wrong, I'm so proud  
But the belt's already tight  
I'll get another job at night, but honest  
  
I can take humiliation  
And hurtful comments from the boss  
I'm just praying by the weekend  
I can earn enough for us  
Just because we're at the bottom of the ladder  
We shouldn't be sadder  
Than others like us  
Who have goals for the betterment of life  
Glad that you want to be my wife, but honest  
  
I can take humiliation  
And hurtful comments from the boss  
I'm just praying by the weekend  
I can earn enough for us  
I can earn enough for us
