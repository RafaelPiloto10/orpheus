You know they saying since the bar back on the 'dro, he lackin the flow  
And if that ever happen whoa I ain't rapping no more  
I'm good with a pina, daq and an o  
Gagging and choke like ho put the dick back in your throat  
Still packing fo sho  
Yeezy Weezy off of the heezy fo sheezy  
Cruise with the top off of the 'Ghini  
Bars got cheese I got cheddar linguine  
That's why I keep the federals scheming  
That's why I keep the platinum blinging  
Every diamond's like a nice size  
I help people with problems look at the bright side  
With nice ties on a rise so they sitting me high  
And the rims born in '79  
Weezy carry the nine glocks  
Slipping they goin' have to get six niggas name called carry a pine box  
Marry me ma, not  
But here's what you can do to me  
Give me good brains tutor me  
W-E-E-Z-why Wee  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
They call me Weezy Weezy fo sheezy  
Banana clip on the heater  
Banana whip on them sneakers  
Banana dick going deeper  
  
Got a good game honestly so respect the young'n  
Got your girl undercover like a detective woman  
I'm a mess blow a vest to onion and I'll test your stomach  
And the pistols right next to him cousin  
I'm a player having sex with dozens  
Sex with cousins hoes dissed with husbands  
My pants is down her dress is up  
Her head down and her neck is tough  
She suck till I say, "That's enough!"  
We fuck till her ass fractured up  
And when I nut no shower bitch pack your stuff

Got so many pictures of Ben Franklin  
High top tennis on the car cover of the whole game cold  
Fuck it up with me niggas come from all angles  
Representing S-Q like the Star Spangled

Low top Nikes plus my ho pop Nikes  
How exciting we riding in the third lane  
Said she like Juvy but prefer Wayne  
She can give me head  
Call her birdbrain on everything

My neck more colorful then Nelly, Murph, Ky, Ali

Low seats in the old drop blow reef

Swiftly no tops on the whippy  
Cash Money hot Bizzy Lil Wizzy get with me
