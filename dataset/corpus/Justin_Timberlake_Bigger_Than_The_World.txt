I think my heart might explode  
Cause now I feel the weight  
Of your love on me now  
From my head down to my toes  
Cause I can't handle nothin' else  
  
I'm starring at the mirror at these clothes  
That is funny, they mean about as much as yesterday  
Something is calling me home, me home  
I can hear your voice and I'm not afraid  
  
Now I know I'm just a girl  
Trying to make my way through this life  
Now I feel bigger then the world  
With your hand in mine  
  
Like a speeding bullet  
Trying to make my way back through the night  
And now I feel bigger then the world  
With your hand in mine  
  
Boy, I'll take care of the storm  
Let's sneek right pass the cloud of where it sworn  
And I can handle the people  
There just pebble's on the long, long road  
  
I'm starring at the sky at those stars  
And it's funny, they seem about as far as tomorrow  
Something is calling me home, me home  
And I'm not afraid no  
  
Cause I can see everything from high above  
The Earth is a little place next to my love  
I can be strong here where you are  
Just look for me in the sky, I'm not that far  
  
Now I know I'm just a girl  
Trying to make my way through this life  
Now I feel bigger then the world  
With your hand in mine  
  
Like a speeding bullet  
Trying to make my way back through the night  
And now I feel bigger then the world  
With your hand in mine  
  
Now I feel bigger then the trees  
That holds the leaves  
Bigger then the mountains  
That touch the see  
Bigger then the night  
That needs to stay  
Bigger then the waves  
That crash the bay  
  
Bigger oh ooh, bigger oh ooh  
Bigger oh ooh, oh oh ooh
