It's all of our birthdays this summer  
One number older, another year younger  
I'll go to your party, you'll come to mine  
We've given up cigarettes, we've given up wine  
We've given up caffeine and sworn off desserts  
I don't try to seduce you, we don't even flirt  
We're too good to be happy, too straight to be sad  
So just blow out the candles, Happy Birthday  
  
Stay out of the ocean, stay out of the sun  
Stay in perfect shape and be number one  
We've got brilliant excuses for having no fun  
So blow out the candles, Happy Birthday  
  
Make love in the microwave  
Think of all the time you'll save  
And don't forget to make it look  
As though you're working very very hard  
  
But I'll be your lover if you will be mine  
We'll go back to the garden and have a good time  
And if I'm offered an apple, I'll politely decline  
And just blow out the candles  
Happy Birthday
