Baby, you understand me now  
Though sometimes you see that I am mad  
No-one can always be an angel  
When everything goes wrong, you'll see some bad  
  
But I'm just a soul, who's intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Sometimes I'm so care-free, with the joy that's hard to hide  
Most of the time, I'm so full of worries  
And then you're bound to see my other side  
  
But I'm just a soul, who's intentions are good  
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood  
Don't let me be misunderstood  
  
If I seem edgy, I want you to know  
I never mean to take it out on you, no  
'Cos life has its problems  
And I've got more than my share  
That's one thing that I never wanna do  
Cause I love you baby  
I'm just human, I have faults like anyone  
Sometimes I think I'll spend the rest of my life regretting  
Some simple things that I have done  
  
But I'm just a soul, who's intentions are good  
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood  
Don't let me be misunderstood  
Don't let me be  
Don't let me be misunderstood  
Don't let me be  
Don't let me be misunderstood
