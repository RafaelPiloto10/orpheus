Da-da-da da-da-da-da-da  
Da-da-da  
Look at you  
You come out with the same old lies  
Think you can win me over  
Feels so good  
I got you working hard this time  
Who's fooling who  
Double check my smile boy  
I'm only playing along  
You know tonight boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
I ain't gonna say  
Baby  
Guess you don't mean that much to me  
Now I got you off of my mind  
(Got you off my mind)  
Baby  
Tell you that word is history  
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again, no  
Ain't gonna say  
Ain't gonna say  
Baby  
Ain't gonna say  
Ain't gonna say  
Oh oh  
  
So, you're bad  
You got that look upon your face  
Too bad I know you better  
That's o.k.  
'Cause now I understand your game  
I just can't lose, now  
Look in my eyes boy  
You know I'll take you along  
Just for the ride boy  
  
I ain't gonna say  
Baby  
Guess you don't mean that much to me  
Now I got you off of my mind  
(Got you off my mind)  
Baby  
Tell you that word is history  
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again, no  
  
Ain't gonna say  
Ain't gonna say  
Baby  
Ain't gonna say  
Ain't gonna say  
Got you off my  
Ain't gonna say  
Ain't gonna say  
Baby  
Ain't gonna say  
Ain't gonna say  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Got you off my  
Da-da-da da-da-da-da-da  
Da-da-da  
  
Double check my smile boy  
I'm only playing along  
You know tonight boy  
I ain't gonna say  
Baby  
  
Guess you don't mean that much to me  
Now I got you off of my mind  
(Got you off my mind)  
Baby  
Tell you that word is history  
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again, no  
(I ain't gonna say it)  
(I ain't gonna say it baby  
Now I got you off my mind)  
(I won't repeat again no  
I got you off my)
