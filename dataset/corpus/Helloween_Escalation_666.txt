Black you stripped me  
Reveal me the secrets of your pain - painful lies?  
Life itself that feeds your wisdom  
Almost everyday you put yourself high on a shelf  
Whatever you do, wherever you go  
Never turn my back on you  
  
Shadows on the wall  
Darkness is spreading  
I warm my hands on the flames of lies  
In vain I scream against the wind  
They don't understand my last testament  
  
Escalation 666  
Escalation 666  
Escalation 666  
  
Deceit and malice  
Every smile hides betrayal and greed, hypocrisy  
We've been like brothers  
Now I hold out my hands to a bloodless, to a bloodless soul  
  
Shadows on the wall  
Darkness is spreading  
I warm my hands on the flames of lies  
In vain I scream against the wind  
They don't understand my last testament  
  
Shadows on the wall  
Darkness is spreading  
I warm my hands on the flames of lies  
In vain I scream against the wind  
They don't understand my last testament  
  
Escalation 666  
Escalation 666 (my last testament)  
Escalation 666 (my last testament)
