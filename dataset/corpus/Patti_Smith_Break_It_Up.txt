Car stopped in a clearing,  
Ribbon of life, it was nearing.  
I saw the boy break out of his skin.  
My heart turned over and I crawled in.  
He cried, break it up, oh I don't understand,  
Break it up, I can't comprehend.  
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.  
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,  
I'm not listening.  
Snow started falling,  
I could hear the angel calling.  
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.  
The boy flew away and he started to sing.  
He sang, break it up, oh, I don't understand.  
Break it up, I can't comprehend.  
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.  
Break it up, don't look at me.  
  
The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,  
I fell on my knee  
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.  
I cried, take me please!  
  
Ice, it was shining.  
I could feel my heart, it was melting.  
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.  
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.  
I cried, break it up, oh, now I understand.  
Break it up, and I want to go.  
Break it up, oh please take me with you.  
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,  
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,  
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel.  
  
So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.  
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.  
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.  
Break it up, break it up, break it up,  
Break it up, break it up, break it up,  
Oh, break it up, break it up, break it up  
Break it up, break it up, break it on up  
Break it up, break it on up, up, up  
Break it, break it, break it, break it  
Break it on up, break it up,  
Break it up, break it up, break it up
