I can still remember, the magic I saw in your eyes, so honest  
And so tender, true love with no compromise  
  
All those things I miss, when I reminisce, about you baby, um hm  
  
[Chorus]  
Why can't we go back in time, when I was your and you where mine,  
Love is special meant to be, eternally our love is one for all time  
(Um, time, mm) this time only  
  
How is it I see you, in every strangers face, I don't wanna need you,  
But my stubborn heart keeps going, and I just can't erase  
  
Oh oh oh oh all these things I miss when I remenise, about you boy,  
Bet you didn't know, how much I love ya, won't mean to show ya baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got to hear your conversation, intelligent debating, baby that  
Would move me, they way you, make me fell so special, how could  
You forget that, you where made for me, you where made for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Skatting, one for all time, mine,  
did you know there's a love, umm,  
our love, oh la la la la la,  
the greatest love, of all time,  
I love ya babe,  
the greatest love of all time, I love ya babe
