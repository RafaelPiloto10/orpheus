Did you ever notice when the sun goes down  
Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound  
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night  
If you listen you can hear it in the breeze  
Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees  
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night  
And the murmuring waters sing the song  
The echoing mountains hum along  
The whispering valleys fill the air  
With a whistling tune our hearts can share  
It's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon  
Listening to old mother nature's favorite tune  
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night
