[Verse 1]  
This could be easy darling  
You can be freaky, I'll be bad  
This could be easy darling  
If we just let go, know what we meant to do  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment  
I got your red lipstick all on my neck cause that what you wanting  
Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong  
My mind is racing, two words, one thought  
  
[Chorus]  
Take your high heels off, let's dance some more  
Never felt like this before  
I can feel it burn inside my head  
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off  
  
[Verse 2]  
This could be easy darling  
You can be mommy, I'll be dad, ooh  
This could be easy darling  
If we just let go, girl I'm in love with you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment  
I got your red lipstick all on my neck cause that what you wanting  
Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong  
My mind is racing, two words, one thought  
  
[Chorus]  
Take your high heels off, let's dance some more  
Never felt like this before  
I can feel it burn inside my head  
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off, take your
blue jeans off  
Take your blue jeans off  
Take your blue jeans off  
Take your blue jeans off  
Take your blue jeans off  
  
[Bridge]  
Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment  
I got your red lipstick all on my neck cause that what you wanting  
Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong  
Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off, take your
blue jeans off  
Take your blue jeans off  
Take your blue jeans off
