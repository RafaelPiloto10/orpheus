All day long he was fighting for you  
And he didn't even know your name  
Young men come and young men go  
But life goes on just the same  
  
And I don't know why  
Why do we keep holding on  
I don't know why  
Pretending to be oh so strong  
Oh why  
Is there something I don't know  
Or something very wrong, with you and me  
Or maybe  
  
That's the way it is, there's nothing I can do,  
That's just the way it is.  
  
They've been waiting for word to come down  
They've been waiting for you night and day  
They won't wait any longer for you  
It may already be too late  
  
And I don't know why.  
  
You see the dying, you feel the pain  
What have you got to say  
If we agree that we can disagree  
We could stop all of this today  
  
It's been your life for as long as you can remember  
But you cannot fight no more  
You must want to look your son in the eyes  
When he asks you what you did it for  
  
'Cos all day long he was fighting for you  
And he didn't even know your name  
Young men come and young men go  
But life goes on just the same  
  
I don't know why...
