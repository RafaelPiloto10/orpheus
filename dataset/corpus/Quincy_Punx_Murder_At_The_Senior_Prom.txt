  
believe it or not I wan't always this fucking cool  
I used to get a lot of shit when I was back in school  
But one day I turned the tables on all those assholes  
I filled em' all full of 9mm bullet holes  
Murder at the senior prom  
Mass murder at the senior prom x2  
I padlocked the gym doors the night of the senior prom  
Under the bleachers I planted several pipe bombs  
Stood up on the balcony sub-machine gun in my hand  
Said "I'm your new prom king, does everybody understand?"  
Rounded up all the jocks who used to chase me home from school  
Tied their hands and feet and pushed them in the swimming pool  
Lined all the teachers who flunked me up against a wall  
Then one by one I stuck a butcher knife into them all  
Found that little fuck who got me busted for smokin' dope  
Now he's hanging from the flag pole kicking at the end of a rope  
Last but certainly not least when everybody else was dead  
I sodomized the cheerleaders and then I cut off all their heads
