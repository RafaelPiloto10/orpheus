Before he ever made the headlines  
Or won the Winston cup  
He survived his share of crashes  
But he never did give up  
The tracks in Carolina  
Where all the Petty's ran  
What kept the motor's running  
Way back then were you the fans  
He won seven at Daytona  
It was STP and forty-three  
King Richard is a legend  
And he's a hero to me  
When he wins he waves his hand  
To the folks up in the stand  
He is dedicated  
To all the nascar fans  
Well I wish this year could last forever  
But the race must go on  
He'll hang up his helmet  
But he never will be gone  
I know he'll drive forever  
In the heart of every fan  
And he will be remembered  
As the best that's ever been
