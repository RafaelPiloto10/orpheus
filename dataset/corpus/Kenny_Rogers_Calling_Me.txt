There's a back road leadin' off the hard-top  
Half-a-mile past the slingshot tree  
Wanders round through a million memories  
It's callin' me, callin' me  
  
There's a white house with fading shutters  
The old front door that never needed a key  
And I hear my Mama in the hush of the evenin'  
Callin' me, yeah, she's callin' me  
  
[Chorus]  
And no matter where I'm goin'  
It reminds me of where I'm from  
Just as long as I can hear it  
I know I'm not too far gone  
  
There's a first kiss under the willow  
Love so honest, it was hard to believe  
And even when my heart is breakin'  
It's callin' me, callin' me  
  
Yes, it's callin' me  
(Oh, yeah, yeah)  
Callin' me, callin' me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a tiny country chapel  
Filled with voices singin' harmony  
And when my soul is lost in the silence  
Oh, it's callin', yes, it's callin' me  
  
Yes it's callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
Callin'  
Oh, it's callin'  
Yes, it's callin' me
