Today, everything was fine  
Until roundabout, quarter to nine  
I suddenly found myself in a bind  
Was it something I said?  
Something I read and manifested that's getting you down  
  
Don't you dare come to bed with that ambiguous look in your eye  
I'd sooner sleep by an open fire and wake up fried  
  
Say what you will  
Say what you mean  
You could never offend  
Your dirty words come out clean  
  
Tomorrow, what price will I pay?  
Could I make it all up to you by serving coffee for two in bed?  
Would you then gimme the time of day?  
  
I need a map of your head  
Translated into English  
So I can learn not to make you frown  
You'd feel better if you'd vent  
Put your frustrations into four letter words  
And let them out on mine  
The most weathered ears in town  
  
So say what you will  
Say what you mean  
You could never offend  
Your dirty words come out clean
