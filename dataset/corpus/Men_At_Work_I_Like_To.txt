I like to pull the plug in the tub  
Sit and watch the water flow down the drain  
I like to, I like to  
I like to look at pictures in a book  
  
Never read the writing just put it down  
I like to, I like to  
  
I'd really like to know  
What would you like to do  
I'd really like to  
  
I like to watch the telly  
With the sound turned down  
Listen to the stereo  
Turn the channels around  
  
I like to, I like to  
I like to eat a sandwich with the lot, yum yum  
Putting on everything that 've got  
I like to, I like to  
  
I'd really like to know  
What would you like to do  
I'd really like to
