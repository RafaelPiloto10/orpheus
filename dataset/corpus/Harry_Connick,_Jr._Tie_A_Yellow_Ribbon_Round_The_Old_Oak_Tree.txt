I'm comin home I done my time now I got to know what is an isn't mine  
If you received my letter  
Telling you I'd soon be free  
Then you'll know just what to do  
If you still want me  
If you still want me  
Tie a yellow ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
It's been three long years  
Do you still want me  
If I don't see a ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us  
Put the blame on me  
If I don't see a yellow ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
Bus driver please look for me  
'Cause I couldn't bare to see what I might see  
I'm really still in prison  
And my love she holds the key  
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free  
I wrote and told her please  
Tie a yellow ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
It's been three long years  
Do you still want me  
If I don't see a ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us  
Put the blame on me  
If I don't see a yellow ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
Now the whole damn bus is cheering  
And I can't believe I see  
A hundred yellow ribbons  
'Round the ole, the old oak tree
