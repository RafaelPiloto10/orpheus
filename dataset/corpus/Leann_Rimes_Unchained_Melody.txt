Oh my love  
My darling  
I've hungered for your touch  
A long lonely time  
  
As time goes by so slowly  
And time can do so much  
Are you still mine?  
  
I need your love  
I need your love  
God speed your love  
To me  
  
Lonely rivers flow  
To the sea  
To the sea  
To the open arms  
Of the sea  
  
Lonely rivers sigh  
"Wait for me, wait for me"  
I'll be coming home  
Wait for me.  
  
Oh my love  
My darling  
I've hungered, hungered for your touch  
A long lonely time  
  
And I know that time goes by so slowly  
That time can do so much  
Are you still mine?  
I need your love  
I need your love  
God speed your love  
To me  
Ooo ooo
