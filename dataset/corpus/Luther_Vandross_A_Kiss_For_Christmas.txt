Honey, it's cold outside  
Pour another glass of wine, light up the fireplace  
The holiday starts right now  
Make yourself slow down, put on a happy face  
  
I don't want you to buy me nothin', it's alright  
Love's the only thing on my list  
All I want is a kiss for Christmas  
Won't you give me a kiss for Christmas?  
  
Early on Christmas day  
Everyone looks for love under the Christmas tree  
And though you might think it's strange  
I wanna tell you, my love  
Don't buy a thing for me  
  
I don't want you to get me nothin', it's alright  
'Cause if I could just get my wish  
All I want is a kiss for Christmas  
Won't you give me a kiss for Christmas?

A kiss for Christmas, don't make me wait for love  
This Christmas all that I want is?  
A kiss for Christmas
