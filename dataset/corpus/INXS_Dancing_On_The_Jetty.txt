Watch the world argue  
Argue with itself  
Who's going to teach me  
Peace and happiness  
  
We could sit here forever  
Just never get old  
Listen to the world  
Letting gods tie us down  
  
Hit cities sharp knives  
The right clothing  
Dancing on the jetty  
So our feet stay dry  
  
Watch the world argue  
Argue with itself  
Who's going to teach me  
Peace and happiness  
Watch the world argue  
Argue with itself  
Who's going to teach me  
Peace and happiness  
  
Blood is upon the steps  
Two thousand years ago  
Play like hell that we go to fight  
Another war in the holy land  
  
Shock the world  
True story  
Snap decisions  
And I'm always going  
We're gonna watch them keep it strong  
  
Watch the world argue  
Argue with itself  
Who's going to teach me  
Peace and happiness  
Watch the world argue  
Argue with itself  
Who's going to teach me  
Peace and happiness  
  
We're making trouble  
We change tracks  
Put the suit down  
Daytime or day no less  
  
We hit cities sharp knives  
The right clothing  
Dancing on the jetty  
So our feet stay dry  
  
Watch the world argue  
Argue with itself  
Who's going to teach me  
Peace and happiness  
Watch the world argue  
Argue with itself  
Who's going to teach me  
Peace and happiness
