This thing we got - it's alive!  
It seems to transcend the physical  
One touch and I'm satisfied  
Must be a dream it's so magical  
  
[Chorus:]  
Glam Slam thank you ma'am  
You really make my day  
Glam Slam thank you ma'am  
I pray you always stay  
  
I know I hold you to tight  
But I just can't seem to get close enough (I want to hold you)  
I want to hold you every night  
I'm so horny and you're the star  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heavy feather, flicka nipple  
Baby scam water ripple  
I don't understand  
It means I love you  
Come a butterfly straight on your skin  
You go for me and I come again  
Glam Slam, thank you ma'am  
Sun is risen, moon is gone  
Soda fizzin' on the lawn  
Come a butterfly straight on your skin  
Glam Slam  
  
Glam Slam, thank you ma'am  
You really make my day  
  
This thing we got - it's alive!  
It seems to transcend the physical  
One touch and I'm satisfied (ooh, baby)  
Must be a dream it's so magical  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Glam Slam  
You will always stay  
You will always stay  
  
It's all right, it's OK
