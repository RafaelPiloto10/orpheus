I'm never gonna cry again  
I'm never gonna die again  
I'll shed some tears for you  
I'll shed more tears for you than the ocean, the ocean  
I didn't wanna let you know  
I didn't wanna take your time  
I didn't wanna bring you down  
I didn't want to hang around you, around you  
So we're living in desperate times  
Oh such an unfortunate time  
I can't relate to you  
I just can't find a place to be near you, to be near you  
I'm never gonna cry again  
I'm never gonna cry again  
I'm never gonna cry again  
...
