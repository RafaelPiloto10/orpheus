I was born in the wagon of a travelling show  
My momma used to dance for the money they'd throw  
Poppa would do whatever he could  
Preach a little gospel  
Sell a couple bottles of doctor good  
  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
We'd hear it from the people of the town  
They'd call us  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
But every night all the men would come around  
And lay their money down  
  
Picked up a boy just south of Mobile  
Gave him a ride filled him with a hot meal  
I was sixteen he was twenty one  
Rode with us to Memphis  
And poppa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done  
  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
We'd hear it from the people of the town  
They'd call us  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
But every night all the men would come around  
And lay their money down  
  
Yip!  
Yahoo!  
  
She was born in the wagon of a travelling show  
Her momma had to dance for the money they'd throw  
Grandpa'd do whatever he could  
Preach a little gospel  
Sell a couple bottles of doctor good  
  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
We'd hear it from the people of the town  
They'd call us  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
But every night all the men would come around  
And lay their money down  
Blahblahblahblah....  
Fuck it  
Fuck it all
