The world is lyrical  
Because a miracle  
Has brought my lover to me  
Though he's some other place, his face I see  
  
At night I creep in bed  
And never sleep in bed  
But look above in the air  
And to my greatest joy, my boy is there  
  
It his prince who walks  
Into my dreams and talks  
  
He dances overhead  
On the ceiling near my bed  
In my sight  
Through the night  
  
I try to hide in vain  
Underneath my counterpane  
There's my love  
Up above  
  
I whisper, "Go away, my lover  
It's not fair"  
But I'm so grateful to discover  
He's still there  
  
I love my ceiling more  
Since it is a dancing floor  
Just for my love  
  
I whisper, "Go away, my lover  
It's not fair"  
But I'm so grateful to discover  
He's still there  
  
I love my ceiling more  
Since it is a dancing floor  
Just for my love  
Just for my love
