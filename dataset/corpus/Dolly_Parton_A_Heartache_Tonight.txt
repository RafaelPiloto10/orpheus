Can't say we're lovers, can't say we're friends  
Don't even know if i'll see you again  
But against your warm body I felt so alive  
And you got me over a heartache tonight  
My heart was broken, my hurt was deep  
I had lost something I wanted to keep  
Lookin' for comfort when you caught my eye  
And you got me over a heartache tonight  
Chorus:  
  
Sweet conversation, a drink and a dance  
Led to an evening of making romance  
And I don't even care if it's wrong or it's right  
'cause you got me over a heartache tonight  
  
2nd chorus:  
  
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight  
Stirring up passion brought me back to life  
Oh, and it may not last, but who know it just might  
But you got me over a heartache tonight  
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight
