Where am i going? what is the place?  
Somebody help me outta here.  
  
Oh i'm walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere  
Oh i'm running slower, slower and slower to somewhere  
'cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me  
It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare  
No matter which way-mare  
  
Spoken:  
Seems that there must be some way to get out.  
But i just can't find it.  
  
People pushing, hustling, rushing on into the future  
Windows open, closing, in a way that they just never used to  
Oh there's violence lurking in the alleys  
Where no one should dare go  
So keep walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere  
  
I gotta get out, somebody...that guy came at me with a gun  
The city closing in  
  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
  
Children crying, screaming, but no one lets on that they hear them  
It's getting louder, louder, surely that someone must hear them  
'cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me  
It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare  
No matter which way-mare  
  
Help me, i want to get out.  
Cut it out! stop closing in on me help!!!  
  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little
