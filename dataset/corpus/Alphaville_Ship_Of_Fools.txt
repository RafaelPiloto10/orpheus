Did you know when the journey started  
That wed ever reach that point  
Many years we sailed together  
Now its time to say goodbye  
You don't know what I've been going through  
haven't heard that much from you  
Isolation is a nice flower  
Now I wonder what to do  
You never know when your dreams come true  
Is it good for you, is it good for you  
On our ship of fools were drifting along the shores never seen before  
When you told me that youre leaving  
Cause the stakes were much too high  
I was wondring why you said so  
Since we still got wings to fly  
I will never ever give up  
Just as long as I am here  
Till the end Ill spread my wings  
And raise my dreams against your fears  
You never know when your dreams come true  
Is it good for you, is it good for you  
On our ship of fools were drifting along the shores never seen before...
