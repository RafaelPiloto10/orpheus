Cause you're a sky  
Cause you're a sky full of stars  
I'm going to give you my heart  
Cause you're a sky  
Cause you're a sky full of stars  
And cause you light up the path  
  
I don't care  
Go on and tear me apart  
I don't care if you do  
Cause in a sky  
Cause in a sky full of stars  
I think I saw you  
  
Cause you're a sky  
Cause you're a sky full of stars  
I want to die in your arms  
Cause you get lighter  
The more it gets dark  
I'm going to give you my heart  
  
And I don't care  
Go on and tear me apart  
I don't care if you do  
Cause in a sky  
Cause in a sky full of stars  
I think I see you  
I think I see you  
  
Because you're a sky  
You're a sky full of stars  
  
Such a heavenly view  
You're such a heavenly view
