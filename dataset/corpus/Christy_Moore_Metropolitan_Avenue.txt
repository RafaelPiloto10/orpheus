Noel Brazil  
First Days in the loft I thought I might live, new faces  
New streets.  
No cash in the hand was making me thing, what now? What's  
Next?  
That's not to say I was'nt welcomed I was welcomed I was  
Taken in.  
I took the bait when I was hunted I was wretched I was  
Freezing.  
  
Chorus  
  
Metropolitan ave standing tall in the winter snow, I'll  
Be back with you before I go  
Don't run like a dog I know how it feels without heat  
Without love.  
Ran free in the park like Jekyll and Hyde, me and Pete,  
Me and Pete.  
Up half the night unwilling witness to some strangers  
Feud.  
Deep underground I hear the notes of some old gamblers  
Blues.  
  
Metropolitan etc  
This rose will never blossom now it needs light shining  
On it's back.  
This road will never take me out, I've been stopped in  
My tracks.  
There goes the night and now the sun begins to filter  
Through,  
I took the bait when I was hunted I was wretched did'nt  
Know that I was failing you  
  
Metropolitan etc
