I gave myself some good advice forget it it's gonna drive me crazy if I let it  
I forgot the line as soon as I had said it but it's good advice for you and me
forget it  
Another day another place it's another year  
We crossed too many bridges that brought us here  
We both had too much fun to now regret it it's good advice for you and me
forget it  
  
A man has mornings when he thinks he'll find it  
Oh it's just a little mountain I can climb it  
So if some night your phone should ring just let it  
It's good advice for you and me forget it  
Another day another place...
