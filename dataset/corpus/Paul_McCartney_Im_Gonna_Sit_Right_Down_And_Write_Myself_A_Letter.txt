I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet  
They're gonna knock me off my feet  
A lotta kisses on the bottom  
I'll be glad I've got 'em  
  
I'm gonna smile and say  
I hope you're feeling better  
And close with love the way you do  
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter  
And I'm make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna smile and say  
I hope you're feeling better  
And close with love the way you do  
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter  
And I'm make believe, ah I'm gonna make believe  
I'm gonna make believe it came from you
