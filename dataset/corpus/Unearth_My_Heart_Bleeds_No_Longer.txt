Shut out and burned by your lies.  
Now it is time to make you learn.  
You'll learn.  
My heart bleeds no longer for your pathetic views.  
  
My heart beats on stronger with my own resolution.  
Bound down for so goddamn long.  
I have seen so many follow you.  
I fell victim to your clouded ways.  
  
It is my intention to end your reign.  
I know so many who would want to see your Burn.  
I aim war at you.  
I did not give into your hold.  
  
I live again alone.  
Pass through the sea of ashes kept.  
My heart bleeds no longer for your love.
