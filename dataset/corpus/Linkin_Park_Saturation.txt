Let me tell you 'bout myself,  
Some say I got a bad attitude,  
Let me tell you 'bout myself,  
Some say I got a lot to prove,  
  
Let me tell you bout myself,  
I'll do whatever you want,  
I'll do what you ask me to,  
I'll do what you tell me to do,  
No!  
  
Strange love,  
Be gone,  
Be gone,  
Gone  
  
Let me tell you 'bout myself,  
Some say I got a long way to go,  
Some say I'm going straight down,  
Some say there's no where to go,  
And this is what I say...  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Strange love,  
Be gone,  
Be gone  
  
Strange love,  
Be gone,  
Be gone
