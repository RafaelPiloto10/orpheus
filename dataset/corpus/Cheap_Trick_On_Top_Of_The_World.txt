You're on top of the world  
On top of the world and you can't  
Get any higher-you're on top of the world  
You're on top of the world tonight  
It wasn't easy- it was hard as hell  
You didn't get luck in a wishin' well  
Never worked so hard- had so much pain  
Wouldn't change for anything  
Learned love from a movie screen  
He was tough, she was wild at fifteen  
Quit school and had no dreams  
Wasn't going very far  
  
Then he got religion and she got a god  
It's on her back and it's in his job  
And it costs lots of money, honey- oh, no  
Breakdown nearly every day  
Shoulda known- couldn't get away  
Got lucky with the girl next door  
She was lonely and didn't care  
  
She was young, she was dark, she was fair  
Wrapped herself around you with her stare  
You'd explode if she would touch you there  
Touch you there- touch you there  
Tonight, tonight-tonight-tonight  
You're on top of the world  
On top of the world and you can't  
Get any higher  
You're on top of the world  
You're on top of the world tonight  
  
(can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight  
(can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight  
(can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight  
(can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight
