There is a finger missing on my right hand  
A butchers hand in a butterfly wing span  
The sky hangs on a thread as I paint the white picket fence red  
Said am I alive or am I dead  
I cought a raingbow tear in her sunset smile  
I told the broken bird of my unborn child  
These blood stained walls in her head  
I found my girl bleeding in his bed  
The angels cried in butterfly red  
(the butcher and the butterfly)  
Her wings are torn my babies dead  
(the butcher and the butterfly)  
I put my girl in the butchers hand  
She is my curse cried fireman Sam  
Heaven down below inscribed her name  
My baby girl's lost in amongst these flames  
The angels cried in butterfly red  
(the butcher and the butterfly)  
Her wings are torn my babies dead  
(the butcher and the butterfly)  
Oh heaven help me what have I done  
I kissed the daughter of my unborn son  
Heaven down below inscribed her name  
Let heaven oh heaven rain down again  
The angels cried in butterfly red  
(the butcher and the butterfly)  
Her wings are torn my babies dead  
(the butcher and the butterfly)  
The angels cried in butterfly red  
(the butcher and the butterfly)  
Her wings are torn my babies dead  
(the butcher and the butterfly)
