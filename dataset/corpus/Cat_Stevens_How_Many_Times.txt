How many times must I get up  
Look out and see the same old view  
How many times must I wear the same old things  
And hear the same old things that I do, I do  
How many times must I clean this face my face  
And how many times must I shine my shoes, oh lord  
How many times must I drink the same old drink  
And dream the same old dreams that I do  
  
Because I, I know one thing  
There ain't nothing that could ever ease the pain  
But for your line and mine  
I want that loving again  
  
How many times must I pass your place. your place  
And how many times must I follow you, you  
How many times must I see the same old things  
When all I should be seeing is you  
  
Because I, I know one thing  
There ain't nothing that could ever ease the pain  
But for your line and mine  
I want that loving again, again
