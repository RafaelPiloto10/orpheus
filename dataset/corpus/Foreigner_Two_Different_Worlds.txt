I know this girl, she's always on my mind  
She lives in her world and I live in mine  
I should forget about her and I've tried, oh Lord knows I've tried  
But I want to know her, and here's the other side  
  
I've got someone waiting for me every night  
She's the only one I've ever loved, it's been that way for the longest time  
And she's the one that makes my world go right  
And it tears me in two because I know where I'll be tonight  
  
I think she knows it  
I think she knows  
  
I live in two different worlds, two different worlds  
One that belongs to me, one could be wrong for me  
Two different worlds, two different worlds  
Ohh, it's two different worlds  
  
Is she that different or is it the thrill of someone new?  
Strung out on her, I need her love, I need it bad, that I know, I know it's
true  
I'm the one that lies awake alone  
And I know, she's the one that makes me stray from home  
  
And I know it  
Yeah, I know it  
  
I live in two different worlds, two different worlds  
One that I may regret, one that I can't forget  
Two different worlds, two different worlds  
Oh, it's two different worlds  
  
No, I can't explain this emptiness  
No, I know that I can't go on like this  
Two different worlds, two different worlds  
  
Oh, it's two different worlds, I live in two different worlds  
One that I may regret, and one that I won't forget  
Two different worlds, but I can't live in both, I know  
One world I must let go
