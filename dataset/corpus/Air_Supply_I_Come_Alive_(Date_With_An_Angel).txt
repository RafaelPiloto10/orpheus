I come alive (date with an Angel)  
  
Everyday I prayed that I would find a lover  
Then I looked into your eyes and I discovered  
Something was changing in my life  
Turning the darkness into light  
  
When I'm with you I come alive  
I feel I'm living in heaven  
You make the wrong turn out so right  
I'm gonna love you forever  
  
There is not a thing that I would change about you  
And my life was never quite the same without you  
You made the rain clouds go away  
Bringing me sunshine everyday  
  
When I'm with you I come alive  
I feel I'm living in heaven  
You make the wrong turn out so right  
I'm gonna love you forever  
  
In your arms you make me warm  
You give me strength to carry on  
I know I won't be alone  
As long as I'm with you
