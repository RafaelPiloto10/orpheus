Could have been a long hot summer night  
When all the stars were shining bright  
Against the blue  
Could have been that famous decade scene  
Top hats and tails, spinning 'round the room  
  
And all I remember is not wanting the music to end  
And all I remember is feeling a need that I could not hide  
Don't take away those dancing shoes  
Don't take away those dancing shoes  
Don't take away that boy's dancing shoes  
  
And ever since that very night  
I found me a guiding light, light the way  
To turn off the music is to turn off the light in my soul  
So just let it shine mister  
  
One more time for me and my babe  
Don't take away those dancing shoes  
Without the rhythm you got the blues  
Don't take away those dancing shoes  
Don't take away that boy's dancing shoes
