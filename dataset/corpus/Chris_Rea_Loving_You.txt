The night was black with thunder  
The streets were wet with rain  
Another day goes under  
A little bourbon will take the strain  
And I'm waiting for my take-home French fries  
She smiled and said 'take me away'  
We always laughed but I think she means it  
But I'm dreaming my life away  
Loving you  
Loving you the way that I do  
  
The weekend cars are leaving  
In a spray of wind and sound  
The bar-talk, make believing  
And the drinks go easy down  
It's back to the all-night take-away  
She says 'Here comes the man of my dreams'  
We always laugh but I think she means it  
And I'm spending my time  
Just loving you  
Loving you the way that I do
