Little Suzie Greenberg with her head caved in  
Soon will let me drown beneath the undertow  
You better put that woman in a loony bin  
'Cause you know I'd really like to be a part of her show  
  
Suzie is an artist, she paints quite a lot  
An artist she may be but a genius she is not  
She says she wants to be a sociologist  
But she better first get checked by a neurologist  
  
Suzie, Suzie, Suzie, Suzie  
Suzie, Suzie Greenberg  
  
Suzie's 'bout as faithful as a slot machine  
Pays off once in a while but then she'll rob you clean  
She's always afraid that she's not sure what she's worth  
She's out of her mind and she's not of this earth  
  
The woman walks the streets like she's the queen of the town  
Doesn't talk very much, she's very profound  
Little Suzie Greenberg always playing the game  
But today I'll bet she's probably forgotten my name
