Hey, a woman made my habit  
Lord I need to have  
Feel just like a lion  
A woman's like a little calf  
And everything I got  
Is everything that I want  
And I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on, babe  
Hey, I ain't got not trouble gettin' it on  
  
A flower's made for pickin'  
One that fits me is better off  
Than the one that fades away  
And everything I got  
Is everything that I want  
And I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on, babe  
Hey, I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on  
  
Mary Jean from New Orleans  
She said she married mainly for love  
But before she could say  
She wasn't that kind of girl  
Uh, she was!  
  
Girl you better look out  
'Cause love is a little like Chinese food  
You're hungry after half an hour  
And everything I got  
Is everything I want  
I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on, baby  
Hey, I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on  
C'mon, hey, hey, hey, hey
