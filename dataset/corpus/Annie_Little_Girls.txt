Miss Hannigan  
  
Little girls  
Little girls  
  
Everywhere I turn I can see them  
Little girls  
Little girls  
Night and day  
I eat, sleep and breathe them  
  
I'm an ordinary woman  
With feelings  
I'd like a man to nibble on my ear  
But I'll admit  
No man has bit  
So how come I'm the mother of the year?  
  
Little cheeks  
Little teeth  
Everything around me is little  
If I wring  
Little necks  
Surely I will get an acquittal  
  
Some women are dripping with diamonds  
Some women are dripping with pearls  
Lucky me! Lucky me!  
Look at what I'm dripping with  
Little girls  
  
How I hate  
Little shoes  
Little socks  
And each little bloomer  
I'd have cracked  
Years ago  
If it weren't for my  
Sense of humor  
  
Some day  
I'll step on their freckles  
Some night  
I'll straighten their curls  
Send a flood  
Send the flu  
Anything that You can do  
To little girls  
  
(reprise)  
Some day I'll land in the nut house  
With all the nuts and the squirrels  
There I'll stay  
Tucked away  
Until the prohibition of  
Little, little, little.  
Little, little, little.
