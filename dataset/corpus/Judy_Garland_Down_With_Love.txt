You sons of Adam, you daughters of Eve  
The time has come to take your love-torn hearts off your sleeve  
Look, look about you, what, what do you see?  
Love-sick, love-lorn, love-wrecked, love-worn, boo-hoomanity  
There'll be no peace on Earth Until this curse  
Is wiped off from this love-mapped universe  
Are we mice or are we men? Can't you see the light?  
Come you fellow victims lets unite  
Down with love, the flowers and rice and shoes  
Down with love, the root of all midnight blues  
Down with things that give you that well-known pain  
Take that moon and wrap it in cellophane  
Down with love, let's liquidate all it's friends  
Moon and June and roses and rainbows' ends  
Down with songs that moan about night and day  
Down with love, just take it away, away  
Take it away, take it away  
Give it back to the birds and the bees and the Viennese  
Down with Eyes romantic and stupid  
Down with signs, down with Cupid  
Ruttle that stuff that duff  
Down with love  
Down with love  
Down with love  
Down, down, down with love
