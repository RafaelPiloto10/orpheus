Wakin' up this morning  
Saw the sun come through my blinds  
And I looked up on the porch  
And found an owl shrieking by  
But never could I have imagined  
Such a place like this  
And you're lyin' next to me  
I wanna wake you with a kiss  
  
And all the crazy things about you  
That I so adore  
Are the little things that keep me  
Coming back for more  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
I will go wherever you go  
Take me where you lead  
Lead me where you want  
My heart doesn't know  
Anything but what you say  
You're the one for me  
You make me feel complete  
  
I can silent read your whisper  
And my lips still feel your touch  
And I'm oh so glad to be here  
Oh so glad to be here  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
But you and I have walked the oceans  
Miles along the shore  
And a thousand seagulls called on me  
So we came right back for more  
And I love to feel the water  
It makes me feel so free  
Underneath the purple sky  
Every time you look at me  
  
I reach up to forever  
With the promises you keep  
They fill me with such happiness  
It makes my heart believe  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
How many lovers  
Have walked along the shore before  
Before you and I  
How many said goodbye
