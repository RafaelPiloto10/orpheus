[Verse 1:]  
Well I realize that love can be foolish and I realize it can be unkind  
It?s a never ended river of fear ahead and behind  
Your always full of righteous indignation, you can put that where the sun
never shines  
All I need is one more thing to fear, and a dark place to hide  
  
[Chorus:]  
You know you?re south of heaven  
A quarter mile from hell  
You know you?re south of heaven  
Will you take me down- only time will tell  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You think everything can be purchased, you think everyone has their price  
Just like the fool that I am I believed you were right  
You?re always thinking about meditation  
In contact with spirits all the time  
I?ve got a magic trick for you it?s disappearing time  
  
[Bridge:]  
Stay away from my house- keep out of my life  
I can?t take no more  
I see snakes on your head  
I?d rater be dead- You already are
