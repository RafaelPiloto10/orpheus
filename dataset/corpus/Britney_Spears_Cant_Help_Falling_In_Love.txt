Wise men say, only fools rush in  
But I can't help falling in love with you  
  
Wise men say, only fools rush in  
But I can't help falling in love with you  
Shall I stay?  
Would it be a sin?  
If I can't help falling in love with you  
  
As a river flows  
Gently to the sea  
Darling, So it goes  
Some things are meant to be  
  
Take my hand  
Take my whole life, too  
For I can't help falling in love with you

Nooo, I can't help falling in love with you  
I can't help falling in love with you
