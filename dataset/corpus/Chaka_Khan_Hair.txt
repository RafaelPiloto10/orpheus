People ask me everywhere  
"Is that really all your hair?"  
I just tell 'em, "If it ain't  
Then it sure don't mean  
That now I can't"  
I just don't believe it's fair  
To judge a girl by the length of her hair  
Take two words like "hip" and "square"  
The truth will shine and not your hair  
Even the blind can almost see  
What's outside you and inside me  
Down or high, truth or lie  
A weak girl's laugh can be  
A strong girl's cry  
Black or blond or nappy or fair -  
You can't judge nobody by hair  
If I thought that you would care  
I'd wear a wig up under my hair  
Down or high, truth or lie  
A weak girl's laugh can be  
A strong girl's cry
