I'm staring at the clock  
It's a quarter to three  
I'm tossing in my bed  
Cause I just can't sleep  
Cause you're not here with me  
I'm reaching out for you  
I wish I could talk to you  
Trying to figure out  
What's going on with me  
I'm used to having  
All the answers for everything  
Oh girl, I think she is the one  
Who where that's coming from  
  
It's so crazy  
Babe you simply amaze me  
Somewhere it's wrong  
When lately I owe it all to you  
All those lately used to be now  
Seem so lately  
I'm coming down with this new me  
All I know is that you are the cure  
Cause I've been diagnosed for love  
  
Does anybody know the answer to this question  
Cause I'm confused so now  
I'm hoping for suggestions  
My heart is taking loud (So loud)  
What is this about (About)  
I'm really changing now, Oh  
Cleared all the numbers out my phone  
Then left that whole life go on  
So are two of the symptoms I see  
And I believe, oh girl, I am sure  
That you are my miracle  
  
It's so crazy  
Babe you simply amaze me  
Somewhere it's wrong  
When lately I owe it all to you  
All those lately used to be now  
Seem so lately  
I'm coming down with this new me  
All I know is that you are the cure  
Cause I've been diagnosed for love  
  
Let me hear you say  
Nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah  
If anybody feels me  
Let me see you wave your hands and say  
I'm dying all for love  
And let me hear you say  
Nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah  
Girl cause all I know  
That you are the cure babe  
  
It's so crazy  
Babe you simply amaze me  
Somewhere it's wrong  
When lately I owe it all to you  
All those lately used to be now  
Seem so lately  
I'm coming down with this new me  
All I know is that you are the cure  
Cause I've been diagnosed for love  
  
Love  
Cause I've been dying all for love  
I said you are the cure  
Cause I've been diagnosed for love  
Put your hands together now  
Everybody put your hands together
