I've become impossible holding on to when  
When everything seemed to matter more  
The two of us  
All used and beaten up  
Watching fate as it flow down the path we  
Have chose  
  
You and me  
We're in this together now  
None of them can stop us now  
We will make it through somehow  
You and me  
If the world should break in two  
Until the very end of me  
Until the very end of you  
  
Awake to the sound as they peel apart the skin  
They pick and they pull  
Trying to get their fingers in  
Well they've got to kill what we've found  
Well they've got to hate what we fear  
Well they've got to make it go away  
Well they've got to make it disappear  
  
The farther I fall I'm beside you  
As lost as I get I will find you  
The deeper the wound I'm inside you  
For ever and ever I'm a part of  
  
You and me  
We're in this together now  
None of them can stop us now  
We will make it through somehow  
You and me  
If the world should break in two  
Until the very end of me  
Until the very end of you  
All that we were is gone we have to hold on  
All that we were is gone we have to hold on  
When all our hope is gone we have to hold on  
All that we were is gone but we can hold on  
  
You and me  
We're in this together now  
None of them can stop us now  
We will make it through somehow  
You and me  
Even after everything  
You're the queen and I'm the king  
Nothing else means anything
