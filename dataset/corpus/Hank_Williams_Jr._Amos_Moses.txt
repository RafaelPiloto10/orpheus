Now Amos Moses was a Cajun  
He lived by himself in the swamp  
He hunted alligator for a living  
He just knock them in the head with a stump  
  
Louisiana law gonna get ya Amos  
It ain't legal huntin' alligator  
Down in the swamp now  
Well everyone blamed his old man  
For making him mean as a snake  
When Amos Moses was a boy  
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait  
  
Tie a rope the neck and chunk him out in the swamp  
Alligator bait in a Louisiana bayou  
About 45 minutes southeast of Tibado Louisiana  
Lived a man named Doc Mill Sap  
And his pretty white Hannah  
They raised up a son who could  
Eat his weight in groceries  
They named him after a man of cloth  
Called him Amos Moses  
  
Now the folks around South Louisiana  
Thought Amos was a hell of a man  
He could trap the biggest meanest alligator  
And just use one hand  
That's all he got left  
Cause the alligator bit it  
Left on gone, clean up to the elbow  
  
Well the sheriff got wind that Amos  
Was in the swamp hutnin' alligator skin  
So he snuck in the swamp  
Tried to get the boy  
And he never came out again  
  
Well I wonder where the  
Louisiana sheriff went too?  
You can sure get lost in the Louisiana bayou  
About 45 minutes southeast of Tibado Louisiana  
Lived a man named Doc Mill Sap  
And his pretty white Hannah  
They raised up a son who could  
Eat his weight in groceries  
They named him after a man of cloth  
Called him Amos Moses  
  
Sit down on em Amos  
  
About 45 minutes southeast of Tibado Louisiana  
Lived a man named Doc Mill Sap  
And his pretty white Hannah  
They raised up a son who could  
Eat his weight in groceries  
They named him after a man of cloth  
Called him Amos Moses  
  
His name is Amos Moses
