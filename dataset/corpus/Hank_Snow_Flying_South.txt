Summer's gone and wintertime's a comin' and where I am ain't where I want to
be  
I can hear my southern home a callin' and it's callin' out that old wide goose
and me  
I got kids and kin down in Kentucky I got lots of aunts in Alabam  
Mom a waitin' down in Mississippi and my sist's in Carolina's honey land  
Flyin' flyin' south to Dixie Lord I've been so lonesome and alone  
Stayin' ain't no use because my heart's an old wild goose  
And so tomorrow I'll be flyin' south for home  
  
Grandma and grandpa's down in Georgia and my sweetheart's down in Tennessee  
There's a little part of all the southland in my heart  
And honey in the south is where I want to be  
Summer's gone and wintertime's a comin' and where I am ain't where I want to
be  
I can hear my southern home a callin' and it's callin' out that old wide goose
and me  
Flyin' flyin' south to Dixie...  
And tomorrow I'll be flyin' south for home
