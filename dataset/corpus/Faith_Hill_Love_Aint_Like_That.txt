You can't buy it at a store  
Try it on for size  
Then bring it back if it don't feel right  
No love, love ain't like that  
  
You can't trade it in  
Like an automobile  
That's got too many miles an' rust on its wheels  
No love, love ain't like that  
  
Love ain't that easy to define  
You can't build it by design  
It takes its own sweet time  
  
It don't fall from the sky  
Like a tiny drop of rain  
That hits you right between the eyes one day  
No love, love ain't like that  
  
You can't put your money down  
An' just roll the dice  
Think you're gonna win it all some night  
No love, love ain't like that  
  
Love ain't that easy to define  
You can't build it by design  
It takes its own sweet time  
  
You can't buy it at a store  
Try it on for size  
Then bring it back if it don't feel right  
No love, love ain't like that
