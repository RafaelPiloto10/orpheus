"The profit is a fool, the spirtual man is mad,  
For the multitude of thine inequity, and the great hatred."  
  
Everyone's trying to decide,  
Where to go when there's no place to hide.  
I follow the bombs as they're coming down.  
This must have been hallowed ground.  
  
No matter what they decide to have done.  
Burn up the clouds, block out the sun.  
My hope is in one they can't bring down.  
My soul is in hallowed ground.  
  
I see the fear, it's on the rise.  
Let's catch the enemy by surprise.  
Bury your treasure where it can't be found.  
Bury it deep in hallowed ground.
