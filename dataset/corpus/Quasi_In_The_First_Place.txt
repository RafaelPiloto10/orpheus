I used to think love was real  
When it's just the way you feel  
After a moment  
When it's gone it's like it never existed  
In the first place  
  
I used to think you were mine  
Mistaken all the time  
We were togheter  
And now you're gone  
And it's like we never existed  
In the first place  
  
Too much of this  
And I'm enough of that  
You get so fast  
In your search for something new again  
  
I used to think I was real  
But now it's no big deal  
It don't matter  
And when I'm gone it's like I never existed  
In the first place
