It's invading my mind  
And breaking the ice  
Whoa oh oh  
I can't fight it  
This feeling's invading my, my mind  
I'm infected tonight  
I can't fight it  
Whoa oh oh, I can't fight it  
So take it invading my mind  
  
Can't decide, can't define  
What I feel inside  
It's so bad, it's still good  
Prefer and love  
It's a rush, it's so rough  
This is out of line  
It's a storm and it rock,  
Rock, rocks my mind  
My destiny, misery  
Your energy  
  
It's invading my mind  
And breaking the ice  
Whoa oh oh  
I can't fight it  
This feeling's invading my, my mind  
I'm infected tonight  
Whoa oh oh  
I can't fight it  
So take it invading my my mind  
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind  
This feeling's invading my, my mind  
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind  
So take it invading my my mind  
  
Like a wild wrecking ball  
Crashing block by block  
I'm defenseless, it penetrates my walls  
Freezing cold, steaming hot  
Sweaty drip drip drop  
It's unstoppable, I can't shake it up  
My destiny, misery  
You energy  
  
It's invading my mind  
And breaking the ice  
Whoa oh oh  
I can't fight it  
This feeling's invading my, my mind  
I'm infected tonight  
Whoa oh oh  
I can't fight it  
So take it invading my my mind  
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind  
This feeling's invading my, my mind  
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind  
So take it invading my my mind  
  
It's taking me down  
And getting me high  
It brings every fantasy to life  
It's getting so loud  
I hear it all around  
And I just can't fight  
  
It's invading my mind  
And breaking the ice  
Whoa oh oh  
I can't fight it  
This feeling's invading my, my mind  
I'm infected tonight  
Whoa oh oh  
I can't fight it  
So take it invading my my mind  
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind  
This feeling's invading my, my mind  
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind  
So take it invading my my mind  
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind  
So take it invading my my mind
