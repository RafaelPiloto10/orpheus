I'm trying not to wonder what you're doing now and it still hurts somehow  
Our pictures disappeared with communications down and I'm living out of town  
But the formula for love was found to be untrue - I wait for you  
To call me up someday and tell me that you're wrong-it's been too long  
And the formula for love was found to be untrue - I wait for you  
Don't try to tell me that my love for you was wrong  
And don't try to tell me that you knew it all along  
You never loved, you don't know how  
And I feel bad for you right now  
  
I'm trying not to wonder whose heart you'll break this time-  
You can bet it won't be mine.
