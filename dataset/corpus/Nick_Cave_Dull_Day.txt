The light from the window  
Falls on the floor  
And after it breaks  
I cut my feet  
On the little bright pieces  
I glow in the dark  
But only when night falls  
It's falling it's falling  
It falls  
  
  
My head is a night-club  
Club-clubbed to dull drums  
Beating to slow  
To dance or to breathe or to dance  
I insist that you cut in  
I A La Flambe  
I'm drinking i'm drinking  
I'm drunk
