It came upon the midnight clear,  
That glorious song of old,  
From angels bending near the earth  
To touch their harps of gold,  
Peace on the earth, good will to men,  
From heaven's all-gracious King.  
The world in solemn stillness lay  
To hear the angels sing.  
  
Look now! for glad and golden hours  
Come swiftly on the wing,  
O rest beside the weary road  
And hear the angels sing!  
  
Hear the angels sing!
