I awoke this morning to a shattering sound  
And I went downstairs and found these shards of glass strewn all around  
And there upon the floor I found this poor broken dove  
And it made me realize how very fragile is this life that we so love  
I came back up to bed and I held you so tight  
And I prayed up to the father, oh I prayed with all my might  
That he'd always keep you with me, that he'd always keep you safe  
And when I went downstairs I found that dove had somehow up and flown away  
There's a magic every moment  
There's a miracles each day  
There's a magic every moment  
Oh won't you let the music play  
Oh won't you let the music play  
On a high and windy island I was gazing out to sea  
When a long forgotten feeling came and took control of me  
It was then the clouds burst open and the sun came pouring through  
When it hit those dancing waters in an instant all eternity I knew  
There's so much we take for granted, there's so much we never say  
We get caught up in the motion of just a living day to day  
We are fettered to the future, we are prisoners of the past  
And we never seem to notice 'til our lives have finally slipped right through
our grasp  
There's a magic every moment  
There's a miracles each day  
There's a magic every moment  
Oh won't you let the music play  
Oh won't you let the music play  
You can see forever in a single drop of dew  
You can see that same forever if you look down deep inside of you  
There's a spark of the creator in every living thing  
He respects me when I work but he so loves me when I sing  
There's a magic every moment  
There's a miracles each day  
There's a magic every moment  
Oh won't you let the music play  
Oh won't you let the music play  
There's a magic every moment  
There's a miracles each day  
There's a magic every moment  
Oh won't you let the music play  
Oh won't you let the music play
