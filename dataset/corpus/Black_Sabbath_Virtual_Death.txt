Reach out and take for me, fruit of the poison  
Tree,  
Give me your body and your soul.  
My youth is fading fast, years melt into the past,  
This mortal life will take it's toll.  
  
I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so  
Amusing,  
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in.  
  
This park of natures fire, my only one desire,  
This world is hanging by a thread.  
  
I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so  
Amusing,  
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in.  
  
People always tried to change me, alter everything  
I am,  
Though you find this so amusing, you left me in  
This state I'm in.  
Virtual death  
  
You may think this existence, is just a human  
Weakness,  
Inside my mind it's near the end.  
Virtual death  
  
I'm losing, I'm fading fast. I'm dying, virtual death.
