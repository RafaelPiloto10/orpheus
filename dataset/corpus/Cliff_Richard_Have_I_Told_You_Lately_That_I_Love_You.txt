Have I told you lately that I love you  
Could I tell you once again somehow  
Have I told, with all my heart and soul how I adore you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.  
This heart would break in two if you refuse me  
I'm no good without you anyhow  
Dear have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.  
  
Have I told you lately that I miss you  
When the stars are shinin' in the sky  
Have I told you why the nights are long when you're not with me  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now  
This heart would break in two if you refuse me  
I'm no good without you anyhow  
Dear have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.  
  
Have I told you lately when I'm sleepin'  
Every dream I dream is you somehow  
Have I told you who I'd like to share my love forever  
Well darlin' I'm telling you now  
This heart would break in two if you refuse me  
I'm no good without you anyhow  
Dear have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.
