Your eyes, they send me  
To eternity  
Your heart may cast me down,  
To hell  
Again  
But lately its your love,  
It's condemnation enough  
  
Identify  
Please Identify  
If it's me you want,  
Standing by your side  
Identify  
These tears of mine,  
Am I lonely? Or am I just alive?  
  
And what is time, to say  
Who and why the test of love,  
Your hands were speaking "no"  
I felt the movement go  
The ice was breaking,  
So  
I wonder why  
That I'd  
Identify with you  
My life  
Leave me empty and see if I survive  
  
For every questioned hour,  
For every second devoured  
You let me wonder you  
Into a myth  
That I  
Missed  
  
Identify  
Please identify  
If it's me you want,  
Standing by your side  
Identify  
These tears of mine  
Am I lonely? or am I just alive?  
Am I lonely? or am I just alive
