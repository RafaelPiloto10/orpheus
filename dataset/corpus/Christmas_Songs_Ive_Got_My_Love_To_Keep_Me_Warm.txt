The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing  
But I can weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
For I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
I can't remember a worse December  
Just watch those icicles form!  
Oh, what do I care if icicles form?  
Oh, I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove  
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love!  
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher  
So I will weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
Oh, I've got my love to keep me warm

What do I care if icicles form?  
Oh-ho-ho, I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove  
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love!  
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher  
So I will weather the storm!
