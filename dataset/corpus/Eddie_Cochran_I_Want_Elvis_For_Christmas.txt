Well baby-baby-baby, baby-baby-baby, baby-baby-baby  
You ain't nothing but a reindeer, ooh barkin' all the time  
Ever since we heard you singin'  
Ever since we saw you swingin'  
Our hearts lit up like a Christmas tree  
So please-please Elvis, spend Christmas with me  
And if you won't  
You ain't nothing but a reindeer, ooh barkin' all the time  
Well if you ain't here for Christmas  
Then you ain't no friend of mine  
Baby-baby-baby, baby-baby-baby  
If only you could hear what we're sayin'  
If Santa Claus could hear us prayin'  
There isn't anything that we wouldn't pay  
If you could be here Elvis on Christmasday  
And if you won't  
I'll be so lonely baby, I'll be so lonely  
It's gonna be a great romance  
So don't be cruel and love me tender  
Don't give me those blue moon blues  
Come back baby, I wanna play house  
And I promise not to step on your blue suede shoes  
I want you, I need you, I love you  
There ain't nobody above you  
Won't you listen to my Yuletide plea  
And please-please Elvis, spend Christmas with me  
And if you won't  
You ain't nothing but a reindeer, barkin' all the time  
Well if you ain't here for Christmas  
Then you ain't no friend of mine  
So Elvis, spend Christmas with me
