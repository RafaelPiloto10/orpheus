We're living in a worried world  
A world that's full of fears  
But there's one hopeful peace eternal  
I hope that it's very near.  
  
Little children are the hope of the world  
So guide them day and night be sure you teach them right  
You can teach them by the things you do and say  
The way you live today the way you pray.  
  
Suffer the little children to come unto me  
For such is the kingdom of heaven God made it plain to see  
Little children are the hope of the world  
Se help us teach them Lord to walk with Thee.
