[Intro]  
My name is, my name is  
My name is, Charles ii!  
  
[Verse 1]  
I love the people  
And the people love me  
So much that they restored  
The English monarchy!  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm part Scottish, French, Italian  
A little bit Dane  
But one hundred percent party animal  
Champagne?  
  
[Verse 3]  
Spaniels I adored  
Named after me too  
Like me, they were fun  
With a nutty hair do!  
  
[Verse 4]  
Is today my birthday?  
I can't recall  
Let's have a party anyway  
Because I love a masked ball!  
  
[Chorus]  
All hail, the king!  
Of bling! Let's sing!  
Bells ring! Ding ding!  
I'm the king who brought back partying!  
  
[Verse 5]  
King Charles, my daddy  
Lost his throne  
And kings were banned  
They chopped off his head  
Then Olly Cromwell ruled the land  
  
[Verse 6]  
Old Olly wasn't jolly  
He was glum, and he was proud  
Would be miserable as sin  
Only sinning's not allowed!  
  
[Verse 7]  
When Olly died, the people said  
'Charlie, me hearty!  
Get rid of his dull laws  
Come back, we'd rather party!  
  
[Verse 8]  
This action's what they called  
The monarchy restoration  
Which naturally was followed  
By a huge celebration!  
  
[Chorus]  
The King of Eng! (Land say!)  
No sin! Too sing! (Okay!)  
Or anything!  
All say, I'm the king who brought back partying!  
  
[Verse 9]  
Great London Fire was a whopper!  
In my reign, London city came a-cropper!  
So this king did what was right and proper  
Fought the fire, proved I'm more than a bopper  
I'm a fire stopper!  
  
[Verse 10]  
Married Catherine Braganza  
She was a love so true  
There would never be another  
Well... Maybe one or two!  
  
[Verse 11]  
Lucy Walter Nell Gwynne  
Moll Davies Barbara Villiers  
You think that's bad  
But her name's not as silly as  
Hortense Mancini!  
  
[Verse 12]  
As king, I must admit  
I broke the wedding rules  
But who cares when I brought back  
The crown jewels?  
I reinstated Christmas  
Make up, sports and even plays  
I was the merry monarch  
They were good old days!  
  
[Chorus]  
When said and done!  
King Charles did run!  
England for fun!  
I was the king loved by everyone  
My song is done!  
  
[Outro]  
Party anyone?
