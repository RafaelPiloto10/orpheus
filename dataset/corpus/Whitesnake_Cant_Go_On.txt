I've been feeling sentimental,  
In a melancholy way,  
Blues siting on my shoulder,  
Getting heavier every day  
  
Staring into space,  
One thing on my mind,  
I've been trying to drown  
The thought of you  
By drinking too much wine  
  
Then my imagination  
Starts running wild,  
I snap my fingers  
And you're there by my side  
  
Can't go on without your love,  
There's no song without your love  
Ain't no reason, ain't no rhyme,  
Without your love  
I'll go out of my mind  
  
Been getting too lazy,  
Letting myself go,  
Feeling like a refugee  
No one cares for anymore  
Endless lonely days,  
I just try to get through,  
And there's no escape,  
Even when I sleep,  
'Cause all I dream is you  
  
Then my imagination  
Gets the better of me,  
'Cause you're everywhere I go,  
In everything I see  
  
I can't go on without you love,  
There's no song without your love  
There ain't no reason, there ain't no rhyme,  
Without your love  
I'll go out of my mind  
  
You make me dance,  
You make me sing,  
When I'm with you  
I can do anything  
When I'm cold,  
You keep me warm.  
And give me shelter  
From the howling storm  
  
There ain't no reason, there ain't no rhyme,  
Without your love  
I'll go out of my mind  
  
Can't go on without your love,  
There's no song without your love
