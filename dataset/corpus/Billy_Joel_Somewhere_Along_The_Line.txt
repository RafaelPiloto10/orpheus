Well, it's a rainy night in Paris,  
And I'm sitting by the Seine,  
It's a pleasure to be soaking in the European rain,  
Now my belly's full of fancy food and wine  
Oh but in the morning there'll be hell to pay  
Somewhere along the line  
In the morning there'll be hell hell to pay  
Somewhere along the line  
  
Sweet Virginia cigarette burin' in my hand  
Well you used to be a friend of mine but now I understand  
You've been eating up inside me for some time  
Oh and I know you're gonna get me  
Somewhere along the line  
Well I know you're gonna get me  
Somewhere along the line  
Somewhere along the line  
Well I know it's just a matter of time  
Well the fun falls through and the rent comes due  
Somewhere along the line  
  
Well you know I love my woman,  
And I would not let her down,  
And I did my share of lovin' when I used to get around  
Now I'm satisfied,  
And she is lookin' fine  
Oh but you pay for your satisfaction  
Somewhere along the line  
But you pay for your satisfaction  
Somewhere along the line  
  
Hey it's good to be a young man  
And to live the way you please  
Yes a young man is the king of ev'ry kingdom that he sees  
But there's an old and feeble man not far behind  
Oh that surely will catch up to him  
Somewhere along the line  
That surely will catch up to him  
Somewhere along the line
