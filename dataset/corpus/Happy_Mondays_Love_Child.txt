You bore me, you bore me you teach me,  
You taught me, you see me, you want me, you buy me, then torch me,  
You enter and walk me the thing that came out of my mouth sweet mouth when I
leave this  
Old house I should have a good day should  
I have a bad should I get something out  
See what I've had can I stay a young man or grow old  
And fat don't need a microphone to say I know bout this and  
I don't need a microphone to know where it's at well  
I got a duster but I don't have a flat how should we cook this'  
Should we let it boil lets make a love child we both can spoil give it a dee  
Use the kindest oil we have to find some good land get the good soil how
should we cook this'  
  
Should we let it burn  
We both need a wise up we both need to learn the things  
That come out of your mouth sweet mouth when I leave  
This safe old house should it be a good thing or should it be  
Here's something dying baby  
But I got to go out your need on the inside  
Where a man like that can shout  
So if you thinks that's evil  
Shake it up and about get to the tip top take a tall look out  
So a leader of people doesn't know what it's  
About just wants to be a big man has the urge to whip it out  
Well I sold it you bought it you spread it you caught it you  
Don't have to have a big dick  
T makes you feel proud I got to find a high point get it out  
For the crowd you bought me, you bore me you tease me,  
You taught me you feed me, you fought me you see me then you want me who you b
Me,  
Then touch me you enter and walk me should I have a good day  
Or is it bad should I get some of the things out  
See what I've had there's something dying baby but I gotta get out
