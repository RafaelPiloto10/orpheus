I still remember the ways that you touched me  
Now I know I don't mean anything to you  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
And that means  
  
You look stupid  
Tellin' all your friends how you got the best of me  
I intended to share the pleasure  
Only I look stupid  
We're livin' in a world with a lot of pressure  
It's quite un-needed to put more pressure on me  
  
You came and went and left my house like "I was just passin' by"  
Hello, goodbye, you left a note saying t'was nice stoppin' by  
I should have never ever let you inside  
  
[Chorus]  
I still remember the ways that you touched me  
Now I know I don't mean anything to you  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
Does that mean anything to you?  
  
Easy breezy  
Do you whistle so high that you're feelin' lonely?  
How do I breathe?  
With all this pressure on me?  
Easy breezy  
When you wrestle you know that you hurt somebody  
How do I breathe?  
With all this pressure on me?  
  
You came and went and left my house like "I was just passin' by"  
Konnichiwa, sayanora  
T'was nice of you to stop by  
Would it amuse you if I told you that I  
  
I still remember the ways that you touched me  
Now I know I don't mean anything to you  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
Does that mean anything to you?  
  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
Does that mean anything to you?  
  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
Does that mean anything to you?  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
  
She's got a new microphone  
She's got a new microphone  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
She's got a new microphone  
Doesn't need you anymore.  
She doesn't need you anymore
