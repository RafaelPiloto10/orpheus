America the beautiful  
Oh, beautiful for spacious skies  
For amber waves of grain  
For purple mountain's majesties  
Above the fruited plain  
  
America, America  
God shed his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea  
  
Oh, beautiful for patriot dream  
That sees beyond the years  
Thine alabaster cities gleam  
Undimmed by human tears  
  
America, America  
God shed his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea
