Do you see the face on the TV screen  
Coming at you every Sunday  
See that face on the billboard  
That man is me  
  
On the cover of the magazine  
There's no question why I'm smiling  
You buy a piece of paradise  
You buy a piece of me  
  
I'll get you everything you wanted  
I'll get you everything you need  
You don't need to believe in hereafter  
Just believe in me  
  
Cause Jesus he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
I've been talking to Jesus all my life  
Oh yes he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
And he's been telling me  
Everything is alright  
  
I believe in the family  
With my ever loving wife beside me  
But she don't know about my girlfriend  
Or the man I met last night  
  
Do you believe in God  
Cause that's what I'm selling  
And if you wanna go to heaven  
I'll see you right  
  
You won't even have to leave your house  
Or get out of your chair  
You don't even have to touch that dial  
Cause I'm everywhere  
  
Cause Jesus he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
I've been talking to Jesus all my life  
Oh yes he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
And he's been telling me  
Everything gonna be alright  
  
Won't find me practicing what I'm preaching  
Won't find me making no sacrifice  
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles  
If you promise to be good, try to be nice  
God will take good care of you  
Just do as I say, don't do as I do  
  
I'm counting my blessings,  
I've found true happiness  
Cause I'm getting richer, day by day  
You can find me in the phone book,  
Just call my toll free number  
You can do it anyway you want  
Just do it right away  
  
There'll be no doubt in your mind  
You'll believe everything I'm saying  
If wanna get closer to him  
Get on your knees and start paying  
  
Cause Jesus he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
I've been talking to Jesus all my life  
Oh yes he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
And he's been telling me  
Everything is alright
