All of that thick time without you  
Has made me so thick and drunk  
"and it's ok to laugh about it"  
I said, "it's ok to laugh about it"  
  
Runnin' twice as fast to stay in the same place  
Don't catch my breath until the end of the day  
And I'd rather be sot in the face  
Than hear what you're going to say  
  
One day the wind will come up  
And you'll come up empty again  
And who'll be laughing then?  
You'll come up empty again  
  
No reason no explanation so play the violins  
  
It's always funny until someone gets hurt  
And then it's just hilarious!  
  
You beat me every time you blink  
if only I did not have to think  
Think about you crackin' a smile  
Think about you all the while  
  
On the ricochet it's going to hit you  
It's always funny until someone gets hurt  
You can laugh at me when it misses you
