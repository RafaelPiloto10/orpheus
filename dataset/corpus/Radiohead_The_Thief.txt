Why must I be the thief?  
Why must I be the thief?  
Oh Lord please won't you tell me,  
Why must I be the thief.  
  
Why must I be the thief  
He said to the hanging man  
And how come you're the only one  
That's black around, that always stares  
  
Why must I be the thief  
He asked of the hanging man  
And how come you're the only one  
Who lived with an open hand  
Now why must I be the thief  
You've cursed with many clouds  
And the hanging man without his hand  
Looked beyond his heart  
  
The thief was drawn to the cross  
To share that other's fate  
But the Jesus man said "Not now"  
"My brother not now, it's far too late"  
(far too late) (7x)  
  
Do what you must  
Take what you can  
Steal the pride from every heart,  
Every angered man (3x)  
I am the thief  
I am the thief  
And you will run  
Yes and you will hide  
But I'll get you then  
Yes I will  
Because of you, because it's justified.  
I will get you yet  
Cause it's justified  
I will get you yet  
It's justified  
I will get you yet  
It's justified
