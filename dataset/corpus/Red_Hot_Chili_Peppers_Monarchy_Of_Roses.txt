The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep  
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep  
Do you like it rough I ask and are you up to task?  
The calicoes of Pettibone where cultures come to? clash  
  
Several of my best friends wear, the colors of the crown  
And Mary wants to fill it up, and Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl  
The savior of your light  
The monarchy of roses, the monarchy of roses tonight  
  
The cloth between my former queen, her legendary stare  
The holy tears that I am in, the lovely cross to bear  
  
Several of my best friends know, the secrets of this town  
And Mary wants to raise it up, and Sherry wants to spit it all around, girl  
The sailors of the night  
The monarchy of roses, the monarchy of roses tonight  
  
Several of my best friends wear, the colors of the crown  
And Mary wants to fill it up, and Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl  
The savior of your light  
The monarchy of roses, the monarchy of roses  
  
Hey yeah  
We all want the rose you know  
I said, hey yeah  
Show us love before you go  
Say I will, and then I'll say I want to  
The story of love that I will never taunt you  
  
Hey yeah  
We all want the rose you know  
I said, hey yeah  
Show us love before you go  
Say I will, and then I'll say I want to  
The story of love that I will always want you  
Hey
