See the white light  
The light within  
Be your own disciple  
Fan the sparks of will  
For all of us waiting  
Our kingdom has come  
  
Rays of power shining  
Rays of magic fall  
On the golden voice that speaks within us all  
For all of us waiting  
Your kingdom will come  
  
Kingdom Come  
  
Feel the white light  
The light within  
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win  
For all of us waiting  
Your kingdom will come  
  
Kingdom Come  
  
Words of power  
Calling to us all  
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall  
No longer waiting  
Our kingdom has come  
  
Kingdom Come  
  
Kingdom coming  
Another kingdom falls  
The rightful are waiting  
But all are not rightful  
Wait and receive the weight of the fall  
  
Kingdom Come
