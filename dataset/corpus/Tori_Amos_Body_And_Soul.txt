Sweet Communion  
Sweet Communion  
  
I have waited all my life  
You say you are bonafide  
To be my judge  
Lay your law down on me love  
  
Seven devils bring them on  
I have left my weapons  
Cause I think you're wrong  
These devils of yours they need love  
  
Come and kneel with me body and soul  
Come and kneel with me body and soul  
Body and soul body and soul body and soul  
  
Sweet Communion  
Sweet Communion  
In my temple boy be warned  
Violence doesn't have a home now but ecstasy  
That's as pure as a woman's gold  
  
Seven devils bring them on  
I have left my weapons  
Cause I think you're wrong  
These devils of yours they need love  
  
Come and kneel with me body and soul  
Come and kneel with me body and soul  
Body and soul body and soul body and soul  
  
I'll save you from that Sunday sermon  
Boy I think you need a conversion  
Body and soul  
  
Come and kneel with me body and soul  
Come and kneel with me body and soul  
Body and soul body and soul body and soul
