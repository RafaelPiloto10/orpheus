I never told you the truth  
Holding your hand at the end of the rainbow  
Left you with nothing to lose  
I can't cry anymore  
I can't cry anymore  
I used to be bulletproof  
I used to wear my hat like a halo  
There's too many holes in my roof  
I can't cry anymore  
I can't cry anymore  
  
She's got the rain  
She's got the rain  
And when she's not around  
The sunshine brings me down  
  
I used to be so aloof  
Whirling around like an angry tornado  
Faced with the burden of proof  
I can't lie anymore  
I can't lie anymore  
  
She's got the rain  
She's got the rain  
And when she's not around  
The sunshine brings me down  
  
She sits alone in her room  
She won't let me in and I worry about her  
I hope that she's coming out soon  
I can't cry anymore  
I can't cry anymore  
  
She's got the rain  
She's got the rain  
And when she's not around  
The sunshine, the sunshine brings me down
