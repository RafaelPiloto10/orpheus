Twice bitten, twice baked.  
Twice led down the same mistake.  
Try me on a Saturday, try me.  
Try me.  
Fine fool for a holiday.  
Slow sun in a Spanish way  
One heart for one week of May, why me?  
Why me?  
Twice given to yesterday  
Right for a foray with fate.  
Fly me home to heaven's gate, fly me.  
Fly me. Fly...  
Twice bitten, twice baked.  
Twice led down the same mistake.  
Try me on a Saturday, try me.  
Try me.  
Try me, try me.
