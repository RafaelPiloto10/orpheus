Did I lose your love a long time ago  
Or did I just wear it out? Baby, I don't know  
Seems like anymore we're not on the same page  
In the same book, or on the same stage  
  
We say the words, but they feel all wrong  
Like a happy blues, like a sad love song  
How two people can bow and scrape  
For every shred of tenderness  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of times that surround us  
Memories that astound us  
Joy and happiness  
Can love stand the test?  
  
A long time ago, or was it just yesterday  
Why would we fall out of love? Baby, can you say?  
Don't look at me like I'm stranger now  
Have I changed that much? Baby, tell me how  
How two people could bow and scrape  
For every shred of tenderness  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of times that surround us  
Memories that astound us  
Joy and happiness  
Can love stand the test?  
  
We said forever, for always, for good  
But the years were not impressed  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of time that surrounds us  
Moments that astound us?  
Can love stand the test  
Of time that surrounds us  
Moments that astound us?  
Joy and happiness  
Joy and happiness  
Joy and happiness
