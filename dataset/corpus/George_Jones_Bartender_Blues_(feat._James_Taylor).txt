Well I'm just a bartender  
And I don't like my work  
But I don't mind the money at all  
I've seen lots of sad faces  
And lots of bad cases  
Of folks with their backs to the wall  
  
(Chorus:)  
But I got four walls around me, to hold my life  
To keep me from going astray  
And a honky tonk angel, to hold me tight  
To keep me from slipping away  
  
Well I can light up your smokes  
I can laugh at your jokes  
I can watch you fall down on your knees  
I can close down this bar  
Oh and gas up my car  
And I can pack up and mail in my keys  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
Now the smoke fills the air  
Of this honky tonk bar  
And I'm thinkin' bout where I'd rather be  
But I burned all my bridges  
And I sunk all my ships  
And I'm standing at the edge of the sea  
  
(Repeat chorus
