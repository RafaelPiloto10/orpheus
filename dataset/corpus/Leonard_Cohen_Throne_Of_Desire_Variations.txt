(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
Let me start with you Miss Shy  
Bundled up in your mother's lie  
Tip toe, tip toe  
Hiding your silky pleasure  
  
Miss Shy come to me  
Along the snowy paths of modesty  
Tip toe, tip toe  
Hiding your silky treasure  
  
Come to me with downcast eyes  
Come to me and claim the prize  
Of your outrageous pleasure  
  
How I like you Miss Shy  
Bundled up in your mother's lie  
Tip toe --  
Claim your outrageous pleasure!  
  
O o o  
  
And you I want strong  
With your hatred intact  
With your father's pipe  
And your brother's bat  
And your quaint belief  
In holy authority  
  
With your discipline  
And your Darwin claws  
And your legal eye  
On the peacock's flaws  
I see what fallen man  
Was meant to be  
  
With your absolute  
No man can refute  
Your absolutely unique  
Contempt for the weak  
Down on our paws  
There are no laws  
Kiss me where I can not speak  
  
You I want strong  
With your hatred intact  
With your father's pipe  
And your brother's bat  
Now kiss me  
Where I cannot speak!  
  
O o o  
  
You I want for my friend  
To gossip with me and drink tea  
To walk down by the river's bend  
You I want for my friend  
  
To watch the water going by  
The swallows climbing above  
To tell me that I lie  
When I tell you I cannot love,  
Cannot love  
  
To know my heart better than me  
To be my friend in charity  
To speak of lovers old and new  
To say to me, what they've done to you  
  
You I want for my friend  
To make some sense of our difference  
To eat and drink together  
To comfort one another,  
And may our conversation never end!  
  
O o o  
  
And you  
I want your  
Beauty hidden  
From all  
Sight but my  
Own  
So none may know  
Your womanhood  
Or hear you moan  
Your pleasures  
To an infant thumb  
  
You will be  
True to me  
There will be no  
Infidelity  
For I will weave  
A cloak so tight  
About your loveliness  
No man will ever guess  
The wild commands you whisper  
From your childhood to the night  
  
And what  
Drops the moon  
About a man  
And draws  
Him tidal to  
Your lips  
And lets your nipples  
Harden I can  
Hear you moan  
Your pleasures  
To an infant thumb  
  
And you I want  
To wink at me  
And you I want  
To think of me  
You I want above  
I want you below  
You I want veiled  
And you to know  
I want you clumbsy  
I want you skilled  
You be ferocious  
You be mild...  
  
You be foolish  
You be wise  
You stay here  
You stay outside  
You comb out your hair  
You keep it curled  
I want, I want, I want  
I want to know the world  
You comb out your hair  
You keep yours curled  
I want, I want to know the world!  
  
O o o  
  
And you  
Who did not come tonight  
I will wait for you  
And you  
Who are not born  
I will write for you  
And you  
Who must appear  
In veils of chance  
And mystery  
I will kneel  
I will kneel  
Like a child  
Who's watching Mary  
As she stands  
Upon the air  
In gentle splendour  
In the black  
Mouth of a cave  
Open-armed and radiant  
To save mankind  
And all the broken  
World to mother  
  
And I swear  
By the obscure  
Truth  
Of this  
Enfolded heart  
I swear  
By  
The unrequited greed  
Of this  
Human heart  
And all  
Its  
Disappointed pleasures  
I swear  
By  
The deep light  
Of my soul  
Stained  
And covered over  
With  
Intrigues of pride  
Whose mercy is  
To let me sing  
I swear  
That I will be  
For the one  
Who will not come  
To me  
I swear that  
I will be  
Her lover  
Her eternal  
And imperfect  
Spirit lover.
