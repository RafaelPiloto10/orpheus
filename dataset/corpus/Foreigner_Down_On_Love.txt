Some people stay all alone and hide  
They don't even want to know the reason why  
They've given up on finding someone new  
But new love comes, it's gonna come for you  
When true love comes, it's gonna comfort you  
  
Now you say you've got a broken heart  
You oughta know this side of love can leave you torn apart  
Dry your eyes 'cause your heart's gonna mend  
And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again  
Yeah, maybe tonight you'll fall in love again  
  
But I know, I know that you're down on love  
But you're wrong, so wrong  
To be down on love  
  
Now love seems so far away  
Your skies are so cloudy  
And the tears come like fallin' rain  
Face up to it and don't pretend  
And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again  
Yeah, maybe tonight you'll fall in love again  
Just once in a lifetime you'll realize  
When love takes two, only one heart cries  
  
But you're wrong, so wrong to be down on love  
You know you're not the only one  
See I've been down on love  
  
In matters of the heart  
You better know before you start  
You can't get down on love  
  
So always be prepared  
To be alone and a little scared  
But never down on love  
  
You see you can't stay down forever, girl  
Down on love  
Come on, now  
Don't get down on love  
This ain't right baby, no  
Down on love  
Don't you go through life livin' down on love  
Down on love  
Don't you go through life livin' down on love  
Down on love  
Don't you go through life down on love  
Down on love  
Down on love
