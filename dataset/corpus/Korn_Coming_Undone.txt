Keep holding on  
When my brains tickin' like a bomb  
Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me  
Sweet bitter words  
Unlike nothing I have heard  
Sing along Mocking bird  
You don't affect me  
  
That's right!  
Deliver it to my heart!  
Please strike!  
Be deliberate  
  
Wait  
I'm coming undone  
Irate  
I'm coming undone  
Too late  
I'm coming undone  
What looks so strong, so delicate  
  
Wait  
I'm starting to suffocate  
And soon I anticipate  
I'm coming undone  
What looks so strong, so delicate  
  
Choke, choke again  
I thought my demons were my friends  
Pity me in the end  
They're out to get me  
Since I was young  
I tasted sorrow on my tongue  
And this sweet chocolate gun does not protect me  
  
That's right!  
Trigger between my eyes  
Please strike!  
Make it quick now!  
  
Wait  
I'm coming undone  
I'm irate  
I'm coming undone  
Too late  
I'm coming undone  
What looks so strong, so delicate  
  
Wait  
I'm starting to suffocate  
And soon I anticipate  
I'm coming undone  
What looks so strong, so delicate  
  
I'm trying to hold it together  
Head is lighter than a feather  
Looks like I'm not getting better  
Not getting better  
  
Wait  
I'm coming undone irate  
I'm coming undone too late  
I'm coming undone  
Wait  
I'm starting to suffocate  
And soon I anticipate
