There's a south wind risin' and  
The moon shines on my window sill  
I've got a feeling I might walk on over the hill  
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is some rest  
And a bottle of your very best  
Blackberry wine  
  
There's a new moon risin' and  
The wind sings its old song  
Pass it on over it's a sin to be sober too long  
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is my share  
Of a bottle of that very rare  
Blackberry wine  
  
My old gal's got a new dress on five and dime  
Try as she will she can't get me  
To come home on time  
But I'd never cheat her  
Or mistreat her you know  
As over the mountain I go  
Blackberry wine  
  
I'll be soft spoken  
All I need is my rest  
And a bottle of your very best  
Blackberry wine  
  
Now my days are numbered  
And one more heel's been killed  
Blackberry John left me  
His old recipe in his will  
I'm bent but not broken,  
All I need is some time  
And a bottle of your very fine  
Blackberry wine  
  
Blackberry wine,  
You know that I'm quite dry without you  
Blackberry wine
