I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste  
A flannel for my face  
Pyjamas, a hairbrush  
New shoes and a case  
I said to my reflection  
Let's get out of this place  
Past the church and the steeple  
The laundry on the hill  
Billboards and the buildings  
Memories of it still  
Keep calling and calling  
But forget it all  
I know I will  
Tempted by the fruit of another  
Tempted but the truth is discovered  
What's been going on  
Now that you have gone  
There's no other  
Tempted by the fruit of another  
Tempted but the truth is discovered  
I'm at the car park, the airport  
The baggage carousel  
The people keep on crowding  
I'm wishing I was well  
I said it's no occasion  
It's no story I could tell  
At my bedside empty pocket  
A foot without a sock  
Your body gets much closer  
I fumble for the clock  
Alarmed by the seduction  
I wish that it would stop  
I bought a novel, some perfume  
A fortune all for you  
But it's not my conscience  
That hates to be untrue  
I asked of my reflection  
Tell me what is there to do
