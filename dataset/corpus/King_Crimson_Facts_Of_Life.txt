Six billion ants crawling on a plate  
Six million ants crawling on a plate  
None of them give back as much as they take  
Six billion ants crawling on a plate  
  
Doesn't mean you should just because you can  
It doesn't mean you should just because you can  
Like Abraham and Ishmael fighting over sand  
It doesn't mean you should just because you can  
  
That is a fact of life  
That is a fact of life  
  
Now some of us build and some of us teach  
Some of us build, some of us teach  
And some of us kill what some of us eat  
  
That is a fact of life  
That is a fact of life  
  
Nobody knows what happens when you die  
Nobody knows what happens when you die  
Believe what you want, it doesn't mean you're right  
  
That is a fact of life  
That is a fact
