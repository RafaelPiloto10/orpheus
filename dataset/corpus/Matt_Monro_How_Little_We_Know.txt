Maybe it happens this way  
Maybe we really belong together  
But after all, how little we know  
  
Maybe it's just for a day  
Love is as changeable as the weather  
And after all, how little we know  
  
Who knows why an April breeze never remains  
Why stars in the trees hide when it rains  
Love comes along, casting a spell  
Will it sing you a song  
Will it say a farewell  
Who can tell  
  
Maybe you're meant to be mine  
Maybe I'm only supposed to stay in your arms a while  
As others have done  
  
Is this what I've waited for, am I the one  
Oh, I hope in my heart that it's so  
In spite of how little we know  
  
Is this what I've waited for, am I the one  
Oh, I hope in my heart that it's so  
In spite of how little we know
