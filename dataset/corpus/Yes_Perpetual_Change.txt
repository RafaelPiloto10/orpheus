I see the cold mist in the night  
And watch the hills roll out of sight.  
I watch in ev'ry single way,  
Inside out, outside in, ev'ry day.  
  
The sun can warm the coldest dawn  
And move the movement on the lawn.  
I learn in ev'ry single day,  
Inside out, outside in, ev'ry way.  
  
And there you are,  
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,  
And boy you'll see  
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,  
  
And then you'll say  
Even in time we shall control the day,  
When what you'll see  
Deep inside base controlling you and me.  
  
And one peculiar point I see,  
As one of many ones of me.  
As truth is gathered, I rearrange,  
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,  
Perpetual change.  
  
And there you are,  
Saying we have the moon, so now the stars,  
When all you see  
Is near disaster gazing down on you and me,  
  
And there you're standing,  
Saying we have the whole world in our hands,  
When all you'll see,  
Deep inside the world's controlling you and me.  
  
You'll see perpetual change.  
You'll see perpetual change.  
  
And there you are,  
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,  
And boy you'll see  
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,  
  
And then you'll say  
Even in time we shall control the day,  
When what you'll see  
Deep inside base controlling you and me.  
  
As mist and sun are both the same,  
We look on as pawns of their game.  
They move to testify the day,  
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,  
All of the way.  
Ah, Ah.
