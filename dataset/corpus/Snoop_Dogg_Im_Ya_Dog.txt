[Hook: Snoop Dogg] x2  
Baby, I come running  
Baby, come running  
Just keep me coming  
And I come running  
Cause I'm your dog  
Baby I'm your dog  
So whenever you call  
I come running  
  
[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]  
You ain't listenin'  
So you can talk to me  
Don't listen to him  
A body like that ain't hard to feed  
Cause girl I'll eat you up  
All in a couple of seconds  
Girl I'll eat you up  
It's when you realize you're in Heaven  
Like how'd you get there?  
Baby what you doin' in this chair?  
Couldn't let you sit there  
You need help, somebody should get there  
You see girl, time is like money  
Both of which men loathe  
Spend them both with me  
And then for sure you'll know  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]  
She's impressed by a fat boy  
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy  
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy  
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it  
Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it  
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard  
Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it  
Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force  
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs  
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job  
Dog pound niggas, and we came to fight  
I was several million up before it came to light  
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it  
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music  
Smoked out like a player and you know the name  
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]  
I got... Rottweiler in tube sock  
Pitbull... lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die  
Boxer... you take mine off then hallelujah  
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times  
Freaky... freak like it's the 80s  
Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we  
Should tone it... down with the clean version  
Dirty... but in public you're like teen virgin  
I like it... make me realize my vices  
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates  
Private... meetin' inside your bedroom  
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room  
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'ma cum in first place  
I'ma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place  
I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree  
What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho
