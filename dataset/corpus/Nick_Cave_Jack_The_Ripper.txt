I got a woman  
She rules my house with an iron fist  
I got a woman  
She rules my house with an iron fist  
She screams out Jack the Ripper  
Every time I try to give that girl a kiss  
  
I got a woman  
She strikes me down with a fist of lead  
I got a woman  
She strikes me down with a fist of lead  
We bed in a bucket of butcher's knives  
A awake with a hatchet hanging over my head  
  
Well you know the story of the viper  
It's long and lean with poison tooth  
Yeah, you know the story of the viper  
It's long and lean it's got a poison tooth  
Well they're hissing under the floorboards  
Hanging down in bunches from my roof  
  
I got a woman  
She just hollers what she wants from where she's at  
I got a woman  
She just hollers what she wants from where she is  
She screams out Jack the Ripper  
Every time I try to give that girl a kiss
