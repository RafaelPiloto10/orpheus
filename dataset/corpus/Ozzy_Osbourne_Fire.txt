I am the god of hell fire and I bring you  
Fire, I'll take you to burn.  
Fire, I'll take you to learn.  
I'll see you burn!  
You fought hard and you saved and learned,  
But all of it's gonna burn.  
And your mind, your tiny mind,  
You know you've really been so blind.  
Now's your time burn your mind.  
You're falling far too far behind.  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, you gonna burn!  
Fire, to destroy all you've done.  
Fire, to end all you've become.  
I'll feel you burn!  
  
You've been living like a little girl,  
In the middle of your little world.  
And your mind, your tiny mind,  
You know you've really been so blind.  
Now's your time burn your mind,  
You're falling far too far behind.  
  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no,  
  
Fire, I'll take you to burn.  
Fire, I'll take you to learn.  
You're going to burn!  
You're going to burn!  
You're going to burn!  
You're going to burn! burn! burn! burn!  
  
Fire, I'll take you to burn.  
Fire, I'll take you to learn.  
Fire, to end all you've become.  
Fire, I'll watch you burn  
  
I am the god of hell fire, ha ha ha ha ha!
