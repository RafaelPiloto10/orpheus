The bells are ringing for me and my gal  
Oh, the birds are singing for me and my gal  
Well, everybody's been knowin', to a wedding they're goin'  
And for weeks they've been sewing every Susie and Sal  
  
They're congregatin' for me and my gal  
While the parson's waitin' for me and my gal  
And sometimes I'm gonna build a little home for two  
Three or four or more, in love land for me and my gal  
  
And sometimes I'm gonna build a little home for two  
Three or four or more, in love land for me and my gal
