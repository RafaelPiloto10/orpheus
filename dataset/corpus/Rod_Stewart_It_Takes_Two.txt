One can have a dream, baby  
Two can make a dream so real  
One can talk about being in love  
Two can see how it really feels  
  
One can wish upon a star  
Two can make a wish come true, yeah  
One can stand alone in the dark  
Two can make a light shine through  
  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
  
One can have a broken heart  
living in misery  
Two can really ease the pain  
like a perfect remedy  
One can be alone in a bar  
like an island he's all alone  
Two can make just any place  
seem just like bein' at home  
  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
Yeah  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two, ha!  
  
One can go out to a movie  
looking for a special treat  
Two can make that single movie  
something really kind of sweet  
And one can take a walk in the moonlight  
thinking that's it's really nice  
But two lovers walking hand in hand  
is like adding just a pinch of spice  
  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
Oh doo doo doo doo  
Oh doo doo doo doo  
Oh doo doo doo doo  
Oh  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two, ha!  
It takes two, baby, yeah yeah  
Me and you, just me and you  
It takes two, baby
