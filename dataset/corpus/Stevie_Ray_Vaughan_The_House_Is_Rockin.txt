Well, the house is a-rockin'  
Don't bother knockin'  
Yeah the house is a-rockin'  
Don't bother knockin'  
Yeah the house is a-rockin'  
Don't bother come on in  
  
Kick off your shoes, start losin' the blues  
This old house ain't got nothin' to lose  
Seen it all for years, start spreadin' the news  
We got room on the floor  
Come on baby shake sumpin' loose  
  
Well, the house is a-rockin'  
Don't bother knockin'  
Yeah the house is a-rockin'  
Don't bother knockin'  
Yeah the house is a-rockin'  
Don't bother come on in  
  
Walkin' up the street you can hear the sound  
Of some bad honky-tonkers really layin' it down  
They've seen it all for years and got nothin' to lose  
So get out on the floor  
Shimmy til you shake sumpin' loose  
  
Well, the house is a-rockin'  
Don't bother knockin'  
Yeah the house is a-rockin'  
Don't bother knockin'  
Yeah the house is a-rockin'  
Don't bother come on in
