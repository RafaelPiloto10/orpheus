Couples walking in the park  
Seeing them just breaks my heart in two, right in two  
Wonder how you spend your time?  
Do you know that I'm still missing you, missing you  
Am I the only one who can't stand a midnight train  
Or do you hear that whistle moan and want my love again?  
Ah, don't it make you lonely?  
Don't it make you wanna cry out loud?  
Don't it make you want me?  
Don't it make you wanna work it out?  
Don't it make your heart ache?  
Even though you're finally free  
Don't it make you lonely, lonely like me?  
When you hear a sad song play  
Does a teardrop lay there in your eye, do you cry?  
When you're alone and the day is done  
Don't you wish we'd give it one more try  
Ah, just one more try?  
And do you reach out in the middle of the night to find me gone  
'Cause if you feel the way I do then baby why don't you come home?  
Ah, don't it make you lonely?  
Don't it make you wanna cry out loud?  
Don't it make you want me?  
Don't it make you wanna work it out?  
Don't it make your heart ache?  
Even though you're finally free  
Don't it make you lonely, lonely like me?  
Ah, don't it make you lonely, lonely like me?
