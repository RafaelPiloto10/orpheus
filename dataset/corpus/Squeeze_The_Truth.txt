I lied to you, I've cheated too  
So what friend can I be  
But still you stick through thick and thin  
Hoping that you'll change me  
I towed the line then fell behind  
Our love began to wane  
The pressure grew and then I knew  
That things were not the same  
The truth  
It's the toughest thing to explain  
The truth  
Playing tricks with me again  
When the truth has to be told  
My blood runs hot and cold  
The truth is not my middle name  
  
You threw a rope attached with hope  
Way down into the sea  
Where lovers swim so deep within  
The tides of mystery  
For what it's worth I don't deserve  
A girl as strong as you  
You're worth much more than me I'm sure  
Accept this as the truth
