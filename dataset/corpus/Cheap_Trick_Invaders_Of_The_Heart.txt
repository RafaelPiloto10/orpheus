(it's rolling)  
(oh, wrong song)  
(it's rolling)  
  
Invaders of the heart  
Are messin' with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin' me insane  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin' with my brain  
  
I can't see anymore  
Now I've gotten tunnel vision  
I can't be anyone  
I just got no direction  
I can't see anything  
But I don't need glasses on  
I can't think anymore  
I'm just a nervous wreck  
  
Invaders of the heart  
Are messin' with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin' me insane  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin' with my brain  
  
I can't see anymore  
Always buckle under pressure  
I can't be anyone  
The slightest thing will set me off  
I can't feel anything  
I'm on pins and I'm on needles  
I can't think anymore  
I've lost my appetite  
  
Invaders of the heart  
Are messin' with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin' me insane  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin' with my brain  
  
(take it, rick: 1, 2 ,3, 4, 5, 6 ,7 ,8 ,9  
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

Invaders of the heart  
Are messin' with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin' with my brain  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin' me insane  
Are messin' with my mind  
Make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
  
(one more time!)  
(okay, choice of lousy endings now.)
