I see you with your palms in your pants  
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands  
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker  
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker  
  
I see you with your palms in your pants  
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands  
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker  
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker  
  
I know your name, yeah  
Your name is unimportant  
We in the belly of the beast  
And she thinking 'bout abortion  
  
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard  
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award  
You can save your bullshit on your memory card  
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed  
Jumped on the celly, called Machiavelli  
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly  
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"  
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga  
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars  
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers  
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked  
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets  
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude  
The haters music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes  
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to  
But I just built a house on "I don't give a fuck" Avenue  
  
I see you with your palms in your pants  
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands  
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker  
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker  
  
I know your name, yeah  
Your name is unimportant  
We in the belly of the beast  
And she thinking 'bout abortion  
  
Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed  
Life is a gamble better check the point spread  
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head  
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds  
Smoking on a hallelujah, thank you Jesus  
Help me focus on the future and not the previous  
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason  
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon  
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees  
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed  
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking  
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?  
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?  
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs  
On the road to redemption, go on and use a few stairs  
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared yeah  
  
I know your name, yeah  
Your name is unimportant  
We in the belly of the beast  
And she thinking 'bout abortion damn  
  
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air  
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair  
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes  
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there  
  
And I see you with your palms in your pants  
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands  
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker  
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker  
  
I know your name
