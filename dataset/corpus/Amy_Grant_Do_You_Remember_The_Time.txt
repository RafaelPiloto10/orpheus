Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?  
Can you look back on the moment after all these years?  
On the moment love broke through and heaven seemed so near  
Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?  
  
Do you remember the day you first let Jesus in?  
How he gently and tenderely washed away your sin  
Don't you know that He still cares the way He did back then?  
Do you remember the day you first let Jesus in?  
  
Keep holdin' on  
Never letting go  
We're not far  
from the end of the road  
  
Keep holdin' on  
Never letting go  
We're not far  
from the end of the road  
  
In a moment love broke through heaven and heaven seemed so near  
Do you remember the moment your heart was moved to tears?  
Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?
