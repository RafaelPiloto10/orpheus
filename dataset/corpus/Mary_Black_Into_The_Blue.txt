Cast my boat out to the ocean  
And set it sails to the wind  
Gentle breeze blowing into my heart  
I'm alive in this gentle world  
A life carefree  
A life carefree  
And in this love that you give me  
You have to share the joy and mystery  
The wonder of your smile  
And the power of your words  
That changes me  
That changes me  
Sometimes I could fly  
When your heart it touches mine  
Deep into the blue  
Where my soul is lost  
And all because of you  
Gave my heart to another love  
Crashing waves of pain came over me  
In my distress you came and rescued me  
Still the storm talked away  
Of life carefree  
Of life carefree  
Sometimes I could fly  
When your heart it touches mine  
Deep into the blue  
Where my soul is lost  
And all because of you  
When I found myself far away from you  
That's when I hear your voice  
Reminding me, calling me, lifting me  
Out into the blue  
Out into the blue  
Sometimes I could fly  
When you heart it touches mine  
Deep into the blue  
Where my soul is lost  
And all because of you
