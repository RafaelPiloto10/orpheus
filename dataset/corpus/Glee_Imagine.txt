Imagine there's no countries,  
It isn't hard to do  
Nothing to kill or die for  
And no religion too  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace  
  
(You) you may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope some day you'll join us  
And the world will live as one  
  
Imagine no possessions  
I wonder if you can  
No need for greed or hunger  
A brotherhood of man  
Imagine all the people  
Sharing all the world  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope some day you'll join us  
And the world will live as one  
  
Imagine there's no countries,  
It isn't hard to do  
Nothing to kill or die for  
And no religion too  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace  
  
You, you may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope some day you'll join us  
And the world will live as one
