She can't put her finger on a single lipstick stain  
Perfume doesn't linger on a shirt on  
There's no matchbook in his pocket with a number and name  
So why does she still hurt  
  
'Cause a woman knows, when there's another woman  
She can feel her, all over her man  
A woman knows, when there's another woman  
You can't fool her, so don't try to think you can  
  
What she don't know, won't hurt her  
That's what he tells himself  
So he hides his cheatin' heart inside his chest  
He thinks he's put one over, but what he don't know is  
He's already confessed  
  
'Cause a woman knows, when there's another woman  
She can feel her, all over her man  
A woman knows, when there's another woman  
You can't fool her, so don't try to think you can  
  
A woman knows, when there's another woman  
You can't fool her, so don't try to think you can  
You can't fool her, so don' try to think you can
