I'm sorry to have taken so long  
It must have been a bitch while I was gone  
You mind if I sit down for a while  
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style  
Well, how could you have waited so long  
It must have been a bitch while I was gone  
All this time you put up a fear  
For a hundred thousand years  
I'm sorry to have taken so long  
It must have been a bitch while I was gone  
All this time you put up a fear  
For a hundred thousand years  
And baby won't you let me  
I think I'm goin' out of my head  
I'm just about to, ooh yeah, ha  
I'm sorry to have taken so long  
It must have been a bitch while I was gone  
You mind if I sit down for a while, would you babe  
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style
