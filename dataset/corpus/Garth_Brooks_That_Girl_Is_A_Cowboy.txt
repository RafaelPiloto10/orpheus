It was a hundred and seven  
We were heading to town  
She had her sleeves rolled up  
And the windows rolled down  
That girl is a cowboy  
Robert Earl was singing out  
The "Buckin' Song"  
With every word that Keen was bringing  
She was singing along  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
(chorus)  
Sometimes the best cowboys  
Ain't cowboys at all  
She's got my back  
Even when it's against the wall  
When I need a friend  
She's the guy I call  
'Cause sometimes the best cowboys  
Ain't cowboys at all  
  
So I took her out to show her  
How to rope and ride  
I can't believe that it was me  
That wound up broke and tied  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
So that night I decided  
We should paint the town  
I made it home although  
I really don't remember how  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
There's just something that a cowgirl has  
Ain't no cowboys got  
Man she's something when she's one of the boys  
But something else  
Any time she's not  
  
(Repeat Chorus)
