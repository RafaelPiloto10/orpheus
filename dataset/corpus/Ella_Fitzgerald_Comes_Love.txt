Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet  
Comes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes a fire, then you know just what to do  
Blow a tire, you can buy another shoe  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Don't try hiding, cause there isn't any use  
You'll start sliding, when your heart turns on the juice  
  
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day  
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes a heatwave, you can hurry to the shore  
Comes a summons, you can hide behind the door  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes the measles, you can quarantine a room  
Comes a mousy, you can chase it with a broom  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
That's all, brother, if you ever been in love  
That's all, brother, you know what I'm speaking of  
  
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake  
Comes depression, you may get another break  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes love  
Comes love  
Comes love  
Comes love
