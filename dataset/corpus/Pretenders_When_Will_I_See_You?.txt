Went out on the balcony in the middle of the night  
The hotel was dark except for just one light  
Television burning in the other room  
I couldn't sleep so I put on some of your  
Hollywood perfume  
  
I went out on the balcony and looked across the way  
Some guy was shadow boxing, he looked like sugar ray  
I was feeling dizzy - began to swoon  
Was it his punch or was it just your  
Hollywood perfume?  
  
I feel like a fugitive escaped from my life  
Seeking refuge in the sensual heat  
These paper-thin walls make me party to calls  
Of love wafting through the room  
The night jasmine bloom  
Of your Hollywood perfume  
  
I went out on the balcony to clear my head  
I was burning up in my queen-sized bed  
Down on the strip beneath the billboard moon  
Teenaged girls look for love in the  
Neon sex and doom  
Of your Hollywood perfume  
  
I went out on the balcony with your photograph  
I dropped it in the pool and that made me laugh  
You like your tan but you don't like to swim  
Meanwhile I feel like I'm drowning in  
Neon sex and doom  
The night jasmine bloom  
Of your Hollywood perfume
