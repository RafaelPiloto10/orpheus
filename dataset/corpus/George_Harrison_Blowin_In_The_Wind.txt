How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
How many times must the cannon balls fly  
Before theyre forever banned?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind,  
The answer is blowin in the wind.  
  
How many years can a mountain exist  
Before its washed to the sea?  
How many years can some people exist  
Before theyre allowed to be free?  
How many times can a man turn his head,  
Pretending he just doesn't see?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind,  
The answer is blowin in the wind.  
  
How many times can a dumb man look up  
Before he can see the sky?  
How many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
How many deaths will it take till he knows  
Too many people have died?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind,  
The answer is blowin in the wind.
