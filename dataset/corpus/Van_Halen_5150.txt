The love line is never straight and narrow  
Unless your love is tried and true  
We take a chance with new beginnings  
Still we try win or lose  
Take the highs with the blues  
  
Always one more  
You're never satisfied  
Share one for all with you  
It's only one for me  
Ah, why draw the line  
And meet you half the way  
And you don't know  
What the means, oh yeah!  
  
I feel like a runnning politician, oh!  
Just trying to please you all the time  
I've given you myself with no conditions  
Going wide, running long  
Feeling lost but not for long...  
  
Always one more  
You're never satisfied  
Share one for all with you  
It's only one for me  
So why draw the line  
And meet you half the way  
When you don't know  
What that means, oh yeah!  
  
Solo  
Always one more  
You're never satisfied  
Share one for all with you  
It's only one for me  
So why draw the line  
And meet you half the way  
When you don't know  
What that means.  
  
I'll meet you half the way  
Whoa yeah.  
I'll meet you half the way  
Whoa yeah.
