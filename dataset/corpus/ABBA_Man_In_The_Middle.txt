Did you see that man in the limousine  
With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen  
But she doesn't care, and she never will  
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn  
Just as long as he pays the bill  
  
Did you see that man with a fat cigar  
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar  
He can choose the wine from a vintage year  
He will drink champagne in his limousine  
Where the rest of the street can peer  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)  
  
But you see that man made a big mistake  
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake  
And the money too, all that he can spend  
He can buy the most, nearly anything  
But he can't buy the lot, his friend  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)
