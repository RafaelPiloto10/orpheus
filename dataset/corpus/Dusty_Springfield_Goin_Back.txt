I think I'm goin' back  
To the things I learned so well in my youth,  
I think I'm returning to  
The days when I was young enough to know the truth  
  
Now there are no games  
To only pass the time  
No more coloring books,  
No Christmas bells to chime  
But thinking young and growing older is no sin  
And I can play the game of life to win  
  
I can recall a time,  
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend  
And now I think I've got  
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift  
  
Now there's more to do  
Than watch my sailboat glide  
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride  
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,  
And live my life instead of counting my years  
  
Let everyone debate the true reality,  
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be  
A little bit of freedom, all we're left  
So catch me if you can  
I'm goin' back  
  
I can recall,  
I can remember  
  
I can recall,  
I can remember  
  
I can recall,  
I can remember
