Come on in, and pull yourself up a chair (like chairry!)  
Let the fun begin, it's time to let down your hair!  
Pee-wee's so excited,  
'cause all his friends have been invited (that's you!)  
To go wacky, at pee-wee's playhouse!  
  
There's a crazy rhythm, comin' from puppetland (what that?)  
Dirty dog, cool cat, and chicky baby are the puppet band (yeah!)  
He's got a couple of talkin' fish,  
And a genie who'll grant a wish -  
Golly, it's cuckoo at pee-wee's playhouse!  
  
Globey's spinnin', mr. Window's grinnin',  
'cause pterri's flyin' by (hello!)  
The flowers are singin', the picture phone is ringin',  
And the dinosaur family goes, "hi!"  
Mr. Kite's soarin', conky's still a snorin',  
There's the flashing magic screen.  
The cowntess is so classy, randy's kinda sassy -  
A nuttier establishment you've never seen!  
Spend the day with pee-wee and you'll see what we mean! (come on!)  
  
Get outta bed, there'll be no more nappin'! (wake up!)  
'cause you've landed in a place where anything can happen -  
Now we've given you fair warnin'!  
It's gonna be that kind of mornin' -  
For bein' wacky!  
For getting nutty!  
Golly, it's cuckoo!  
At pee-wee's playhouse!
