My old dad went a walkin' one day,  
Pushing tall weeds right outta his way,  
My old dad went a walkin' one day,  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Corduroy pants and an old plaid shirt,  
Daddy went a walkin' just to feel the earth,  
Got a little dirty but that's all right,  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Old man crossing the road,  
You've got to let him go,  
Old man crossing the road,  
He's feelin' fine  
  
Daddy went a ridin' in his old car,  
Took the dog with him 'cause it ain't too far,  
Daddy went ridin' in his old car,  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Brown leather boots and an old straw hat,  
Daddy's getting wood with the barnyard cat,  
Got a little dirty but that's all right,  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Old man crossing the road,  
You've got to let him go,  
Old man crossing the road,  
He's feelin' fine  
  
Mama's waiting  
At the top of the hill,  
They'll be laughing,  
Oh the stories they'll tell...  
When he holds her  
In his arms again,  
They'll be sweethearts  
With time on their hands
