You're sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove  
That is no way to live that is no way to love  
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in  
Your stabbed in the back but you feel no pain  
Push the heaviest doors that you can't open  
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again  
  
You're as bright as the sun and as calm as the wind  
I don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon  
If my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you  
  
I've got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
He's stealing salt skin  
Telling me I'm winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
The meaning (of)  
  
Hands on strings and my mouth open  
Find the perfect words that I've not spoken  
And I won't tell the truth unless you want me to  
  
For all of the times that I lost my head  
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again  
But when it came back,  
I didn't know my own name  
  
I've got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
He's stealing salt skin  
Telling me I'm winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
The meaning (of)  
Of, of  
  
I've got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
He's stealing salt skin  
Telling me I'm winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
  
I've got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
He's stealing salt skin  
Telling me I'm winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
The meaning (of)
