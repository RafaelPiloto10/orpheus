The opportunity's takin' me over  
I'm gonna put on a mask  
I've got to be outrageous for my fans  
I am not gonna waste this moment  
Because these moments don't last  
So tonight I will shake it and show my ass  
  
Flash  
makes me feel good  
Feel like a queen  
And it gives me all the panache  
That I want  
That I need  
And it'll all be over in a flash  
  
Roll out the carpet give me some exposure  
'Cause soon I'll be the past  
But anyway I came here to tell you 'bout my plans  
Well  
Let's keep this moving while people still notice  
'Cause my time's going fast  
And when it's over, it's over  
'Cause I've got no class  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Flash  
makes me feel good  
Feel like a queen  
And it gives me all the panache  
That I want  
That I need  
And it'll all be over in a flash
