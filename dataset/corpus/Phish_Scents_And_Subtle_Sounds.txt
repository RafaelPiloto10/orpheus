If you would only stop to live  
One moment at a time  
You would I think, be startled by  
The things that you would find  
Like scents you never noticed  
And many subtle sounds  
Like colors in the landscape  
And textures of the town  
And the winds would lift you up  
Into the sky above  
And you'd be treated to a view  
Of everything you love  
And if the moment passes  
You should try it once again  
For if you do it right you'll find  
The moment never ends
