She's looking back to see if he's looking at her  
They talk without any words  
And with a smile, he's moving heaven and earth  
She dreams of holding him tight  
When will the moment be right?  
Got to be diplomatic, a step at a time, don't want to blow it, baby  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  
You're finding your way as you go, go, go  
How do you know?  
Head over heels under the moon looking at you but do you feel it too  
And if I move in closer, what will you do?  
'Cause I'm thinking, please hold me tight  
Am I the light in your eyes?  
I wish you had the power for reading my mind  
'Cause I'll never say it to you  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  
You're finding your way as you go, go, go  
How do you know?  
Oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Hear what I'm sayin' to ya  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  
That's the politics of kissing
