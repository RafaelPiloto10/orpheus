I will dance I will sing to be mad for my king  
Nothing lord is hindering the passion in my soul  
I will dance I will sing to be mad for my king  
Nothing lord is hindering the passion in my soul

And I'll become even more undignified than this  
Some would say it's foolishness but  
Ill become even more undignified than this  
Some would say it's foolishness
