That's underground  
And fly  
Macho Macho  
I don't like your style  
Macho Macho  
You'll be floatin' on the river Nile  
Macho Macho  
So get down on your knees and pray  
Macho Macho  
I'm gonna blow your Macho Macho mind away, away  
And the boys are singin'  
Na - na - na - na - na  
Hip, hip  
Na - na - na - na - na  
So listen  
I heard a story the other day  
And I've been wonderin' what they got to say  
They said you took ma lady for a ride  
They said it lasted to the morning light  
So listen  
I am not a violent boy  
But you touched my lady and she's my  
Favourite toy  
And you're  
Macho Macho  
Fade out  
The boys don't sing anymore
