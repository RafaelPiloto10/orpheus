Try to remember the kind of September  
When life was slow and oh  
so mellow.  
Try to remember the kind of September  
When grass was green and grain was yellow.  
Try to remember the kind of September  
When you were a tender and callow fellow.  
Try to remember and if you remember  
then follow  
follow.  
  
Try to remember when life was so tender  
When no one wept except the willow.  
Try to remember when life was so tender  
When dreams were kept beside your pillow.  
Try to remember when life was so tender  
When love was an ember about to billow.  
Try to remember and if you remember  
then follow  
follow.  
  
Deep in December it's nice to remember  
Although you know the snow will follow.  
Deep in December it's nice to remember  
Without a hurt the heart will hollow.  
Deep in December  
it's nice to remember  
The fire of September that made you mellow.  
Deep in December our hearts should remember and follow  
follow.
