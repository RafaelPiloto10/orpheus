Are you ready for a good pounding, baby? (Get down)  
Are you ready to get it on? (Get down, get down)  
Don't pretend you're not fucking freaky, baby (Get down)  
I will spank that ass just for fun (Get down on the ground)  
  
Ass up high  
Make a motherfucker cry  
It's so good that I could die  
Help me stay alive  
The time is right  
I want to feel it good, tight  
I'm down to do this all night  
I'm gonna deal it up right  
  
I'll behave  
Oh my god  
Make me beg  
My God  
Yes, I'm ready for a good flogging, baby (my God)  
Come on, beat my ass just for fun (Get down, get down)  
Don't let up till my ass is bleeding, baby (Get down)  
Don't let up until you are done (Get down, on the ground)  
  
Ass up high  
Make a motherfucker cry  
It's so good that I could die  
Help me stay alive  
The time is right  
I want to feel it good, tight  
I'm down to do this all night  
I'm gonna beat it up right  
  
We're gonna ride  
I got my tongue inside and outside now  
Don't try to run and hide  
Yes, it's true what they say about my kind
