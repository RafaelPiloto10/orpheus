Honey, I know I've said it too many times before  
I said I'd never say it again  
I guess I shouldn't say anything at all since you're supposed to belong to
him.  
But I just can't let you go without telling you just how much I love you.  
  
So that is why I'm gonna say it one more time  
  
[Chorus]  
Honey, come back I just can't stand  
Each lonely day's a little bit longer  
Than the last time I held you  
Seems like a hundred years ago  
Back to his arms and never know  
The joy of love that used to taste like  
Honey, come back where you belong to only me.  
  
Well, I guess that's about all I gotta say.  
So I'm just gonna take my bags and I'm gonna walk.  
I know those bright lights are callin' ya, honey.  
Big fine cars and fancy clothes.  
But if you ever want somebody to just love ya, and some day you  
Just may, just give me a call-you know where I am  
  
And here is what I'll say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Honey, come back where you belong to only me.  
Honey, come back  
  
Where you belong to only me.  
Honey, come back where you belong to only me.
