I've been through so many changes I don't know which way to go  
Yet I've got it so together I can see with my eyes open or with my eyes  
Closed  
Late at night I cry and wonder why my life's goin', goin' nowhere  
But during the day everything is okay, I'm having it my way, I say  
My teachers tell me that I am a lost soul, in a black hole  
But my mind, it tells me that I'm doing just fine  
Oh if everything is peachy, why can't anybody reach me  
I've always said I don't need anybody else  
Chorus:  
I'm so confused  
So confused  
And I'm destined to lose  
Unless I follow another way  
Spent all my time lookin' for something never knew what for  
Tried out all the options just to find that more pain and hurt was in store  
Been through it all, but the one thing that I still run from is you  
Still I remember 'bout all the things my momma said that you could do  
She said that if I only let you in my life  
You could take away the sorrow and the emptiness inside  
But to be true, the life I'm living, it's hard to let it go  
Though I've spent my whole life learning, there's so much that I don't know  
[Chorus: X2]  
I hear you calling, telling me to leave it all behind  
If I could only find the answers to the questions in my mind  
I wonder could it be my mind's not meant to understand  
Maybe I should go with my heart and put my life in your hands  
Surrender to you  
(chorus out)
