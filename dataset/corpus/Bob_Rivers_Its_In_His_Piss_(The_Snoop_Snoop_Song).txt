(It's In His Kiss, Shoop Shoop Song - Betty Everett)  
  
Is he drug-free?  
I wanna know  
How can I tell  
If he's strung out on dope?  
(Is it bloodshot eyes? )  
Oh no he's got Visine  
(Is he getting' high? )  
His urine won't be clean  
  
If you wanna know  
If he's smokin' dope  
It's in his piss  
(That's where it is)  
It's in his whiz  
(Check out his piss)  
Oh yeah  
  
Piss in  
This plastic cup  
We'll find out what we want to know  
If it's drugs like we think that it is  
It's there in his whiz  
  
(Oh is he smokin' crack)  
Oh my it's hard to say  
But it's certain that twitchin'  
All night and day  
  
If you want to know  
If it's in his nose  
It's in his piss  
(That's where it is)  
Oh yeah  
It's in his whiz  
(And if it is)  
He'll be dismissed  
(No slap on the wrist)  
Oh no  
Because of his piss  
(Pack up your shit)
