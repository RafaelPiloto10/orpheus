When I think of all the good times that I've wasted having good times  
When I think of all the good times that 's been wasted having good times  
  
When I was drinking  
I should've been thinking  
When I was fighting  
I could've done the right thing  
All of that boozing  
I was really losing  
Good times  
Good times  
  
When I think of all the good time that's been wasted having good times  
When I think of all the good time that we wasted having good times  
  
All of my lying  
I remember her crying  
All of the talking  
I could've been walking  
Instead of complaining  
I could've been gaining  
Good times  
  
Useless talking  
All that walking  
All of my sinning  
I could've been winning  
I have it too easy  
And its a beginning of a good time  
Good times  
  
When I was drinking  
I should've been thinking  
When I was fighting  
I could've done the right thing  
All of that boozing  
When I was really losing  
All of my sinning  
I could've been winning  
  
Oh yeah, I am ready for a good time  
  
Cheers!
