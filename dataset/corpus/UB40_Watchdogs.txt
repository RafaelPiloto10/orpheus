You try to close your ears  
And you try to close your eyes  
But the blasphemies keep coming  
Tempting you lies  
  
[Chorus]  
Give thanks for you protection  
Your watchdogs of the night  
Who hold the hungry wolves at bay  
And keep them out of sight, out of sight  
  
You just don't understand it  
But it strikes a distant chord  
So you look for away of escaping  
And sanity's restored  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give thanks for your protection  
Your  
  
  
You focus your direction  
Cloak tightly pulled around  
But somewhere in the distance  
You can hear a haunting sound  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give thanks for your protection  
Your  
  
You're in danger of corruption  
And you're always running scared  
You cannot make decisions  
You're completely unprepared  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give thanks for your protection  
Your
