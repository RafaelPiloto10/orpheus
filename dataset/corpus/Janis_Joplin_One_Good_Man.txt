Honey, I love to go to parties  
And I like to have a good time,  
But if it gets too pale after a while  
Honey and I start looking to find  
One good man.  
Hmm, don't you know I've been searching,  
Oh yes I have!  
One good man,  
Oh ain't much, honey ain't much,  
It's only everything, whoa.  
  
An' I don't want much outta life,  
I never wanted a mansion in the South.  
I just-a want to find someone sincere  
Who'd treat me like he talks,  
One good man.  
Oh honey don't you know that I've been looking.  
Oh, one good man  
Ain't much, honey it ain't much,  
Oh, it's only everything.  
All right.  
  
Some girls they want to collect their men,  
They wear 'em like notches on a gun.  
Oh honey, but I know better than that,  
I know that a woman only needs one.  
One good man, oh,  
Oh baby don't you know I've been looking, hmm.  
One good man,  
It ain't much, no, no honey it ain't much,  
Oh, it's only every little thing,  
Just-a everything, everything  
Ah yeah.
