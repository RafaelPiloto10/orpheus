Inside youre burnin I can see clear through  
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to  
Lit up and flashin like the reds and blues  
Out there on the neon avenue  
Well I, feel like a stranger (feel like a stranger)  
  
Well the musics thunderin, restless and hot  
You keep firin me glances across the room  
And I can't stop wonderin just what you got  
Get the feeling I'm going to find out real soon  
But I feel like a stranger (feel like a stranger)  
So lets get on with the show, lets go  
  
Yes, and the wheels its smokin round midnight  
You show me a look that says lets go  
Yes, and it feels about like running a red light  
Now there aint no point in looking behind us, no!  
Still I feel like a stranger (feel like a stranger)  
You know its gonna get stranger, lets get on with the show  
  
If this were love now how would I know? How would I know?  
Feel like a stranger  
Gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night  
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night
