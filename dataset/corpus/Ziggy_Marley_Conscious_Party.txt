Everyone is happy tonight  
But not because of the world  
And I know there'll be no fight  
In such a Conscious Party  
Everyone is happy tonight  
But not because of the world  
And I know there'll be no fight  
In such a Conscious Party  
No booze to lick our head  
Now we can't lose in life way  
No booze to lick our head  
Got to stay a light in darkness  
And everyone is happy tonight  
But not because of the world  
But not because of the world  
And I know there'll be no fight  
In such a Conscious Party  
Spirit of Jah passes through  
I can feel him, so can you! Yeah  
Makes one want to get up and dance  
I said we're jammin' on this love and chant  
Everyone is happy tonight  
But not because of the world  
But it's not because of the world  
And I know there'll be no fight  
In such a Conscious Party  
Everyone, and Jah-a-everyone  
I get smiles of Happiness  
Jahlification a dances  
Brothers loving their sisters  
Sisters loving their brothers  
Everyone is happy tonight  
But not because of the world  
And I know there'll be no fight  
In such a Conscious Party  
Everyone is happy tonight  
But not because of your world  
And how could there be any fight  
In such a Conscious Party  
Everyone is happy tonight  
But not because of the world  
And how could there be any fight  
In such a Conscious Party?  
No booze to lick our head  
Now we can't lose in life way  
No booze to lick our head  
Got to stay a light in darkness  
And everyone is happy tonight  
But not because of the world  
It's not because of the world  
And I know there'll be no fight  
In such a Conscious Party
