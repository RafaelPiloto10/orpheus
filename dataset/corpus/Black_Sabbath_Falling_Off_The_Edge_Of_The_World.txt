I think about closing the door  
And lately I think of it more  
I'm living well out of my time  
I feel like I'm losing my mind  
  
I should be at the table round  
A servant of the crown  
The keeper of the sign  
To sparkle and to shine  
  
Never, no never again!  
Listen to me and believe what I say if you can  
Never, this is the end  
You know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man  
Help me, tell me I'm sane  
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain  
Save me, take me away  
You know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!  
  
I've got to be strong  
Oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world  
Think you're safe, but you're wrong!  
We are falling off the edge of the world!  
  
Look out! there's danger! no where to run!  
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it has to be done  
Over, it's over at last  
There's a message inside as we build a new life from the past  
  
We're falling off the edge of the world!  
Yes, the edge of the world!  
It's the end of the world!
