[Originally by The Faces]  
  
In the mornin' don't say you love me,  
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door  
I know your name is Rita 'cause your perfume's smellin' sweeter  
Since when I saw you down on the floor.  
  
Won't need too much pursuadin'  
I don't mean to sound degradin',  
But with a face like that you got nothin' to laugh about.  
Red lips, hair and fingernails,  
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel  
Lets go up stairs and read my Tarot cards  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd better stay with me  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd better stay with me  
  
So, in the mornin', please don't say you love me  
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door  
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne,  
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd gonna stay with me  
Sit down, get up, get out.
