I used to be a booze hound  
Spent my time downtown  
  
Gettin' round  
Sittin' in the barroom  
Tryin' to get another drink  
"I think you've had enough"  
"come on, just one more"  
This time I ain't feelin' so fine  
What cha say we get to downin'  
Don't throw me just forget about the line  
I wish I could be drownin'  
Sweet water, I ain't seen her in a while  
I don't know if I can face her  
I know she can always make me smile  
If I can't outrun my chaser  
I used to be a booze hound  
  
Buzzin' round midtown  
Gettin' loaded  
Tryin' to get a number  
Feelin' mighty good  
  
"is this guy bothering you? "  
"no, no, I was just"  
All my life there ain't never been a drought  
That's probably been my downfall  
Even though, you know,  
I might be passed out  
I won't drop the high ball  
I know where the river flows  
And the lives that it devours  
Ain't it great I can touch my nose  
But I can't smell the flowers  
I used to be a booze hound  
  
Stumblin' uptown  
Gettin' higher  
Fallin' off the bar stool  
Rememberin' where I left the floor  
"say buddy, you need some help"  
"no, I'm cool"  
  
Come and get me you can be my boogey man  
You can catch me on the rebound  
You may not fly like the candy man can  
But it's safer on the ground  
Just one more trip to the fun house  
They'll smother me with foam  
See, my brother, that's the one house  
That I can call my home
