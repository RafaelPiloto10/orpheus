Yeah  
Wasted  
Party  
Burr  
  
Double deuces on the back  
21's on the front  
Got the engine in the back  
And the trunk is in the front  
In the back of the club now smokin' on a blunt  
Club packed took a pass of G and parked right in the front  
From the front to the back like a zoo party animal  
Want to ball with me baby what it do, party animal  
Shes a man-eater baby, that's the kind of party animal  
I'mma party animal, shes a party animal  
  
I'm a party animal, used to be a trafficker  
Bricks up on the bus call me the roll manager  
200,000 cash I might put that in the challenger  
To only ride on more man cause that's my eat Atlanta car  
See first I brought you juiceman, then I brought you flock flame  
Gucci mane the bossman but you can call me iceman
