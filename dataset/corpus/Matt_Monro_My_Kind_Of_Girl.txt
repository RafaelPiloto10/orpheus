She walks like an angel walks  
She talks like an angel talks  
And her hair has a kind of curl  
To my mind, she's my kind of girl  
  
She's wise like an angel's wise  
With eyes like an angel's eyes  
And a smile kind of like a pearl  
To my mind, she's my kind of girl  
  
Pretty little face  
That face just knocks me off my feet  
Pretty little feet  
She's really sweet enough to eat  
  
She looks like an angel looks  
She cooks like an angel cooks  
And my mind's in a kind of whirl  
To my mind, she's my kind of girl  
  
Pretty little face  
That face just knocks me off of my feet  
Pretty little feet  
She's really sweet enough to eat  
  
She looks like an angel looks  
She even cooks like an angel cooks  
And my mind's in a kind of whirl  
To my mind, she's my kind of girl  
  
And my heart's kind of full of joy  
'Cause she told me, I'm her kind of boy
