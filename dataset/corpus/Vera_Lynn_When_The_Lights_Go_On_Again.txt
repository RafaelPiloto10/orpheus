When the lights go on again all over the world  
And the boys are home again all over the world  
And rain or snow is all that may fall from the skies above  
A kiss won't mean "goodbye" but "hello to love"  
  
When the lights go on again all over the world  
And the ships will sail again all over the world  
Then we'll have time for things like wedding rings and free hearts will sing  
When the lights go on again all over the world  
  
When the lights go on again all over the world  
And the ships will sail again all over the world  
Then we'll have time for things like wedding rings and free hearts will sing  
When the lights go on again all over the world
