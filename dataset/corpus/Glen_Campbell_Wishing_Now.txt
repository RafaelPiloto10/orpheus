Just another day  
And I think I'll die before it ends  
It's just another day  
And I sure like to go see my baby again  
  
Time was when I did not know  
What they meant when they said a man was blue  
But now I know because of you  
What I know because of you  
  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again  
Right now, right now  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again  
Somehow, somehow  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' now  
  
Just another day  
There ain't nothin' going down  
Nothin' going down I already know  
'Cause I already called around  
  
I am worse, when I did not know  
Just what they meant when they said a day went wrong  
But now I know it's been too long  
Since I knew it had been too long  
  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again  
Right now, right now  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again  
Somehow, somehow  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' now
