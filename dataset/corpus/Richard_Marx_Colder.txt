This is what I should have said  
If I'd've been a man about it  
You might be in my arms by now  
Nothing ventured, nothing gained  
As I contemplate the losing  
The silence is up way too loud  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't sleep anymore  
The words I never said keep turning over  
I can't dream like before  
And all I seem to be getting is colder  
  
Just like the t-shirt that you wore  
You were divine and full of madness  
Not really like anyone  
In words too beautiful for words  
  
I constructed a soliloquy  
That never seemed to reach my tongue  
Yeah the air never even filled my lungs  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All I can think of is  
My name on your lips  
  
I can't sleep anymore  
The words I never said keep turning over  
I can't dream like before  
And all I seem to be getting is  
All I seem to be getting is colder  
Colder
