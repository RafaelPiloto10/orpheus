Some boys kiss me  
Some boys hug me  
I think they're ok  
If they don't give me proper credit  
I just walk away  
  
They can beg and they can plead  
But they can't see the light (that's right)  
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash  
Is always Mister Right  
  
'Cause we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Some boys romance  
Some boys slow dance  
That's all right with me  
If they can't raise my interest then I  
Have to let them be  
  
Some boys try and some boys lie but  
I don't let them play (no way)  
Only boys who save their pennies  
Make my rainy day  
  
'Cause we're living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
Living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
  
Boys may come and boys may go  
And that's all right you see  
Experience has made me rich  
And now they're after me  
  
'Cause everybody's living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
Living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
A material, a material, a material, a material world  
  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world
