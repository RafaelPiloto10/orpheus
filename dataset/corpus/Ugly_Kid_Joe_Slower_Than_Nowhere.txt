Slower than nowhere  
Playing Hide and Seek  
Walking from room to room  
Will you follow me  
  
Will you challenge me  
My destiny will follow me  
And set me free  
And set me free  
  
Slower than nowhere  
Cold in the mid-west  
Don't take away my shine  
Asking me something  
  
Giving me nothing  
That's okay, take your time  
Prelude to madness  
Certain circles hold  
  
Fall to the west side, I'll take my own  
Come on now, come on now  
Down to my luck and  
Speaking of nothing  
  
Feeling the ground move under me  
Do you feel the same  
Do you feel the same  
Slower than nowhere  
  
I feel the ground move under me  
Slower than nowhere  
Prelude to madness  
Certain circles hold  
  
Fall to the wayside, I'll take my own  
Come on now
