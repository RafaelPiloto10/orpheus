I've slept under the sun  
And I've tasted the rain, cold rain  
I've loved more than once  
And I've stared down the face of pain  
But look at me, I'm still standing here today  
  
I'm alive, yeah, I'm alive  
I'd rather walk this winding road  
And let love take a leap of faith than be alone  
Yeah, I'm alive, life is stronger  
And more powerful and beautiful than ever  
  
Yesterday, I was a fool  
But in our yesterdays we are all fools  
Watched the news in disbelief  
And prayed for love to bring relief  
Giving up is always easier  
Than standing up to fight but baby  
  
I'm alive, yeah, I'm alive  
I'd rather walk this winding road  
And let love take a leap of faith than be alone  
Yeah, I'm alive, life is stronger  
And more powerful and beautiful than ever  
  
Everybody gets scared a little, everybody gets tired a little  
Everybody feels low, everybody feels high  
When life is a journey, take a deep breath  
And enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride all on borrowed time  
  
I'm alive, look around, baby  
I'd rather take a leap of faith than be alone  
Yeah, I'm alive, life is stronger  
And more powerful, beautiful than ever  
  
I'm alive, yeah, I'm alive  
I'd rather walk this winding road  
And let love take a leap of faith than be alone  
Yeah, I'm alive, life is stronger  
And more powerful and beautiful than ever  
  
I'm alive, yeah, I'm alive  
I'd rather walk this winding road  
And let love take a leap of faith than be alone  
Yeah, I'm alive, life is stronger  
And more powerful and beautiful than ever
