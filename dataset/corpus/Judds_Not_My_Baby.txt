There are guys who will lie  
Then they'll hang you out to dry  
But not my baby  
Promise you everything  
Then they never buy the ring  
But not my baby  
Say they're out with their pals  
When they're seein' other gals  
But not my baby  
  
And they think it's a crime  
When they have to spend a dime  
But not my baby  
Bring you gifts now and then  
Always from the five and ten  
But not my baby  
And I've heard stories of  
Guys afraid to fall in love  
But not my baby  
  
I don't have to dream  
My dream baby  
He's the sweetest dream  
That's already come true  
And every time we touch, just touch  
I can feel how very much  
How much he loves me  
Not my baby  
No, not my baby  
  
There are guys that I've seen  
Who are wrong or being mean  
But not my baby  
Getting mad, getting cross  
If you don't let them be boss  
But not my baby  
  
Yes, I've sure got a lot  
And the best thing that I've got  
I've got my baby  
And I know he will stay  
He will never go away  
No, not my baby  
No, not my baby  
No, not my baby  
No, not my baby
