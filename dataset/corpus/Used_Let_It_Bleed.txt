This poison's my intoxication  
I broke a needle off in my skin  
Pick the scabs and pick the bleeding  
And assume that it was all in vein  
Popping a scab that's never healing  
It just hit me in the face  
Burning bridges, So misleading  
The poison's more important now with the pain  
  
Let it bleed  
Take the red for what it's worth whoa  
Watch the fire  
Fill your lungs with smoke for the last time  
If you feel like dying you might want to sing  
  
The fire department couldn't drown the city  
They didn't even try to wash it clean  
And what did you think that I was sober?  
For me yea cause I'm on fucking fire  
Popping a scab that's never healing  
I'm proud that I kept this clean  
The most that I can do for you is keep on lying  
I'm tired of lying I think I'd rather sin  
  
Let it bleed  
  
Take the red for what it's worth woah  
Watch the fire  
Fill your lungs with smoke for the last time  
If you feel like dying you might want to sing!  
  
Oh oh you might want to sing  
Aha ha you might want to sing  
Ha ha you might want to sing  
Ha ha ha ha sing!  
You might want to sing!  
You might want to sing!  
You might want to sing or scream at  
  
This poison's my intoxication  
I broke a needle off in my skin  
Pick the scabs and pick the bleeding  
And yeah, assume that it was all in vein  
  
Let it bleed  
Take the red for what it's worth, whoa  
Watch the fire  
I'ma fill your lungs with smoke for the last time  
If you feel like dying  
If you feel like dying  
If you feel like dying, You might want to sing  
Ha ha ha You might want to sing  
Ha ha You might want to sing
