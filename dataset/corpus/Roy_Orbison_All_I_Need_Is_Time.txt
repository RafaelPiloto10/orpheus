All I need is time, then I'll get over you  
A little at a time, a bit each day  
All I need is time to mend a dream or two  
Then I'll forget the love you took away  
  
Morning's here again, just like the day before  
But the only change is that I love you more  
All I need is time, maybe a thousand years  
Maybe a million tears, but I need time  
  
Everybody says the pain won't last too long  
Have a lot of fun and time will fly  
It took a lot of time till love was born in me  
And it'll take some time for love to die  
  
Each and every day I spend forgetting you  
Brings another night I never quite get through  
All I need is time, maybe a thousand years  
Maybe a million tears, but I need time
