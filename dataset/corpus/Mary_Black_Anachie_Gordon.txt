Harking is bonnie  
And there lives my love  
My heart lies on him  
And will not remove  
It will not remove  
Oh for all that I have done  
Oh I never will forget my love anachie  
For anachie gordon  
He's bonnie and he's rough  
He'd entice any woman that ever he saw  
He'd entice any woman and so he has done me  
Oh I never will forget my love anachie  
Down came her father and he's standing by the door  
Saying jeannie you're trying the tricks of a whore  
You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee  
You must marry lord sulton and leave anachie  
For anachie gorden, he's barely but a man  
Although he may be pretty but where are his lands?  
Oh the sulton's lands are broad and his towers they run high  
You must marry lord sulton and leave anachie  
With anachie gordon I'd beg for my bread  
And before I'll marry sulton it's gold to my head  
With gold to my head and gowns fringed to the knee  
And I'll die if I don't get me love anachie  
And you that are my parents to church you may me bring  
But unto lord sulton I'll never bear a song  
To a son or a daughter, I'll never bow my knee  
And I'll die if I don't get me love anachie  
Jeannie was married and from church she was brought home  
And when she and her maidens so merry should have been  
When she and her maidens so merry should have been  
She went into her chambers she cried all alone  
Come to bed now jeannie me honey and my sweet  
For to style you my mistress it would be so sweet  
Be it mistress or jeannie it's all the same to me  
But in your bed lord sulton I never will lie  
And down came her father and he's spoken with reknown  
Saying you that are her maidens go loosen off her gowns  
But she fell down to the floor so close down by his knee  
Saying father look I'm dying for me love anachie  
The day that jeannie married was the day that jeannie died  
And the day that yound anachie came home on the tide  
And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands  
Saying oh it's been so long you've spent so long on the sands  
Oh so long on the sands, so long on the flood  
They have married your jeannie and now she lies dead  
You that are her maidens go take me by the hand  
And take me to the chamber that me love she lies in  
And he's kissed her cold lips till his heart has turned to stone  
And he's died in the chamber that his love she lies in
