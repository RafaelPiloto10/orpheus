Can't you see  
What love and romance have done to me  
I'm not the same as I used to be  
This is my last affair  
  
Tragedy just seems to be the end of me  
My happiness is misery  
This is my last affair  
  
Right from the start  
You took my love  
Tore my heart apart  
Now there's nothing new to look forward to  
My dreams won't come true  
  
So I'll make a vow, make a vow  
No more to love's line will I bow  
I cross my heart and feel it now  
This is my last affair
