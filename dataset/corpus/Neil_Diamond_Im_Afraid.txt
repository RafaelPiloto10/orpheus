I'm afraid, so afraid  
That you'll go  
And I'll know  
It's the end  
The end of all the love I ever knew  
And the kisses tender as  
The morning dew  
  
I'm afraid  
So afraid  
Destiny did foresee lonely days  
I'll never understand  
The reason why  
Why a love as warm as ours  
Should ever die  
  
All I want is you  
Standing close to me  
You can make me walk the line  
If you love me to  
Listen to my plea  
Darlin' won't you say that you're mine  
  
I'm afraid, so afraid  
That you'll leave me to grieve  
Every night  
And every tear will tell  
The price I paid  
I played the game of love  
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid  
So afraid  
So afraid
