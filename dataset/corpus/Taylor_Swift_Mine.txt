Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables  
Left a small town, never looked back  
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'  
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts  
  
I say, "can you believe it?"  
As we're lyin' on the couch  
The moment, I can see it  
Yes, yes, I can see it now  
  
Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?  
You put your arm around me for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together  
And there's a drawer of my things at your place  
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded  
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  
  
And we got bills to pay  
We got nothin' figured out  
When it was hard to take  
Yes, yes  
This is what I thought about  
  
Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?  
You put your arm around me, for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?  
You saw me start to believe, for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.  
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands  
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street  
  
Braced myself for the goodbye,  
'Cause that's all I've ever known  
Then, you took me by surprise  
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"  
  
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.  
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.  
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.  
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."  
  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Do you believe it?  
We're gonna make it now  
And I can see it  
  
(I can see it now)
