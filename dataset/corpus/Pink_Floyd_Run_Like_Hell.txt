Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.  
You better make your face up in  
Your favorite disguise.  
With your button down lips and your  
Roller blind eyes.  
With your empty smile  
And your hungry heart.  
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past.  
With your nerves in tatters  
When the conch shell shatters  
And the hammers batter  
Down your door.  
You'd better run.  
  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.  
You better run all day  
And run all night.  
Keep your dirty feelings  
Deep inside.  
And if you're taking your girlfriend  
Out tonight  
You'd better park the car  
Well out of sight.  
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat  
Trying to pick her locks,  
They're gonna send you back to mother  
In a cardboard box.  
You better run.  
  
"Hey, open up!"  
"Hammer, hammer"
