In summertime I have no fury  
No chance of sinking sailing ships  
If time stood still  
I'd take aim and fire for you  
  
For every ocean there must be shore  
On which I'll stand with restless toes  
When everything I look for in myself  
Is in you  
  
I feel a little more than empty  
But I want to feel more than full  
  
It's a pity all I have  
Is just enough to keep you satisfied  
This knot could come undone  
No matter how we try to keep it tied  
  
Inside this bottle there's a message  
You may be drinking way too much  
If I had the strength to take the weight off you  
I would  
  
I feel a little more than empty  
But I want to feel more than full  
  
It's a pity all I have  
Is just enough to keep you satisfied  
This knot could come undone  
No matter how we try to keep it tied  
  
Something higher keeps me here  
Something that keeps us together  
You keep me dry despite the weather  
I don't mean to feel this way for you  
But I do and I feel satisfied  
  
It's a pity all I have  
Is just enough to keep you satisfied  
This knot could come undone  
No matter how we try to keep it tied  
  
It's a pity all I have  
Is just enough to keep you satisfied  
This knot could come undone  
No matter how we try to keep it tied  
  
It's a pity all I have  
Is just enough to keep you satisfied  
This knot could come undone  
No matter how we try to keep it tied
