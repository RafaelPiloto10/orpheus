Your face is beaming, you say cause it's you're dreaming of  
How good it's going to be  
You say you've been around and now you've finally found  
Everything you wanted and needed in me  
  
Chorus:  
I don't have the heart to hurt you  
It's the last thing I wanna to do  
But I don't have the heart to love you  
Not the way you want me to  
  
Inside I'm dying, to see you cryin'  
How can I make you understand  
I care about you, so much about you  
Baby I'm trying to say this as gently as I can 'cause  
  
Chorus:  
I don't have the heart to hurt you  
It's the last thing I wanna to do  
But I don't have the heart to love you  
Not the way you want me to  
  
You're so trusting, and open  
Hoping that love will start  
But I don't have the heart  
Oh no, I don't have the heart  
  
Chorus:  
I don't have the heart to hurt you  
It's the last thing I wanna to do  
But I don't have the heart to love you  
Not the way you want me to  
  
I don't have the heart  
Baby, I don't have the heart  
Baby, I don't have the heart
