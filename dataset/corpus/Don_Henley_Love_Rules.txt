Every day you pass her in the hall  
You just pretend that you don't see her at all  
You want to tell her how much you care  
You want to call her but you just don't dare  
Love rules  
Love rules  
  
Out in the parking lot with all the guys  
Don't ever let them see the tears in your eyes  
She's got a date tonight and it ain't you  
So you go out there and you get one too  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Love rules  
  
You wish you didn't have so much to feel  
It's much too scary and it's all too real  
All your friends are out having fun  
Sometimes you think that you're the only one that  
Love rules  
Oh, love rules  
  
While everybody's out making time  
You can't help thinking you're the last in line  
She's the finest thing you've ever seen  
You wrap your arms around her in your dreams  
When she smiles it brings you to your knees  
You want to tell her but you always freeze  
She's in the backseat but you're much too shy  
You'd give the world to be an older guy  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Yeah, love still rules  
Love rules  
Love rules...
