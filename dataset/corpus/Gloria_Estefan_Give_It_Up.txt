There's no wrong and no right  
In the heat of the night you stop thinking  
You don't care anymore  
Throw all doubt out the door  
And you let go  
  
You may try to fight back by ignoring the fact  
That you want it  
But it's harder each day  
No more games you can play to avoid it  
  
You may think you're cool and collected  
Obeying all the rules  
  
But when someone's blinding your senses  
You give it up and fall in love  
  
Feel your heart beating fast  
Want this moment to last you forever  
Feel your throat getting dry  
When you find that it's now or it's never  
Since you're feeling confused  
You no longer can choose and you weaken  
Then you finally give in to this urge from within  
And it happens  
  
You may think you're cool and collected  
Obeying all the rules  
But when someone's driving you crazy  
You give it up and fall in love  
Fall in love  
  
You're gonna fall in love  
  
Fall in love
