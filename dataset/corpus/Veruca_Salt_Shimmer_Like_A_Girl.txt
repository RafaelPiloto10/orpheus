It's a shame you have a mind of your own now.  
Shame on you, completely setting the tone now.  
I've caught you bleeding under my skin now.  
I fought you, but you're beginning to win now.  
Well I don't care, I swear it's my turn now.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should,  
You gotta get it glimmer, shimmer, sparkle while you can.  
Shame crashing, falling off of the tracks now.  
Get cracking at the small of my back now.  
I failed you and they're beginning to talk now.  
I nailed you until you're walking the walk now.  
Well I don't care, I swear it's my turn now.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should,  
You gotta get it glimmer, shimmer, sparkle while you can.  
Yeaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

Yeah, shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.
