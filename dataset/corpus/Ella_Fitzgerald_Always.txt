I'll be loving you always  
With a love that's true always.  
When the things you've planned  
Need a helping hand,  
I will understand always.  
  
Always.  
  
Days may not be fair always,  
That's when I'll be there always.  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year,  
But always.  
  
I'll be loving you, oh always  
With a love that's true always.  
When the things you've planned  
Need a helping hand,  
I will understand always.  
  
Always.  
  
Days may not be fair always,  
That's when I'll be there always.  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year,  
But always.  
  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year,  
But always.
