Living on free food tickets  
Watering the milk from the hole in the roof  
Where the rain came through  
What can we do?  
Tears from your baby sister crying  
'Cause she doesn't have a dress  
Without a patch for the party to go  
Ah, but you know she'll get by  
Because she's living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of a family man  
Daddy's goin' to buy you a dream to cling to  
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can  
And she can  
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare  
It would fall through the hole in your pocket  
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground  
Walkin' to town to find a job  
Tryin' to keep your hands warm  
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through  
And it chills to the bone  
Boy, you better go home where it's warm  
And you can live in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of a family man  
Daddy's goin' to buy you a dream to cling to  
Mummy's goin' to love you just as much as she can  
And she can  
Livin' on dreams ain't easy  
But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit  
And the chills stay away  
You take them in stride, family pride  
You know faith is your foundation  
With a whole lot of love and a warm conversation  
And many a prayer  
Making you strong, where you belong  
Living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of a family man  
Daddy's goin' to buy you a dream to cling to  
Mummy's goin' to love you just as much as she can  
Yeah  
Living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of a family man  
Daddy's goin' to buy you a dream to cling to  
Mummy's goin' to love you just as much as she can  
Yeah
