You took a mystery and made me want it  
You got a pedestal and put me on it  
You made me love you out of feeling nothing  
Something that you do  
And I was there and not dancing with anyone  
You took a little, then you took me over  
You set your mark on stealing my heart away  
Crying, trying, anything for you  
  
I'm in the middle of a chain reaction  
You give me all the after midnight action  
I want to get you where I can let you make all that love to me  
I'm on a journey for the inspiration  
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation  
I need you to get me nearer to you  
So you can set me free  
We talk about love, love, love  
We talk about love  
We talk about love, love, love  
We talk about love  
  
You make me tremble when your hand moves lower  
You taste a little then you swallow slower  
Nature has a way of yielding treasure  
Pleasure made for you, oh  
You gotta plan, your future is on the run  
Shine a light for the whole world over  
You never find your love if you hide away  
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is  
  
Get in the middle of a chain reaction  
You get a medal when you're lost in action  
I want to get your love all ready for the sweet sensation  
Instant radiation  
You let me hold you for the first explosion  
We get a picture of our love in motion  
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you  
With no more left to say  
We talk about love, love, love  
We talk about love  
You let me hold you for the first explosion  
My arms will cover you  
  
All you gotta do is get in the middle of a chain reaction  
You get a medal when you're lost in action  
Don't pass me by  
I want to get your love all ready for the chain reaction
