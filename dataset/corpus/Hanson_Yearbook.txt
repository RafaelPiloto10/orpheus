Dear Amy, see you in September  
Hope that you remember me next year  
Hey Jamie, you've been a great friend to me  
I hope that I'll still see you around here  
  
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook  
Then I find that empty space  
There's a name without a picture  
But I can't forget his face  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me, where did he go?  
I want to know  
Where did Johnny go?  
It says "picture unavailable" right here  
More than sad  
It makes me mad to know somebody knows  
There's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?  
  
Poor Katie, she won't even speak his name  
None of us will ever be the same  
It's quiet in the halls  
But I hear echoing off the walls  
The rumors of Johnny's mystery  
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook  
Then I find that empty space  
No, he never wrote me nothing  
But I can't forget his face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, there's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?  
Oh, there's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?  
  
Sometimes I think I hear him calling out my name  
Sometimes I wonder if maybe we're to blame  
It's been a year now and a lot of things have changed  
But I keep thinking about Johnny  
I keep turning to that page  
  
Where did he go?  
I want to know  
Where did he go?  
I want to know  
  
Oh, there's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?  
Oh, there's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?
