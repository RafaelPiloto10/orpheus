Way back, take a look, she would cook  
When they were stompin' at the Savoy  
She would blow, and they would dance, don't you know ?  
It was an uptown kind a show  
  
Cool notes and melodies, harmonies  
She sang the song of the universe  
She can make a joyful noise up to heaven  
And call the angels down to the earth  
  
From jazz, to swing, to be-bop  
She kept the spirit alive  
For Bo, Duke, Dizzy, and Miles  
She spoke her mind  
She's Ellamental to the art  
She spoke her mind  
She's Ellamental to the art  
  
Too hot, until the dawn she sang on  
When joints were jumpin' and jive was in  
Bodies movin' back and forth to the rhythm  
Ever since Ella first did her thing  
  
From jazz, to swing to be-bop  
She brought emotions and moves  
She kept the spirit alive.  
She spoke her mind  
  
Act like ya know, Oh!  
Was it the smooth tones that was so much like butter  
Oh Ella was singin' just like no other singer  
Cause you know I be the funky bringer of the new style  
because I be the wild child.  
Listenin' to hip-hop, listening to be-bop and jazz  
Ella made you move that ass  
Sensation for the people, insperation for the sisters and brothers  
Smooth jazz for the midnight lovers  
Savoy was the spot for shakin' on your rump and  
Ella made it hoppin'  
Got the joint jumpin', remembering you 'til the dawn  
Because Ella your memory goes on  
  
She spoke her mind (yeah...and it just don't stop)  
She's Ellamental to the art (the memory goes on and on...'cause it just don't
stop)  
She spoke her mind (...yeah..jazz to the bebop)  
She's Ellamental to the art  
She spoke her mind..(yeah...much love...)  
She spoke her mind...
