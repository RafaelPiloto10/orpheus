Hey man I noticed you were  
You were crying  
Ohh shame on you would leave it inside  
Mind open your mind you say "no, well no, will I"  
Hey cause yourself all alone  
You will lie down  
Oh, put yourself away from all your love  
And you will soon lie down  
Said I can leave it way open eyes  
I go to you see me whine  
See me lie here  
Oh, call see me whine call you way down  
The pain has been riddling me oh will I, yeah  
Open, I will  
I will leave it to destiny to choose which way I go to  
I will leave destiny  
To choose which direction it is that I'm gong to  
My face open eye you leave I mean I  
And I will  
And we will leave most men, most men lie  
I fear that we will go away most men, most men  
Leave us crying
