There was a man named mahatma Gandhi  
He would not bow down, he would not fight  
He knew the deal was down and dirty  
And nothing wrong could make it right away  
But he knew his duty, and the price he had to pay  
Just another holy man who tried to make a stand  
My god, they killed him !  
Another man from atlanta, georgia  
By the name of martin luther king  
He shook the land like rolling thunder  
And made the bells of freedom ring today  
With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away  
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend  
My god, they killed him !  
The only son of God almighty  
The holy one called jesus christ  
Healed the lame and fed the hungry  
And for his love they took his life away  
On the road to glory where the story never ends  
Just the holy son of man we'll never understand  
My god, they killed him !  
Sing about mahatma Gandhi  
Sing of martin luther king  
Sing of jesus christ almighty  
And the brothers kennedy
