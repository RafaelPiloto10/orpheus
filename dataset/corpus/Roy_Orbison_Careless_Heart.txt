I had somebody,somebody who loved me.  
Someone so good to me.  
You were my angel, you were my heaven  
But i was too blind to see.  
  
I let you slip away, i guess i never knew.  
I had the world with you .  
I'd be there, still be there in your arms.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be loving me.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be mine.  
I wouldn't have this hurt inside.  
I wouldn't have this tears to cry.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
  
I had my chances,i took advantage.  
I took it all too far.  
So now you're gone, and i'm all alone,  
Alone with my lonely heart.  
I let it fall apart,i didn't care enough.  
I lost your precious love.  
You'd be here,still be here in my arms.  
  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be loving me.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be mine.  
I wouldn't have this hurt inside.  
I wouldn't have this tears to cry.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You's still be mine.  
  
I'd be loving you, i'd be holding you,  
I'd be loving you.  
If not for my careless heart.  
I wouldn't have this hurt inside.  
I wouldn't have this tears to cry.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be loving me.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be mine.  
I wouldn't have this hurt inside.  
I wouldn't have this tears to cry.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
If not for my careless heart.  
You'd still be loving me.  
You'd be loving me.  
You'd still be mine.
