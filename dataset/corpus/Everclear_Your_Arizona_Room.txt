Just another night in a bar somewhere  
Just another blonde girl  
Such a pretty blonde girl  
I saw a light behind those cold dark eyes that you show to a cold dark world  
Then something came over me  
When I touched your face  
It took me to a place that I've been afraid to go  
Everytime we talk I find another piece of the puzzle of me  
That I never really got to know  
Sometimes it is so easy to believe that a broken thing can never be whole  
Just another night in a hotel room  
Just another bad dream  
Can you believe? I had another bad dream  
We were high on a hill above a big black cloud that turned into a swarm of
bees  
Then something came over me  
Then you held my hand and they faded into summertime when you smiled at me  
Every time we talk, I find another piece of the puzzle of me  
That I never really got to know  
Sometimes it is so easy to believe that a broken heart can never be whole  
Give your heart to me, I will give my heart to you  
If you believe in me, I'll do anything you want me to do  
We can stay in bed until the sun turns into the moon  
I will hold you and smile safe in your Arizona room  
Inside your Arizona room  
There is nothing I'd rather do than be alone with you inside your Arizona room  
There is nothing I'd rather do than waste away the day inside your Arizona
room  
There is nothing I'd rather do  
There is nothing I'd rather do than spend the day alone with you  
If you give your heart to me, I will give my heart to you  
If you believe in me, I'll do anything you want me to do  
We can stay in bed until the sun turns into the moon  
I will hold you and smile safe in your Arizona room  
Inside your arizona room  
There is nothing I'd rather do  
Inside your arizona room  
There is nothing I'd rather do  
We can waste away the day  
We can waste away the day  
Inside your arizona room  
There is nothing I'd rather do  
There is nothing I'd rather do than spend the day alone with you
