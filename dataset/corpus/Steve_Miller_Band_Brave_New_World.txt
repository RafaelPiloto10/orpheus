We're driving fast  
From a dream of the past  
To the brave new world  
Where nothing will last  
That comes from the past  
It's a brave new world  
Put a smile on your face  
As we walk with space  
In the brave new world  
Now, as you begin  
You're born once again  
With the rising sun  
Something new, nothing old  
Something true, something gold  
No spirit of the past  
Can hold you back  
From the brave new world  
The direction to start  
Is inside your heart  
To the brave new world  
If you're free in your heart  
You can make a new start  
It's a brave new world  
There's nothing to hide  
Leave your troubles behind  
It's a brave new world  
I told you, my friend  
And I'll tell you again  
Your trip has begun  
Something new, nothing old  
Something true, something gold  
The direction to start  
Is inside your heart  
To the brave new world
