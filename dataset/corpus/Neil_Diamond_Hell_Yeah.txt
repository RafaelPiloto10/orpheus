If you're thinking that my life  
Is a hoot and a holler  
From the start of the day  
To the dark of the night  
And that its ringin' like a bell  
That you only want to follow  
Gotta trust me when I say  
I'm just trying to get it right  
  
Still I think about myself  
As a lucky old dreamer  
If you're askin' me to tell  
Is it worth what I paid  
You gonna hear me say  
  
Hell yeah it is  
And I say it loud  
I loved it all  
And I'm not too proud  
I freed my soul...just let it fly  
Hell yeah this crazy life around me  
It confuses and confounds me  
But it's all the life I've got until I die  
Hell yeah it is  
  
If you're asking for my time  
Isn't much left to give you  
Been around a good long while  
So I gotta say it fast  
Time is all we'll ever need  
But it's gotta have a meaning  
You be careful how it's spent  
'Cause it isn't going to last  
  
I hear you wondering out loud  
Are you ever gonna make it?  
Will you ever work it out?  
Will you ever take a chance  
And just believe you can?  
  
Hell yeah you will  
You're gonna be okay  
And you might get lost  
But then you'll find a way  
Don't go alone  
Can't be afraid  
Hell yeah  
This life is here and it's made for livin'  
And love's a gift that's made for givin'  
You give it all away and have it still  
And Hell yeah you will  
  
I've been living in a bowl  
With a lot of people staring  
With my feet on shaky ground  
And my head up in the sky  
But it's where I want to be  
It's a life that's made for caring  
Got a song to pass the day  
And a girl to share the night  
  
So if they ask you when I'm gone  
Was it everything he wanted?  
When he had to travel on  
Did he know he'd be missed?  
You can tell them this  
  
Hell yeah he did!  
He saw it all  
He walked the line  
Never had to crawl  
He cried a bit  
But not for long  
Hell yeah  
He found the life that he was after  
Filled it up with love and laughter  
Finally got it right  
And made it fit  
Hell yeah he did!  
Hell yeah he did!  
Hell yeah he did!
