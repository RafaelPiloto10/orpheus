My hands were made to worship you my  
heart my king it beats for you  
  
(Pre chorus)  
O lamb so true I surrender to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
my life  
(I give you)  
my love  
(I give you)  
my all  
  
(Verse two)  
your touch your kiss your grace to me is deeper  
than my soul can see my purpose it changed  
When I called out your name  
  
(Pre chorus)  
my life  
(I give you)  
my love  
(I give you)  
my all  
  
[Bridge:]  
my past has been erased with just one touch from  
you my clouds my rain my faith has changed your blood  
has made me new o lamb so true I surrender to  
  
[Chorus:]  
my life  
(I give you)  
my love  
(I give you)  
my all
