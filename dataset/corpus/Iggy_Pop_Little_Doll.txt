Little doll I can't forget  
Smoking on a cigarette  
In my life a real queen  
Prettiest thing I ever seen  
Uh-huh  
You're the one who makes me sing  
Bring happiness and everything  
You're the only real one  
A real way to have some fun  
Uh- huh  
But I don't know you little doll  
I don't know you little doll  
Come on shake  
Come on shake  
Come on shake you little doll  
Shake you little doll  
Come on.... Shake  
Come on shake  
Shake you little doll
