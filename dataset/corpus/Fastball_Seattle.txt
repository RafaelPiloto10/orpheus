Ridin' round and round  
In my car I can't afford to go very far  
It needs a new transmission and new brakes  
  
Parking tickets  
I cannot pay  
They're gonna have to tow me away  
Tow me away  
'Cause I can't afford to drive  
  
We're outta groceries again  
Ain't got no money to spend  
The credit card is maxed out  
So let's get high  
'Cause it's raining all the time  
And the rain's been seeping through my mind  
But I get by  
  
I've got a nasty rash on my rocker  
I can't afford to go see the doctor  
I know I'll be all right in a couple of weeks  
  
Happy hour,  
That's where we're meeting  
Eat for free as long as you're drinking  
Hey that ain't no problem  
For you and me  
  
We're outta groceries again  
Ain't got no money to spend  
The credit card is maxed out  
So let's get high  
'Cause it's raining all the time  
And the rain's been seeping through my mind  
But I get by  
  
We're outta groceries again  
Ain't got no money to spend  
The credit card is maxed out  
So let's get high  
'Cause it's raining all the time  
And the rain's been seeping through my mind  
But I get by  
  
Yeah I'm all right It's all right
