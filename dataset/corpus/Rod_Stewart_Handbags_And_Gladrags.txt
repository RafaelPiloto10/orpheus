Ever seen a blind man cross the road  
Trying to make the other side  
Ever seen a young girl growing old  
Trying to make herself a bride  
  
So what becomes of you my love  
When they have finally stripped you of  
The handbags and the gladrags  
That your Granddad had to sweat so you could buy  
Baby  
  
Once I was a young man  
And all I thought I had to do was smile  
You are still a young girl  
And you bought everything in style  
  
Listen  
But once you think you're in you're out  
'Cause you don't mean a single thing without  
The handbags and the gladrags  
That your Granddad had to sweat so you could buy  
  
Sing a song of six-pence for your sake  
And take a bottle full of rye  
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake  
And bake them all in a pie  
  
They told me you missed school today  
So what I suggest you just throw them all away  
The handbags and the gladrags  
That your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy  
  
They told me you missed school today  
So I suggest you just throw them all away  
The handbags and the gladrags  
That your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy ya
