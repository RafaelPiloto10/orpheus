So much to do, there's plenty on the farm  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
Saturday night I like to raise a little harm  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
  
I'm drinking heartbreak motor oil and Bombay gin  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
Straight from the bottle, twisted again  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
  
Well, I take this medicine as prescribed  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
It don't matter if I get a little tired  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
  
I've got a .38 special up on the shelf  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
If I start acting stupid  
I'll shoot myself  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
  
So much to do, there's plenty on the farm  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
Saturday night I like to raise a little harm  
I'll sleep when I'm dead
