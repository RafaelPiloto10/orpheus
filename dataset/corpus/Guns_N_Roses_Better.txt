No one ever told me when I was alone  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
  
No one ever told me when I was alone  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
  
The hardest part this troubled heart has never  
Yet been through now.  
We've healed the scars that got their start  
Inside someone like you now.  
  
Well had I known or I'd been shown back  
When I longed you'd take me.  
To break the charge that brought me home  
And all that won't erase me.  
  
I never would know that I could  
No matter what you'd pay me.  
Replay the part, you stole my heart  
I should have known you're crazy.  
  
If all I knew was that with you  
I'd want someone to save me.  
It'd be enough, but just my luck,  
I fell in love and baby all that I wanted was  
  
Now I know you better,  
You know I'd know better,  
Now I know you better!  
  
So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution,  
This melody inside of me still searches for solution,  
A twist of fate, a change of heart,  
Kills my infatuation,  
A broken heart, provides the spark for my determination,  
  
No one ever told me when I was alone,  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
Ooh, no one ever told me when I was alone,  
They just thought I'd know better, better.
