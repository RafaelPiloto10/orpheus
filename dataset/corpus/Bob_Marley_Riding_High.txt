You've been riding  
You've been riding quite a while, child  
(Keep on riding, keep on riding)  
You've been jiving  
Like a peacock, that's your style  
(Keep on jiving), oh (keep on jiving)  
  
Now I remember the days in school  
There wasn't a time when you didn't treat me cruel  
Ooh, wait till I get my hooks on you  
I'll show you what a fisherman can do  
  
You're riding  
Been riding quite a while, child  
(keep on riding, keep on riding)  
You've been jiving  
Like a peacock, that's your style  
(Keep on jiving), ooh-wee (keep on jiving)  
  
I say now, you always try to hurt me in the end  
In the presence of all our good, good friends  
But the patient man always win  
Now I'll just wait till you give in  
  
You've been riding  
You've been riding quite a while  
(keep on riding), keep on, ride (keep on riding)  
You've been jiving  
Like a peacock, that's your style  
(keep on jiving) oh-wee, alright (on jiving)  
  
At Christmas, more like an Easter bunny  
Just like a rabbit, you're always on the run  
But wait till I get my trap on you  
I'll see where you gonna run to  
Wait till I get my trap on you  
Then I'll see where you gonna run to  
  
You've been riding  
You've been riding quite a while  
(keep on riding), keep on, ride (keep on riding)  
You've been jiving  
Like a peacock, that's your style  
(keep on jiving), ooh-wee (keep on jiving)  
  
(So riding on my own) I need your love tonight  
(Riding on my own) A-when you hold me right
