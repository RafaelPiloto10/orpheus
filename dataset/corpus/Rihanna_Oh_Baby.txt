Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
And hold on if you're losing your way, oh.  
Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
Hold on tighter if you're going my way, oh.  
  
Someone take this gloom, and walk right on,  
Take it some place that I don't go.  
Try to push myself, it just holds me back,  
The stronger I go.  
I'm learning fast to fly away,  
And I took the blues on and won  
I turn around, I'll be smiling all the way to the sun, Hey.  
  
Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
And hold on if you're losing your way, oh.  
Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
Hold on tighter if you're going my way, oh.  
  
Steady as you go, hold your hand in mine,  
Don't stop if you're moving on.  
Put your mind into a happy photograph,  
Ain't no worry at all.  
I'm getting stronger every day,  
And it feels so good just to smile.  
Oh feels just like I can take a thousand miles in my stride, hey.  
  
Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
And hold on if you're losing your way, oh.  
Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
Hold on tighter if you're going my way, oh.  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
And hold on if you're losing your way, oh.  
Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
Hold on tighter if you're going my way, oh.  
  
Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
And hold on if you're losing your way, oh.  
Oh baby oh, still a long way to go,  
Hold on tighter if you're going my way, oh.
