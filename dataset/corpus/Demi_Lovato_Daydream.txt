Lalala-a  
Yeah  
Lalala-a  
  
I coulda been the one you noticed  
I coulda been the one for you  
I coulda been like all the others  
Is that what I'm supposed to do?  
I don't wanna be disappointing  
I don't wanna have to prove  
How I really feel about you  
But you don't even have a clue  
  
I try to be sensitive  
I try to be tough  
I try to walk away  
I try to be innocent  
I try to be rough  
But I just wanna play  
  
You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you lately  
And every time I look at you  
I can't explain I feel insane, I can't get away  
You're my daydream  
  
You're making me insane  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're doing it again  
  
If I tell you what I'm thinking,  
If I let myself trust you  
Can you give me what I'm missing  
Can you make my dreams come true  
  
I try to be sensitive  
I try to be tough  
I try to walk away,  
I try to be innocent  
I try to be rough  
But I just wanna play  
  
You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you lately  
And every time I look at you  
I can't explain how I feel insane, I can't get away  
You're my daydream, yeah  
  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're making me insane  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're doing it again  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're making me insane  
And you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're doin' it again
