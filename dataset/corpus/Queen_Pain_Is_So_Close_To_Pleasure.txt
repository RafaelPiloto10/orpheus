Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, oh yeah  
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life  
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows  
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time  
When I was young and just getting started  
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted  
Then I grew up and got my imagination  
And all I wanted was to start a new relation  
So in love but love had a bad reaction  
I was looking for some good old satisfaction  
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection  
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah  
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life  
Pain and pleasure  
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure  
  
When your plans go wrong - you turn out the light  
But inside of your mind you put up a fight  
Where are the answers that we're all searching for  
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore  
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad  
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad  
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your face  
For better for worse, so let's make the best of the rest of our years  
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so  
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life  
Pain and pleasure, ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah  
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life  
All your life  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure
