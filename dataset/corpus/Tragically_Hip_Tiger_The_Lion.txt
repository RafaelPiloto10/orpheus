This is Tiger the Lion  
Gimme the Knuckles of Frisco  
If there's danger in the language,  
Gentlemen,  
I suggest no further use of  
The two-way radio.  
'John Cage had come to feel  
That art in our time  
Was far less important  
Than our daily lives,  
To which so many'd become  
More or less inclined.  
The purpose of it's not unique.  
Not to build masterpieces  
For a delectative elite  
But simply to wake to your life.'  
  
You'll be serving the song  
When you find out you won't change  
Serving the song  
Walking the range.  
  
'John Cage had come to feel  
Art in our time  
Was much less important  
Than our daily life  
If there's a perpetual plan  
For discovery days  
Where everyone can take part  
In what he called  
Purposeless play  
And there's a sign of life in this play  
Not to get order from chaos  
Tell you how to create  
But simply to wake to your life.'  
  
You'll be serving the song  
When we find out you won't change  
Serving the song  
Bombing the range  
  
This is Tiger the Lion  
Get me Into the Pillows  
If you're painted by radar, gentlemen,  
There'll be no further use of  
The two-way radio
