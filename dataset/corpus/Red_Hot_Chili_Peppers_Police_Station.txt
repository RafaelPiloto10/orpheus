I saw you at the police station and it breaks my heart to say  
Your eyes had wandered off to something distant, cold and gray  
I guess you didn't see it coming  
Someone's gotten used to slumming  
Dreaming of the golden years  
I see you had to change careers  
Far away, but we both know its somewhere  
  
I saw you on the back page of some pre-press yesterday  
The drift wood in your eyes said nothing short of love for pain  
I know you from another picture  
Of someone with the most convictions  
We used to read the funny papers  
Fooled around and pulled some capers  
Not today, send a message to her  
A message that I'm coming, coming to pursue her  
  
Tell your country I, rest my face on your bed  
I've got you ten times over, I'll chase you down 'til you're dead  
  
Saw you on a TV station and it made me wanna pray  
An empty shell of loveliness is now dusted with decay  
What happened to the funny paper?  
Smiling was your money maker  
Someone oughta situate her  
Find a way to educate her  
All the way, time to come and find you  
But you can't hide from me girl, so never mind what I do  
  
Tell your country I, rest my face on your bed  
I bet my sovereign country and I, left it all for your head  
  
I saw you in the church out there was no time to exchange  
You were getting married and it felt so very strange  
I guess I didn't see it coming  
And now I guess it's me who's bumming  
Dreaming of the golden years  
You and I were mixing tears  
Not today, not for me but someone  
I never could get used to, so now I will refuse to  
  
Tell your country I, rest my face on your bed  
I bet my sovereign country and I, left it all for your head  
I got my best foot forward and I'll chase you down 'til you're dead
