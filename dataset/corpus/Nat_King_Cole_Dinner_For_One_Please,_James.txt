Dinner for one please, James,  
Madame will not be dining.  
Yes, you may bring the wine in,  
Love plays such funny games.  
  
Dinner for one please, James,  
Close Madame's room, we've parted.  
Please, don't look so downhearted,  
Love plays such funny games.  
  
Seems my best friend told her of another,  
I had no chance to deny.  
You know there has never been another,  
Someday she'll find out the lie.  
  
Maybe she's not to blame,  
Leave me with silent hours.  
No, don't move her favorite flowers,  
Dinner for one please, James.
