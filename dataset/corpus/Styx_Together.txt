Rush down, down to the first floor  
There never seems to be enough time  
Push hard, and push a little bit more  
A cup of coffee and I'm gonna be fine  
Fine as I can be now  
  
Me and you, we do what we gotta do  
We only want to have a good life  
It's tough, we don't see each other enough  
And sometime the going gets rough  
Still we keep pushing on through  
  
We could use another summer of love  
It's cloudy here  
But there's a blue sky up above  
  
If we could only fly away from here  
We could say good-bye to all the tears  
And maybe we could spend the rest of our years  
Together, together  
  
Sometimes I watch the TV news  
I wanna say what's the use in trying  
Cause come on, what kind of difference can one man make  
Yeah but how much more can I take  
  
I think back when I was a little kid  
I did what little kids did  
Played war 'til I didn't wanna play no more  
Hey and that's when love stepped in  
Changed everything again  
  
It's never too late for a summer of love  
Yeah it's cloudy here  
But there's a blue sky up above  
  
If we could only fly away from here  
We could say good-bye to all the tears  
And maybe we could spend the rest of our years  
Together, we could be together  
  
These are crazy times  
It's a different world  
Well, that's okay  
Let it be that way  
We could lose our minds  
Or we could find our way  
We can change our world  
No matter what they say  
  
If we could only fly away from here  
We could turn around and say good-bye to all the tears  
And maybe we could spend the rest of our years  
Together  
We could be together  
  
Now, we can let the sunshine in (Together)  
And we can overcome and win (Together)  
We'll have ourselves a summer of love again (Together)  
We'll be, we'll be together  
Hey, hey  
We'll be together
