I've declared a truce, so stop your fighting  
The marshall is in town  
I won't put up with no big mouth yapping  
At least not while I'm around  
This is my friend Ace, he's from the 8th precinct  
Nothing goes on that he don't know  
And we've been send cause your arguments  
Have been going on for too long  
And before one of you hurts the other one of you  
I'm declaring martial law  
  
I came, I saw, I declared martial law  
I'm the marshall in the city  
The jails are filled with people like you  
You oughta listen to your diddy-wah-diddy  
What's a girl like you doing with that lamp  
You better drop it down on the floor  
And, son, that isn't very smart, kicking a hole in that door  
Hey Ace, will you take a look at this place  
And get those neighbors out of the hall  
I'm declaring martial law  
  
I came, I saw, I declared martial law  
I'm the marshall of the city  
And if you stand away, I've got something to say  
That might even help you  
  
Keep your hands to yourself and keep your big mouth shut  
Don't touch nobody with hate  
And if all you've got is poison in your mouth  
Make sure that you don't speak  
It's 3:30 in the early morning  
Don't punch, don't scratch, don't bite  
Try not to take the garbage of the day  
Any place but outside  
  
Now me and Mr. Ace are gonna leave this place  
And this fighting's gonna end  
And if we're called back, I'm gonna knock you flat  
And stack you end to end  
  
I came, I saw, I declared martial law  
I'm the marshall in the city
