When the night time unfolds and the memories that you hold  
Bring a light to your eyes though you know it's disguise  
When the night turns to day you turn around and say  
Magic mirror please tell is this heaven or hell?  
Answer to the master  
  
Can you look to the sky? Can you live through your lie?  
Of the thoughts you can't trace which time can't erase  
To a face on the wall do you often recall  
What you said on the night when the new full moon was rising?
