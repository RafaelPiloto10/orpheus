I can bring you back anytime I want to  
I remember an angel in your veil of white so fine  
You were always very near, well, I think that you're still here  
It's so reads in the diary of my mind.  
  
On the first page there we are down by the river  
With the flowers bloomin' in the warm sunshine  
Speaking love words, soft and sweet and as our lips slowly meet  
We're together in the diary of my mind.  
  
Yes, I can bring you back anytime I want to  
Even though you've been gone a long, long time  
Oh, I just close my eyes and then I realize  
You're right there in the diary of my mind.  
  
On the next page I can smell the yellow roses  
You brought to this world our baby girl so fine  
A princess for the queen, I was such a happy king  
You're both still here in the diary of my mind.  
  
Yes, seasons come and mistakes I don't like to remember  
But history shows that kindoms fall with time  
Mistrust and deceit and the bottle it brought defeat  
That's the last thing that's in the diary of my mind.  
  
But I can bring you back anytime I want to  
Even though you've been gone a long, long time  
I just close my eyes and then I realize  
You're right there in the diary of my mind.  
  
You're still here in the diary of my mind
