Oh, Oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me.  
You can walk, you can talk just like me.  
You can look, tell me what you see.  
You can look, you won't see nothing like me  
If you look around the world.  
  
Oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me.  
With a little practice, you can walk like, talk just like me.  
If that's what you want to do.  
Well, you can look, you'll walk in circles around me.  
But first, I'll walk in circles 'round you.  
But first, I'll walk around the world.  
  
I'm walking 'round the world  
I...you can.  
But first, show me what you do.
