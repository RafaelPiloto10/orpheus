I've been around watching little late shows  
Drink a lot of beer  
Like playing cards with my friends  
  
Call it evil  
Call it pain  
It goes knock, knock, knock-knock-knock-knock, on my door  
It goes knock, knock, knock-knock-knock-knock, on my door  
  
That rock and rock, yeah, call it evil  
That rock and rock, yeah, call it evil  
  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door, Yeah!  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door  
Going to get as my babe.  
It goes knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door  
  
Playing sopwith in the back of my head  
What you trying to be crazy?  
People look at me, they look at me, but you're dead  
  
Call it evil  
Call it pain  
It goes knock, knock, knock-knock-knock-knock, on my door  
It goes knock, knock, knock-knock-knock-knock, come on  
Knock-knock-knock-knock, one more  
Knock-knock-knock-knock  
  
That rock and rock, yeah, call it evil  
That rock and rock, yeah, call it evil  
  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door
