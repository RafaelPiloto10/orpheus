There's a touch upon my lips  
Left by memory's fingertips  
I still hear her voice  
When there's no sound  
  
There's a touch upon my skin  
Left when she went back to him  
All the rest has gone  
She's not around  
  
When I saw her first  
It was lust my friend  
Thought it would burn  
Then it would end  
But I lost my old philosophy  
Now I believed in love  
Well the months went by and my love grew strong  
Thought she felt the same but I was wrong  
She held my old philosophy  
Now I'm destroyed by love  
  
There's a touch  
  
Well I still believed that I would win  
'cause I was a better man than him  
She held the new philosophy  
Now she believed in love  
But the love she felt was not for me  
Said she would have to set me free  
Now I know there's no philosophy  
That can't be destroyed by love  
  
There's a touch
