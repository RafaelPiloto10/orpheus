The ornaments are ready  
The place has been prepared  
Strings of lights and holly  
Are draped across the chair  
The family's all together  
I know where they must be  
Everyone is searching  
For the perfect tree  
  
Chorus:  
The perfect tree  
Grew very long ago  
And it was not decked with silver  
Or with ornaments of gold  
But hanging from it's branches  
Was a gift for you and me  
Jesus laid His life down  
On the perfect tree  
  
Mother wants a straight one  
The children want it tall  
Dad just hopes that somehow  
He can get it down the hall  
Soon they'll gather round it  
As proud as they can be  
But when they're looking at it  
I wonder if they see  
  
Chorus (repeat)  
  
With all the celebrations  
Sometimes the truth is lost  
That every step this baby took  
Brought Him closer to the cross  
  
Chorus (repeat 2X)
