I can only imagine  
Surrounded by your glory,  
What will my heart feel  
  
Will I dance for you Jesus  
Or in awe of you be still  
Will I stand in your presence  
Or to my knees will I fall  
  
Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speek at all  
I can only imagine  
Yeah, I can only imagine  
  
I can only imagine  
Surrounded by your glory,  
What will my heart feel  
  
Will I dance for you Jesus  
Or in awe of you be still  
Will I stand in your presence  
Or to my knees will I fall  
  
Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speek at all  
I can only imagine  
Yeah, I can only imagine
