I'm more than just an option  
(hey, hey, hey)  
Refuse to be forgotten  
(hey, hey, hey)  
I took a chance with my heart  
(hey, hey, hey)  
And I feel it taking over  
  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
I'm more than just a number  
(hey, hey, hey)  
I doubt you'll find another  
(hey, hey, hey)  
So every single summer  
(hey, hey, hey)  
I'll be the one that you remember  
  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
It's more than just a mission  
(hey, hey, hey)  
You hear but you don't listen  
(hey, hey, hey)  
You better pay attention  
(hey, hey, hey)  
And get what you been missing  
  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
Too many times I've been wrong  
I guess being right takes too long  
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do  
But give all I have to you and  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart.
