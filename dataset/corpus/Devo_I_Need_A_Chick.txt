I need a chick to suck my dick  
I need a dog to lick my hog  
I need a cat to stroke my bat  
I'm pukin and shitin' and dyin' of thirst  
I ain't got no field to plow  
There's no hole for my pole  
I'd fuck a mink stole  
I need a woman who understands  
There's nothing more spiritual  
Than dog style love  
And when i find her  
I'm going to get down on my knees  
I'm going to eat her  
'Cause she's the moon
