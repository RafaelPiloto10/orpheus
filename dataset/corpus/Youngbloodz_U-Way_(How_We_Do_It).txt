Center of attention, all eyes are on me  
Oh, that's Sean Paul a.k.a. Sean Grease  
Oh, nevermind him 'cause he always on that soft  
And roll wit a group of felons that'll rip you off  
He slum as hell, seven golds in his mouth  
He slizzard as hell, always hollin 'bout the south  
And every week at the club he always get kicked out

Off in the club gettin slizzard shawty is what we do  
Just like you cut dat bougie ho, yeah I done cut her too  
Forever who from what we do, so we's against da grain

So get on up and just bounce  
Wit the hump-ta-hump off in the trunk, so just bounce  
Now come on and jump on befo' you get left  
This ain't nothin you want to miss, so now it's on to the next  
[Chorus]6x
