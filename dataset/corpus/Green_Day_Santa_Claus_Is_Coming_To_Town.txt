You better watch out,  
You better not cry,  
You better not pout  
And I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making his list, checking it twice  
Gonna find out if you're naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when youve been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
O, You better watch out,  
You better not cry,  
You better not pout  
And I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
O, You better watch out,  
You better cry,  
You better not pout,  
And I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making his list, checking it twice  
Gonna find out if you're naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when youve been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake
