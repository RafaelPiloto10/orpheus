Well, I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head  
Over you, over you  
I want you to want me I need you so badly  
I can't think of anything but you, yeah  
  
And I think I'm going out of my head  
'Cause I can't explain these tears that I shed  
Baby, over you over you  
I see you each morning but you just walk past me  
You don't even notice I exist  
  
Going out of my head over you, baby  
Out of my head over you darlin'  
Been out of my head oh baby  
I must think of a way into your heart  
There's no reason why  
My being shy should keep us apart  
  
Yeah oh, shoobop shoobop, baby  
Shoobop, shoobop, my love  
I see you each morning  
But you just walk past me  
You don't even notice that I exist  
  
Going out of my head over you darlin'  
Out of my head over you, out of my head  
I'm going, going, going, going, going  
Girl, girl, yeah  
  
I'm going, going, going, going, going, com'n  
Give me, give me your lovin', com'n  
Give me, give me your lovin', com'n  
Give me, give me a little lovin'
