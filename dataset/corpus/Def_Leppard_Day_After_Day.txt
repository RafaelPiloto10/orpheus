You know me, just look in my eyes  
I shed my skin, got a new disguise  
My heart still beats and I'm still the same  
Do you know my name  
  
It's everything you've ever seen  
It's every dream you've broken  
It's only when you keep your eyes wide open  
  
Like a circle of light spinnin' out of control  
and I just can't let go  
  
Day after day there's a voice deep inside me  
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie  
Every belief that has come back to find me  
Day after day and it follows me blindly  
Day after day  
  
I feel you, you're under my skin  
You look in the mirror, you know where I've been  
My heart still beats but it's not the same  
Don't you know my name  
  
I'm always there to keep your eyes wide open  
  
Like a circle of light spinnin' out of control  
And I just can't let go  
  
Day after day there's a voice deep inside me  
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie  
Every belief that has come back to find me  
Day after day and it follows me blindly  
Day after day  
  
Like a circle of light spinnin' out of control  
And I just can't let go  
  
Day after day there's a voice deep inside me  
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie  
Every belief that has come back to find me  
Day after day and it follows me blindly  
Day after day  
  
Day after day  
  
Day after day there's a voice deep inside me  
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie  
Every belief that has come back to find me  
Day after day and it follows me blindly  
Day after day
