I've seen ladies look at me  
With want to in their eyes  
But each time they do  
I think of you and it makes me realize  
Just any old love won't do  
  
No, any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just any old love won't do  
  
You've got the only arms  
I've ever come runnin' to  
Love has always led me to your bed  
Just any old love won't do  
  
No, Any old love won't do  
Just any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just any old love won't do  
  
Just any old love won't do  
No, any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just any old love won't do  
  
No, any old love won't do  
Just any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just, any old love won't do  
  
No, any old love won't do  
Just any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just, any old love won't do.
