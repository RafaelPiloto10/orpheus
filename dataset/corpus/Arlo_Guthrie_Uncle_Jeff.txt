Uncle Jeff played the fiddle in his Colorado home  
And I backed him on the banjo so he didn't play alone  
We've got five generations of a fiddle playin' clan  
And it's nice to hear a fiddle by a fiddle playin' man  
  
Here's another song for Uncle Jeff Guthrie  
Written on the road by the light of the moon  
Thinkin' 'bout fiddlin' somewhere up in Michigan  
I hope that I can make it back to Colorado soon  
  
Well, my daddy had a fiddle, and he laid it on his son  
Sayin', "Son, play the fiddle like your fiddlin' folks done."  
Well, it's hard to learn to fiddle  
When you're fiddlin' on the run  
But fiddlin' is fiddlin', and fiddlin' is fun
