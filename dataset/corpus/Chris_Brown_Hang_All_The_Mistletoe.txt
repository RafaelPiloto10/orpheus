Hang all the mistletoe  
I'm gonna get to know  
You better, yeah  
  
This Christmas  
And as we trim the tree  
How much fun it's  
Gonna be together  
  
This Christmas  
Fireside is blazing bright  
Were caroling through  
The night  
  
And this Christmas,  
Will be  
A very special  
Christmas, for me  
  
Presents and cards  
Are here  
My world is filled with  
Cheer and you,  
  
This Christmas  
And as I look around  
Your eyes outshine  
The town, they do  
  
This Christmas  
Fireside is blazing bright  
Were caroling through  
The night  
  
And this Christmas,  
Will be  
A very special  
Christmas, for me  
  
Shake a hand  
Shake a hand  
  
Fireside is blazing  
Bright  
Were caroling  
Through the night  
  
And this Christmas  
Will be  
So very special for  
You and me  
  
Shake a hand now, come  
On  
Everybody shake a hand  
Now  
Family  
  
We'll be together to  
Make this Christmas  
Right  
Yes We Will
