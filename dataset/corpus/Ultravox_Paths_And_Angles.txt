Visions of men never known  
Never seen, never heard, never shown  
Characters lying in wait  
Responsible figures of fate  
With memories and faces as long as their hate  
  
Paths and the angles of light  
Find their way into my eye  
Recorded and logged for a time  
Some living, some loving, some dying  
  
There are factors re-arranged every time  
The phrases, the angles, so fine  
Sunken valleys and decades of crime  
Distant seasons  
A smile that was quoted as mine  
  
Paths and the angles of light  
Find their way into my eye  
Recorded and logged for a time  
Some living, some loving, some dying
