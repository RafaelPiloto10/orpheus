We seduce the dark with pain and rapture  
Like two ships that pass in the night  
You and I, a whore and a bashful sailor  
Welcome to a sunrise of a dirty mind  
  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
Whoever brings the night  
  
The dark, created to hide the innocent white, the lust of night  
Eyes so bright, seductive lies  
Crimson masquerade where I merely played my part  
Poison dart of desire  
  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
Whoever brings the night  
  
Choose a bride tonight  
A fantasy for a zombie  
Hurt me, I love to suffer  
Your harems are dreams for free  
  
Enter  
Suck form us and live for ever  
Rotten beauty  
Will haunt you for a lifetime  
  
Come with me on underwater  
And drown to despise me no more  
Unholy, unworthy  
My night is a dream for free  
  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
Whoever brings the night  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
  
Whoever brings the night  
Whoever brings the night
