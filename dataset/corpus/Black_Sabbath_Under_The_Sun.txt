Well, I don't want no Jesus freak to  
Tell me what it's all about  
No black magician telling me  
To cast my soul out  
Don't believe in violence  
I don't even believe in peace  
I've opened the door  
Now my mind has been released  
  
Well I don't want no preacher  
Telling me about the god in the sky  
No I don't want no one to tell me  
Where I'm gonna go when I die  
I wanna live my life, I don't want  
People telling me what to do  
I just believe in myself  
'Cause no one else seems true  
  
Every day just comes and goes  
Life is one long overdose  
People try to rule the nation  
I can see through their frustration  
  
People riding their real peace  
keep on running their rat race  
Behind each flower there grows a weed  
In their world of make-believe  
  
So believe what I tell you  
It's the only way to fight in the end  
Just believe in yourself you know you really  
shouldn't have to pretend  
Don't let those empty people  
Try and interfere with your mind  
Just live your life  
And leave them all behind
