I know what you think  
It's clear as mud in your eyes  
We're the plastic poseurs and prostitutes  
You've obviously come to despise  
  
But you don't know nothing  
You're not hot enough to matter  
You don't understand it's the glamorous life  
A dream that no one can shatter  
  
[Chorus]  
We're shameless  
We will do anything  
To get our fifteen minutes of fame  
We have no integrity  
We're ready to crawl  
To obtain celebrity  
We'll do anything at all  
  
I'm ambitious  
Believe me, I'm going to be big  
I'm a slave to glamour  
Applause and clamour  
My makeup, my wardrobe, my wigs  
  
Don't call me pathetic  
I'm harder than you'll ever guess  
Relentlessly tough, for when the going gets rough  
The tough get their picture in the press  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Anything, anything, anything at all)  
(We'll do anything, anything, anything at all)  
(We'll do anything, anything, anything at all)  
(We'll do anything, anything, anything at all)  
[It's going perfectly alright]  
[How dare you? Do you know who I am?]  
[It's an absolute disgrace]  
  
Tell me you love me  
Admit it, you're really impressed  
Would it not amuse you  
For me to seduce you  
Have you ever seen me undressed?  
  
[Chorus x2]
