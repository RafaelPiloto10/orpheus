When the light shines down  
And time goes slowly  
When my mind's in the dust  
Spoilt and dying  
  
There's a pain in my hand  
Inscribed to the sad and lonely  
I've been so cold and alone thinkin' how long  
  
Now if you had told me, she would come back  
And if you had told me, the clock was gonna fall  
If you had shown me, some affection  
I would have believed you  
  
Don't tell me the moon is blue  
Cos tonight it's over, now the pain's in the dust  
And you can't find your blue moon  
It's over, ooh tonight it's over  
  
And yeah you been bad  
So why did I still want you to hold me?  
My tears of broken glass thinkin' ho wlong  
  
The blade was a sharp one  
That cut me both ways and tore my world apart  
Now I could have healed that wound so deep  
But you wouldn't understand  
  
Don't tell me the moon is blue,  
Cos tonight it's over, now the pain's in the dust  
And you can't find your blue moon  
It's over, ooh tonight it's over  
  
Don't you know that you hurt me so? You!  
  
Don't tell me the moon is blue, cos tonight it's over  
Now the pain's in the dust  
And you can't find your blue moon  
It's over, ooh tonight it's over
