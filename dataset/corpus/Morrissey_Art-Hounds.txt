Art-hounds look like nothing  
  
So Art-hounds write something  
And those that do are judged by those  
Who tried and found they couldn't do  
  
Art-hounds see the Greek ideal  
And gaze on what they'll never feel  
Oh, the pitiless revenge of those without friends  
The pitiless, the pitiless revenge  
  
Art-hounds know what's around  
Because they've seen it somewhere written down  
And everything they've seen on the moving screen  
Helps them fill up the page  
  
In European museums  
Will I see you?  
Will I see you?  
Will I see you?  
Will I see you?  
In European museums  
Will I see you?  
  
My life is opera  
My life is opera  
My life is opera  
My life is opera  
  
Art-hounds in a restaurant  
They bring along their loving Aunt  
But when they can't find a table for their fat Aunt Mable  
They stamp their feet and cry

Art-hounds: very funny, very witty, but very lonely  
And below the belt is shriveled and small  
It functions only as a word

It knows a thousand woes

If you cannot stand this fake world  
If you cannot stand this fake world  
Take my hand  
If you cannot stand this fake world

If you cannot stand this fake world  
Take my hand

I take 16 pills to send me to sleep  
And 16 pills to shake me awake
