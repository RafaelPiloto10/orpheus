Can you hear it in my voice  
Was it something I let slip  
Does the whole world know  
Isn't it obvious?  
  
I'm the one who's in control  
Now I'm acting like a fool  
Do my feelings show?  
Is my face aglow?  
Isn't it obvious?  
  
[Chorus]  
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore  
I'm feeling like a little girl  
Caught up in emotions  
I'm out of control  
Isn't it obvious?  
  
Do you see my hands they tremble  
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes  
Don't know how long  
I can keep this inside  
Isn't it obvious?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart  
Can you see it in my eyes  
Every glance, every smile  
Must give me away  
And I feel so much I can't hide  
  
[Chorus]
