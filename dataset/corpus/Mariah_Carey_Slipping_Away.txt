Yeh, la-di-da-di-da, yeh (woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeh)  
Oh-ooo, yeh (woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeh) oh-oo, yeh  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made  
Baby I'm so afraid  
(You're so far, so far, (oh yeh, babe) so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast it seems  
You know you're slipping away from me  
  
I keep on reaching and I, keep on trying  
But you never even hold me and it seems like you don't know me baby  
I keep on yearning and I, I guess I'm learning  
That it's just a losing fight 'cause there's no passion in your eyes  
No, no, no, no, babe  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away) yeh  
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made  
Baby I'm so afraid  
(You're so far, so far, so far, (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast it seems  
You know you're slipping away from me  
  
I keep denying that our, our love is dying  
But it's all a big charade and it's a fruitless game to play  
I can't remember when you, you last were tender  
And it's always touch and go your silence chills me to the bone, yeh  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made  
Baby I'm so afraid, yeh  
(You're so far, so far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast it seems  
You know you're slipping away from me  
  
Away, away, away, away, away, yeh (woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh) hey, yeh  
Further, further, (further, further) ooo-yeh  
(woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh) yeh  
You're so far  
  
Time after time I reach for you  
I try and I try but you're so aloof  
Where is the boy (hey) that you used to be (where,yeh)  
Baby you're slipping away from me  
(You're so far away from me baby, baby)  
Time after time I reach for you  
I try and I try but you're so aloof  
Where is the boy that you used to be (oh-babe)  
Baby you're slipping away from me  
(You're so far)  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
Slipping away from what we had, truly I just don't understand, yeh  
(You're so far, so far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading so fast it seems  
You know you're slipping away, yeh-yeh-yeh, baby  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
Time after time I reach for you  
I try and I try but you're so aloof

Baby you're slipping away from me
