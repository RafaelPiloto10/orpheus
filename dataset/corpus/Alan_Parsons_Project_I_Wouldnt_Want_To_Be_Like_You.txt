If I had a mind to  
I wouldn't wanna think like you  
And if I had a time to  
I wouldn't wanna talk to you  
  
I don't care  
What you do  
I wouldn't want to be like you  
  
If I was high class  
I wouldn't need a buck to pass  
And if I was a fall guy  
I wouldn't need no alibi  
  
I don't care  
What you do  
I wouldn't want to be like you  
  
Back on the bottom line  
Diggin' for a lousy dime  
If I hit a mother lode  
I'd cover anything that showed  
  
I don't care  
What you do  
I wouldn't want to be like you
