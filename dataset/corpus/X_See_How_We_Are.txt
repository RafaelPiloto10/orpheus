There are men lost in jail  
Crowded fifty to a room  
There's too many rats in this cage of the world  
And the women know their place  
They sit home and write letters  
And when they visit once a year  
Well they both just sit there and stare  
  
See how we are  
Gotta keep bars in between us  
See how we are  
We only sing about it once in every twenty years  
See how we are  
Oh see how we are  
  
Now there are seven kinds of Coke  
500 kinds of cigarettes  
This freedom of choice in the USA drives everybody crazy  
But in Acapulco  
Well they don't give a damn  
About kids selling Chiclets with no shoes on their feet  
  
See how we are  
"Hey man, what's in it for me?"  
See how we are  
We only sing about it once in every twenty years  
See how we are  
Oh see how we are  
  
Now that highway's coming through  
So you all gotta move  
This bottom rung ain't no fun at all  
No fires and rockhouses and grape-flavored rat poison  
They are the new trinity  
For this so-called community  
  
See how we are  
Gotta keep bars on all of our windows  
See how we are  
We only sing about it once in every twenty years  
See how we are  
Oh see how we are  
  
Well this morning the alarm rang at noon  
And I'm trying to write this letter to you  
About how much I care and why I just can't be there  
To draw your bath and comb...and comb your hair  
  
Last night in a nightspot  
Where things aren't so hot  
My friend said, "I met a boy and I'm in love"  
I said, "Oh really... What's this one's name?"  
She said, "His first name is Homeboy"  
I said "Could his last name be Trouble?"  
  
See how we are  
Ah Homeboy... Isn't that a Mexican name?  
See how we are  
We only sing about it once in every twenty years  
See how we are  
Oh see how we are  
Yeah see how we are
