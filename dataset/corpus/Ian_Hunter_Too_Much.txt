All I ever wanted  
Was to lose myself in you  
All I ever needed  
Was you to need me too  
You're all I ever think about  
I hunger for your touch  
And all I ever wanted  
Was you, is that too much?  
I hate the pain of loving you  
It happens all the time  
I never needed anything or anybody  
Until your eyes met mine  
I'm waiting for your answer, babe  
What's gonna become of us?  
'cause all I ever wanted  
Was you, is that too much?  
It is too much to ask  
That this man with a past  
Could be happy at last  
With a future like you  
It is too much to ask  
Is it too much of a task?  
Am I going to fast for you?  
Maybe you don't want me  
I'm so scared of losing you  
I never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity  
Watch me screw up this one too  
It's so hard to talk about love  
I'm leaving now, oh, it's just  
And all I ever wanted  
Was you, is that too much?
