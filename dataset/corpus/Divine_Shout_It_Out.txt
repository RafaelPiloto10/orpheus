Shout it out, if your partner is your best friend  
Shout it out, shake your buddy's hand  
Shout it out, if you really love the DJ  
Shout it out, everybody take a stand.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out  
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out  
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out  
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out  
  
Shout it out, if there's beauty in the beat  
Shout it out, if the rhythm is a treat  
Shout it out, if romance is in your heart  
Shout it out, everybody start.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shout it out, if your partner is your best friend  
Shout it out, shake your buddy's hand  
Shout it out, if you really love the DJ  
Shout it out, everybody take a stand.  
  
[Chorus]
