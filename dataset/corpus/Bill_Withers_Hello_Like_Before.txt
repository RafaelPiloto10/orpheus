Hello like before  
I'd never come here  
If I'd known that you were here  
I must admit though  
That's it's nice to see you, dear  
You look like you've been doing well  
  
Hello like before  
I hope we've grown  
'Cause we were only children then  
For laughs I guess we both can say  
'I knew when'  
But then again, that's kiss and tell  
  
Hello like before  
I guess it's different  
'Cause we know each other now  
I guess I've always known  
We'd meet again somehow  
So that it might as well be now
