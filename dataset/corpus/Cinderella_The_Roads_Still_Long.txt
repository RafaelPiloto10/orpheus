Growing up as a young boy  
Sometimes can be rough  
At six years old I was thinkin'  
Seven would be just enough  
But I was wrong  
Ooh I was wrong, yeah  
Ten years old and I'm growin'  
Thinkin' I got it sussed  
Mama said you'll be a fine young man  
I thought I already was  
But I was wrong  
Ooh I was wrong  
'Cause when you get where you're going  
The road's still long  
Eighteen years I'm a rebel  
Thinkin' I'm pretty tough  
Daddy said you got a lot to learn  
I thought that I'd learned enough  
But I was wrong  
Ooh I was wrong, yeah  
Twenty-five was a good time  
Comin' into my own  
Climbed the mountain and I reached for the sky  
I thought that I had it all  
But I was wrong  
Ooh I was wrong  
'Cause when you get where you're going  
The road's still long  
(The road's still long)  
When you get where you're going  
The road's still long  
(The road's still long)  
They all try to tell you but who are they to say  
'Cause the best things that you learn you find out on your way  
No time for feelin' sorry just time for being strong  
When you get where your going  
The road's still long  
Now I see where I come from  
Now I see where I am  
Now I see that you never really know  
So you just gotta do the best you can  
That ain't wrong  
Ooh that ain't wrong no  
'Cause when you get where you're going  
The road's still long  
(The road's still long)  
When you get where you're going  
The road's still long  
(The road's still long)  
When you get where you're going, yeah
