What was yours to give  
Was also yours to sell  
There's the haystack  
Can you spin it into gold?  
  
Halo on your head  
A tail and cloven hoof  
You set sail upon a sea of open wallet  
  
And when you're played out  
You'll coast for miles  
Fueled by smiles  
  
You run in circles  
With industry professionals  
You climb the ladder  
That leads you to the temple gates  
The evil god there will welcome you with open arms  
  
What was yours to give  
Was also yours to sell  
But where's the haystack now?  
And where's the pot of gold?
