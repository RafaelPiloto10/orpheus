From night to dawn  
You soldiered on, did ya?  
Each day is a gift  
But you led us strong  
And kept us on, did ya?  
Like each day is a gift  
  
I never thought that I'd be here with you  
Saying all these words that I have to  
But after all is said and all is done  
I never meant to ever hurt no one  
  
And nothing has to change  
You and I are strange  
Passing in the night  
Between the darkness and the rain  
  
At the crack of dawn  
You grab my arm, did ya?  
Each day was a gift  
You told me, "slow,  
Before I move on  
You must remember each day is a gift."  
I never understood what was for you  
Could never be for me this'll have to do  
But after all you said and all you've done  
I know you never meant to hurt no one  
  
Nothing has to change  
You and I can be strange  
Passing in the days  
Between the morning and the rain [Repeat: x 2]  
  
I can see you now  
Its like you were never gone  
  
From dusk to dawn  
You soldiered on  
Like each day was a gift  
Oh, you led us strong  
But you couldn't hold on  
And that's fine,  
'Cause each day was a gift  
  
I don't know when  
I'll be home  
So save a place for me 'til I get there  
I don't know when  
I'll be home  
So save a place for me  
  
For me [Repeat: x 4]
