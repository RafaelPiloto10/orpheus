Darlin', I believe in love  
Since I met you, baby  
I believe in love  
The way you hold me  
My heart is stirred  
You can control me  
Without a word  
  
Turn on your white light  
In my open eyes  
Oh girl, you hypnotize me (hypnotize me)  
I feel your white light  
You're so bright  
I'm hypnotized (I'm hypnotized)  
And as you're looking at me  
It's a deep ecstasy  
And no word is enough  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love  
  
Darlin', I believe in love  
In this hate-ridden world  
I believe in love  
Do you know the power  
You have over me  
Use it every hour  
Shine the light on me  
  
Turn on your white light  
In my open eyes  
Oh girl, you hypnotize me (hypnotize me)  
I feel your white light  
You're so bright  
I'm hypnotized (I'm hypnotized)  
And as you're looking at me  
It's a deep ecstasy  
And no word is enough  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love  
  
Turn me on (with your love)  
Turn me on (with your love)  
Turn your light around (to mesmerize me)  
Turn me on (oo-oh)  
  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love  
  
Turn on your white light  
In my open eyes  
Oh girl, you hypnotize me (hypnotize me)  
I feel your white light  
You're so bright  
I'm hypnotized (I'm hypnotized)  
And as you're looking at me  
It's a deep ecstasy  
And no word is enough  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love  
  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love
