Rivers flow uphill  
Blue turns into grey  
Winter follows springtime  
Morning ends the day  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
  
If you're walking home beside her  
And you know what time it is  
And if you avoid the puddles in your way  
You haven't been there either  
To the land that lies  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
  
But if you're walking home beside her  
And the sun should turn to blue  
And you keep on going 'cause you're unaware  
Then you know that you are there  
  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
You won't know if you're coming or going  
  
If you're sitting there beside her  
With your arms you hold her close  
And you're wondering just how far she'll let you go  
You haven't been there either  
To the land that lies  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
  
But if you're sitting there beside her  
And a bear comes in the room  
And you keep on going 'cause you're unaware  
Then you know that you are there  
  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
You won't know if you're coming or going
