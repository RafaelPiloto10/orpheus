"I can't stop this feeling  
Deep inside of me  
Girl, you just don't realise  
What you do to me  
  
When you hold me  
In your arms so tight  
You let me know  
Everything's all right  
  
CHORUS  
I, I'm hooked on a feeling  
Im high on believing  
That your in love with me  
  
Lips as sweet as candy  
Its taste is on my mind  
Girl you've got me thirsty  
For another cup of wine  
  
Got a bug from you, Girl  
But I don't need no cure  
I'll just stay a victim  
If i can for sure  
  
All the good love  
When we're all alone  
Keep it up Girl  
Yeah, you turn me on  
  
CHORUS  
  
All the good love  
When we're all alone  
Keep it up Girl  
Yeah, you turn me on  
  
CHORUS  
  
I'm hooked on a feeling  
And im high on believing  
That your in love with me  
  
I said I'm hooked on a feeling...  
And im high on believing  
That your in love with me  
Hooked on a feeling
