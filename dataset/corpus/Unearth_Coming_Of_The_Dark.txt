This marks the end of innocence  
Collapse now the common ground  
Beneath it all are fears of destiny  
As the bastard man cometh  
  
Concealed the omens howl  
Blinded the second sight  
Smothered, smothered  
To mask the coming of the dark  
  
And as I cling to this world  
I know there is cold blood running  
Alive, yet live to curse the days  
I know there is cold blood running  
  
Confess all arrogance  
Confide in circling wolves  
Ferocious blades bleeding the lifeblood  
As the bastard man forges on  
  
Capsized in periled plight  
Is this the only road?  
Alone, alone  
Will darkness lead to light?  
  
And as I cling to this world  
I know there is cold blood running  
Alive, yet live to curse the days  
I know there is cold blood running  
  
And as I cling to this world  
I know there is cold blood running  
Alive, yet live to curse the days  
This blood is running strong  
  
I was bound by the hands of false destiny  
No longer will I follow  
No longer will I follow hands of false destiny
