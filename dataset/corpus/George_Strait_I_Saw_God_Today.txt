I just walked down the street to the coffee shop  
Had to take a break  
I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight  
I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk  
Pushing up through the concrete  
Like it was planted right there for me to see  
The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns  
All seemed to fade away  
In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08  
I saw God today  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been to church  
I've read the book  
I know He's here, but I don't look  
Near as often as I should  
Yeah, I know I should  
His fingerprints are everywhere  
I'd just slow down to stop and stare  
Opened my eyes and man I swear  
I saw God today  
  
I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands  
Man, she had that glow  
Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show  
It stood there for a minute takin' the sky  
Lost in that sunset  
A splash of amber melted in the shades of red  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass  
She's sleeping like a rock  
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks  
She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes  
My brand new baby girl  
She's a miracle  
I saw God today
