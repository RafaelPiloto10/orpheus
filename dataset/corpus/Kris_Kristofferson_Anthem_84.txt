If you're looking for a fighter who'll defend you  
And love you for your freedom. I'm your man.  
And I ain't gonna leave you for the crazy things you're doing  
But don't ask me to lend a helping hand.  
You were such a pretty dream as I remember  
You were young and strong and God was on your side.  
But vision slowly faded like the wonder from your eyes  
And you traded your compassion for your pride.  
  
But I still believe in all that we believed in.  
And I pray to God that you will in the end.  
And you'll see the golden chances that you're wasting.  
And be the loving beauty that you can.  
But I still believe in all that we believed in.  
And I pray to God that you will in the end.  
And you'll see the golden chances that you're wasting.  
And be the loving beauty that you can.
