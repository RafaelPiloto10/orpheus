A cockroach in the concrete, courthouse tan and beady eyes.  
A slouch with fallen arches, purging truths into great lies.  
A little man with a big eraser, changing history  
Procedures that he's programmed to, all he hears and sees.  
  
Altering the facts and figures, events and every issue.  
Make a person disappear, and no one will ever miss you.  
  
Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was.  
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws.  
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules.  
Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools.  
  
You say you've got the answers, well who asked you anyway?  
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way?  
Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come.  
I believe my kingdom will come.  
  
F is for fighting, R is for red,  
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed.  
E, we elect them, E, we eject them,  
In the land of the free, and the home of the brave.  
D, for your dying, O, your overture,  
M, they will cover your grave with manure.  
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me,  
As long as there's a P.M.R.C.  
  
F is for fighting, R is for red,  
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed.  
E, we elect them, E, we eject them,  
In the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
D, for your dying, O, your overture,  
M is for money and you know what that cures.  
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me,  
As long as there's a P.M.R.C.  
  
Put your hand right up my shirt,  
Pull the strings that make me work,  
Jaws will part, words fall out,  
like a fish with hook in mouth.  
  
Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was.  
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws.  
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules.  
Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools.  
  
I'm not a fish  
I'm a man  
Hook in mouth
