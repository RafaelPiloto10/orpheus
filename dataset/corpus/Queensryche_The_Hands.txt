When I'm lost... I find a way.  
I hear voices. Feel them surround me,  
Pull me from the edge.  
I close my eyes and....  
And my luck keeps holding strong,  
Even when that boot comes down.  
Waiting for the revolution but there's no one around except the  
... Hands out of nowhere, saving me again  
There's always something there watching out for me,  
If I'm suffocating, it gives me air.  
Finally now I remember,  
But where I'm going now, I'm not sure.  
Only one thing matters much to me anymore.  
I'm looking for you.  
Can you imagine? You can't think.  
You won't find a way this time to frighten me.  
You're running scared now, always looking  
Over your shoulder for a place  
Where you don't see my face.  
When my luck keeps holding so strong,  
Even with the state I'm in.  
I'm like a revolution of one, even when I stumble I win.  
Because there's hands out of nowhere, saving me again.  
There's always something there, watching out for me.  
When I'm suffocating, it gives me air.  
I'm like a cat with only a few lives left,  
Running from the shadows.  
Watching my back waiting for the attack that I know is  
Coming... I feel it's near.
