You want to explain, that's why you called  
Save your breath it doesn't matter at all,  
Not now, my friend  
  
You played your cards, and you made your choice  
I don't want to listen to your voice,  
Not now, my friend  
  
I've found a new part to play in life  
There's different actors on my stage  
I'll set the pace in a world without you  
I don't want to hear the things that you say  
''cause my life is over with you  
  
Now you know what's on my mind  
Don't call again ''cause you will find  
I won't be here  
  
You chose your path to walk along  
Now I can sing a different song  
I hope that's clear  
  
[Chorus]  
I've found a new part to play in life  
There's different actors on my stage  
  
Good bye, my love, and don't feel sad  
Just because I'm feeling glad  
That you're not here  
  
You'll go your way and I'll go mine  
Maybe we'll meet some other time  
Goodbye, my love  
  
[Chorus]
