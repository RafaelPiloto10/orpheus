Poor me, I'm floating out to sea  
An opportunity that went by  
Poor you, oh what you gonna do  
No what you gonna do, you just cry  
  
Oh, you always come undone  
Try into the sun, you don't know why  
Poor you, I know what you gonna do  
Come on love i'll see it through, I don't know why  
  
I hear you come nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand  
I hear you come nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand  
  
Poor me, now float me out to sea  
Oh no just let it be, come on try  
Poor you, oh what you gonna do  
Oh what you gonna do, you just cry  
  
I hear you come nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand  
I hear you come nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand  
  
I don't understand  
I don't understand  
  
Oooh, ahhhh, ahhhh
