Hands above, put your hands up highhh oh ay  
When you rock on... Clap on ayyayoaii  
Lets's... Until it's over, bring your body closer,  
One more shot and it's over ayaaayyoa  
Put your hands above, put your hands up high  
See you cut up in the night light  
And everything about you is without...  
Oh baby yeah your body so you can dance with me  
So we're gonna party like  
  
The best about your beauty is to build for me the reason  
The rest of your body is my black brown ready for recess  
And I can tell you got your hair... Bitches hate em and... Nothing  
But the hair flew, I'm impressed about your body going all in  
Just like a saying all shit, a house hold name  
You're the bad and the love got me higher than addicts  
I'll dress you in the best the money can buy  
And money came by love was shit I'ma try  
I'll be... And anything you ask for, baby girl yeah I hope you get your
passport.  
  
Chorus:  
Hands above, put your hands up highhh oh ay  
When you rock on... Clap on ayyayoaii  
Lets's... Until it's over, bring your body closer,  
One more shot and it's over ayaaayyoa  
Put your hands above, put your hands up high  
See you cut up in the night light  
And everything about you is without...  
Oh baby yeah your body so you can dance with me  
So we're gonna party like
