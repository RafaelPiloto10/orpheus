At last my love has come along  
My lonely days are over, and life is like a song  
Oh yeah yeah at last the skies above are blue  
My heart was wrapped up in clover, the night I looked at you  
  
I found a dream, that I can speak to  
A dream that I, can call my own  
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
Oh yeah yeah, you smiled you smiled and then the spell was cast  
And here we are, in Heaven  
For you are mine at last  
  
I found a dream, that I could speak to  
A dream that I, can call my own  
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
Oh yeah you smiled you smiled oh and then the spell was cast  
And here we are, in Heaven  
For you are mine at last at last, at last
