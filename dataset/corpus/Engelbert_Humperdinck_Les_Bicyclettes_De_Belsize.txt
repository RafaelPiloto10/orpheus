Turning and turning  
The world goes on.  
We can't change it, my friend.  
Let us go riding all through the days,  
Together to the end, to the end.  
  
Les bicyclettes de Belsize  
Carry us side by side  
And hand in hand we will ride,  
Over Belsize.  
Turn your magical eyes.  
Round and around,  
Looking at all we found.  
Carry us through the skies,  
Les bicyclettes de Belsize.  
  
Spinning and spinning,  
The dreams I know,  
Rolling on through my head.  
Let us enjoy them, before they go.  
Come the dawn, they all are dead.  
Yes, they're dead.  
  
Les bicyclettes de Belsize  
Carry us side by side  
And hand in hand we will ride  
Over Belsize.  
Turn your magical eyes.  
Round and around,  
Looking at all we found.  
Carry us through the skies,  
Les bicyclettes de Belsize.
