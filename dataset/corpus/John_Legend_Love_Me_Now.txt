[Verse 1]  
Pulling me further, further than I've been before  
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core  
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars  
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours  
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
[Post-Chorus]  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, I want you to love me now  
  
[Verse 2]  
Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed  
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no  
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to
good  
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall
apart  
  
[Chorus]  
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?  
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
And I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh  
Love me now  
Love me now, love me now  
Love me now  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright  
Let's make the most of every moment tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh  
Love me now, love me now  
Love you now  
Oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh, oh
