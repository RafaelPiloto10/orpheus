Here it is again  
Friday night  
Everyone is laughing  
Carrying on  
  
Going out  
Having a ball  
But I stay at home  
Waiting by a phone that never rings  
  
Surrounded by memories and all your things  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
'Til my tears run dry  
I know that you're out  
Having fun  
  
Cheatin' on me  
Telling pretty lies  
Making her promises now  
You don't think of me  
  
You don't care about what's happening here  
Every time you kiss her I cry a tear  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
'Til my tears run dry  
You don't think of me  
  
You don't care about what's happening here  
Every time you kiss her I cry a tear  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
'Til my tears run dry  
Yes I yes I'm gonna cry
