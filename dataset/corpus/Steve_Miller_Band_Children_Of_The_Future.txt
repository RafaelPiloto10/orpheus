We are children of the future  
Wonder where this world is going to, going to  
We are children of the future  
Wonder what in this world we are going to do, going to do  
When they get high  
They can see for miles and miles  
When I get high  
I can see myself for miles  
You know I've got something that you can use  
It takes a little bit of lovin'  
A little bit of huggin'  
A little bit of lovin'  
A little bit of huggin  
And if you don't think that you can find  
And if you don't think that it's peace of mind
