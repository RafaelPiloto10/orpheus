When you walk  
Do you take the short way home  
Call you up  
Does it sound like you're alone  
Dressin' up  
Are you lookin' good for me  
Dancin' close  
Are your eyes where they should be  
I can feel it comin' over me (comin' over me)  
Somebody help me  
Jealousy  
When you sleep  
Do you see me in your dreams  
Feelin' high (high) high  
Do I always see the steam  
I'm afraid it's taken hold of me (takin' hold of me)  
Somebody help me  
Jealousy  
(Aaaahhhh oohh)  
Your constant assurance  
Don't want your mystery  
I'm guessing, please tell me  
I'm goin' crazy over you and you and me  
When you talk  
Are you mentioning my name  
Cheryl Plate  
Are you willing to explain  
Hate to have you prove it constantly  
Jealousy  
Jealousy  
You and me  
(Ahh) jealousy  
Jealousy yeah  
(Jealous)jealousy  
Jealousy  
Jealous, jealousy  
Yeah ah  
Jealousy
