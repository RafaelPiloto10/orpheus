Lyrics: Leah Goldberg  
Music: Achinoam Nini  
  
Transliteration:  
Et eloah raiti bekafeh.  
Hu nitgalah li be'ashan sigariyot.  
Neche ruach, mistaleach verafeh  
Ramaz li: "od efshar lichyot!"  
  
Hu lo hayah yafeh ke'ahuvi:  
Karov mimenu - ve'umlal,  
Ketsel shakuf shel or hakochavim  
Hu lo mile et hechalal.  
  
Leor shkiah chiver ve'adamdam,  
Kemitvadeh al chet lifney moto,  
Yarad lematah lenashek ragley adam  
Ulevakesh et slichato.  
  
Translation:  
I ran into God in a small cafe  
Through cigarette smoke he appeared to me  
Apologetic and blaze  
He said: life is still worth living (you'll see)  
  
He didn't look anything like my lover  
Dejected, slightly out of place  
Like shadows of constellation  
He could hardly fill up space  
  
But in the reddish twilight, hurried  
To confess before the fall  
Kiss the feet of all man-kind  
And beg forgiveness of us all
