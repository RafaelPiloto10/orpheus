I awoke this morning  
Love laid me down by a river.  
Drifting I turned on upstream  
Bound for my forgiver.  
In the giving of my eyes to see your face.  
Sound did silence me  
Leaving no trace.  
I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories.  
Beg to hear your wonderous stories.  
  
He spoke of lands not far  
Or lands they were in his mind.  
Of fusion captured high  
Where reason captured his time.  
In no time at all he took me to the gate.  
In haste I quickly checked the time.  
If I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories.  
Had to hear your wonderous stories.  
  
Hearing  
Hearing  
Hearing your wonderous stories.  
Hearing your wonderous stories.  
It is no lie I can see deeply into the future.  
Imagine everything  
You're close  
And were you there to stand  
So cautiously at first and then so high.  
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky.  
I bid it to return  
To hear your wonderous stories.  
Return to hear your wonderous stories.  
  
Hearing,  
Hearing,  
Hearing,  
Hearing,  
Hearing,
