You're not the kind of guy  
That make the girls all sigh  
And they never turn their heads  
And look when you walk by  
  
But baby that's okay I love you anyway  
And I never change or rearrange you  
So stay that way  
  
Cause it's the little things that mean a lot  
It's what you are not what you got  
Call my name and I'll come running  
Look at me and the clouds start sunning  
Hold my hand and you got me going  
Kiss my lips and my mind starts going  
We got a thing that won't stop cooking  
You turn me on just by looking  
You can make me strong just by sighing  
You can break my heart just by crying  
  
You're not the smartest man that I ever met  
And every word you ever said I won't forget  
And so I guess that's why until the day I die  
When you're bad and make me sad  
You're still my guy
