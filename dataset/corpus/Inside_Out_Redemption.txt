Lost at a game, so easy to play  
I lost my faith, I lost my stride  
How can this be, I fought so desperately  
Was too afraid to show what I had inside  
  
But I believe in redemption  
And I believe in redemption  
And I believe in redemption  
  
Children of the street wander so helplessly  
Who will pay for their suffering?  
We've got the power to set them free,  
Yet still, we do nothing, nothing  
  
But I believe in redemption.  
And I believe in redemption.  
And I believe in redemption.  
I believe!  
  
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go  
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go  
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go  
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go (x2)  
  
Redemption!
