Waste my time running in circles  
Waste my time going bad on the vine  
I spent the last year walking through the fire  
Now I do believe it's my turn to shine  
(Now it's my turn to shine)  
  
Waste my time walking in rythym  
Waste my time talking in rhyme  
I spent the last year in a Mexican freefall  
I do believe it's my turn to climb  
  
I used to think I was born to know trouble  
I used to think I was a born-again clown  
I used to think I had everybody guessing  
I looked like I was flying high when I was falling down  
  
Now I am taller than I used to be  
Now I am living again  
Now I like where I have found myself  
This is where I want to be now  
  
Now this is where I want to be  
Now this is where I want to be  
Now this is where I want to be  
  
I was falling free in Mexico  
Living on those taco bars and sweet sunshine  
Learning how to walk again in my own skin  
Learning the art of losing my mind  
  
I used to think I was born in a hurricane  
I used to think I was jumping jack flash  
I used to think I was a victim of circumstance  
Beating up on everyone all the time  
I should have been kicking myself  
In my own ass  
  
Now I don't worry about the future much  
Now I don't think about the past  
Now I'm learning how to laugh again  
This is where I want to be now  
  
Now I'm tired of the drama club  
Now I'm sick with all the hate  
Yeah, it's been one hell of a hard year  
This is where I want to be now  
This is where I want to be now  
I want to be now
