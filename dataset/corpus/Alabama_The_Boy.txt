He stays up at night till way after dark  
Feeding the dog that lives in our yard  
He'll put on my shoes and stumble around  
But together we can catch any outlaw in town  
The boy tries to be just like me  
I'm all that he tries to be  
Watching cartoons on my knee  
Mamma's little man and me  
He wants to know how this and that goes  
He'll play all day on a mountain of clay  
And he'll fight with me to show that he's strong  
But if he gets hurt it's mamma he wants  
The boy tries to be just like me  
I'm all that he tries to be  
Watching cartoons on my knee  
It's mamma's little man and me  
Some day I know he'll leave us alone  
Break mamma's heart I'll try to be strong  
But if I shed a tear I hope he won't see  
The big man is him and the boy is me  
The boy tried to be just like me  
He's all that I try to be  
Now I'm watching cartoons on my knees  
And mamma's little man is me  
Let's go to bed mamma
