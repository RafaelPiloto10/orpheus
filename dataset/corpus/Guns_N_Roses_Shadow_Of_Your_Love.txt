Took my chances carelessly  
choked on my own cigarette  
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby  
but you ain't seen the worst yet  
  
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun  
and the woman who is dead  
who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one  
  
And I ain't standing, never standing  
in the shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
  
Wrote my changes helplessly  
yeah but I got no regrets  
Money it was on the table  
so I booked with all the bets  
  
Living like a lemon ain't so hot  
and you ain't my idea  
of one high-rollin' shot  
  
No I ain't standing, never standing  
[Chorus]  
Big dark clouds hanging over your head  
hope you've heard, baby all I've said  
You've been told, what I've said  
No use crying, you're as good as dead  
  
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun  
and the woman who is dead, who is out alright  
now I'm not the only one  
  
And I ain't standing, never standing  
[Chorus]
