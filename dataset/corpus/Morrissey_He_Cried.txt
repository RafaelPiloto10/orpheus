I need you  
Simple words  
But words which had never been heard  
By the soul  
Stoned to death  
But still living  
And so he froze where he stood  
And he looked to the ground  
And he cried  
He cried  
  
Ride our minds  
If you must  
But there's always a line you don't cross  
Time is short  
Don't be cruel  
Oh you don't know the power  
In what you're saying  
Oh...  
And so he froze where he stood  
And he looked to the ground  
And he cried  
He cried  
  
People where  
I come from  
They survive without feelings or blood  
I never could  
Was stoned to death  
But I'm still living  
So he froze where he stood  
And he looked to the ground  
And he cried  
He cried  
  
So he froze  
And he looked, and he looked  
To the ground  
And he cried  
He cried
