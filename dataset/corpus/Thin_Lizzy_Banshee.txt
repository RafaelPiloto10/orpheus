I was your lover  
You were my queen  
You broke my heart  
I gave up everything  
  
I was your friend  
But you were my foe  
I told you that  
I could not let you go  
  
At night I hear the wind calling  
"Oh come back my darling"  
Oh banshee! oh banshee!  
It keeps on calling me, keeps on calling me  
  
We dance the night away  
Oh we dance the night away  
  
I won your heart  
You took my soul  
I love you then  
But you left me cold  
  
I was your lover  
You were my queen  
You broke my heart  
I gave up everything  
  
At night I can hear you calling  
"Oh come back my darling"  
Oh banshee! Oh banshee!  
I hear you calling me, I hear you calling me
