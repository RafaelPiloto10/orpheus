Check into horror hotel  
This place is creepy and it's somber too  
And a little vampira wrapped on my neck, said  
Say something, say something  
You want to start something with me  
  
Well, take it up to room 21  
Where all the creatures gonna have their fun  
And underworld dangers and underworld scum  
Take it up to room 21  
  
And down the hall with my vampire girlfriend  
Say something, say something  
You want to start something with me, here at  
  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
It's up to me  
  
Gather round the place of the demon whore  
And my girl in room 21  
Well, underworld dangers and underworld scum  
Take it up to room 21  
  
Down the hall with my vampire girlfriend  
Say something, say something  
You want to start something with me here at  
  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
It's up to me when it comes down to necking with girls  
  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
It's up to me
