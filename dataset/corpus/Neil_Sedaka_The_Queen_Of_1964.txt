Anyone who's played on a record date  
will remember stage door Jenny,  
Well I saw her last night  
and man she looked like she wasn't gettin' any  
Oh - Rock 'n' roll kind of took its toll  
when she shed her inhibitions,  
Too many scenes in limousines  
and dressing room intermissions.  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four  
But the truth of the matter is  
nobody wants her any more.  
There was a time she could have shown them how,  
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.  
  
When it came to a superstar,  
Jenny was a bragger,  
She spread it around to everyone in town  
that she made it with Mick Jagger  
Oh - but there's no doubt, when the truth comes out,  
true love will always conquer,  
She didn't get Mick, but she got a kick  
and a black eye from Bianca.  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four,  
What a pity she became a shadow of the girl she was before.  
She passed her prime, it seems a shame somehow,  
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.  
  
Dwee da da da dwee da da da dwee da da da da,  
Dwee da da da da da da , dwee da da da da.  
Dwee da da da da da da da da, da da da da da,  
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.  
  
I'm afraid that this morning's trade  
had a sad obituary,  
There'll be no more Jenny at the door,  
They took her to the cemetery  
Just an autograph book and a stereo,  
there was no one she was close to,  
She was found with her arms around an Elvis Presley poster.  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four,  
Tonight there'll be a moment of silence at the Troubador.  
There was a time she could have shown 'em how,  
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now,  
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.  
  
Dwee da da da dwee da da da dwee da da da da,  
De de de de da da da da da da da da da da da da.  
Papa oom a mow mow, oom mow mow mow,  
Papa oom a mow mow, oom mow mow mow,  
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
