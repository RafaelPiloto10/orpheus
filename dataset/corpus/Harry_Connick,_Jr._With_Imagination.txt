I've travelled many a mile  
And I haven't found a home  
I've travelled many a mile  
And one seed's unsown  
I'll travel another mile  
'til I finally find my own  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
I started with a dream  
But came to a decision  
I started with a dream  
But now I have a mission  
I have a goal  
To see beyond my vision  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
I've got to be strong [shannon]  
To climb the next hill  
I've got to be strong [russell]  
My fate to fulfill  
And from a strength [leroy]  
Stronger than my will  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
In my father's house  
No harsh words are spoken  
In my father's house  
No vows are broken  
In a holy place  
My sould like beams oaken  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
When weary is your world  
Go and spin another  
When weary is your world  
There's heaven to discover  
Here on earth  
We're sister and brother  
With imagination  
We'll get there  
  
And if I stand alone  
To my cause I'm loyal  
If I stand alone  
Either common or royal  
I'm not afraid  
To cross their sea of toil  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
With imagination  
I'll get there
