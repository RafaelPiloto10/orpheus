It?s not that I think you would know  
I just don?t feel  
All the things I do for you  
Baby, that?s the clue that I am true  
It?s just unspoken but I mean it, yeah yeah  
But if you look into my eyes  
You?ll see what?s inside  
I won?t have to say it  
REFRAIN  
All the things that you wanna hear from me  
And all the things that you want me to say it  
Baby, say it  
CHORUS  
Well, if you wanna hear me say it  
That I want you  
I would say it a hundred times a day  
Till your heart will drown away  
Just tell me, do I have to  
It?s not that I?m too shy to say  
?Bout the words that come out my way  
All the tears that you shed  
I guess I have to pay for if I can only see  
[Repeat REFRAIN]  
[Repeat CHORUS]  
[Repeat REFRAIN]  
CHORUS  
Well, if you wanna hear me say it  
That I want you, I need you, I love you  
A hundred times a day (I would say it, I would say it)  
Till your heart will drown away (I would say it, yeah yeah)  
Just tell me (I wanna say it)  
(Yes, I?m going to say it)  
Do I have to (I will say it)
