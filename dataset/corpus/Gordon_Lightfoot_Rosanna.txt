Rosanna makes my day begin  
With kisses for a king  
And coffee on a silver tray  
She sees the shape I'm in  
And if she should ever break away  
I'd follow close behind her  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna  
Rules my heart  
  
Rosanna knows the times I keep  
A fire softly glows  
And the shadows lick the walls  
She knows when I'm asleep  
The dinner's served at eight o'clock on time  
And all is well by nine  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna  
Rules my heart  
  
Rosanna moves across the floor  
Her perfume fills the air  
As she walks beside my easy chair  
I touch her hand once more  
And I may never sleep again  
I like the bag she put me in  
  
Rosanna knows the ways of a man  
But not the way I feel  
I don't really care what happens now  
It's catch me if you can  
For no matter what occasion should arise  
She likes to sympathize  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
Rules my heart
