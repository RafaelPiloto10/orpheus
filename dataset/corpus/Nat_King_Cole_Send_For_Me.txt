When you want  
A true lover  
Send for me...send for me!  
You'll never want  
Any other  
Send for me...send for me!  
I promise you  
I'll be true  
Send for me...send for me!  
  
Anytime just tell me  
Your problems  
And you'll find out, baby, I'll solve 'em.  
If you're late one mornin',  
Don't hurry.  
If you've got big trouble,  
Don't worry.  
Just depend  
On your friend  
Send for me...send for me!  
  
A-mornin', noon and night,  
In the early bright,  
Don't you fret, my pretty pet  
I'm gonna treat you right.  
  
Don't you dare  
Raise a hair,  
I'm gonna share  
Your every care.  
Anywhere,  
Oh, yeah  
Send for me...I'll be there!  
  
(Interlude)  
  
Anything  
That upsets you  
Send for me...send for me!  
I'll be there  
To protect you  
Wait and see...wait and see!  
Don't delay  
Right away  
Send for me...send for me.  
  
It's gonna be  
Twiddle-deee  
Yes sirree  
You and me  
Faithfully  
Send for me  
  
(Ad-lib to fade)
