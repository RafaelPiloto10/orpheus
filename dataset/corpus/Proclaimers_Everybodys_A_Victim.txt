Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A  
  
I demand recompense  
For sitting on the fence  
Throughout my adult life  
You've got to put my parents in jail  
For raising me in Fife  
It doesn't matter what I do  
You have to say it's alright  
And I need you to send somebody around  
To tuck me in at night  
Because  
  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the USA  
  
Well it's not my fault  
That I'm positive  
I just stuck a needle in my arm  
And nobody told me  
That sixty a day  
Would do me any harm  
My liver's shriveling like a leaf  
But it's not the whiskey that do's it  
Call me irresponsible  
And I'm really going to lose it  
Because  
  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the USA  
  
Wear a ribbon for this  
Hug a stranger for that  
Light a candle to the dead  
And soon you'll forget  
That you ever had  
A brain inside our head  
We value everythin' the same  
We turn it into farce  
So we don't know a crisis  
'Till it kicks us up the are  
Because  
  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A
