Another summer day  
Has come and gone away  
In Paris and Rome  
But I wanna go home  
Mm  
  
Maybe surrounded by  
A million people I  
Still feel all alone,  
I just want to go home  
Oh I miss you, you know  
And I've been keeping all the letters  
That I wrote to you  
Each one a line or two  
I'm fine baby how are you  
Well I would send them but, I know that it's it's just not enough  
The words were cold and flat  
And you deserve more, than that  
  
Another airplane  
Another sunny place  
I'm lucky, I know  
But I wanna go home  
I've got to go home  
Let me go home  
I'm just too far  
From where you are  
I gotta come home  
Let me come home  
I've had my run  
Baby I'm done  
I wanna come home  
  
And I feel just like, I'm living  
Someone else's life  
It's like I just stepped outside  
When everything was going right  
And I know just why you could not come along with me  
'Cause this was not your dream  
But you always believed in me  
  
Another winter day, has come and gone away  
In either Paris and Rome  
And I wanna go home  
I miss you, you know  
Let me go home  
I've had my run  
Baby I'm done  
I wanna go home  
Let me go home  
  
It'll all be alright  
I'll be home tonight  
I'm coming back home
