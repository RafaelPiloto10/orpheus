Like a bird that's lost its mate in flight I'm alone and oh so blue tonight  
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea may you never be alone like me  
[ piano ]  
I believed the lies you told to me when you whispered dear I worship Thee  
Now here am I alone and blue all because I loved no one but you  
I gave up my friends I left my home when you promised to be mine alone  
Now you're gone our love could never be may you never be alone like me  
[ fiddle ]  
In the Bible God's own words to say for every wrong someday you'll pay  
I pray the Lord to set me free may you never be alone like me
