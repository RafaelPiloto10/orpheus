Some people are very hard to shake awake  
Some things are hard to define  
Some lazy people've got haze on the brain  
No motivation vacations holidays  
You say you want to change the world upside down  
  
Gotta go all the way  
Start today  
It's up to you to get it right  
Gotta try gotta try  
  
It's up to you to get things started  
It's up to you no no not half hearted  
Take each and every day as if it is your last  
It's up to you you've things to do  
It's up to you  
  
Some have an attitude of fool all the rest  
Take it all have a ball don't accept second best  
So Hollywood but it's really anywhere  
I've got a feeling it's something in the air  
It's much the same across the worls all around  
It won't change much without our feet on the ground  
  
Gotta go all the way  
Start today  
It's up to you to get it right  
Gotta try gotta try  
  
It's up to you to get things started  
It's up to you no no not half hearted  
Take each and every day as if it is your last  
It's up to you you've things to do  
It's up to you  
  
Hands off attitude  
What's that gonna prove  
If you pass the test  
Don't look back  
Settle for the best forget all the rest  
Take it all have a ball  
You deserve the best  
  
It's up to you to get things started  
It's up to you no no not half hearted  
Take each and every day as if it is your last
