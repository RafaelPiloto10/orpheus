Father they have written  
On the point of no return  
Soldiers they will come and  
Oh they're coming to burn  
(I said) Oh boy, we need your hope to live  
Oh boy, you have so much to give  
Oh boy, don't let it get you down  
  
Who, baby, who will save the world ? (it's not too late)  
Who, baby, who will save the world ? (all heroes hesitate)  
I'm too young to die  
I'm too young to die  
  
Father, I've been looking  
Through a rainbow of tears  
Found yourself so lonely  
Oh they're drowning in my fear  
(I said) Oh boy, I'm old enough to know  
Oh boy, that it hurts to grow  
Oh boy, don't let it get you down
