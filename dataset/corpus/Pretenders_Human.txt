I play a good game  
But not as good as you  
I can be a little cold  
But you can be so cruel  
I'm not made of brick  
I'm not made of stone  
But I had you fooled enough to take me on  
If love was a war  
It's you who has won  
While I was confessing it  
You held your tongue  
Now the damage is done  
  
Well there's blood in these veins  
And I cry when in pain  
I'm only human on the inside  
And if looks could deceive  
Make it hard to believe  
I'm only human on the inside  
  
I thought you'd come through  
I thought you'd come clean  
You were the best thing, I should never have seen  
But you go to extremes  
You push me too far  
Then you keep going til you break my heart  
Yeah, you break my heart  
  
See I bleed and I bruise  
Oh, but what's it to you  
I'm only human on the inside  
And if looks could deceive  
Make it hard to believe  
I'm only human on the inside  
I crash and I burn  
Maybe someday you'll learn  
I'm only human on the inside  
I stumble I fall  
Baby, under it all  
I'm only human on the inside
