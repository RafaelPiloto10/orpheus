Took a while to drag me out of bed,  
Aim some coffee at my head,  
Saw the clock I'm running late,  
It's an ordinary day.  
And I'm like a dog on head,  
Knock one out and then fall asleep,  
It's sad but true,  
I'd rather be with you.  
Don't you forget about me,  
When you're a celebrity,  
It will be only you and me before too long.  
So little time so much to do,  
I'd rather spend my days with you.  
So little time so much to do,  
I'd like to spend one day with you.  
And if that day is not enough,  
Maybe we can stay in touch,  
But I'm not making plans for tomorrow,  
For tomorrow nevre comes.  
Said I've been celibate for years,  
Not out of chance there's no-one here,  
See I can't get my end away,  
Another ordinary day,  
And I'd love to see a little more of you,  
Your clothes would look better on my bedroom floor...bedroom floor.  
Don't you forget about me,  
When you're a celebrity,  
I know you're busy,  
But we all need somebody - before too long.  
It's in your eyes, oooooh...
