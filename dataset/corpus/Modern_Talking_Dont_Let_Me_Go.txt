A lonely avenue, it's raining in my heart  
No name, no number girl, how can I try a start without you?  
I'm as lonely as a cloud, oh, when your love falls down  
You make the sun keep shining, oh, when you're just around  
And whenever will be, I promise your love, forever my love  
  
Don't let me go, little darling  
Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling  
That I'm so in love with you  
Don't let him know, little darling  
Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling  
That I'll never let you go  
We're flying high and flying low  
Oh, babe there's one thing you should know  
I'll never ever let you go  
  
And when the sun goes down, my world is in your hands  
On silver clouds we'll fly, just to the rainbow's end, you and I  
Only my shadow knows, love is on my side  
I'll fly around the moon, only to hold you tight  
And whatever will be, I promise your love, forever my love
