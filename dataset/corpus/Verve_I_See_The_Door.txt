Light...I see the light  
You're there on my floor  
You're there on my floor  
Fly...angel fly  
You're out of sight  
You're out of sight  
She came in a dream, Lord  
No way to describe it,  
It was in my head  
I burn but I don't scream  
No way to describe it,  
It is in my head  
I have seen things that I can't explain  
Looking in through that window pane  
Open your eyes and let me in  
Don't go to think that I don't care  
So...I see the door  
I see the door  
I see the door  
It came in a dream, Lord  
No way to describe it,  
It was in my head  
What's life without a scream, lover?  
No way to describe it,  
It was in my head  
I have seen things that I can't explain  
Looking through windows, feeling the same  
I have seen moments I'd like to share  
Scared that you don't want me there,  
My lover  
Scared that you don't want me there,  
My lover  
(It's a battle, it's a battle...)
