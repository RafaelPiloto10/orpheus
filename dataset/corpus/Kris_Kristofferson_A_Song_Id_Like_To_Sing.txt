There's a song I'd like to sing  
Do you know the song I mean?  
It don't always sound the same  
But it's always good to sing  
  
Maybe it don't mean a thing  
It's a pretty little tune  
It's a song I'd like to sing  
And I'd love to sing with you  
  
And we can get to know each other  
Like a sister and a brother  
Like a father and a mother  
Like a woman and a man  
  
We can sing along together  
Just enjoying till it's over  
It don't need to last forever  
If we want it to, it can
