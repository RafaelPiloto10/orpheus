Standing at the machine every day for all my life  
I'm used to do it and I need it  
It's the only thing I want  
It's just a rush, push, cash  
  
Standing at the machine every day for all my life  
I'm used to do it and I need it  
It's the only thing I want  
It's just a rush, push, cash  
  
Rush, push, rush, push, rush, push, rush, push  
Standing at the machine every day for all my life  
I'm used to do it and I need it  
It's the only thing I want
