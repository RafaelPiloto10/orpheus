Oh it's cryin' time again  
You're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'  
That it won't be before it's cryin' time  
  
Now they say that absence makes  
The heart grow fonder  
And that tears are only rain to make love grow  
Well my love for you can never grow more stronger  
If I live to be a hundred years old  
  
Oh it's cryin' time again  
You're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'  
That it won't be love before it's cryin' time  
  
Now you say you've foiund someone that you love better  
That the way it happens every time to old  
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow  
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door  
  
Oh it's cryin' time again  
You're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'  
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time  
  
Yeah, it won't be long before it's cryin' time
