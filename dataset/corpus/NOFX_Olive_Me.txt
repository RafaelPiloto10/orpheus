All of me, why not take all  
Can't you see I'm no good without you?  
Take these arms, I want to lose them  
Take these lips, I'll never use them  
Your goodbye left me with eyes  
How can I go on to without you?  
You took the best so why not take the rest?  
Why not take all of me?  
All of me, why not take all of me  
Can't you see I'm no good without you?  
Take these arms, I want to lose them  
Take these lips, I'll never use them  
Your goodbye left me with eyes to cry  
How can I go on to without  
You took a part that once was my hart.  
Why not take all of me?
