Sent to a world cold as steel  
Don't know where else I have been  
Where will I go? - I can't tell  
Who would save us if we fell  
Can you feel what I see?  
In blind faith would you believe?  
Don't share my point of view  
But it may mean a lot to you  
  
Tell me will we remember  
How it used to be?  
Will it be the same  
In a time in the future?  
Will there be a different way  
Can one ever say?  
  
Anthem for a distant world  
We'll all be alike  
Be there 'til eternity  
One will see  
When salvation comes our way  
  
All my life I was sure  
Kept my thoughts clean, real and pure  
Just as I will always know  
Were down here to learn and grow  
I am my own entity  
And the world is there for free  
Keeps me alive 'til that day  
When my soul will find the way  
  
In another dimension  
You may find paradise  
We'll be safe and warm  
I've been told there will be everyone  
I held so close and near  
There will be no fear  
  
Anthem for a distant world  
We'll be all alike  
Be there 'til eternity  
One will see  
When salvation comes our way  
  
Anthem for a distant world  
We'll be all alike  
Be there 'til eternity  
One will see  
When salvation comes  
When salvation comes  
When salvation comes our way
