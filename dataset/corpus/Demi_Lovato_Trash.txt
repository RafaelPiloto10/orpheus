Don't try to cover up your, your new flame  
That's seething through your eyes.  
I can see it from 10 feet away and I know  
Just who is burning.  
With every kiss you deny  
So what makes you think, that I  
Still care or still want you anymore  
  
So how long has this been  
Going on and one more thing tell me  
Was she the reason you stomped on my heart  
And moved on so quickly  
  
You can call it pure torture  
Watching your every move with her  
Oh, just the thought of it,  
Knowing what goes on between you  
Makes me sick  
I should've noticed, I should've noticed  
When she came into the picture  
You were always with her  
And she's not leaving.  
  
So how long has this been  
Going on and one more thing tell me  
Was she the reason you stomped on my heart  
And moved on so quickly  
  
You called me shady  
And now she's your baby doll  
She drove you over,  
Over to break it off  
And this time just maybe  
Maybe you went a little far  
I'm sick of crying about,  
About your new flame  
That's soon to burn out.  
  
So how long has this been  
Going on and one more thing tell me  
Was she the reason you stomped on my heart  
And moved on so quickly  
  
I'm done.
