Love on the rocks  
Ain't no surprise  
Pour me a drink  
And I'll tell you some lies  
Got nothin' to lose  
So you just sing the blues all the time  
  
Gave you my heart  
Gave you my soul  
You left me alone here  
With nothing to hold  
Yesterday's gone  
Now all I want is a smile  
  
First, they say they want you  
How they really need you  
Suddenly you find you're out there  
Walking in a storm  
When they know they have you  
Then they really have you  
Nothing you can do or say  
You've got to leave, just get away  
We all know the song  
  
You need what you need  
You can say what you want  
Not much you can do  
When the feeling is gone  
May be blue skies above  
But it's cold when you love's on the rocks  
  
First, they say they want you  
How they really need you  
Suddenly you find you're out there  
Walking in a storm  
When they know they have you  
Then they really have you  
Nothing you can do or say  
You've got to leave, just get away  
We all know the song  
  
Love on the rocks  
Ain't no surprise  
Pour me a drink  
And I'll tell you some lies  
Yesterday's gone  
And now all I want is a smile
