My hands are cold  
My body's numb  
I'm still in shock  
What have you done  
My head is pounding  
My vision's blurred  
Your mouth is moving  
I don't hear a word  
  
And it hurts so bad  
That I search my skin  
For the entry point  
When love went in  
And ricocheted  
And bounced around  
And left a hole when you walked out yeah  
  
I'm falling through the doors of the emergency room  
Can anybody help me with these exit wounds  
I don't know how much more love, this heart can lose  
And I'm dying, dying from these exit wounds  
Wounds, when they're leaving, the scars you're keeping  
Exit wounds, when they're leaving, the scars you're keeping  
  
Marks a battle  
Still feel raw  
A million pieces of me  
On the floor  
I'm damaged goods  
For all to see  
Now who would ever want to be with me  
  
I've got all the baggage  
Drink the pills  
Yeah this is living but without the will  
I'm blacking out  
I'm shutting down  
You've left a hole  
When you walked out yeah  
  
I'm falling through the doors of the emergency room  
Can anybody help me with these exit wounds  
I don't know how much more love this, heart can lose  
And I'm dying, dying from these exit wounds  
Wounds, when they're leaving, the scars you're keeping  
Exit wounds  
When they're leaving, the scars you're keeping yeah  
  
Lose your clothes and show your scars  
That's who you are  
Lose your clothes and show your scars  
That's who you are  
Lose your clothes and show your scars  
That's who you are  
Lose your clothes and show your scars  
  
Marks a battle  
Still feel raw  
A million pieces of me  
On the floor  
  
I'm falling through the doors of the emergency room  
Can anybody help me with these exit wounds  
I don't know how much more love this, heart can lose  
And I'm dying, dying from these exit wounds  
Wounds, when they're leaving, the scars you're keeping  
Exit wounds  
When they're leaving, the scars you're keeping
