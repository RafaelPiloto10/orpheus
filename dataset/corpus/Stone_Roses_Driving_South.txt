Driving south 'round midnight, man, I must have been insane  
Driving south 'round midnight in a howling hurricane  
I stopped for an old man hitcher at a lonely old crossroad  
He said "I'm going nowhere  
I'm only here to see if I can steal your soul"  
  
"I'm not trying to make you, I don't want to touch your skin  
I know all there is to know about you and all your sins  
Well, you ain't too young or pretty, and yer sure as hell can't sing  
Any time you want to sell your soul  
I've got a toll-free number you can ring"  
  
Yeah, that's what I thought he said anyway  
  
"I'm not trying to make you, I don't want to touch your skin  
I know all there is to know about you and all your sins  
Well, you ain't too young or pretty, and yer sure as hell can't sing  
Any time you want to sell your soul  
I've got a toll-free number you can ring"  
  
0 800 treble six, oh yeah  
0 800 treble six, oh yeah  
  
I stopped for an old man hitcher at a lonely old crossroads  
He said "I'm going nowhere  
I'm only here to see if I can steal your soul"  
He got!
