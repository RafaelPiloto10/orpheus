[Verse 1]  
Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm wrong  
I could've spoken sooner than I should've  
Only the good die old  
That's what they told me, but I don't know  
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself  
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to  
The things that I've been told  
Wait for the colors to turn to gold  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Do you know? Do you know?  
You're all I know You're all I know  
That everything is crashing down  
You're all I know You're all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm ready for the fall  
I'm ready for everything  
That I believed in to drift away  
ready for the leaves  
I'm ready for the colors to  
burn to gold and crumble away  
  
[Verse 2]  
Maybe I'm destined to be distraught  
Always a reason  
Breaking me down to my knees  
In the dead of night  
I keep on praying to see the light  
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself  
Maybe I'm thinking i should just  
keep to the things that I've been told  
wait for the colors to turn to gold  
  
[Pre-Chorus]X2  
Do you know? Do you know?  
You're all I know You're all I know  
That everything is crashing down  
You're all I know You're all I know  
  
I'm ready for the fall  
I'm ready for everything  
That I believed in to drift away  
I'm ready for the leaves  
I'm ready for the colors to  
burn to gold and crumble away  
  
X7  
You are the one, you are the one  
You are the one who helped me see  
You are the one, you are the one  
I am giving all of me  
  
[Outro]  
I'm ready for the fall  
I'm ready for the leaves  
I'm ready for the colors to  
Burn to gold and crumble away
