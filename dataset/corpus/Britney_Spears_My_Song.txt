All my people over here  
(All my people over here)  
All my people over there  
(All my people over there  
Grab a partner. ..  
And dance!  
  
Dance  
Dance  
  
I've had a feeling to fight for so long  
It kept going on like an awful song  
All my friends, they say "Just get over him"  
Up 'till now that's been so hard  
But see I been watching you  
I'd like you to teach me the way you move  
Been down for so long  
But now I'm up. ..  
And on the floor!  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Just grab somebody  
And move your body  
Don't gotta be naughty  
Just turn out the party  
If you're feeling somebody  
Gotta work your body  
Gotta twerk your body  
And they'll notice you  
  
[Chorus:]  
This is my jam, this is my song  
Gonna dance to my song all night long  
Gotta have some fun  
Dance until the sun  
There's people to be won  
Gonna have some fun  
This is my jam, this is my song  
Gonna dance to my song all night long  
Gotta have some fun  
Dance until the sun  
There's people to be won  
Gonna have some fun  
  
Now we've been dancing for a little bit  
But I'd like to get to know you  
You seem just right  
You're out of sight  
You're Mr. Right  
Let's talk some more  
  
(Repeat Pre-Chorus)  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
You're Mr. Right  
You're outta sight  
You seem just right  
My emotions won't fight  
I wanted to party  
I grabbed somebody  
I grabbed the right one  
I grabbed you!  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Repeat Pre-Chorus)  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
They'll notice you  
They'll notice you  
Don't pay no dues  
They'll notice you
