Ev'ry night I watch the lights from the house upon the hill  
I love a little girl who lives up there and I guess I always will  
But I don't dare knock upon her door, 'cause her daddy is my boss man  
So I got to try to be content, to see her whenever I can, goin'  
Chorus:  
Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks  
People put me down, 'cause that's the side of town I was born in  
I love her, she loves me, but I don't fit in her society  
Lord have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks  
But I need money, honey, give me money, honey  
Money, honey, (I need enough) money, honey  
I'll take it to the bank, I'll take it all down, just say it to me, oh man  
chorus  
One fine day I'll find a way to move from this old shack  
I'll hold my head up like a king and I never will look back  
Until that day I'll work and slave, and I'll save every dime  
But tonight she'll have to steal away to see me one more time, goin'  
chorus repeats 2x  
Lord have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks  
Mama have mercy on a boy from down in the - ooh  
Have mercy baby, a little mercy, hang around all day, take me  
Down in the boondocks, da-da-down in the boondocks (repeats out)
