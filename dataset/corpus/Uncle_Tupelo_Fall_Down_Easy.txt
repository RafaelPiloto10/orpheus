Disengaged, we're forsaken now communication does suffer  
The moral stare of Big Brother  
Not a chance, no compromise  
Battling the barrier of belief  
Not to try anymore  
  
Don't want to murder the only memory or hide  
Try to accept that it's all worth whilewhen you've been disengaged  
Severed from any world that's mine  
  
You can hang the blame on the wall  
It'll be a frame around us all deluged by stickers and billboards  
The conversation turns to war  
Never thought it would come down to this it seems every person for themself  
  
Don't want to murder the only memory or hide  
Try to accept that it's all worth while when you've been disengaged  
Severed and forsaken  
When you've been disengaged  
Severed from any world that's mine  
  
More and more makes a hunger for less  
You get hurt when you touch the bright lights burningwhen you're high  
You can fall down easy  
  
Too many years spent trigger-happy  
At times I feel betrayed  
I feel that I've been wronged  
Suspended in all disbelief  
Until it seems it just can't go on
