It's darker than the dark bottom  
Rumbles more than the Rumba  
If you think that the two steps got 'em  
  
Just take a look at this number  
It's got that certain swing  
That makes you wanna sing  
  
Don't go left, but be polite  
Move to the right  
Doing the reactionary  
  
Close your eyes, to where you're bound  
And you'll be found  
Doing the reactionary  
  
All the best dictators do it  
Millionaires keep steppin' to it  
The four hundred love to sing it  
Ford and Morgan swing it  
  
Hand up high and shake your head  
You'll soon see red  
Doing the reactionary  
  
Don't go left, but be polite  
Move to the right  
Doing the reactionary  
  
Close your eyes, to where you're bound  
And you'll be found  
Doing the reactionary  
  
All the best dictators do it  
Millionaires keep steppin' to it  
The four hundred love to sing it  
Ford and Morgan swing it  
  
Hand up high and shake your head  
You'll soon see red  
Doing the reac'  
Doing the reactionary  
  
So get in it, begin it  
It's smart, oh, so very  
To do the reactionary
