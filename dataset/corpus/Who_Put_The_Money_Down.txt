I got lost in the back streets, trying to get here tonight,  
The police were asking questions, they took me to the wrong place twice.  
I even lost my passport, and I forgot my name and town,  
But now I'm here by the water, put the money down.  
  
Before I walk on the water,  
Put the money down, down, down,  
There are bands killing chickens,  
My hero's getting pushed around, 'round, 'round.  
  
I don't know if I trust you as you try to shoot me down,  
Before I walk on the water,  
Put the money down, down, down,  
Put the money down.  
  
It was a beautiful day in Columbus when the fences fell  
But the five loaves and the fishes ain't going to be much help,  
I got a hungry juggler here who wants to be at the head,  
Before he walks the water he wants his bread.  
  
Take a glass of that light brown ale and a purple pill,  
If the air don't get you too sure as hell the pill will,  
Oh, mommy, mommy, please may I go downtown?  
  
He's gonna walk on the water,  
Put the money down,  
Put it down, before I walk on the water,  
Put the money down, down, down.  
  
There are bands killing chickens,  
My hero's getting pushed around, round, round,  
  
I don't know if I trust you as you try to shoot me down,  
I'm gonna walk on the water,  
Put the money down, down, down, down, down,  
Put the money down.  
In a tin cup.
