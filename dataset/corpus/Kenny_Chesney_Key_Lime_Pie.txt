Big straw hat, banana drink  
I can't remember what it is I think  
And my, my, my - my key lime pie  
  
Ocean breeze, tire swing  
Coconut fall if you shake that thing  
And my, my, my - my key lime pie  
  
Not too tart, not too sweet  
My baby loves to watch me eat  
Her key lime pie  
Her key lime pie  
  
Tall green tree, yellow bird  
Bikini bottom and a tie-dyed shirt  
And my, my, my - my key lime pie  
  
Big white sail, red sunset  
Lobster tail and don't forget  
My, my, my - my key lime pie  
  
A six string, ten shots  
Of Cruzan rum, hey, I like it a lot  
With my, my, my - my key lime pie  
  
Tortola, a full moon  
Shining down on a blue lagoon  
And my, my, my - my key lime pie  
  
Not too tart, not too sweet  
My baby loves to watch me eat  
Her key lime pie  
Her key lime pie  
  
We got Ginger and Mary Ann  
Cookin' up a real good tan  
And my, my, my - my key lime pie  
  
Key lime pie, key lime pie  
Key lime pie, my my my  
My, my, my key lime pie  
Key lime pie, key lime pie  
My, my, my key lime pie
