There was nothing missing, it was just a case of foolishness  
Girl, I must've been crazy  
Something I would just as soon forget  
I can only say I'm sorry and leave it up to you to say the rest  
  
[Chorus]  
If you want to go, girl, I won't stand in your way  
But I'll stand by you if you decide you want to stay  
Baby, don't you see  
Doesn't have to be forever or goodbye  
All I'm asking for is one more try  
  
I'm the one who hurt you, still I know the pain you're going through  
And even if you show forgiveness, there may be too much damage to undo  
I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My heart and soul are searching  
Trying to find a way  
To bring your love back to me  
  
Still I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you  
  
[Chorus]
