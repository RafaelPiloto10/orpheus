The record man said'don't let it go to your head,I'm gonna make you a star'  
If you've got it,use it,but don't abuse it,gave me money from an old fruit jar  
To exercise my delight,I went out that night and shook the town the way I knew  
How  
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now  
Six months later I'm a cool operator,and I know my way around  
The record man sighed,he really tried,but he couldn't get it off the ground  
But that don't bother me now 'cause I've got a friend who's gotta friend who  
Really knows how  
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now  
Still hanging on,still hanging on,hang on  
I met this real live walking,self-styled,self-assured,slow talking bore  
I thought I'd play him along,give him a song,to keep the doom dust away from  
My door  
But I didn't do what he wanted me to,but it didn't seem to matter somehow  
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now  
Still hanging on,still hanging on,hang on  
Six months later I'm a part time waiter,but that didn't last long  
I stretched and squeezed at words I'd never heard to write a song  
And when it finally came,it sounded the same as a tune I'd heard before  
Somehow  
But mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now  
Still hanging on.still hanging on
