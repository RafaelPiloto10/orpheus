Four o'clock in the morning  
When the ambulance arrived  
Four o'clock in the morning  
When the ambulance arrived  
Blue light was flashing  
As they lay my baby down inside  
They took her to the hospital  
In the darkest hour of the night  
They took her to the hospital  
In the darkest hour of the night  
It was silent as the grave  
As my baby lay beneath the light  
They turned on the gas and cut her open  
She didn't feel no pain  
They turned on the gas and cut her open  
She didn't feel no more pain  
Daylight was breaking  
And down came the rain  
Down came the rain  
Down came the rain  
Down came the rain  
Down came the rain  
Down came the rain
