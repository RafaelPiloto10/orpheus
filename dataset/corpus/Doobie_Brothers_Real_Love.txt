Darlin', I know I'm just another head on your pillow  
If only just tonight, girl, let me hear you lie just a little  
Tell me I'm the only man that you ever really loved  
Honey, take me back in my memory place  
When it was all very right, so very nice, so very nice  
Here, darlin', stands another bandit wanting you  
In and out your life, they come and they go  
Your days and nights like a wheel that turns  
Grindin' down a secret part of you  
Deep inside your heart, that nobody knows  
  
When you say comfort me to anyone who approaches  
Chalkin' up the hurt, you live and you learn  
Well, we've both lived long enough to know  
That we'd trade it all right now for just one minute of real love, real love
