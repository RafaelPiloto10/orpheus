Run  
(Run for cover)  
For for cover  
Don't shoot!  
Shoot!  
She's so dangerous  
(Shotgun!)  
(Gun!)  
(Don't shoot shotgun!)  
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right  
Fallin' head over heals at the speed of light  
Hey little miss heaven on earth  
Whoa, won't you walk this way but I see a red alert  
Oh, my senses say keep away  
So don't shoot!  
Don't shoot shotgun  
Dream on nightmare  
Touch 'n' go  
Dove turned destroyer, she cut you up, she's a slave of love  
Run for cover, she's so dangerous  
Undercover, she's so shameless  
Don't shoot shotgun  
You got me bitin' my lip  
Don't shoot shotgun!  
Ya shootin' straight from the hip  
So don't shoot shotgun  
Shoot me, baby!  
Ow!  
Hit 'n' miss, flesh and blood  
She's sweet and indiscreet, she can't get enough  
A little midnight madness  
Oh baby, you can't hide  
So wild 'n' unpredictable  
Step aside  
'cause you're, you're shooting wide  
Run for cover, she's so dangerous  
Undercover, she's so shameless  
Don't shoot shotgun  
You got me bitin' my lip  
Don't shoot shotgun!  
Ya shootin' straight from the hip  
Oh  
Shake it, shake it!  
Ah, take this, little hit 'n' miss  
Oh  
Don't shoot shotgun  
You got me bitin' my lip  
Don't shoot shotgun!  
Ya shootin' straight from the hip  
Don't shoot it!  
Don't shoot shotgun!  
Shake it, shake it!  
Aw, take this little hit 'n' miss  
Ow!  
(Don't shoot! Shotgun!)  
Oh shoot it!  
Don't shoot it!  
Uh, Oh shotgun!  
Shoot me, baby!  
Ow!  
Let it blow!
