Just in time, I found you just in time  
Before you came my time was running low  
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed  
My bridges all were crossed, no where to go  
Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going  
  
No more doubt or fears I've found my way  
For love came just in time  
You found me just in time  
And changed my lonely life that lucky day  
  
Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going  
No more doubt or fears I've found my way  
For love came just in time  
You found me just in time  
And changed my lonely life that lucky day
