Had a thought that you might be coming home  
Made myself up while I was alone  
You said one thing and now it's a shame  
That you're leaving without anything  
To say  
You believed that the stars come from the left  
I have something you might need to know the rest  
You believe  
It's okay  
Everybody's just looking out north  
For that one dream that comes every night  
In your smile there are many a ways to cut  
Your pain  
Uh-huh
