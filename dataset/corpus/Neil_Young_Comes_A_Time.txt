Comes a time when you're driftin'  
Comes a time when you settle down  
Comes a light, feelin's liftin'  
Lift that baby right up off the ground  
  
Whoa, this old world keeps spinnin' round  
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down  
There comes a time  
  
You and I, we were captured  
We took our souls and we flew away  
We were right, we were giving  
That's how we kept what we gave away
