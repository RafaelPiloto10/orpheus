Got This Thing On The Move  
  
Come on over to my side, it's where you want to' be.  
Come on over to joy ride, and let your morals be.  
Ain't no way to deny it, if it's in your soul.  
You don't know 'till you try it, baby, let the good times roll.  
  
Let me taste your life. Let me fill your stream.  
Let me make you feel it right now, just lay back and dream.  
Got this thing on the move, it's beginin'.  
Got a strange kind of feeling, under my skin.  
  
I hear my baby knockin', at my front door.  
She knows what I got, she wants some more.  
And when it's all over, I start to come down.  
Think of the restin' place, I'll leave the ground
