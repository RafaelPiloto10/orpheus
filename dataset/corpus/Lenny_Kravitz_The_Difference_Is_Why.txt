I'm just a human  
I never said I was god  
And each day I wonder where you are  
How could our lives once be so together  
Now we're apart  
I know we can make it  
But where do we start?  
Sometimes the scales get unbalanced  
Don't you know the reason why?  
  
The difference is why  
The difference is why  
  
You say you can't trust me  
Have you tried?  
You say you don't love me  
That's a lie  
There are so many so many rainbows  
That we were to climb  
But baby baby why can't we survive?  
We've got to get our heads untangled  
And free our state of mind  
  
The difference is why  
The difference is why  
  
Sometimes the scales get unbalanced  
Don't you know the reason why?  
  
The difference is why  
The difference is why  
Does this have to mean goodbye?
