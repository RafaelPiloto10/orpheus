He was an accident waiting to happen  
Most accidents happen at home  
Maybe he should have gone out more often  
Maybe he should have answered the phone  
  
Hip-shakin' shoutin' in gold lame  
That's how he earned his regal sobriquet  
Then he threw it all away  
For a porcelain monkey  
  
He threw it away for a porcelain monkey  
Gave it all up for a figureine  
He traded it in for a night in Las Vegas  
And his face of velveteen  
  
From a shotgun shack singing Pentacostal hymns  
Through the wrought iron gate to the TV room  
He had a little world, it was smaller than your hand  
It's a rockabilly ride from the glitter to the gloom  
  
Left behind by the latest trends  
Eatin' friend chicking with his regicidal friends  
That's how the story ends  
With a porcelain monkey  
  
He threw it away for a porcelain monkey  
Gave it all up for a figureine  
He traded it in for a night in Las Vegas  
And his face of velveteen  
  
Hip-shakin' shoutin' in gold lame  
That's how he earned his regal sobriquet  
Then he threw it all away  
For a porcelain monkey  
  
He threw it away for a porcelain monkey  
Gave it all up for a figureine  
He traded it in for a night in Las Vegas  
And his face of velveteen
