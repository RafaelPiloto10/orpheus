I can't help it when you're near me  
I don't think straight, I get all confused  
I just lose all my concentration  
With no question at all I'd surrender to you  
Standing here so close together  
I can feel all the magic again  
But I'm holding back the emotion  
Couldn't take anymore of the heartache and pain  
I know I should take it slow but,  
The minute I see you I just let go  
Chorus :  
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
I'm leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
It's a gamble, can we take it  
Playing safe is no way to survive  
There's a chance for us, we can make it  
Give our love room to breathe to keep it alive  
Admit that we made mistakes but  
I know in my heart that it's not too late  
Chorus :  
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
I'm leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
It feels like I'm falling in love with you all over again  
And I'm trying not to let it show  
But the minute I see you I just let go  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control
