Living room, passing time, talking trash, sipping wine,  
I need something more substantial.  
New deck of playing cards, I don't like to work this hard,  
I think I'll have to cancel.  
  
I'm running out of time,  
I'm about to lose my mind.  
I got the six,  
gimme your nine.  
  
Slow hand on the clock, I'm sitting here like a rock,  
I'm feeling so abnormal.  
Pictures in the magazines, all my thoughts are so obscene.  
Cover up that centerfold.  
  
I'm running out of time,  
I'm about to lose my mind.  
I got the six,  
gimme your nine.  
  
Look at this, what a pair, she won't let me touch her there,  
she's so discriminating.  
This is weird, it's time to blow, I just heard the rooster crow.  
I guess I'll have to spank my monkey.  
  
I'm running out of time,  
I'm about to lose my mind.  
I got the six,  
gimme your nine.
