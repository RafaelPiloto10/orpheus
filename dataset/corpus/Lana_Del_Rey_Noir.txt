Walking is an art, so is my body  
Papi is a workaholic, I'm his little party  
  
I'm Miss Parlor-Tricks, sips above the 'cardi  
I can make you dope, sick from the naughtiness  
He says '"who's the best?" You is!  
  
I'm glamorous famous  
Notorious dangerous but you're crazy  
  
I'm gonna leave you  
He said ''you're not a real girl  
You're like a cartoon  
All caught up in this fame game  
Yo, good luck, good luck, good luck  
May all the stars in the sky  
Bow down to you, we're through"  
  
You gotta be smart and I'm a little smarty  
Papi is a gangsta, I'm his little dolly  
  
Party favor favorite of them all  
He says "baby Dolly's so sick"  
Sick off your naughtiness  
  
Let's go to Vegas  
He say "who's the best?"  
He said ''she is, she is but, yo  
She crazy like in every single way  
Like a hurricane www.eliterics.com  
You gotta get out of the way  
But she's hot, and she's cold  
And she's cool and she's bold  
And she's full of rage like me  
And I like the game, yo"  
  
Cause I'm glamorous I'm famous  
Notorious dangerous but I'm crazy, yo  
Glamorous dangerous  
Notorious but famous but I'm crazy  
  
He's gonna hate me  
He wants a real girl  
I'm like a cartoon  
All caught up in this fame game  
Yo, good luck, good luck  
He said ''we're through"
