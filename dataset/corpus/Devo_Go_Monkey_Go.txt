I'm wound tight  
Hot-wired  
About to explode  
  
I'm seein' red  
All hopped up  
And ready to go  
  
I'm hurtin' and I'm searchin' for a place  
Where I can deliver  
  
I want to scoot so fast that my head snaps  
Back together  
It's OK, not OK, it's OK, not OK, it's ok  
It's OK, not OK, it's OK, not OK, it's ok  
Go monkey go  
MoJo JoJo  
Go monkey go  
MoJo JoJo  
Go Monkey go  
MoJo JoJo  
  
Tell me tell me where to go  
Tell me tell me where to go  
  
There's nothing I can do  
To fix what's wrong with me!
