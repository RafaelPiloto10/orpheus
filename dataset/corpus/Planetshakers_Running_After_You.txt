Your Word is a light unto my path  
Your Love guides me through my darkest night  
And even though sometimes Your ways  
I cannot understand  
Ill never walk away because my futures  
In Your hands  
I don't care what people will say  
I'm running after You  
I wont turn back and go their way  
Coz I'm running after You  
Yeah I'm running after You  
I'm running after You  
(I will run to You)  
I don't care what people will say  
I'm running after You  
I wont turn back and go their way  
Coz I'm running after You  
Don't matter what may come my way  
I'm running after you  
Its You I'm following today  
I'm running after You  
I'm running after You
