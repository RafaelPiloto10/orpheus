Done the things I said I would  
Some of them were pretty good  
Suddenly they changed the game  
I only know it's not the same no more  
I don't know what to do the rules I knew  
  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue  
  
The life I live is pretty nice  
Of course I had to pay a price  
Lots of folks depend on me  
Crazy kind of slavery, what for  
I don't know what to do the rules I knew  
  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue  
  
Sometimes I want to walk away  
I felt like that just yesterday  
But then this song is in my head  
I try my best 'till I'm dead and gone  
I don't know what to do the rules I knew  
  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue
