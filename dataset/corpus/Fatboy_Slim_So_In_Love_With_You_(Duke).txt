Woman... I can't live,  
Live without you in my life.  
Woman... I need you  
Keep my mind, ??? Ised  
  
Chorus: No matter what I say or do,  
So in love with you.  
No matter what I say or do,  
So in love with you.  
  
People... Don't understand  
That my heart is in your hand,  
And we know this.  
  
When I'm in your arms,  
I am free  
  
Chorus  
  
People everywhere,  
You don't understand,  
What you're missing.  
People everywhere,  
Stop for a minute and listen.  
If you find love  
If you find love, hang on  
  
Chorus  
Na, na, na...
