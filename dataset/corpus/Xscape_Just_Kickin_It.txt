Every man wants a woman where him an her can just go hang.  
Just the two of them alone, kick back, doing their own thang.  
And every man wants a woman that can always keep him in the mood.  
And I'm in that kind of girl so this is what I tell my dude:  
  
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,  
party on down to the XS-CAPE beat.  
Just kick it, just kick it.  
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,  
party on down to the XS-CAPE beat.  
Just kick it, just kick it, just kick it.  
  
Every man wants a woman  
That can cook him up a good meal  
A woman he can treat like his homie  
And take her out on the Ave. and just chill  
Every man wants a woman  
That ain't good for just lying on her back  
And I'm that kind of woman  
So before me and my man get in the sack:  
  
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,  
party on down to the XS-CAPE beat.  
Just kick it, just kick it.  
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,  
party on down to the XS-CAPE beat.  
Just kick it, just kick it, just kick it.  
kick off your shoes and relax your feet,  
party on down to the XS-CAPE beat.  
Just kick it, just kick it, just kick it.
