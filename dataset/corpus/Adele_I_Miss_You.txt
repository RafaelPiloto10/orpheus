[Verse 1]  
I want every single piece of you  
I want your heaven and your oceans too  
Treat me soft but touch me cruel  
I wanna teach you things you never knew, ooh baby  
Bring the floor up to my knees  
Let me fall into your gravity  
Then kiss me back to life to see  
Your body standing over me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Verse 2]  
I love the way your body moves  
Towards me from across the room  
Brushing past my every groove  
No one has me like you do  
Baby, bring your heart, I'll bring my soul  
But be delicate with my ego  
I wanna step into your great unknown  
With you and me setting the tone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Bridge]  
We play so dirty in the dark  
Cause we are living worlds apart  
It only makes it harder, baby  
It only makes it harder, baby  
Harder baby, harder baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Outro]  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you
