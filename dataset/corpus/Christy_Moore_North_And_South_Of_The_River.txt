I want to reach out over the lough  
And feel your hand across the water  
Walk with you along an unapproved road  
Not looking over my shoulder  
I want to see  
I want to hear  
To understand your fears  
But we're north and south of the river  
  
I've been doing it wrong  
All of my life  
This holy town has turned me over  
A young man running from what he didn't understand  
As the wind from the lough just blew colder and colder  
  
There was a badness that had its way  
But love was not lost  
It just got mislaid  
North and south of the river  
  
Can we stop playing these old tattoos?  
Darling I don't have the answer  
I want to meet you where you are  
I don't need you to surrender  
There is no feeling so alone  
As when the one you're hurting is your own  
North and south of the river  
  
Some high ground is not worth taking  
Some connections are not worth making  
There's an old church bell no longer ringing  
And some old songs not worth singing  
  
North and south of the river  
North and south of the river
