I got the picture that you gave to me  
And it's signed with love, just like it used to be  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got the picture, he's got you  
  
I got the records that we used to share  
And they still sound the same, as when you were here  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got the records, he's got you  
  
I got your memory, or has it got me?  
I really don't know, but I know it won't let me be  
  
I got your class ring that proves you care  
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got these little things, he's got you  
  
I got your memory, or has it got me?  
I really don't know, but I know it won't let me be  
  
I got the picture that you gave to me  
And it's signed with love, just like it used to be  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got these little things, he's got you
