You never seem, seem to have the time to listen to what I say  
How can I know just what goes on in your mind if you always walk away  
So what's the good, what's the good of trying  
And hanging around you begging for your love  
When it seems there's someone else in your dreams  
And I can't be sure of you anymore  
  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Have you had too much of my love?  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Where is the love you once gave me?  
  
And when we meet, things are not the same now, you always hurry away  
And all the friends that once you used to share with me are ignored now, and
you're bored now  
I guess we are through, but still I go on hoping  
Because you never put it into words  
Can't you see you should be honest with me  
And I've got to find what is in your mind  
  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Have you had too much of my love?  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Where is the love you once gave me?  
  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Have you had too much of my love?  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Where is the love you once gave me?  
  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Have you had too much of my love?  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Where is the love you once gave me?
