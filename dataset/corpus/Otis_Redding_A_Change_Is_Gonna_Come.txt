I was born by a river, oh my  
In this little old town  
Just like this river  
I've been running ever since  
It's been alone  
  
Lord, I'm coming but I know, but I know  
That changes gotta come, now  
Oh yes it is, my oh my oh my oh my  
  
It's been too hard livin', oh my  
And I'm afraid to die  
I don't know what's up there  
Beyond the clouds  
It's been alone  
  
Lord I'm coming but I know, but I know  
That changes gotta come  
Oh yes it is, my oh my oh my  
  
There's a time  
I will go to my brother, oh my  
I would ask my brother  
Will you help me please, oh now oh now  
He turned me down  
And then I asked my little mother, oh my oh  
I said mother, I said mother  
I'm down on my knees  
  
It's been time that I go  
Lord it's too late  
Very long, oh now oh  
  
Somehow I thought I was still able  
To try to carry on  
It's been alone  
Lord I'm coming but I know  
That changes gonna come  
Oh yes it is  
  
Huh, just like I said  
I went to my little baby brother, oh my, my little brother  
I asked my brother, brother help me please, oh now  
He turned me down  
And then I go to my little mother, my dear mother, oh now, huh  
I said mother, I said mother I'm down on my knees  
  
But there was a time that I go  
Lord it's too late  
So very long, oh my oh  
Somehow I thought I was still able  
To try to carry on  
It's been alone  
Lord I'm coming but I know, but I know  
That changes gotta come, ou  
It's been so long, It's been so long  
A little too long  
But changes gotta come  
So tired, so tired of suffering  
Standing by myself  
Has given up a home  
But changes gotta come  
You know, you know that I know  
And I know that you know  
Honey, That a change is gonna come, oh now, oh my  
I gotta
