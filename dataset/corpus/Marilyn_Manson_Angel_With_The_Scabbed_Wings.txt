He is the angel with the scabbed wings  
Hard drug face want to powder his nose  
He will deflower the freshest crop  
Dry up all the wounds with his rock and roll sores  
Dead  
Is what he is he does what he please  
The things that he has you'll never want to see  
What you're never gonna be now  
Sketch a little keyhole for looking glass people  
You don't want to see him  
You only want to be him  
Mommy's got a scarecrow, gotta let the corn grow  
Man can't always reap what he sow  
"he is the maker"  
(he is the taker)  
"he is the saviour"  
(he is the raper)  
  
Get back you're never gonna leave him  
Get back you're always gonna please him
