I'm all alone in bed  
and I can't sleep, I'm feeling blue.  
I try to close my eyes  
but all I'm thinking of is you.  
Baby only you  
  
I cry my eyes out baby  
wondering what I have to do.  
I lookin' inside my heart  
and knows for sure this love is true!  
  
Day by day, heart to heart  
I hope that we will ever be together.  
Will it be me and you  
I dream that our love will last forever...  
  
Hold me tight in your arms  
I know we haven't straight this thing together.  
Walk with me  
hand in hand.  
I promise to be there forever.  
Forever.  
  
Day by day...  
  
Hold me tight..
