Look at me, now yeah  
You may think you see  
Who I really am,  
But you'll never know me.  
  
Everyday,  
It's as if I play  
A part.  
  
Now I see,  
If I wear a mask,  
I can fool the world,  
But I cannot fool my heart.  
  
Chorus:  
  
Who is that girl I see?  
Staring straight,  
Back at me.  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside?  
  
I am now,  
In a world  
Where I have to hide my heart,  
And what I believe in.  
  
But somehow,  
I will show the world what's inside my heart,  
And be loved for who I am.  
  
Who is that girl I see,  
Staring straight  
Back at me?  
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?  
  
Must I pretend that I'm  
Someone else  
For all time.  
When will my reflection show,  
Who I am inside?  
  
There's a heart that must be free  
To fly  
That burns with a need to know  
The reason why  
  
Why must we all conceal  
What we think  
How we feel?  
  
Must there be  
A secret me  
I'm forced to hide  
I won't pretend that I'm  
Someone else  
For all time.  
  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside?  
  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside?  
  
Oh, ooh yeah
