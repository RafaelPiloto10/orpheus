When it comes to giving you the best of me  
I don't know why, I don't know why  
I don't even have to try  
When it comes to holding true  
These words I say  
I look at you, one look at you  
How can I turn my head away  
  
With the sound of your voice  
Like the whispering wind  
Don't you know I'll be there  
When you call, anytime you call  
  
Chorus  
Maybe it's the power of love  
Maybe ya can feel it when you get enough  
Maybe it's the power of love  
I don't know  
  
When it comes to needing you  
I call your name  
And you'll be there, you'll be right there  
Shining through the pouring rain  
When it comes to seeing through  
The fool in me, the thing I found  
One thing I've found  
Lover, you never let me down  
  
When the sound of your voice  
Like the whispering wind  
Lets me know you'll be there  
When I call, anytime I call  
  
Chorus
