The clouds are really cheap  
The way I seen 'em through the forts  
Of which there is a half-a-dozen  
On the base of my resorts  
  
You wouldn't think I'd have too many  
Since I never cared for sports  
But I'm never really lonely  
In my Excentrifugul Forz  
  
There's always Korla Plankton  
Him and me can play the blues  
And then I'll watch him buff that  
Tiny ruby that he use  
  
He'll straighten up his turban  
And inject a little ooze  
Along a one-celled Hammond organsim  
Underneath my shoes  
  
And then I'll call pup tentacle  
I'll ask him how's his chin  
I'll find out how the future is  
Because that's where he's been  
  
His little feet got long and flexible  
And suckers fell right in  
The time he crossed the line  
From later on, to way back when
