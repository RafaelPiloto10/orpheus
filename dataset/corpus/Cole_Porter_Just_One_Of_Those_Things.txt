It was just one of those things  
Just one of those crazy flings  
One of those bells that now and then rings  
Just one of those things  
  
It was just one of those nights  
Just one of those fabulous flights  
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings  
Just one of those things  
  
If we'd thought a bit before the end of it  
When we started painting the town  
We'd have been aware that our love affair  
Was too hot not to cool down  
  
So good-bye, dear, and amen  
Here's hoping we meet now and then  
It was great fun  
But it was just one of those things
