A little white house  
It's everything we've  
Dreamed about  
I wanted you to know  
I'm hanging up my ego  
We shouldn't have to fight  
Or worry about the bills tonight  
I wanted you to know  
I want to be your shadow  
The mystery's gone  
So bring back the sun  
We'll bury this hate  
And build it with love  
The grass wasn't greener  
I found  
I wanted you to know  
I dug you up a rainbow  
I know, I know I failed you  
I hope, I hope we get to  
Sunny days again
