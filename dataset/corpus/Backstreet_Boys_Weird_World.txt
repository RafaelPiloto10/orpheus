(Weird world, weird world)  
Hey hey hey  
  
There's silence over the city but it's so noisy  
There is reason for looking up but I'm feeling down  
You see I've got to catch a plane, won't buy a ticket  
Cause it's hard to stop when you're spinning around  
  
It's a weird world don't you know it  
It's a weird world and it won't slow down  
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it  
  
Hey hey hey  
Sweet baby  
There's a way, just stand up and fight it  
Hey hey hey  
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love  
It's a weird world, yea  
  
Sent a message to a G.I. in the desert  
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn  
Back here it's her and me and we're having our first baby  
He's out there taking them on  
  
It's a weird world and I know you know it  
It's a weird world and it won't slow down  
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it  
  
Hey hey hey  
Sweet baby  
There's a way, just stand up and fight it  
Hey hey hey  
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love  
  
I'm closing my eyes but I'm starting to see  
While he's looking at you, she's looking at me  
The only thing he does is just keep me away from you  
'Cause you're part of this place  
But if I die, don't let them take away your beautiful smile  
Take away your beautiful smile  
Take away your beautiful smile  
  
Hey hey hey  
Sweet baby  
There's a way just stand up and fight it  
Hey hey hey sweet baby  
There's a way for you to decide it  
Hey hey hey  
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love  
  
(Hey hey hey)  
It's a weird world don't you know it?  
(Hey hey hey)  
It's a weird world don't you know it?  
(Hey hey hey)  
It's a weird world don't you know it?  
Hey hey hey
