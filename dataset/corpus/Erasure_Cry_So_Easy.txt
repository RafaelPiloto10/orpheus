Draw the line  
Don't want to waste my time  
On an unresponsive  
Kid like you  
Who made the effort  
You devil in disguise  
You just keep on trying  
To win affection with your smile  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(In the love that you're looking for)  
Say you'd never leave me  
But babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
  
Danger signs  
Opened up the eyes  
Of an unsuspecting  
Fool like me  
What about an effort  
What about tonight  
What's the use in trying  
When nothing's going right  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
Tears they don't come easy  
And babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(The kind love you never felt before)  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(In the love that you're looking for)  
Say you'd never leave me  
But babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
  
Can't you see  
That you're turning me  
Into a cold cold  
Kid like you  
Forget the effort  
Now you're not mine  
No more use in smiling  
It's time to say goodbye  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
Tears they don't come easy  
And babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(The kind love you never felt before)  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(In the love that you're looking for)  
Say you'd never leave me  
But babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
  
Say you'd never leave me  
Tears they don't come easy  
Baby please don't leave me  
Baby (in the love that you're looking for)  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(In the love that you're looking for)  
Say you'd never leave me  
But babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
Tears they don't come easy  
And babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(The kind love you never felt before)
