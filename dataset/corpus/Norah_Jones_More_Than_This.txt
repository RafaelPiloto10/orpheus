I could feel at the time  
There was no way of knowing  
Fallen leaves in the night  
Who can say where they're blowing  
As free as the wind  
And hopefully learning  
Why the sea on the tide  
Has no way of turning  
  
[Chorus]  
More than this  
There is nothing  
Oh more than this  
You tell me one thing  
More than this  
You know there's nothing  
  
It was fine for a while  
There was no way of knowing  
Like a dream in the night  
Who can say where we're going  
No cares in the world  
And baby I'm learning  
Why the sea on the tide  
It has no way of turning  
  
[Chorus]  
  
More than this  
You know there is nothing  
Much more than this  
You tell me one thing  
More than this  
There is nothing  
More than this
