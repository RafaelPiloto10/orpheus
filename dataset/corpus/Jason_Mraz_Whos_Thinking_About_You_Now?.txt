Who's thinking about you now?  
If you were building a wall, who would tear it all down and pull you through?  
Who's thinking about you?  
Who'd care enough to send you flowers, that you could call at all hours,  
And give your love to?  
Somebody must believe if they could see what I see  
If they haven't, well they will  
Baby they all will  
  
Just when you suspect that life couldn't get harder, something comes  
Along and makes your dark day darker  
The weight of it all falls on you  
Who will be the one to listen when it's time to listen?  
Who will be the one to miss you when you go missing?  
Well, I do.  
Do I qualify, qualify, qualify, qualify, qualify?  
I want to be the one to help you ignore Mr. Loneliness peeking his head  
Into your door.  
I'm hoping you can feel me.  
I'm hoping you can give me a new chance, chance, yes  
I'm hoping that you notice how you're blessed  
  
I feel like starting something.  
I feel like calling off the day to be with you.  
Yeah, I believe we all do something that's familiar like a deja vu,  
Familiar like a deja vu  
Yeah, I know you're smoking, I seen your fire, I know in love  
You've been giving it up  
So do I qualify, qualify, qualify, qualify, qualify?  
  
I want to be the one to help you move from Mr. Loneliness living in the  
Kitchen of your home.  
I'm hoping you can feel me.  
I'm hoping that I don't run out of breath, breath, yeah.  
  
When our two hands are linked together with an ampersands.  
It's my kind of diagram.  
When our sore eyes are lined up side by side  
Well, I'm a happy man  
Yes, I'm a happy man.  
  
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am  
I am thinking about you.
