City of tiny lites  
Don't you wanna go  
Hear the tiny auto horns  
When they tiny blow  
Tiny lightnin'  
In the storm  
Tiny blankets  
Gonna keep you warm  
Tiny pillows  
Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny sheets  
Talkin' bout the tiny cookies  
That the peoples eats  
Well city of tiny lites  
Maybe you should know  
That it's over there  
In the tiny dirt somewhere  
You can see it any time  
When you get the squints  
From your downers and your wine  
You're so big  
It's so tiny  
Every cloud is silver liney  
The great escape for all of you  
Tiny is as tiny do  
Tiny is as tiny do  
Tiny is as tiny do  
Tiny is as tiny do  
City of tiny lites  
Do-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-nt you wanna go  
Hear the tiny auto horns  
Whe-e-e-e-e-e-e-n they tiny blow  
Tiny, lightnin  
In the storm  
Tiny blankets  
Tiny blankets  
Are bound to keep you warm  
Tiny pillows  
Talkin' bout those tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny sheets  
Ooooo!  
Talkin' bout them tiny cookies  
That the peoples eats  
City of tiny lights  
May be you should know  
That's it's over there  
Well that is over there  
Say that it's over there  
Well it is over there
