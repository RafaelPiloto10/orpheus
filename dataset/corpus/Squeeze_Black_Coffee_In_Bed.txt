There's a stain on my notebook  
Where your coffee cup was  
And there's ash in the pages  
Now I've got myself lost  
I was writing to tell you  
That my feelings tonight  
Are a stain on my notebook  
That rings your goodbye  
With the way that you left me  
I can hardly contain  
The hurt and the anger  
And the joy of the pain  
Now knowing I am single  
They'll be fire in my eyes  
And a stain on my notebook  
For a new love tonight  
From the lips without passion  
To the lips with a kiss  
There's nothing of your love  
That I'll ever miss  
The stain on my notebook  
Remain all that's left  
Of the memory of late nights  
And coffee in bed  
Now she's gone  
And I'm back on the beat  
A stain on my notebook  
Says nothing to me  
Now she's gone  
And I'm out with a friend  
With lips full of passion  
And coffee in bed
