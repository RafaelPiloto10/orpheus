Remember, I will still be here  
As long as you hold me, in your memory  
  
Remember, when your dreams have ended  
Time can be transcended  
Just remember me  
  
I am the one star that keeps burning, so brightly,  
It is the last light, to fade into the rising sun  
  
I'm with you  
Whenever you tell, my story  
For I am all I've done  
  
Remember, I will still be here  
As long as you hold me, in your memory  
Remember me  
  
I am that warm voice in the cold wind, that whispers  
And if you listen, you'll hear me call across the sky  
  
As long as I still can reach out, and touch you  
Then I will never die  
  
Remember, I'll never leave you  
If you will only  
Remember me  
  
Remember me...  
  
Remember, I will still be here  
As long as you hold me  
In your memory  
  
Remember, when your dreams have ended  
Time can be transcended  
I live forever  
Remember me  
  
Remember me  
Remember... Me...
