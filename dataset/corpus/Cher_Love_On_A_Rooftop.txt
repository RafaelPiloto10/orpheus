We use to talk  
Delivered on a dime  
Now we live together  
Never find the time  
We use to walk  
As lovers on the sand  
Now we're working full time  
On our lifetime plan  
We never stop to see  
The moon at night  
We're just too busy  
Leading complicated lives  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember love on a rooftop  
We couldn't make our love stop  
We were giving all that we got  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember holding you so tight  
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
Love on a rooftop  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
  
Look at us now all grown up  
We got it all together  
Got it all sown up  
But is this all, it was leading to  
Do we just run out of dreams  
When all our dreams come true  
What ever happened  
To those endless nights  
When we were happy  
Living young and foolish lives  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember love on a rooftop  
We couldn't make our love stop  
We were giving all that we got  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember holding you so tight  
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
Love on a rooftop  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
  
We never stop to see  
The moon at night  
We're just too busy  
Leading complicated lives  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember love on a rooftop  
We couldn't make our love stop  
We were giving all that we got  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember holding you so tight  
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
Love on a rooftop  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
