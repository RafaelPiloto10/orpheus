The offered me the office, offered me the leadership  
They said I'd better take anything they'd got  
Do you want to make tea at the BBC?  
Do you want to be, do you really want to be a cop?  
  
Career opportunities are the ones that never knock  
Every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock  
Career opportunity, the ones that never knock  
  
I hate the army an' I hate the R.A.F.  
I don't want to go fighting in the tropical heat  
I hate the civil service rules  
And I won't open letter bombs for you  
  
Bus driver....ambulance man....ticket inspector  
  
They're gonna have to introduce conscription  
They're gonna have to take away my prescription  
If they want to get me making toys  
If they want to get me, well, I got no choice  
  
Careers  
Careers  
Careers  
  
Ain't never gonna knock
