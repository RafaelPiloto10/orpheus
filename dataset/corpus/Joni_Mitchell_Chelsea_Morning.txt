Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard  
Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words  
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells, and rapping up like pipes and drums  
  
Oh, won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes  
  
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw  
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall  
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon  
  
Oh, won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
There's a sun show every second  
  
Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today  
And the streets are paved with passersby  
And pigeons fly  
And papers lie  
Waiting to blow away  
  
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew  
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too  
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses  
Oh, won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll talk in present tenses  
  
When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away  
I will bring you incense owls by night  
By candlelight  
By jewel-light  
If only you will stay  
Pretty baby, won't you  
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning
