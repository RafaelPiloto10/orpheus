So I reach for it  
Stare in the darkness, stare in the doom  
My heart ba boom, ba boom, boom  
  
Stare in the darkness, and the defeat  
Come along when I'm finding no peace  
And I know, and I know, and I know  
I know I'm unlocked  
  
And I know, and I know, and I know  
I know what you got  
  
So I put my hands up to the sky  
Feeling life, got a rocket ship that I wanna ride  
Put my hands up to the sky and it's alright  
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure  
  
So I race for it  
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure  
So I race for it  
  
Stare in the darkness, stare in the doom  
You make my heart ba boom, ba boom, boom  
  
Superhero, masterpiece  
Been innocent but a sinner in me  
  
And I know, and I know, and I know  
I know I'm in love  
And I know, and I know, and I know  
I know when I'm lost  
  
I just put my hands up to the sky  
I'm feeling life, got a rocket ship that I wanna ride  
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling inside  
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure  
  
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright  
I got a rocket, eyes on the prize  
Put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna fly  
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure  
  
So I race for it  
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure  
So I race for it  
  
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure  
So I race for it  
And I know, and I know, and I know  
Know what I got  
  
X marks the spot  
  
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling life  
I got a rocket ship that I wanna ride  
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling inside  
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure  
  
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright  
I got a rocket, eyes on the prize  
Put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna fly  
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
