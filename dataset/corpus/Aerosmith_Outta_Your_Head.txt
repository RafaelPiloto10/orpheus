All the way back in a history  
How a girl thinks is a mystery  
We spend our lives cruisin' the bars  
The Venus girls and the men from mars  
So in all this time did you ever think  
Do the girl see red when the man sees pink  
And if your best lovin's in the past  
'Cuz you're somewhere slow is nowhere fast  
You're outta your head... yeah  
So outta your head... yeah  
Stay outta your head  
You better get with it  
'Cuz you're so without it  
You're outta your head... yeah  
So outta your head... yeah  
Stay outta your head  
(Somewhere somewhere underneath the rainbow)  
Aaar...bricka braka fiya kraka sis boom-bah  
Here's comes trouble in a push up bra  
Your style is sharp as carpet tack  
But you're out of your box and you're way off track  
You can moderate on a mental binge  
Your catastrophe's on a lunatic fringe  
It's good for the gander it's tit for tat  
You say it's all good but it's more than that  
You're outta your head... yeah  
So outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head
