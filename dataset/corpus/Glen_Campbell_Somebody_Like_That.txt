Well he can't be more than seventy  
She's not a day over sixty-five  
But they'd returned to a plane in forty-three  
And their fire's still burning bright  
  
They'll be found holdin' hands at the picture show  
Lookin' just like Juliet and Romeo  
The sad song won't steal the beat away  
They got a special kind of love that's here to stay  
  
See the romance on the port of sea  
Auburn hair grew a silver linin'  
There's something in their eyes  
You just don't see these days  
  
I wanna love somebody like that, I wanna hold on forever  
Two heart's become one with a love like that  
I wanna love somebody like that  
I wanna love somebody, yeah  
  
I was head over heels in junior high  
And it lasted a week or two  
When my heart was destroyed I cried and cried  
'Til I found me somebody new  
  
Life without a real love is tragedy  
That's why I'm gonna find a love that's right for me  
I've gotta look beyond what my eyes can see  
Until my dreams are reality  
  
There's gotta be more to fallin' in love  
Than fallin' away when the stayin' gets tough  
I want my love to be young  
When I'm old and gray  
  
I wanna love somebody like that, I wanna hold on forever  
Two heart's become one with a love like that  
I wanna love somebody like that  
I wanna love somebody, yeah  
  
I wanna love somebody like that, I wanna hold on forever  
Two heart's become one with a love like that  
I wanna love somebody like that  
I wanna love somebody  
I wanna love somebody like that
