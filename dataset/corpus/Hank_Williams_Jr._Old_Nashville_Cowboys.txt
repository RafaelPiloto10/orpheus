The old Nashville cowboy was burdened with time  
He was bent by his years and the fight with the wine  
With a head full of music and an old nursery rhyme  
A heart full of sadness and dark sunken nights  
He told me they cheated he told me they stole  
The strength from his youth and the songs from his soul  
He said he was family till he got too old  
And he called them miners mother load finders  
Digging so deep in search of more gold  
Oh where are the cowboys and the home on the range  
Does anyone know that they've killed Jesse James  
Now the good guys on TV seem bad ain't it strange  
And the old Nashville cowboys missed out on the change  
  
The old cowboy's life now is gone with the past  
Like whiskey he drank it all went out too fast  
He didn't know how to make each swallow last  
And the head waitress won't be back to fill up his glass  
Oh where are the cowboys and the home on the range  
Does anyone know that they've killed Jesse James  
Is anyone listening or is everyone blind  
And old Nashville cowboys will sing for a dime  
And hard times are cheap at the end of the line
