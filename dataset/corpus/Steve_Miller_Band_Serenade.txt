Did you see the lights  
As they fell all around you  
Did you hear the music  
Serenade from the stars  
  
Wake up, wake up  
Wake up and look around you  
We're lost in space  
And the time is our own  
  
Whoa, whoa  
I  
  
Did you feel the wind  
As it blew all around you  
Did you feel the love  
That was in the air  
  
Wake up, wake up  
Wake up and look around you  
We're lost in space  
And the time is our own  
  
Whoa, whoa  
I  
  
The sun comes up  
And it shines all around you  
You're lost in space  
And the earth is your own  
  
Whoa, whoa  
Whoa
