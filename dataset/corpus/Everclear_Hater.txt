Yeah live and let live motherfuckers,  
I'm a do me you do you. You're all a bunch of haters.  
  
Oh  
Oh  
  
I don't like the way that you talk to me  
When you tell me how it's gonna be  
And I don't like the way that you smile at me  
When you tell me what is wrong with me  
Sometimes I wish you would go away  
Go away and never ever come back  
I don't like the mean and vindictive things you do  
It makes me want to hate on you  
  
Yeah it's got me sad  
I'm kinda stressed  
You got me feeling anxious  
I'm always depressed  
And I don't want to play this game of tug of war  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore  
  
Oh  
  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore, anymore  
No  
No I don't wanna be with a hater  
You are such a hater  
  
I don't like the way that you never take the blame  
For absolutely anything  
And I don't like the way that you put me through hell  
For all those things you do yourself  
Sometimes I wish I could disappear  
Fade away into a happy new life  
I don't like the way that you're always telling lies  
You talk about me all the time  
  
I hear you talk  
You are such a bore  
I see the way you look  
I think you look like a witch  
I know you know  
I know the way you were before  
  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore  
Whoa, oh

Anymore

No I don't wanna play games, games, uh  
  
You're a hypocrite  
Yeah you lie to me  
You use what you don't understand  
You embarrass me  
Yeah you're beautiful  
In an ugly way  
Hey the sex  
Was never that good anyway  
  
It's got me down  
And I'm super stressed  
Been taking medication  
I'm always depressed  
I don't want to fight you in this tug of war  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore  
Whoa whoa  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore, anymore  
Whoa whoa
