You didn't have to love me like you did  
But you did, but you did.  
And I thank you.  
You didn't have to love me like you did  
But you did, but you did.  
And I thank you.  
But you took your love to someone else  
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death  
  
You made me feel like I've never felt  
Kisses so good I had to holler for help  
You didn't have to squeeze it but you did  
But you did but you did  
And I thank you.  
You didn't have to hold it but you did  
But you did but you did  
And I thank you.  
  
Every day was something new,  
You put on your bag and your fine to-do  
You got me trying new things too  
Just so I can keep up with you.  
  
You didn't have to shake it but you did  
But you did but you did  
And I thank you.  
You didn't have to make it like you did  
but you did but you did  
And I thank you.  
  
All my life I've been shortchanged  
Without your love baby it's a crying shame  
But now I know what the fellas talking about  
Hear me say that they been turned out  
I want to thank you  
I want to thank you  
I want to thank you  
Yes, I want to thank you
