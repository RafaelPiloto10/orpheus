Born into darkness  
Where sounds portay the images that are out  
Out of reach from my sight  
Which has been denied  
Hands change into my eyes  
Body senses intensified  
Sight so close yet far away  
  
In dreams my thoughts take their form  
To give memories identity  
Through dreams I obtain  
The ability to connect sight with sound  
  
[Solo: Schuldiner]  
  
Close your eyes and imagine to be without  
What we take for granted every time we open eyes  
A permanent shadow to never step away  
Feel the dark in the cold  
Feel the warmth of the light  
Which has been denied  
Hands change into my eyes  
Body senses intensified  
Sight so close yet far away  
In dreams my thoughts take their form  
To give memories identify  
Through dreams I obtain  
The ability to connect sight with sound
