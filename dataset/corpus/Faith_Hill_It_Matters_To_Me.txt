Baby tell me where'd you ever learn  
To fight without sayin' a word  
Then waltz back into my life  
Like it's all gonna be alright  
Don't you know how much it hurts  
  
When we don't talk  
When we don't touch  
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love  
It matters to me  
  
When I don't know what to say  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know if it really even matters to you  
How can I make you see  
It matters to me  
  
Maybe I still don't understand  
The distance between a woman and a man  
So tell me how far it is  
And how you can love like this  
'Cause I'm not sure I can  
  
When we don't talk  
When we don't touch  
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love  
It matters to me  
  
When I don't know what to say  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know if it really even matters to you  
How can I make you see  
It matters to me  
  
Whoa I don't know what to say  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know if it really even matters to you  
How can I make you see  
Oh, it matters to me  
Oh, it matters to me  
It matters to me
