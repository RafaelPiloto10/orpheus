There's no business like show business like no business I know  
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow  
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow  
  
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low  
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the
cold  
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show  
  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk  
Are secretly unhappy men because  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk  
Get paid for what they do but no applause.  
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?  
  
There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so  
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on
opening nights  
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there
in lights  
  
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low  
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's
no attack  
Where could you get money that you don't give back? let's go on with the show  
  
(There's no business like show business like no business I know)  
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn  
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on  
  
(There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)  
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there
you are  
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the
show!!
