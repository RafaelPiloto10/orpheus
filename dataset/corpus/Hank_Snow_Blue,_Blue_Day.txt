It's been a blue blue day I feel like running away I feel like running away
from it all  
My love has been untrue she's found somebody new  
It's been a blue blue day for me  
I feel like crying dying what can I do  
I feel like praying saying I'm glad we're through  
It's been a blue blue day I feel like running away  
I feel like running away from the blues  
  
How can I make believe that I don't sit  
And grieve it's been a blue blue day for me  
I can't pretend and say that I don't love her anyway it's been a blue blue day
for me  
I feel like crying dying...  
I feel like running away from the blues
