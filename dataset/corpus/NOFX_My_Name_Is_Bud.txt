They're always doin' fry  
Tryin' to get me high  
I felt the pressure but I never did  
  
They always call me dude  
Put it in my food  
I never wanted to when I was a kid  
  
I've got no septicals  
From eating egg rolls  
They took my squirt gun and made it a bong  
  
My teacher smelled my clothes  
They think I'm one of those  
My mom's from Utopia, my dad's Tommy Chong  
  
My sister's name  
Is Mary-Jane  
And mine's Bud, mine's Bud
