What if I never knew  
What if I never found you  
I'd never had this feeling  
In my heart  
How did this come to be  
I don't know how you found me  
But from the moment I saw you  
Deep inside my heart  
I knew  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
I wanted someone like you  
Someone that I could hold onto  
And give my love  
Until the end of time  
But forever was just a word  
Something I'd only heard about  
But now you're always there for me  
When you say forever  
I'll believe  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
Maybe all we need  
Is just a little faith.  
Cause baby, I believe  
That love will find a way.  
Hey..  
Oh baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny
