I don't mind the abuse  
It fills in time  
When I'm not much use  
But it's killing me, killing me slowly  
  
They all say  
I'm too restless  
But words cut deep  
When you're defenceless  
And they're killing me, but killing me slowly  
  
There was a time when we were fine  
And I could tolerate you  
I do believe that you should leave  
'Cause I've grown to hate you  
Should I be weak and turn my cheek  
'Cause I'm scared to fall  
But I just don't know you  
And you don't know me at all  
  
I've been told that love's a celebration  
But I've lost faith through frustration  
And it's killing me, but killing me slowly  
  
You paint my picture black  
The joke's on me  
And I don't wanna laugh  
Remember the good times  
Won't you bring them back someday, somehow  
  
I don't mind feeling blue  
If I could smile just like you do  
And it's killing me, killing me slowly  
  
I can't go on alone  
Pretending nothing's wrong  
Maybe I just want to belong  
Somewhere, somehow, somehow
