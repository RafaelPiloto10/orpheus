Kill your senses  
You might be right  
Hold your fire  
I'll take you higher  
Never drop  
We'll never stop  
  
Tar for feathers  
Blood for honey  
Milk for money  
Isn't it funny how it hurts  
How it hurts  
  
You never see me make  
The same mistake twice  
You never see a tear  
Coming out of these eyes  
You never see me beg  
For another shot  
And you never see me change  
Into something I'm not  
Famous last words  
  
Stare at someone  
You used to know  
Laughs at you  
Turns around and fade away  
If only I could see it that way  
  
Kill your senses  
It can't be right  
Isn't it funny how it hurts  
  
You never see me make  
The same mistake twice  
You never see a tear  
Coming out of these eyes  
You never see me quit  
See me disengage  
And you never see me spit in your face  
Out of rage  
Famous last words
