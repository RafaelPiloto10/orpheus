I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night  
I threw my phone across the room at you  
I was expecting some dramatic turn away  
But you stayed  
This morning I said we should talk about it  
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved  
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet  
And said okay, let's talk  
And I said  
  
Stay, stay, stay  
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time  
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad  
But I think that it's best if we both stay  
  
Before you, I'd only dated self indulgent takers who took all of their problem
out on me  
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing  
I love you, because you have given me no choice but to  
  
Stay, stay, stay  
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time  
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad  
But I think that it's best if we both stay  
Stay, stay, stay  
  
You took the time to memorize me, my fears, my hopes and dreams,  
I just like hanging out with you  
All the time  
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me  
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life  
  
Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time  
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad  
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay  
Stay, stay, stay  
  
Stay, stay, stay  
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time  
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad  
But I think that it's best if we both stay  
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay  
  
Stay, stay, stay  
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time  
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad  
But I think that it's best if we both stay
