Flowers grow  
They're everywhere you go  
I feel, I feel  
  
Rainbow sky  
Whenever you are by  
I feel, I feel  
  
I feel for you  
I can go on and on and on and on  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
You know I feel for you  
  
Stars appear  
The moment you are near  
I feel, I feel  
  
I feel for you  
I can go on and on and on and on  
I feel for you  
I can go on and on and on and on  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
You know I feel for you  
  
Every second of the day (I feel for you)  
You know I just can't stay away (I feel for you)  
Baby when you're next to me (I feel for you)  
That's the way I like to feel (I feel for you)  
  
Color shine  
A sunbeam through my mind  
  
I feel for you  
I can go on and on and on and on  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
You know I feel for you
