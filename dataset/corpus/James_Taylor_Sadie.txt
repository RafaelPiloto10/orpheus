[Chorus]  
You ain't nothing but a hound dog  
Crying all the time.  
You ain't nothing but a hound dog  
Crying all the time.  
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit  
And you ain't no friend of mine.  
  
Well they said you was high classed  
Well, that was just a lie.  
Yeah they said you was high classed  
Well, that was just a lie.  
Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit  
And you ain't no friend of mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Well they said you was high classed  
Well, that was just a lie.  
Yeah they said you was high classed  
Well, that was just a lie.  
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit  
And you ain't no friend of mine.  
  
[Chorus]
