My love, my heart  
Oh bruised and broken, all alone when we're apart  
I die inside,  
Oh this room is like a battlefield of love tonight  
I know I should be stronger but I lose all control  
Fighting with myself tryna hide what you don't know  
  
But I get weak  
I'm giving it all away  
I know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything that's been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees  
I get weak  
  
One look, one touch  
Oh I'm helplessly pretending you don't mean that much  
It gets so hard  
The waiting here forever with this shattered heart  
Lying to myself tryna act like I don't care, no  
The way it's killing me every time that you're not there  
  
Cause I get weak  
I'm giving it all away  
I know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything that's been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees  
I get weak  
  
I get weak  
And all the walls I've been building up  
Just crack and then break when you're around  
I get weak  
And nothing I do to fight it matters now  
  
I get weak  
I'm giving it all away  
I know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything that's been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees  
  
I get weak (oh)  
I get weak (oh)  
I get weak (oh)  
  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything that's been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees
