I Guess he'd Rather Be In Colorado  
  
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado  
He'd rather spend his time out where the sky looks like a pearl after a rain  
Once again I see him walkin Once again I hear him talking to the stars he
makes  
And asking them for bus fare  
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado  
He'd rather play his banjo in the morning when the moon is scarcely gone  
In the dawn the subways comin in the dawn I hear him hummin'  
Some old song he wrote of love in Boulder Canyon  
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado  
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado  
I guess he'd rather work out where the only thing you earn is what you spend  
In the end up in his office  
In the end a quiet cough is all he has to show  
He lives in New York City
