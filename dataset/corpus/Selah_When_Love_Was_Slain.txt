This world is not my home  
Oh, this world is not my home  
My home's been made at heaven's throne  
This world is not my home  
This life is not my own  
Oh, this life is not my own  
I am His and His alone  
This life is not my own  
  
[Chorus]  
I was bought when Love was slain  
What I cost, to pay death's wage  
Now ransomed, I am freedom's slave  
My Jesus raised me from the grave  
  
Come now and walk with me  
Oh, come now and walk with me  
Together we and Lord shall meet  
Come now and walk with me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Soon Lord, very soon,  
Oh, soon Lord, oh very soon,  
You'll come take me to be with You  
Soon Lord, very soon  
Soon Lord, oh very soon
