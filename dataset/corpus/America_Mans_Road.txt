Horizon rising up to meet the purple dawn  
Dust demon screaming, bring an eagle to lead me on  
For in my heart I carry such a heavy load  
Here I am on Man's road, walking Man's road, walking Man's road  
  
I'm hungry, weary, but I cannot lay me down  
The rain comes, dreary, but there's no shelter I have found  
It will be a long time till I find my abode  
Here I am on Man's road, walking Man's road  
  
Moon rising, disguising lonely streets in gay displays  
The stars fade, the night shade falls and makes the world afraid  
It waits in silence for the sky to explode  
Here I am on Man's road, walking Man's road, walking Man's road  
Walking Man's road, walking Man's road, walking Man's road
