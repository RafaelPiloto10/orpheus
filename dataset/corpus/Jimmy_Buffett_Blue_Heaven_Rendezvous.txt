Blue light guitars  
And tropical breeze  
Hummingbirds mime the words  
As they dance in the trees  
It's a flashback kind of crowd  
It's a cabaret sound  
There's still some magic left  
In this tourist town  
  
Those crazy days and crazy ways  
We never want to un-do  
We'll be together now and forever  
At the blue heaven rendezvous  
  
We were weird roman candles  
Burning bright at both ends  
At the end of the road  
Is where this story begins  
Where the green of the gulf  
Meets the blue of the sea  
What makes it all happen  
Still a mystery to me  
  
Those crazy days and crazy ways  
We never want to un-do  
We'll be together now and forever  
At the blue heaven rendezvous  
  
If these walls could talk  
I don't know what they'd say  
They've seen some accidental masquerades  
But it's no surprise  
Dances till dawn, heroes long gone  
Just let that guitar play  
  
Those crazy days and crazy ways  
We never want to un-do  
We'll be together now and forever  
At the blue heaven rendezvous  
We'll be together now and forever  
At the blue blue heaven rendezvous
