Can you tell me where it leaves  
When it's never ending?  
Can you tell me where to go  
When no one's home?  
  
Chorus:  
And I know, you know  
It hurts  
It hurts to be alone  
  
You're wrong, you're wrong  
On the one-way train going down  
Can you tell me what to say  
When there's no one listening?  
Can you show me what to do  
When all is done?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The plan has gone wrong  
Like a one-way train going down  
Going down, down, down  
Going down  
Going down, down, down  
Ooohhhh  
Yes I know, you know  
It hurts  
It hurts to be alone  
You're wrong, oh you're wrong  
On a one-way train going down, going down  
Going down, down, down  
Going down  
Going down, down, down  
That's the feeling  
It hurts to be alone  
Going down
