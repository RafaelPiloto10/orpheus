Hell, yeah  
The scent of Zenith clogs the midnight air  
You look around to see yourself and stare  
Hot knives, you know you're not alone  
The thunder burst your mind and cracks your bones  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M, yeah  
This is our hell and that's the way we live  
Your eyes transfixed by a deadly riff  
There ain't no doorway to Satan's mind  
He takes your soul and leaves your shell behind  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
Jeff Mantas on lead guitar  
The sins of man dictate eternity  
We are the sons of Satan, we the three  
The final gift of Hades, is Satan band  
And now the future lies in his beloved hand  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
Drag you to Hell
