I want to, I want to hold you  
  
Every time I go home there's another cellphone tower  
Construction getting louder,  
Paving over yesterdays  
You and I, we will try to find the side of it that's pretty  
While our town becomes a city,  
We won't let it be erased  
Empires rise, empires fall  
Will you be my constant through it all?  
  
I will hold your hand and watch the world spin idly around this life we're in  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet  
When it's you I'm with  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet  
When it's you I'm with  
You, you, you...  
  
Every once in a while,  
You know I get these real bad headaches  
Worried about the mistakes  
That I've made along the way  
You and I, we can't hide from the fact that we need each other  
How else will I recover when the fever comes again  
  
Temperatures rise  
Temperatures fall  
Will you be my constant through it all?  
  
I will hold your hand and watch the world spin idly around this life we're in  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with  
You, you, you...  
  
There are no words, no words when  
I'm with you, you, you  
Every time I hear music  
They've added more stuff to it  
Things are always moving into a futuristic place  
Where you and I will try  
We'll try to dance into tomorrow  
But time will have to borrow  
Not a minute left to waste  
  
Heartbeats rise, heartbeats fall  
Will you be my constant through it all?  
  
I will hold your hand  
And watch the world spin idly around this life we're in  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with [x4]
