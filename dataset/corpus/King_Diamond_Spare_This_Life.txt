"I, O'Brian of the Black Horsemen, forbid this sacrilege  
You all know that this Demon Child has Abigail's spirit  
Inside  
But what you don't know is  
That she is the reincarnation of my stillborn half-sister  
Her spirit is not EVIL, nor is it GOOD  
All it wants, is to make things right again  
So spare this life, through which revenge can be mine  
And Abigail can find her final peace  
I, O'Brian, have spoken  
Let it be done"
