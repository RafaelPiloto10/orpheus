We've been going together  
Too long to be vague  
When there's something to say  
If it's not now then it's never  
So I'll say it straight out  
'Cause I have no doubt, no doubt  
  
Let's get married  
I love you and I want to stay with you  
Let's get married  
Have kids and grow old and grey with you  
Let's get married  
Hold hands, walk in the park  
You can get a cat as long as it barks  
  
We know other people  
Who drifted apart  
Who broke each other's hearts  
But we ain't other people  
So we'll do things our way  
We're gonna be okay  
We're gonna be more than okay  
  
Let's get married  
We're ready for tying the knot  
Let's get married  
Set the seal on the feelings we've got  
Let's get married  
We can make each other happy or we can make each other blue  
Yeah, it's just a piece of paper, but it it says, "I love you."  
For the good times  
For the days when we can do no wrong  
For the bad times  
For the moments when we think we can't go on  
For the family  
For the lives of the children that we've planned  
Let's get married  
C'mon darlin', please take my hand  
  
And I'll be the one  
Who's by your side  
I'll be the one  
Still taking pride  
When we're old if they ask me,  
"How do you define success?"  
I'll say, "You meet a woman  
You fall in love  
You ask her and  
She says, 'Yes.'"  
  
Let's get married  
I love and I want to stay with you  
Let's get married  
Have kids and grow old and grey with you  
Let's get married  
Hold hands when we walk in the park  
All right, you can get a cat, just as long as it barks  
For the good times  
For the days when we can do no wrong  
For the bad times  
For the moments when we think we can't go on  
For the family  
For the lives of the children that we've planned  
Let's get married  
C'mon darlin', please take my hand
