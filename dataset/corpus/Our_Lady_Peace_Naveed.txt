Are you there, and is it comfortable?  
Did you want to escape, try to escape the population?  
The pressure is deceiving,  
And for you particularly should we let a young man die?  
Let him die if he wants to?  
I can't live here anymore  
It's hard when you reach for that floor and  
And there's something that tears me inside, so I can't  
Go brother are you there?  
Now tell me is it wonderful  
Or were you hoping to find something a little more?  
Climbing down the hours I need to know now  
Do the hands of time only rule this chapter  
I'll have to try once again, I'll have to try when I want to  
There he's on his knees again  
Trying hard to understand  
Why Naveed would let a young man die  
Convinced that he might break he reaches for that phone  
And then another day has gone
