At the end of,  
At the end of the world.  
Will you find me?  
Will you find me?  
At the end of,  
At the end of the world,  
Will you find me?  
So that we can go together.  
  
When the moon breaks up and the tide goes out of control,  
Will you find me in the water and swim me to the stars?  
  
At the end of,  
At the end of the world.  
Will you find me?  
Will you find me?  
At the end of,  
At the end of the world,  
Will you find me?  
So that we can go together.  
  
Together  
  
When the sun breaks up and there's no one to save you.  
  
At the end of,  
At the end of the world.  
Will you find me?  
Will you find me?  
At the end of,  
At the end of the world,  
Will you find me?  
Will you find me?  
Will you find me?  
  
Will you find me?
