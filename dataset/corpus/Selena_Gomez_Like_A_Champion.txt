Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam, ram pa pa pam pam  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam  
  
Tonight become alive  
Stand up 'cause you got the pride  
Dancing and the sweat don't dry  
Once shot so baby hit it right  
No doubt 'cause we young and free  
Walk like you run the city, like your name in the sky  
Live it up, 'cause baby it's your time  
  
It's in the way you hold yourself  
You gotta know you're something else  
It's sure that you've never felt so sexy sexy sexy  
  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam, ram pa pa pam pam  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam, ram pa pa pam pam  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam, ram pa pa pam pam  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam  
  
We got nothing to lose, we got nothing to prove  
Shine bright like diamonds in the sky  
Live it up 'cause baby it's your time  
  
It's in the way you hold yourself  
You gotta know you're something else  
It's sure that you've never felt so sexy sexy sexy  
  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam, ram pa pa pam pam  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam, ram pa pa pam pam  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam, ram pa pa pam pam  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
Ram pa pa pam pam, ram pa pa pam pam  
  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion  
  
Stand up let 'em know that you shine bright  
Throw down let 'em know that you got fight  
Walk like a champion, walk like a champion  
  
Stand up let 'em know that you shine bright  
Throw down let 'em know that you got fight  
It's sure that you've never felt so sexy sexy sexy

Ram pa pa pam pam, ram pa pa pam pam  
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
