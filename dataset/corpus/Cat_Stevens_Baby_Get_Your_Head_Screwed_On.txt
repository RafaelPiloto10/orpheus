Well if you're feelin' low, take it slow  
  
Baby get your head screwed on  
I know he's left, but don't be depressed  
Baby let your favorite daddy see you through  
  
Oh baby you'll be out of your mind,  
Baby you'll be out of your mind,  
Baby you'll be out of your mind.  
  
You know you're nice, you're sugar and spice  
And I know what you're going through  
And if you're hot HOT, and even if you're not  
Baby let your favorite daddy see you through  
  
Oh baby you'll be out of your mind,  
Baby you'll be out of your mind,  
Baby you'll be out of your mind.  
  
You were so neat, ever so sweet,  
And overnight you've seemed to change  
Since you kissed your psychiatrist  
Baby, you've never been the same.  
  
Well if you're feelin' low, take it slow  
Baby get your head screwed on  
I know he's left, but don't be depressed  
Baby let your favorite daddy see you through  
  
Oh baby you'll be out of your mind,  
Baby you'll be out of your mind,  
Baby you'll be out of your mind.
