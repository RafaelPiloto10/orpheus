So : the choice I have made  
May seem strange to you  
But who asked you, anyway?  
It's my life to wreck  
My own way  
  
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
In part, and in whole  
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
In part, and in whole  
  
So the life I have made  
May seem wrong to you  
But, I've never been surer  
It's my life to ruin  
My own way  
  
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
In part, and in whole  
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
In part, and in whole  
  
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
Part, and in whole  
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
Part, and in whole  
  
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Oh yeah...  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Oh yeah...
