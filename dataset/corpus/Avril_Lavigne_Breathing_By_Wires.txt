Addicted to razors  
Lashes to saviors  
Glued to the monitor  
Trained behavior  
Reduced to a number  
Mechanic enslavement  
A virtual prison  
Selected detainment  
A gradual nightmare  
Suicidal impulse  
A cycle of habit  
Undeniable loss  
Breathing by wire  
A network of heroes  
Processing data of ones and zeroes  
Carry me through the wires  
Bury me in the screen  
Shift me into this fixation  
Cling to the machine  
This I your world now  
And you barely made it  
Did you think that I would cradle you  
Until you were asleep forever?  
Did you?  
Carry me through the wires  
Bury me in the screen  
Shift me into this fixation  
Cling to the machine  
This is your world  
And you barely made it  
Did you think I could cradle you  
Until you were asleep forever?  
Did you?
