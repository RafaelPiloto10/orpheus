If you want to know what's written in the stars  
And you're in rio, go-to barbarella's bar  
With a magic circle as that company  
Today she writes tomorrow's diary  
  
[Chorus]  
Barbarella, magical barbarella  
Mystical fortuneteller  
Painting a sky of blue  
Do you know barbarella, magical barbarella  
Mystical fortuneteller  
Selling your dreams to you  
  
You take a look into her gypsy eyes  
You'll get the feeling  
That she never ever lies  
She will seduce you with that misty look  
She's gonna read you like an open book  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heya, heya, make the furure very clear  
Don't you be too shy!  
Heya, heya, while you whisper in my ear  
Tell another lie  
  
Barbarella, magical barbarella  
Mystical fortuneteller  
Selling your dreams to you  
  
Barbarella, magical barbarella  
Mystical fortuneteller
