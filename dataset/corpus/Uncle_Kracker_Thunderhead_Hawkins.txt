I know a cabin down there in Tennessee  
Where you can't find the forest on account of the trees  
And Old Perry Foster he got something to say  
And you can smell the pigs 'cause' they been cookin' all day  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I don't need no critics  
I don't need no suits  
I just need somebody who can tell me the truth  
You can keep your opinions  
You can keep on walkin'  
I'm gonna raise my glass yeah to Thunderhead Hawkins  
  
Miss Mary Jane she always looks like a star  
But the rock n roll banker likes to sleep in his car  
You won't hear no opry you'll hear six strings  
And you won't know what to do when you hear Thunderhead sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Mr. Hawkins got a family tree  
He got that their legendary cabin down in Tennessee  
You know he'll hook up that guitar everybody gather round  
You stay close to the fire when the sun goes down  
Old Brother Merle he's always waiting in the wings  
Only man up in them woods wearin' all them gold rings  
Old Mr. Hawkins he won't do nobody wrong  
But he'll he'll tear your heart out with one sad song  
  
[Chorus]
