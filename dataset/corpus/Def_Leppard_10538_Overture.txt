Did you see your friend crying from his eyes today  
Did you see him run through the streets and far away  
Did you see him run, did you see him fall  
Did his life flash by at the bedroom door  
  
Did you hear the news it came across the air today  
Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay  
Did you see him hide, did you see him crawl  
Does his life mean more than it did before  
  
Did you see that man running through the streets today  
Did you catch his face, was it 10538
