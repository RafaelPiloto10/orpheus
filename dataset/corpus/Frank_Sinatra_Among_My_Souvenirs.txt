There's nothing left for me of days that used to be,  
I live in memory among my souvenirs.  
Some letters tied with blue, photograph or two,  
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs.  
  
A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest,  
And though they do their best to give me consolation,  
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start,  
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs.
