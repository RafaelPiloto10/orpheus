Your a breath of fresh air  
I need you without you I can't live  
Your in cahoots with my heart (that's the way you stole it)  
It's gotta be a insider job  
You're a diamond, shawty perfect (perfect ohh)  
But you're body still sparkle (sparkels)  
I'm on a knee, holding your left hand  
I know where that missing diamond should  
  
Go, ooh, oh, ooh, oh oh oh  
Is there a magical garden where more of you  
Grow, ooh, oh, ooh, oh oh oh  
I didn't think so  
  
Feel like I just won the lotto  
I found a one in a million you(oh)  
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold.  
There will never be another you(ooh)  
Never be another you(ohhh)  
Never be another you  
  
Now I can spend my whole life  
Searching for something that's better than my dear  
But that's a waist of my time (cause what's better than perfect love?)  
Nothing, that's what my point is  
You can stand in front of the mirror (mirror, ohh)  
And there wouldn't be a reflection (noo)  
Cause there's only one of you  
And that's why I never let you  
  
Go, ooh, oh, ooh, oh oh oh  
Is there a magical garden where more of you  
Grow ooh, oh, ooh, oh oh oh  
I didn't think so (noo)  
  
Felt like I just won the lotto  
I found a one in a million you(oh)  
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold.  
There will never be another you(ooh)  
Never be another you(ohh)  
Never be another you  
  
Ima firm believer  
In never say never  
But I can say I'll never find another you  
They can say what ever  
Man it don't even matter  
Cause I know our love is true(x2)  
Yeahhh  
  
Felt like I just won the lotto  
I found a one in a million you(you yeah)  
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold.  
There will never be another you(ooh)  
Never be another you(ohh)  
Never be another you  
(Woah woah oh x5)  
There will never be another you...
