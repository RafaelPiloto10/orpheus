Some hope for the future  
Some wait for the call  
To say that the days ahead  
Will be the best of all  
  
We will build bridges  
Up to the sky  
Heavenly light surrounding you and I  
  
From out of the darkness  
Our future will come  
If we leave the past behind  
We'll fly beyond the sun  
  
We'll be together  
Sharing the load  
Watching in wonder as our lives unfold  
  
Hope for the future  
It's coming soon enough  
How much can we achieve?  
  
Hope for the future  
It will belong to us  
If we believe  
If we believe  
  
Hope shines brightest  
In the dark  
Where nothing's ever seen  
  
Lighting undiscovered places  
No one's ever been  
  
Some hope for the future  
Some wait for the call  
To say that our destiny  
Will be the best of all  
  
And we will build bridges  
Up to the sky  
Heavenly light surrounding you and I  
  
Hope shines brightest  
In the dark  
Where nothing's ever seen  
  
Lighting undiscovered places  
No one's ever been  
  
Hope for the future  
Hope for the future  
Hope for the future
