I am the diamond you left in the dust  
I am the future you lost in the past  
Seems like I never compared  
Wouldn't notice if I disappeared  
  
You stole the love that I saved for myself  
And I watched you give it to somebody else  
But these scars no longer I hide  
I found the light you shut inside  
Couldn't love me if you tried  
  
Am I still not good enough?  
Am I still not worth that much?  
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out  
Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now  
Guess I'm still not good enough  
  
Does it burn  
Knowing I used all the pain?  
Does it hurt  
Knowing you're fuel to my flame?  
Don't look back  
Don't need your regrets  
Thank God you left my love behind  
Couldn't change me if you tried  
  
Am I still not good enough?  
Am I still not worth that much?  
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out  
Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now  
Guess I'm still not good enough  
  
Release your curse  
'Cause I know my worth  
Those wounds you made are gone  
You ain't seen nothing yet  
Your love wore thin  
And I never win  
You want the best  
So sorry that's clearly not me  
This is all I can be  
  
Am I still not good enough?  
Am I still not worth that much?  
I'm sorry for the way my life turned out  
Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now  
Guess I'm still not good enough
