When our powerful structure creates sound  
The walls of the hall start coming down  
You're thrashing and slamming like there's no end  
The mob starts to get out of hand  
Distorted sound goes through your ears  
The pounding of the bass creates fear  
You stop and breathe when we slow down  
You have no chance 'cause our drummer's not fucking around  
Now you're gonna have this torment  
For the rest of your life  
No peace, No chance, No sleep day or night  
We're coming through your nughtmare you will see  
So be ready to meet the power of...  
[CHORUS]  
Incubus, Incubus  
[LEAD]  
[CHORUS]  
Incubus  
You are the victim, because you betray us  
You've got no place to hide  
You can't destroy us we'll crank the decibel high  
Our sound can never die! Die! Die!  
The mission's not over  
Preparing for your destruction  
We'll thrash you with all emotion  
You're running out of time  
There's nothing you can do  
We're taking your breath from you  
Nothing you can do, Take your breath from you  
We'll smash your skull  
Came from the word  
Only one word  
Came from the sound of Incubus.
