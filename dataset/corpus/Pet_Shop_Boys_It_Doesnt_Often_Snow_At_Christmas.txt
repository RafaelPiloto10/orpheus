Christmas is not all it's cracked up to be  
Families fighting around a plastic tree  
Nothing on the TV that you'd want to see  
And it's hardly ever snowing  
  
The way it's meant to be  
Like in White Christmas year after year  
Bing Crosby, Bring Crosby  
Are you listening to me?  
  
It doesn't often snow at Christmas  
The way it's meant to do  
But I'll still have a glow at Christmas  
Because I'll be with you  
  
The Christmas message was long ago lost  
Now it's all about shopping and how much things cost  
It's meant to be goodwill as well as synthetic fun  
And what this is this year's festive number one  
  
It doesn't often snow at Christmas  
The way it's meant to do  
But I'll still have a glow at Christmas  
Because I'll be with you  
  
Neil: Merry Christmas  
Chris: And a happy new year
