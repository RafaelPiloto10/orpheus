All my life I've been searching for something  
Something never comes never leads to nothing  
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close  
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope  
All night long I dream of the day  
  
When it comes around and it's taken away  
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most  
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost  
  
Calm down don't you resist  
You've such a delicate wrist  
And if I give it a twist  
Something to hold when I lose my grip  
Will I find something in there  
To give me just what I need  
Another reason to bleed  
One by one hidden up my sleeve (one by one hidden up my sleeve)  
  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down  
  
Will I find a believer  
Another one who believes  
Another one to deceive  
Over and over down on my knees  
If I get any closer  
And if you open up wide  
And if you let me inside  
On and on I've got nothing to hide (on and on I've got nothing to hide)  
  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down  
  
All my life I've been searching for something

Then I'm done done on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done done and I'm on to the next one  
Done I'm done and on to the next  
  
Done done on to the next one  
Done I'm done and on to the next one  
Done done on to the next one  
Done I'm done and on to the next  
  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down  
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste  
Weight keepin' me down  
  
Done done on to the next one  
And I'm done and on to the next
