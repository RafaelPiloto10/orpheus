(With The Beach Boys)  
Well, I've been searchin', I've been searchin'  
I've been searchin' every week and day  
Well, I've been searchin', I've been searchin'  
I've been searchin' every which way  
Like the North West Mountain you know I'll bring her in someday  
Well, if I have to climb a mountain, you know I will  
And if I have to swim a river, you know I will  
No matter where she goes, Oh Lord, you know I will  
And if I have to climb a mountain, you know I will  
And if I have to swim a river, you know I will  
I know she's hiding up there  
If you marry him don't you know I'll find her, child I will  
Well Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade gonna put that child on me  
No matter where she's hiding  
She gonna tell me you're coming  
I'm gonna walk right down that street just like bulldog jumping  
Cause I've been searchin', I've been searchin'  
I've been searchin' every which way  
Like the North West Mountain you know I'll bring her in someday
