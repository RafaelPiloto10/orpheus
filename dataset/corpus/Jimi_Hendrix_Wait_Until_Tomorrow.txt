Well I'm standing here freezing  
Inside your golden garden  
Got my ladder leaned up against your wall  
Tonight's the night we planed to run away together  
Come on dolly may there's no time to stall  
But now you're telling me that a  
I think we better wait 'till tomorrow  
What you say  
I think we better wait 'till tomorrow  
Ain't gone wait that long  
I think we better wait 'till tomorrow  
  
Got to make sure it's right  
So until tomorrow goodnight  
Oh what a drag  
  
Oh dolly may, how can you hang we out this way  
On the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today  
Now I'm sanding here like some  
Turned down serenading fool  
Hearing strange words stutter from the mixed-up mind of you  
And you keep telling me that ah  
I think we better wait till tomorrow,  
What ya say  
I think we better wait till tomorrow  
I ain't gonna wait that long  
I think we better wait till tomorrow  
  
Got to make sure it's right  
So until tomorrow goodnight  
See if I can talk to this girl a little bit  
  
Hey Dolly may girl you must be insane  
So unsure of yourself  
Leaning from you unsure window pane  
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing  
Something from a tree  
Click bang  
Oh what a hang your daddy just shot poor me  
And I hear you say as I fade away  
  
We don't have to wait till tomorrow  
Well I guess we don't have till tomorrow  
We don't have to wait till tomorrow  
That sure is a drag on my part baby  
We don't have to wait till tomorrow  
  
It must not have been right  
So forever goodnight  
  
We don't have to wait till tomorrow  
We don't have to wait  
We don't have to wait till tomorrow  
We don't have to wait  
We don't have to wait till tomorrow  
I won't be around tomorrow  
We don't have to wait till tomorrow  
We don't have to wait  
  
So here I am baby  
Yeah  
Hey man what's gone on
