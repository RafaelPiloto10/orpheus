Loving you  
Isn't the right thing to do  
How can I ever change things  
That I feel  
  
If I could  
Maybe I'd give you my world  
How can I  
When you won't take it from me  
  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
You can go your own way  
  
Tell me why  
Everything turned around  
Packing up  
Jacking ups all you want to do  
  
If I could  
Baby I'd give you my world  
Open up  
Every thing's waiting for you  
  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
You can go your own way  
  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it another lonely day  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
You can go your own way  
You can call it another lonely day  
  
You can go your own way (go your own way)  
You can go your own way (go your own way)
