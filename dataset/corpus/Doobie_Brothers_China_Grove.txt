When the sun comes up on a sleepy little town  
Down around San Antone  
And the folks are risin for another day  
Round about their homes  
  
The people of the town are strange  
And they're proud of where they came  
Well, you're talkin bout china grove  
Oh, china grove  
  
Well, the preacher and the teacher  
Lord, they're a caution  
They are the talk of the town  
When the gossip gets to flyin  
And they ain't lyin  
When the sun goes fallin down  
  
They say that the father's insane  
And dear missus Perkins a game  
Were talkin bout the china grove  
Oh, china grove  
  
But every day theres a new thing comin  
The ways of an oriental view  
The sheriff and his buddies  
With their samurai swords  
You can even hear the music at night  
  
And though it's a part of the lone star state  
People don't seem to care  
They just keep on lookin to the east  
  
Talkin bout the china grove  
Oh, china grove
