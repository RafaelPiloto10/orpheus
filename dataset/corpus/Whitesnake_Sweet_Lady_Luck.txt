You hold all the aces,  
I never get the chance to deal  
Flick of the wrist and you cut me down,  
I'm spinning like a roulette wheel  
  
You say that love's a gamble  
But, you play with loaded dice  
You hide behind a good girl smile  
With a heart stone cold as ice  
  
But, I want it, I need it  
If you don't give it I'll steal it,  
I'll take it all and walk away  
Lady luck,  
You're a loser in the game of love, sweet lady luck  
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you,  
Sweet lady luck  
  
You can't stop your dealing  
'cause it's a crying shame,  
When the winner takes it all  
And never ever takes the blame  
  
But I want it, I need it  
If you don't give it I'll steal it,  
I'll take it all and walk away  
Lady luck,  
You're a loser in the game of love, sweet lady luck  
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you  
Uh, what you gonna do?  
Lady luck  
  
I need your love, I need it now,  
I've got to have it anyhow,  
Sweet lady luck  
  
I can't win for losing,  
It's tearing me apart  
So I'll play the joker to your queen of broken hearts  
  
But, I want it, I need it,  
If you don't give it I'll steal it  
I'll take it all and walk away  
Lady luck,  
You're a loser in the game of love, sweet lady luck  
Spinning like a roulette wheel, sweet lady luck  
You're a loser in the game of love, sweet lady luck  
  
I need your love, I need it now,  
I've got to have it anyhow  
  
Sweet lady luck  
Sweet lady luck  
Sweet lady luck  
Lady luck!
