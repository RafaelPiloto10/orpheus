Save time to collect my fortune  
Paid upon arrival  
But I don't know where I'll be goin'  
I'm travelin' survival  
Aw, girl  
When I get there  
If it ain't for free  
I want you to know there's  
Nobody like you to me  
  
I've been scarred by my commitment  
To tell them what I see  
But I can't see that I've  
Been blinded  
By mediocrity  
Aw, girl  
If I dare  
To change what it should be  
I want you to know there's  
Nobody like you to me  
  
Maybe I should take it easy  
Seems I'm the only one  
But you won't let me rest my conscience  
'Til all I know is done  
Aw, girl  
If I care  
Enough to disagree  
I want you to know there's  
Nobody like you to me
