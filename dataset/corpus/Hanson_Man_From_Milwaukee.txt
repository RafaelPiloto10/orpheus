It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere  
Sitting beside me was a man with no hair  
From the look on his face and the size of his toes  
He comes from a place that nobody knows  
  
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky  
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why  
  
I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee  
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie  
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky  
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day  
  
He says where he's from is called Albertane  
There they use more than ten percent of the brain  
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave  
They run around in underwear and they never shave  
  
Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky  
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why  
  
This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird  
Baby Bird come in, come in Baby Bird  
  
For the love of Pete come in!  
This is Baby Bird, sorry I was watching Court TV  
Do you copy? Do you copy?  
Of course we copy, twenty four hours a day, in color  
  
You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest  
The man sitting by me who was barely dressed  
Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane  
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane  
  
I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee  
I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie  
I'm talking to Mars you may think I'm wacky  
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday  
I know they'll come get me and take me away  
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday  
If not tomorrow then maybe today
