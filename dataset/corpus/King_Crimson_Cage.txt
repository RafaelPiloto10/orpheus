Walking down the street do you stare at your feet and never do you let your
eyes meet the freaks, The deadbeat addicts,  
social fanatics, they're a dime a dozen and they carry guns  
  
[Chorus]  
Halloween, every other day of the week  
Living in a cage in the USA  
Living in a cage in the USA  
Holy smoke, somebody blew up the pope  
Living in a cage in the USA  
All around us the rules are changing  
Taller walls and stronger cages  
Nothing is sacred or too outrageous  
Taller walls and stronger cages  
  
What in the world is happening to the world?  
What in the world?  
Driving in your Mercedes you think you're safe, but you're never safe in a
world of hate with criminal minds with guns and  
knives who say "gimme your ride or give your life"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What in the world is happening to the world?  
What in the world?
