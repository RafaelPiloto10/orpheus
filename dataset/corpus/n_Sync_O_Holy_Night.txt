O holy night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night  
Of our dear saviors birth  
  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
'til he appeared  
And the soul felt it's worth  
  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Oh fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angels voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh night when christ was born  
  
Oh holy night  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night  
Oh night divine  
  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angels voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh night when christ was born  
  
Oh night  
Divine  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night  
Oh night divine  
  
Oh holy night  
When christ was born  
Holy night when christ was born
