There's a place in the sun,  
For anyone who has the will to chase one  
And I think I've found mine,  
Yes, I do believe I have found mine, so  
  
Close your eyes,  
And think of someone,  
You physically admire  
And let me kiss you,  
Let me kiss you  
  
I've zig-zagged all over America,  
And I cannot find a safety haven  
Say, would you let me cry,  
On your shoulder  
I've heard that you'll will try anything twice  
  
Close your eyes,  
And think of someone,  
You physically admire,  
And let me kiss you,  
Let me kiss you  
  
But then you open your eyes,  
And you see someone,  
That you physically despise  
But my heart is open  
My heart is open to you
