Dress in Armour  
Bring your sword and shield  
And your lucky charm.  
In dragonships  
We'll sail the seven seas  
Under guilding stars.  
  
Into battle, we will ride  
Gods will follow, by our side  
  
[Bridge: x1]  
Heathens from the north  
  
The air is still,  
The bodies cold and pale  
They'll never live to tell.  
About the slaughter  
When battlegrounds ran red  
We gave them hell.  
  
Into battle, sense of pride  
We're forever, shining bright  
  
[Bridge x4]  
Heathens from the north  
  
We are immortal  
Ever shining bright  
Heathens from the north, yeah
