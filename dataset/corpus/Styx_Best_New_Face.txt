Let's go.  
  
I don't know where I found you  
I don't know where you been  
All I know is you got me  
In the shape I'm in  
  
You're the message in the bottle  
You're the deluxe model  
I haven't been so affected  
Since I don't know when  
  
Yeah (yeah), Whoa yeah (whoa yeah)  
You're the best new face  
In the human race  
  
(I said) Yeah, Whoa yeah  
You're the best new face  
In the human race  
  
You look so real  
When you ask me to feel  
Yeah you're so damn convincing  
Digging in your heels  
  
If your persuasion attack  
Leaves me flat on my back  
You can ride me off to ruin  
While the whole world cracks  
  
(Said) Yeah (yeah), Whoa yeah (whoa yeah)  
You're the best new face  
In the human race  
  
(I said) Yeah, Whoa yeah  
You're the best new face  
In the human race  
  
Speak of the devil  
And look who appears  
He's cranking up the level  
In between your ears  
But he's so frustrated  
Cause he can't get a rise  
Out of someone who's reflecting  
Heaven in their eyes  
  
I see heaven in your eyes.  
  
(You look so good)  
  
Yeah (yeah), Whoa yeah (whoa yeah)  
You're the best new face  
In the human race  
  
(I said) Yeah, Whoa yeah  
You're the best new face  
In the human race  
  
(Said) Yeah (yeah), Whoa yeah (yeah, whoa yeah)  
You're the best new face  
In the human race  
  
Yeah, Whoa yeah (Oh yeah)  
You're the best new face  
In the human race (Best new face).
