Love comes in spurts  
And love is all around us  
Love is what it does  
Sometimes it hurts  
Does that strike you rather strangely, does it ever love?  
Please, please, please  
No need to be so cruel  
Please, please, please  
Don't treat me like a fool  
  
Love comes in spurts  
Sometimes it gets to be too much to rise above  
  
Please, please, please  
No need to be so cruel  
Please, please, please  
Don't treat me like a fool  
If you love me  
You would leave me  
Leave me time to be alone  
Please believe me  
That would leave me  
Time to love you  
Does that strike you funny, love?  
Be-bop-a-lua  
Be-bop-a-lua she's my ? baby  
  
When it's over  
Promise me that you'll go  
When it's over  
Promise you'll let me know  
When it's over promise me that you'll go  
Just because what it was becomes another empty cup of memories
