You took a part of me that I really miss  
I keep askin' myself how long can it go on like this  
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, I told myself one too  
Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
You took the silver and you took the gold  
You left me standin' out in the cold  
People ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew  
Well, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
I'm driftin' in and out of dreamless sleep  
Throwin' out my memories in a ditch so deep  
I did so many things I never did intend to do  
And I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink  
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think  
I feel like talkin' to somebody but I just don't know who  
Well, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once  
Rock me for a little while and rock me for a couple a months  
You know honey I'll rock you too  
Well, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
Well, there's voices in the night tryin' to be heard  
I'm sittin' here listening to every mind-pollutin' word  
And I know, I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two  
Yes, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles  
Yes, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you
