(One teardrop one teardrop)  
I know that I've cried a lot today and my heart's gonna hurt the same old way  
Cause I'm losin' the love I thought was mine  
The heartache's brought one teardrop at a time  
One teardrop at a time keeps telling me that won't be long until you'll be
leaving me  
When you go I'm gonna cry one more time  
I'll take back my heart one teardrop at a time  
No matter how many tears I cried that old familiar feeling stays inside  
My heart for you won't leave just in time  
I'll cry you from my heart one teardrop at a time  
One teardrop at a time...
