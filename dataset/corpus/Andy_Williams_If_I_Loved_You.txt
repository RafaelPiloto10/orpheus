I was sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream  
Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain  
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head  
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread  
I think I love you (I think I love you)  
  
This morning I woke up with this feeling  
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself  
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it  
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room  
I think I love you (I think I love you)  
  
I think I love you so what am I so afraid of  
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you isn't that what life is made of  
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way  
  
I don't know what I'm up against  
I don't know what it's all about  
I got so much to think about  
  
Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of  
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you isn't that what life is made of  
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way  
  
Believe me you really don't have to worry  
I only wanna make you happy and if you say "hey go away" I will  
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you  
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face  
Do you think you love me?  
  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you
