She will never be invincible  
She will never be some Florence Nightingale  
Her threshold's invisible  
But she'll hang on like hell  
  
[Chorus:]  
She may be transparent  
She's got no defenses to speak of  
But she'll stand here before you  
With no pride or prejudice  
Just steadfast and certain  
That she'll land on her own two feet  
And you'll think you can break her  
'Cause you think that she's crazy and weak  
But her power will defy you when  
She wears her heart on her sleeve  
  
She will never learn your tranquility  
She will never learn how to let things slide  
Her joy overwhelms her and  
Her sorrow won't subside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh you may condemn me with  
Your bitter words and untouchable rage  
And you may torment me 'cause I don't  
Lead my life in your way  
But I will stand here before you  
With no pride or prejudice  
Just steadfast and certain  
That I will land on my own two feet  
You'll think you can break me  
Bring my head down to my knees  
But my power will defy you when  
I wear my heart on my sleeve
