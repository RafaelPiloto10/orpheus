Will:  
Listen, baby,  
Ain't no mountain high,  
Ain't no valley low,  
Ain't no river wide enough, baby  
  
Kelly:  
If you need me, call me,  
No matter where you are,  
No matter how far  
  
Will:  
Don't worry, baby  
  
Kelly:  
I'll be there in a hurry,  
You don't have to worry  
  
Both:  
'Cause, baby, there  
Ain't no mountain high enough,  
Ain't no valley low enough,  
Ain't no river wide enough,  
To keep me from getting to you, babe  
  
Will:  
Remember the day when I set you free,  
I told you could always, always count on me  
  
Kelly:  
From that day on, I made a vow,  
I'll be there when you want me, someday, somehow  
  
Both:  
'Cause, baby, there  
Ain't no mountain high enough,  
Ain't no valley low enough,  
Ain't no river wide enough,  
To keep me from getting from you, babe  
  
Will:  
Oooo, darling  
  
Kelly:  
  
No wind, no rain,  
No winters cold,  
Can stop me now  
  
Will:  
Don't stop me, baby  
  
Kelly:  
'Cause you are my goal,  
Oooo, baby  
  
Will (while Kelly is singing):  
When you are in trouble,  
I'll be there on the double,  
Just send for me  
  
(Lots of chorus and random words)  
  
Both:  
'Cause, baby, there  
Ain't no mountain high enough,  
Ain't no valley low enough,  
Ain't no river wide enough,  
To keep me from getting to you, babe  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough!
