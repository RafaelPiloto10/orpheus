Tell you a story  
'Bout a friend of mine  
Woke up in this room  
Looked like... black and white movies  
No light  
And someone strange in the bed  
She said  
"You could be here forever"  
"Can you feel me?  
I'm the new disease  
I'm like a hunger  
That you've never known"  
"Do you want me?  
I'll take everything  
I'm like a hunger  
Lying in your heart"  
He made excuses  
Tried to leave the room  
She said  
"I'm the disease and the cure  
Skin mechanics  
Couldn't help you here  
The nature of need  
Leaves you junk sick and lonely"  
"Trick it up  
Trick it up good"  
She moved  
Like a ghost to the door  
She said  
"This is a re-al love story"  
I heard his voice  
And walked in on it all  
She said  
"You could be here forever"
