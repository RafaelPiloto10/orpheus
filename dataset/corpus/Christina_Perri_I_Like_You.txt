It's like a little piece of heaven  
When you stay  
You make me feel like it's all  
Okay  
And now I know that the sun  
Will only shine  
When the clouds go away  
Cause that's how you make me feel  
That's how you make me feel today  
  
And you're like a little piece of candy  
On my tongue  
You're so much fun  
And I flip like a butterfly  
With one look in your eyes  
That's how you make me feel  
That's how you make me feel tonight  
  
And I think I like you  
And I think you like me too  
  
Lets keep dreaming and wishing  
This way  
Growups don't take enough time to play  
Love is all that matters at the end of the day  
That's how you make me feel  
Thank you for making me feel this way  
  
And I think I like you  
And I think you like me too
