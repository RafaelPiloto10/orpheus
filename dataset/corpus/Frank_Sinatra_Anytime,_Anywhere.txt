You could leave tomorrow, fly to Mandalay, darling I would love you anyway,  
I just couldn't help but care, anytime, anywhere.  
You can keep me waiting every single day, I'll be there to meet you anyway,  
You make life a love affair, anytime, anywhere.  
  
Why should I lie and pretend I don't belong to you,  
Why even try when it makes no difference what you do, I'll be true.  
Take my heart completely, treat me as you may, I am yours forever anyway,  
All I have is yours to share, anytime, anyplace, anywhere.
