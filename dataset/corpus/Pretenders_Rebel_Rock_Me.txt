I'm as solid as a rock  
Throw me at the powers that be  
I'm as solid as a rock  
Throw me at the powers that be  
I'm as user friendly as a lead-filled glove  
Rebel rock me  
  
Hey!  
  
I've got money in the bank  
Come with me and you can have it for free  
I've got money earning interest in the bank  
Come with me and you can have it for free  
I've got assets big as holes up in the sky  
Rebel rock me  
  
Hey!  
  
I'm as heavy as a crowd in east l.a.  
Fling me at the oppressor and flee  
  
I'm as heavy as a crowd in east l.a.  
Fling me at the oppressor and flee  
  
I'm a seething burning moving mass of love  
Rebel rock me  
  
Hey!
