(It's Whitey. . . and the Likwit) repeats several times  
Watch me rock these sounds from the Polo Grounds  
To the Sunset Strip, I'm like an acid trip  
I'm flashing back on ya, run it up on ya  
Born in Hempstead L.I., raised in California  
Mister entrepreneur, I rock the shot that's sure  
I need a dime plus more, I sip the finely corked  
I want the cash in hand, and the beats front land  
And I get loco from Acapulco to Japan  
Mister Whitey Ford gets terrain explored  
You perpetrate that Ford, you must be out your gourd  
It's time make like break nights kid, and praise the lord  
Keep the faith, smoke your eighth  
Continue stackin' papers all up in my safe  
Commence to motivate, assume an altered state  
And kill your whole wack show like I'm Edgar Alan Poe  
It's the psychotic thriller, no peckerwood's iller  
Than this freckled face man with the farmer's tan  
If I can't bomb on you, I'm bombin' on your man  
Chorus:  
Some get the shit, sugar, some get the stains  
Some get the muscles, baby, some get the brains  
Some get the powers, love, some get the papers  
Some catch the vibes and some catch the vapors  
Better . . . [Praise the Lord . . . Keep, keep the faith (4x)]  
I say roll to the rock, rock to the roll  
Whitey Ford brings the devastating mic control  
Like Darrell McDaniel, a hundred g's annual  
The tips get clocked baby, the bonds get stocked  
My style gets rocked just like doors get knocked  
With legendary status like my name's Lou Brock  
And my lanzar sounds be shaking the grounds  
Hunting down crews, like packs of bloodhounds  
Snatching off crowns and melting 'em down  
I once was lost, see but now I'm found  
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
And when the saints come marchin' in . .  
(Keep the faith)  
I messed the alpine white, classic rapper's delight  
All these shorties pullin' tools, cause they know they can't fight  
I bang my selections on worldwide connections  
So get the seven digits baby, never burn your bridges  
Chorus 2x
