Today for the first time  
For the first time  
You took my hand  
Today for the first time  
Touched a warm heart  
What a lucky girl  
  
Cause you opened your heart  
And you gave it to me  
So don't tell me that you don't love me  
You opened your heart  
And you gave it to me  
So don't tell me that you don't need me  
  
For me for me  
you're the one you're the world  
Someone is anyone there  
My body needs warmth  
It?s a mad mad world  
Today for the first time  
I heard my heart stop  
As he flew away  
  
Open your heart  
And give it to me  
And don't tell me that you don't love me  
Open your heart  
And give it to me  
And don't tell me that you don't need me  
  
Sometimes I just fall and break  
Sometimes it just overflows  
I can't take no more  
I can't take no more no more  
  
Open your heart ?  
Tonight for the first time  
All the stars shine  
But you're the brightest one  
My love
