I try to keep you out of my heart  
But somehow I find  
Trying to keep you out of my heart  
I'm out of my mind  
I tell myself "I'm through with you  
And I'll having nothing more to do with you"  
I stay away, but every day  
I'm just foolin myself  
  
Tell my friends that I don't care  
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair  
But all know it isn't so  
I'm just foolin myself  
  
And every time I pass  
And see my face in a looking glass  
I tip my hat and say  
"How do you do, you fool  
You're trowing your life away"  
I'm acting gay  
I'm acting proud  
And every time I see you in a crowd  
I may pretend  
But in the end  
I'm just fooling myself
