Climb down my pile  
And again to the beat of my heart  
You're so exiting  
Take all the soul  
I will give you as  
much as you want  
  
Higher, much higher  
Umbouned fire  
Closer, come closer  
Close to the core  
  
We burn, we burn  
  
I contaminate you  
I like to pollute you with my  
G- g- generations  
Look into my eyes  
And we melt into  
on yearning mind  
We climb the stages  
  
Higher, much higher  
Umbouned fire  
Closer, come closer  
Close to the core  
  
We burn, we burn  
Insanity, insanity  
Never set me free  
  
Higher, much higher  
Set me on fire  
Closer, come closer  
Close to the core  
  
We burn, we burn  
Insanity, insanity  
Never set me free
