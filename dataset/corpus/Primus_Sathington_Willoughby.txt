We are gathered here today  
In the magestic halls of old.  
To honor a man they call  
Sathington Willoughby.  
  
There's a joke or two,  
A pun or three,  
I feel that must be told.  
Then I go on to speak of Sathington Willoughby.  
  
Sathington Willoughby,  
The legislator,  
That penned us up a bill.  
That banned the use of certain things  
  
Like this and that.  
(this and that).  
This and that.  
(this and that).  
This and--.
