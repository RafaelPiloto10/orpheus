Feels so cold, so alone  
An empty stage, no one home  
Feels so strange, susky  
No point in screaming, I won't be hurt  
  
You're so cold, you're so cool  
It's so dark in this tomb  
  
Time has come so soon  
And time takes no prisoners, except in the womb  
There's no way out, no escape  
This silence is deafening, I have to cry out  
  
You're so cold, you're so cool  
It's so dark in this tomb  
  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
  
Set me free from this grief  
Am I forgiven, can I be saved?  
You've been so cold for so long  
This silence is deafening, was I so wrong?  
  
You're so cold, you're so cool  
It's so dark in this tomb  
  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
  
Roll away the rock  
Take that rock rollin'  
  
Roll the rock, rock away  
Roll the rock, rock away  
  
Roll away the rock  
You gotta roll the rock away  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
  
Roll the rock, rock away  
Roll the rock, rock away  
Roll the rock, rock away  
Roll the rock, rock away  
  
This silence is deafening  
This silence is deafening
