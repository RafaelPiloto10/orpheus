It's a cold and crazy world that's ragin' outside  
Well baby me and all my girls are bringin' on the fire  
Show a little leg, gotta shimmy your chest  
It's a life, it's a style, it's a need, it's Burlesque  
  
E-X-P-R-E-S-S, love, sex  
Ladies no regrets  
E-X-P-R-E-S-S, love, sex  
Ladies no regrets  
  
Been holdin' back for quite some time and finally the moment's right  
I love to make the people stare  
They know I got that certain savoir-faire  
  
Fasten up  
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch?  
Step into the fantasy  
You'll never want to leave, baby it's guarantee  
Why?  
  
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque  
It'll move you, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque  
All ladies come put your grown up, boys throw it up if you want it  
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's Burlesque.  
  
I tease 'em 'til they're on the edge  
They screamin' more for more and more they beg  
I know it's me they come to see  
My pleasure brings them to their knees  
  
Fasten up  
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch?  
Step into the fantasy  
You'll never want to leave, baby let's give it to you  
Why?  
  
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque  
It'll move you, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque  
All ladies, confident, flaunt it  
Boys throw it up if you want it  
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's Burlesque.  
  
(Woo, dance break!)  
  
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque  
It'll move you, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque  
All ladies come put your grown up, boys throw it up if you want it  
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's Burlesque.
