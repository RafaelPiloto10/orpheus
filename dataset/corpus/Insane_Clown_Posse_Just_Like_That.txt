Just Like That  
[Violent J]  
Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts  
Eat em quick or they soggy and that sucks  
Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt  
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt  
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill  
'cause it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel  
I got a few money back and a little change  
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings  
"What up man, check it out, I know this bitch  
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich  
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte  
guaranteed, we can fuck em both on the spot"  
Oh shit, let me call Bill Bill  
I want to let my nuts through the windmill  
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark  
'cause I know he can get the fuckin Skylark  
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas  
But I want to buy these Faygo, think fast  
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones  
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home  
"Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten  
No need to get punched in your head again  
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away  
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day"  
Fuck yeah, I throw my Pro Winds on my feet  
Lock the house, and wait for em in the street  
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck  
My mouth still kind of tastes grapenuts  
Here they come, nope, wasn't them  
Seems like the same car's driving by again  
It pulls up, "hey man, you're outta luck"  
What, what ya say man  
(gunshot)  
Fuck
