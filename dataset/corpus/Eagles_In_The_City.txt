Somewhere out there on that horizon  
Out beyond the neon lights  
I know there must be somethin' better  
But there's nowhere else in sight  
It's survival in the city  
When you live from day to day  
City streets don't have much pity  
When you're down, that's where you'll stay  
In the city, oh, oh.  
In the city  
  
I was born here in the city  
With my back against the wall  
Nothing grows, and life ain't very pretty  
No one's there to catch you when you fall  
Somewhere out on that horizon  
Faraway from the neon sky  
I know there must be somethin' better  
And I can't stay another night  
In the city, oh, oh.  
In the city  
  
In the city  
  
In the city  
  
In the city
