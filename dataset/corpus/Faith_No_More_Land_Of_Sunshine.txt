You have a winning way, so keep it  
Your future  
You are an angel heading for a land of sunshine  
And fortune us smiling upon you  
  
Prepare for a series of comfortable miracles  
From fasting to feasting  
And life to you is a dashing, bold adventure  
So sing and rejoice  
  
And look for the dream that keeps coming back  
Your future  
Pat yourself on the back and give yourself a handshake  
'Cause everything is not yet lost...  
  
(Does life seem worthwhile to you?)  
HERE'S HOW TO ORDER!  
Does life seem worthwhile to you?  
Do others push you around?  
  
Is age against you?  
Sing and rejoice!  
Does life seem worthwhile to you?  
Does emotional music  
  
Have quite an effect on you?  
I-I can help - I can help you - I can help you help yourself!
