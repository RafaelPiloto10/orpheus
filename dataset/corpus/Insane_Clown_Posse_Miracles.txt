If magic is all we've ever know  
Then it's easy to miss what really goes on  
But I've seen miracles in every way  
And I see miracles everyday  
Oceans spanning beyond my sight  
And a million stars way above em at night  
We don't have to be high to look in the sky  
And know that's a miracle opened wide  
Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas  
And everything chilling underwater, please  
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog  
Long neck giraffes, and pet cats and dogs  
And I've seen eighty-five thousand people  
All in one room, together as equals  
Pure magic is the birth of my kids  
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids  
The sun and the moon, and even Mars  
The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars  
ufos, a river flows  
Plant a little seed and nature grows  
Niagara falls and the pyramids  
Everything you believed in as kids  
fucking rainbows after it rains  
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains  
I fed a fish to a pelican at (Friscal?) bay  
It tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away  
And music is magic, pure and clean  
You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen  
  
Music is all magic  
(Are you a believer in miracles)  
You can't even hold it  
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)  
It's just there in the air  
(Are you a believer in miracles)  
Pure motherfucking magic  
Right?  
This shit'll blow your fucking mind  
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)  
  
Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling  
And it fills the room, from the floor to the ceiling  
I see miracles all around me  
Stop and look around, it's all astounding  
Water, fire, air and dirt  
fucking magnets, how do they work?  
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist  
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed  
Solar eclipse, and vicious weather  
Fifteen thousand Juggalos together  
And I love my mom for giving me this  
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted  
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly  
Miracles ain't nothing to lie  
Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy  
And my little boy looks just like daddy  
Miracles each and every where you look  
And nobody has to stay where they put  
This world is yours for you to explore  
There's nothing but miracles beyond your door  
The Dark Carnival is your invitation  
To witness that without explanation  
Take a look at this fine creation  
And enjoy it better with appreciation  
Crows, ghosts, the midnight coast  
The wonders of the world, mysteries the most  
Just open your mind, and it ain't no way  
To ignore the miracles of every day  
  
(Are you a believer in miracles)  
Magic everywhere in this bitch  
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)  
It's all around you, you don't even know it  
(Are you a believer in miracles)  
Shit's crazy  
(Do you notice and recognize miracles,  
So many miracles, the magic miracles)  
  
Are you a believer in miracles  
Do you have time for the miracles  
Do you notice and recognize miracles  
So many miracles, the magic miracles  
Are you a believer in miracles  
Do you have time for the miracles  
Do you notice and recognize miracles  
So many miracles, the magic miracles  
Are you a believer in miracles  
Do you have time for the miracles  
Do you notice and recognize miracles  
So many miracles, the magic miracles  
Are you a believer in miracles  
Do you have time for the miracles  
Do you notice and recognize miracles  
So many miracles, the magic miracles
