Got a call from my friend  
She saw my picture again  
In a magazine  
We laughed out loud  
'Cuz she said "remeber when...  
This was all a silly dream?  
Now I wake up every day  
In a different city  
A smile on my face  
Somebody pinch me  
She said "all the world's a satge"  
But girl you know  
Those cameras and lights  
Won't ever change me  
  
I don't drink champagne  
When I'm back home with my friends  
We sip on tea on the porch  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
No fancy things when I come off tour  
I slip back into my jeans  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
  
It's amazin' to hear people singin' along  
Hear the radio playin' my song  
I still get butterflies  
Still get nervous inside  
In the spotlight  
  
Now every now n then  
On a friday night  
Cruisin' down to the dive bar  
We waste the night away  
Spend saturday sleepin' in late  
Those were the good days  
  
I don't drink champagne  
When I'm back home with my friends  
We sip on tea on the porch  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
No fancy things when I come off tour  
I slip back into my jeans  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
  
And even when I'm miles away  
I'll always have the roots from where I came  
Cuz when it all fades away  
My home will still be the same  
  
Yeah eh  
Yeah...  
  
I don't drink champagne  
When I'm back home with my friends  
We sip on tea on the porch  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
No fancy things when I come off tour  
I slip back into my jeans  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
