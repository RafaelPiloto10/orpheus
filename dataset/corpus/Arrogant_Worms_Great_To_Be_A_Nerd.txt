It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
The only light we ever see is from our moniter  
We argue about comic books and Internet connections  
The biggest highlight of the year is the Star Trek Convention  
Our town's not big enough to sign up any stars  
But we once met a red shirt who was phasered by a Borg  
(Man, he knew Mr. Sulu!) (What?)  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We wear our Star Trek uniforms and talk like Captain Kirk  
We have our own heroes who we try to emulate  
I dream of one day being as sexy as Bill Gates  
We hate watching sports 'cause we're reading Carl Sagan  
But we'd watch the Olympics if they played Dungeons and Dragons  
(I'm a Hobbitt! Ha ha ha ha!)  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We think Tolkein was a genius and Shakespeare was a turd  
We rarely get a date or get talked to by a girl  
Unless they're having trouble with their algebra homework  
We're emotionally bereft and we're sexually frustrated  
But we can download photographs of Agent Scully naked  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We know the truth is out there but we'd have to leave our room  
We are the nerds in your neighbourhood  
Polyester's a fashion statement  
But there's more room on the beach for you  
'Cause we're locked in our basement  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We like to wear colours that do not appear in nature  
It's great to be a  
Poorly-dressed fashionless  
Star trekking roleplaying  
Ninety pound when wet down  
Pasty skinned pop drinking  
Underfed genius  
Yes, it's great to be a nerd
