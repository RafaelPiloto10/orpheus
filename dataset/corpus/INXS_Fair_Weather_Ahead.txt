There's this place full of mountain heads  
Living and chewing on the fat  
Built upon the hazy plan  
Like foundations slipping through the sand  
  
Long teeth and whiskers like a rat  
Fearing only those present  
They got zero emotion  
And everybody's fed up with that  
  
Warm outside but very cold within  
Followed and praised for many years  
They got all the promotions  
Isn't that the way it's always been  
  
History's written always red  
It's pages are painful and clear  
It's so full of devotion  
Makes you wonder where it could have led  
  
Put the lights out, fair weather ahead  
These strange new creatures  
Aha, they won't be led
