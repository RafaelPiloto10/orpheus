Well you're just in time to be too late I tried to but I couldn't wait  
And now I've got another date so I won't be home no more  
You're just in time to miss the boat so don't take off your hat and coat  
Be on your way that's all she wrote cause I won't be home no more  
I stood around a mouth or two and waited for your call  
Now I'm too busy pitchin' woo so come around next fall  
I stretched your name right off my slate and hung a sign on my front gate  
You're just in time to be too late and I won't be home no more  
[ guitar - piano - fiddle - steel ]  
Well you're just in time to turn around and drive your buggy back to town  
You lookedf me up I turned you down and I won't be home no more  
You're just in time to change your tune go tell your troubles to the moon  
And call around next May or June cause I won't be home no more  
I used to be a patient kind believed each alibi  
But that's all done I've changed my mind I've got new fish to fry  
Well you're just in time to celebrate the thing you didn't calculate  
You're just in time to be too late and I won't be home no more
