Many a year ago in old sorrento  
A certain ditty was quite the thing  
Whenever a mother rocked her baby in sorrento  
This little ditty she used to sing:  
  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
My bambino go to sleep!  
  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
My bambino go to sleep!  
  
All the stars are in the skies ready to say " goodnight"  
Can't you see your doll is sleepy, too?  
Close your drowsy little eyes, mama will hold you tight  
While she sings a lullaby to you:  
  
Oh, chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
My bambino go to sleep!  
  
(chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa, and chi-lawa)  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah (la goombah!)  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
My bambino go to sleep!  
  
(chi, chi, chi-baba!)  
Chi, chi, chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah (la goombah!)  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
My bambino go to sleep!  
  
All the stars are in the skies ready to say " goodnight, goodnight"  
Can't you see your doll is sleepy, too?  
Close your drowsy little eyes, mama will hold you tight  
While she sings a lullaby to you, ever so sweetly!  
  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
An' chi-lawa kook-a la goombah (la la goombah! Chi-baba!)  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
My bambino go to sleep!  
  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
My bambino go to sleep!  
Chi-baba, chi-baba, chi-wawa  
My bambino. ..  
Go to sleep!
