Too much coffee's gonna shatter my nerves,  
Too much whiskey's gonna stutter my words  
A whole lotta speed gonna take me to fast,  
How much longer can I last  
  
Too many women gonna put me to waste,  
Too much money gonna spoil my taste  
Doctor says to slow down if you want to stay alive,  
How am I gonna survive... I want to know  
I want to know, I want to know, I want to know, oh yea  
Been working to hard don't got no time to rest,  
Don't look to well I ain't feeling my best  
Can't push much harder before I fall on the ground,  
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown  
  
I've gotta slow down,  
Get my feet on the ground, yeah  
I better slow down fast,  
Today could be my last, all right
