Imagination is funny  
It makes a cloudy day sunny  
Makes a bee think of honey  
Just as I think of you  
  
Imagination is crazy  
Your whole perspective gets hazy  
Starts you asking a daisy  
What to do, what to do?  
  
Have you ever felt  
A gentle touch and then a kiss  
And then and then  
Find it's only your imagination again? Oh, well  
  
Imagination is silly  
You go around willy-nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too
