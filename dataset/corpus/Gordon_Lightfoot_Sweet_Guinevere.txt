Sweet Guinevere you're off to the coal town tonight  
And your young brother Ernie's up in Pittsburgh PA  
You know mother loves you, and dad's in the mine  
So don't go to the coal town, Guinevere, if you're kind  
  
She loves a young man and he lives in the town  
He leaves the house early for he works underground  
He makes a good wage for a coal miner's son  
And she's a bit pretty, just turned twenty-one  
  
Sweet Guinevere you're off to the coal town tonight  
And your young brother Ernie's up in Pittsburgh PA  
You know mother loves you, and dad's in the mine  
So don't go to the coal town, Guinevere, shut the blind  
  
She knows her good mother's not feelin' no pain  
She remembers an explosion and the black falling rain  
She paints her thin lips in her dewy-eyed way  
Then she says to the daughter, dear daughter I pray  
  
Sweet Guinevere you're off to the coal town tonight  
And your young brother Ernie's up in Pittsburgh PA  
You know mother loves you, and dad's in the mine  
So don't go to the coal town, Guinevere, if you're kind
