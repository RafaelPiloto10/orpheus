This is an insight  
Into my life  
This is a strange flight  
I'm taking  
My true will  
Carries me along  
  
This is a soul dance  
Embracing me  
This is the first chance  
To put things right  
Moving on  
Guided by the light  
  
And the spirit of love  
Is rising within me  
Talking to you now  
Telling you clearly  
The fire still burns  
  
Wisdom of ages  
Rush over me  
Heighten my senses  
Enlighten me  
Lead me on  
Eternally  
  
And the spirit of love  
Is rising within me  
Talking to you now  
Telling you clearly  
The fire still burns  
  
I'm talking to you now  
The fire still burns  
Whatever you do now  
The world still turns
