It's so sad, livin' at home  
Far from the city and the midnight fun  
It's so bad, goin' to school  
So far from me and the dirty things that we do  
I'm the king of the night time world  
And you're my headlight queen  
I'm the king of the night time world  
Come live your secret dream  
It's so fine, lovin' with ease  
Far from the house and the family fights  
It's so fine, bein' with you  
Bein' with me makes everything alright  
I'm the king of the night time world  
And you're my headlight queen  
I'm the king of the night time world  
Come live your secret dream, alright  
It's so sad, you're not content  
Far from the music and the neon glow  
Ain't you glad we got the time  
Far from our folks, they'll never ever know  
I'm the king of the night time world  
And you're my headlight queen  
I'm the king of the night time world  
Come live your secret dream  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king  
I'm the king of the night time world  
And you're my headlight queen  
I'm the king of the night time world  
Come live your secret dream  
I'm the king of the night time world  
And you're my headlight queen  
I'm the king of the night time world  
Come live your secret dream  
I'm the king of the night time world  
And you're my headlight queen  
I'm the king of the night time world  
Come live your secret dream  
I'm the king of the night time world
