The sun come up  
It was blue and gold  
The sun come up  
It was blue and gold  
The sun come up  
It was blue and gold  
Ever since I put your picture  
In a frame  
  
Now I come crawling in my Sunday mist  
I come crawling in my Sunday mist  
I come crawling in my Sunday mist  
Ever since I put your picture  
In a frame  
  
And I'm gonna love you  
Till the leaves come off  
Oh yeah  
I'm gonna love you  
Till the leaves fall off  
Oh yeah  
  
I love you baby and I always will  
I love you baby and I always will  
I love you baby and I always will  
Ever since I put your picture  
In a frame  
  
I love you baby and I always will  
Ever since I put your picture  
In a frame
