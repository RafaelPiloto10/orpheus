If I knew then what I know now  
If I knew then you'd be here right now  
I'd trade the world and its gold  
To have and to hold  
The one thing in life I love  
If I knew then oh what I know now  
We would never have drifted apart  
If I Had only taken your dream and made it part of mine  
If I knew then oh what I know now  
If I knew then oh what I know now  
We would never have drifted apart  
If I Had only taken your dream made it part of mine  
If I knew then what I know now
