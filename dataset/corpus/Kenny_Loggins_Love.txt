Love is real, real is love  
Love is feeling, feeling love  
Love is wanting to be loved.  
  
Love is touch, touch is love  
Love is reaching, reaching love  
Love is asking to be loved  
  
Love is you  
You and me  
Love is knowing  
You can be  
  
Love is free, free is love  
Love is living, living, living love  
Love is needing to be loved.  
  
Love is you  
You and me  
Love is wanting  
To be free  
  
Love is knowing  
You will be.
