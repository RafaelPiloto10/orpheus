This time, this place misused, mistakes  
Too long, too late, who was I to make you wait?  
Just one chance, just one breath  
Just in case there's just one left  
'Cause you know you know, you know  
  
[Chorus]  
That I love you I have loved you all along and I miss you  
Been far away for far too long  
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go  
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore  
  
On my knees, I'll ask last chance for one last dance  
'Cause with you, I'd withstand  
All of hell to hold your hand  
I'd give it all I'd give for us  
Give anything, but I won't give up  
'Cause you know you know, you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So far away, so far away  
Been far away for far too long  
So far away, so far away  
Been far away for far too long  
But you know, you know, you know  
  
I wanted, I wanted you to stay  
'Cause I needed, I need to hear you say  
That I love you, I have loved you all along  
And I forgive you, for being away for far too long  
So keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving  
Hold on to me and never let me go  
Keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore  
Believe it, hold on to me and  
Never let me go, keep breathing  
Hold on to me and never let me go (Keep breathing)  
Hold on to me and never let me go
