So you finally got what you wanted  
You've achieved your aim by making me walk in line  
And when you just can't get any higher  
You use your senses to cuss out this weeks climber  
And the small fame that you've acquired  
Has brought you into cult status  
But to me you're still a collector  
  
[Chorus:]  
There's tarts and whores but you're much more  
You're a different kind cause you want their minds  
And you just don't care cause you've got no pride  
Its just a face on your pillowcase  
That thrills you  
  
And you started looking much older  
And your fashion sense is second rate like your perfume  
But to you in your little dream world  
You're still the queen of the butterfly collectors  
  
As you carry on cause its all you know  
You can't light a fire  
You can't cook or sew  
You get from day to day by filling your head  
But surely you must know the appeal between your legs  
Has worn off  
  
And I don't care about morals  
Cause the worlds insane and were all to blame anyway  
And I don't feel any sorrow  
Towards the kings and queens of the butterfly collectors  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As you carry on cause its all you know  
You can't light a fire  
You can't cook or sew  
You get from day to day by filling your head  
But surely you must know the appeal between your legs  
Has worn off  
  
And I don't feel any sorrow  
Towards the kings and queens of the butterfly collectors
