I was a sad and lonely girl  
All alone in this big world, baby, (hey, baby) baby  
Lost in a state of misery  
Not a soul to comfort me, baby (hey, baby)  
  
I couldn't find no help  
Didn't know what to do with myself  
Oh, I was standing in confusion  
So badly disillusioned  
When you wrapped your arms around me  
I knew love had found me  
  
I was lost, so long  
But found in the nick of time  
You know I was lost, so long  
But found in the nick of time  
Oh, I was lost  
  
I thank the lord that you  
Are the one who came to my rescue, baby, (hey, baby)  
Thanks for me and this heart of mine  
You came just in time, baby, baby (hey, baby)  
  
I couldn't find my way, ooh  
Don't you hear what I say?, yeah  
Well I was standing in confusion  
So badly disillusioned  
When you wrapped your arms around me  
I knew love had found me  
  
I was lost, so long  
But found in the nick of time  
You know I was lost (so lost), yeah  
But found in the nick of time  
Well, I was out here in desperation  
No means of communication  
Just looking for a sign  
Then you threw out your lifeline  
  
Lost, so long  
But found in the nick of time  
You know I was lost (so lost), yes I was  
But found in the nick of time  
Well, I was out here in desperation  
No means of communication  
Just looking for a sign  
Then you threw out your lifeline  
Oh, so lost, so long  
But found in the nick of time  
You know I was lost (so lost), yeah  
But found in the nick of time  
Well, I was out here in desperation
