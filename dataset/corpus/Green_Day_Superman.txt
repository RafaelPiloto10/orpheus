Walking down the street, and I find it out if I should leave  
(Cause I've been feeling pretty worthless lately)  
Now I think we should find a place downtown  
A place that I used to hang around  
(and get us something, a cappuccino maybe)  
  
I'm so let down  
I'm so good now  
Now I feel just like superman, going everywhere I can  
I feel just like superman, yeah  
And I feel just like Romeo, if you want a golden rose  
I feel just like Romeo, ohhh yeah  
  
Now I'll have cab or bus and we're  
(Driving down mile 69, here on a bus)  
And I'm finding my way back home  
Because I'm taking back control of my life  
Not afraid cause it feels so right  
(and I feel so much better for this, for this baby)  
  
I'm so let down,  
I'm so good now  
Now I feel just like superman, going everywhere I can  
I feel just like superman, yeah  
And I feel just like Romeo, if you want a golden rose  
I feel just like Romeo, ohhh yeah  
  
I'm so let down,  
I'm so good now  
(Yeah I felt so pushed around man)  
Now I feel just like superman, going everywhere I can  
I feel just like superman, yeah  
And I feel just like Romeo, if you want a golden rose  
I feel just like Romeo  
  
And I feel just like superman (fade)  
Going everywhere I can  
I feel just like superman, yeah
