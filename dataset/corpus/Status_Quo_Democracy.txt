It's coming through a hole in the air,  
From those nights in Tienanmen Square.  
It's coming from the feel  
That this ain't exactly real,  
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there.  
From the wars against disorder,  
From the sirens night and day,  
From the fires of the homeless,  
From the ashes of the gay,  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming through a crack in the wall,  
On a visionary flood of alcohol,  
From the staggering account  
Of the Sermon on the Mount  
Which I don't pretend to understand at all.  
It's coming from the silence  
On the dock of the bay,  
From the brave, the bold, the battered  
Heart of Chevrolet:  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming from the sorrow in the street,  
The holy places where the races meet,  
From the homicidal bitching  
That goes down in every kitchen  
To determine who will serve and who will eat.  
From the wells of disappointment  
Where the women kneel to pray  
For the grace of God in the desert here  
And the desert far away,  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
Sail on, sail on  
Oh mighty Ship of State!  
To the Shores of Need  
Past the Reefs of Greed  
Through the Squalls of Hate  
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.  
  
It's coming to America first,  
The cradle of the best and of the worst.  
It's here they got the range  
And the machinery for change  
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst.  
It's here the family's broken  
And it's here the lonely say  
That the heart has got to open  
In a fundamental way,  
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  
  
It's coming from the women and the men.  
Oh baby, we'll be making love again.  
We'll be going d
