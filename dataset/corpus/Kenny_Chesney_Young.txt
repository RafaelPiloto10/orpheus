Lookin' back now well it makes me laugh,  
We were growin' our hair,  
We were cuttin' class,  
Knew it all already there was nothing to learn,  
We were strikin' matches just to watch em burn.  
  
Listenin' to our music just a little too loud,  
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd,  
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer,  
It was a long train tressle but we had no fear,  
  
Man I don't know where the time goes  
But it sure goes fast, just like that,  
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue  
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes  
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done  
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly  
Young, young  
  
Talked a good game, we were right with the guys  
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy  
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain,  
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change  
  
Man I don't know where the time goes  
But it sure goes fast, just like that  
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue  
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes  
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done  
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly  
Young, young, young  
  
Yeah and wishing we were older  
Young  
Hey I wish it wasn't over  
  
Man I don't know where the time goes,  
But it sure goes fast, just like that  
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue  
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes  
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done  
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly  
Young, young  
  
Hey and wishing we were older  
And I wish it wasn't over
