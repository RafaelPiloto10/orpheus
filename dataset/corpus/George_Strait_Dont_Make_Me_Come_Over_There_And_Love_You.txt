Don't make me come over there and love you  
I'll be beside you in a single Bound  
Don't make me come over there and love you  
Cause I will right now  
I don't need any explanation  
Why I crave all your honey talk  
Don't make me come over there and love you  
'Cause it's a short walk  
You better tone down  
Your persuasion  
Start behaving  
Before I go and fall apart  
My hearts been on a long vacation  
And now its beating like a Cha-Cha-Cha  
Don't make me come over there and love you  
'Cause I will right now  
You better tone down  
Your persuasion  
Start behaving  
Before I go and fall apart  
Don't make me come over there and love you  
Because it's looking like a perfect spot  
Don't make me come over there and love you  
And give all I got  
Don't make me come over there and love you  
'Cause I will right now  
Yes I will right now  
Don't make me come over there and love you
