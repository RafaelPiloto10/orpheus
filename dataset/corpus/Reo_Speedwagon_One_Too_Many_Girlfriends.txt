Talkin' 'bout a hot-wired kid who thought he knew it all  
And what he didn't know, he didn't need to  
Changin' women like tires when their use wore thin  
Retread feelings, that's all we knew  
He's been runnin' lights for years, grindin' down those forward gears  
He's got a lady in the back seat, lady in the front seat  
Eyes on the road and whispers in both ears  
  
[Chorus]  
One too many girlfriends, and too little feeling left  
He better find the one, he's gonna take on the run, before it runs him down  
He's got far too many choices, he better make a few of them  
He wants to have it all, and wind up standin' tall  
I hope his dream never ends, I guess it just depends  
He's got one too many girlfriends  
  
Well there's so damn much writin' written on his walls  
I can't imagine that he doesn't read it  
Such a loud clear message screaming through the halls  
Keep your advice, he don't need it  
He's heard of living up to the truth, thinks it means giving up his youth  
He doesn't want to get a haircut, looking for a shortcut  
He needs a change, he needs more than a phone booth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whooo, there's anger and romance at every turn  
Whooo, be careful boy that you don't crash and burn  
You're in about as deep as you can get  
It's a matter of time before you get wet  
I wouldn't be in your shoes on a bet  
  
He's been runnin' lights for years, grindin' down those forward gears  
He's got a lady in the back seat, lady in the front seat  
Eyes on the road and whispers in both ears  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's got one too many girlfriends... look out!
