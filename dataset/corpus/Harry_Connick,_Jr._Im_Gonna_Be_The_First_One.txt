I don't much care  
If I am the last in line to see  
Whatever that it is  
That they're lining up to see  
You see, it doesn't concern me  
  
I don't much care  
If I am the very last to know  
Whatever that it is  
That they know about, oh, no  
Oh, no I really don't care to know  
  
'Cause when it comes to Santa Claus  
And presents 'round the tree  
No one I know could ever get jump on me  
  
I'm gonna be the first one  
Up on Christmas morning  
I'm gonna be the first one  
Up on Christmas day  
  
I've always heard that the  
Early birdie catches all the worms  
But worms ain't for me, no  
They're not my cup of tea  
And I am certainly not a birdie  
Me, I'd rather sleep 'til three  
  
'Cause when it comes to Santa Claus  
And presents 'round the tree  
No one I know could ever get jump on me  
  
I'm gonna be the first one  
Up on Christmas morning  
I'm gonna be the first one  
Up on Christmas day
