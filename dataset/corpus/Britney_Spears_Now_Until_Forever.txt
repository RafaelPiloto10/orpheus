Oh yeah...  
They say in this world,  
Love can't last forever,  
But I don't believe that's true.  
Cos the way that I feel when we're together,  
I know that's the way,  
I'll always feel for you.  
  
From now until forever,  
That's how long I'll be true,  
I'll make you this vow,  
And promise you now until forever,  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
There'll come a day when the world stops turning,  
And stars will fall from the sky,  
But this feeling will last when the sun stops burning,  
All I wanna do is love you until the end of time.  
  
From now until forever,  
That's how long I'll be true,  
I'll make you this vow,  
And promise you now until forever,  
I'll never stop, never stop,  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
It's gonna take more than a lifetime,  
To give you all the love I feel for you tonight.  
  
From now until forever,  
That's how long I'll be true,  
I'll make you this vow,  
And promise you now until forever,  
I'll never stop, never stop,  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
From now until forever,  
That's how long I'll be true,  
I'll make you this vow,(oh yeah)  
And promise you now until forever,  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
Until forever,  
I'll never stop loving you.
