I'm plowing through a crowd of worthless hatred  
That's falling down, at least they start to fry  
Why can't I be removed, take their places?  
Sometimes it's better to eat their scars  
  
These are the times of the waking liar  
Hold him close or you will expire  
Holding on to the place you're thinking  
Total deceit  
  
I like to lose hope  
Recede and cope  
Like a beautiful rape  
These things, aren't they great?  
  
I'm terrified by emotionless faces  
They're all around me I want to die  
I'm fucking trippin' out seeing faces  
Of murderers covered in lye  
  
These are the times of the waking liar  
Hold him close or you will expire  
Holding on to the place you're thinking  
Total deceit  
  
I like to lose hope  
Recede and cope  
Like a beautiful rape  
These things, aren't they great?  
  
I love the things that make you upset  
The more you hurt, the stronger I get  
I love the things that make you upset  
The more you hurt, the stronger I get!  
  
I like to lose hope  
Recede and cope  
Like a beautiful rape  
These things, aren't they great?  
Aren't they great?
