London times  
Hear they were the golden times  
Captured all the hearts and minds  
Oh how the memory shines  
Like diamonds  
Keep shining, like diamonds  
London times  
Say they were the best of times  
Dancing till the big bell chimes  
Oh how the memory shines  
Like diamonds  
Keep shining, keep shining  
Shine away  
Those were the days of (power?)  
Sing yeah for the Beatle and the Stone  
These were the days  
Yeah yeah yeah  
-repeat chorus-
