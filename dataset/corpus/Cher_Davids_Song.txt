Won't you let me rock and roll you baby  
I haven't seen you in a long, long time  
I haven't fooled around with any candles lately  
Just thought you might have some music in mind  
Oh, I just want to serenade you  
Maybe we could even live a verse or two  
And I could finish this old love song  
So I could start singing it to you, oh  
I could start singing it to you  
If I could finish this old love song  
Then I could start singing it to you  
Won't you come and boogie-woogie with me, baby  
It's been a while since I held you close to me  
I haven't met many boys like you, baby  
Knew I would find you eventually  
Oh, I just want to serenade you  
Maybe we could even live a verse or two  
And I could finish this old love song  
So I could start singing it to you, oh baby  
I could start singing it to you, oh honey  
If I could finish this old love song  
Then I could start singing it to you  
If I could finish this old love song  
Then I could start singing it  
Then I could start singing it to you  
Oh, to you, oh, to you baby, you  
I said, to you
