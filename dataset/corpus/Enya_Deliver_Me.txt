Deliver me, out of my sadness  
Deliver me, in all of the madness  
Deliver me, courage ot guide me  
Deliver me, straight from inside me  
  
All of my life, I've been in hiding  
Wishing there was someone just like you  
Now that your here, now that I've found you  
I know that youre the one to pull me through  
  
Deliver me, loving and caring  
Deliver me, giving and sharing  
Deliver me, across that I'm bearing  
  
All of my life I was in hiding  
Wishing there was someone just like you  
Now that your here, no w that I've found you  
I know that youre the one to pull me through  
  
Deliver me(deliver me)  
Deliver me(deliver me)  
  
All of my life I was in hiding  
Wishing there was someone just like you  
Now that your here, now that i'ver found you  
I know that youre the one to pull me through  
  
Deliver me (deliver me)  
Oh deliver me (deliver me)  
Wont you deliver me
