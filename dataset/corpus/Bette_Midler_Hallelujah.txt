I don't know if you can hear me  
Or if you're even there  
I don't know if you would listen  
To a humble prayer  
Yes, I know I'm just an outcast  
I shouldn't speak to you  
Still I see your face and wonder  
Were you once an outcast too  
  
I ask for nothing  
I can get by  
But I know so many  
Less lucky than I  
God help the outcasts  
The poor and down trod  
I thought we all were  
The children of God  
  
I don't know if there's a reason  
  
Why some are blessed, some not  
Why the few you seem to favour  
They fear us  
Flee us  
Try not to see us  
  
God help the outcasts  
The tattered the torn  
Seeking an answer  
To why they were born  
Winds of misfortune  
Have blown them about  
You made the outcasts  
Don't cast them out  
  
The poor and unlucky  
The weak and the odd  
I thought we all were  
The children of  
God...
