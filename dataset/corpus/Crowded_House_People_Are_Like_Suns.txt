Sweet madness it must be wrong  
What kind of fool imagines love  
With all this going on  
Stars burning in the empty sky  
And the city is aflame  
With a million lights  
And they come and they go  
In the blink of an eye  
People are like suns  
Science will enable us to hear  
To be crystal clear  
To make diamonds in the shifting sand  
Better take all the love that you got in a single hand  
And they come and they go  
In the fullness of time  
People are like suns  
They are burning up inside  
People are like suns  
Breathing into life  
All that's good in us  
To saints become  
And they come and they go  
Yeah they come and they go  
People are like suns  
People are like suns  
And we'll go out tonight  
Set the town alight  
All fade into white
