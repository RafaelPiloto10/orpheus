Ooooo...  
I'm crazy about you  
I'll give you all my love  
Yes I'm crazy about you  
Night and day, day and night  
I'll be your heart's salvation  
  
Hey baby, let's stay together  
Let's make it now and forever  
I want to show it and shout it  
And tell the whole world about it  
  
I thought it never could happen  
I thought you never would see me  
You run a lovin' locomotive  
You make my needs very primitive  
  
The more I get, the more I want from you, of your affection  
When you're around, I'm in control, I feel a complete connection  
  
Hello, hello  
I'm so crazy about you, you know... baby  
Hello, hello, hello  
Yes I'm crazy, so crazy about you  
  
C'mon close your eyes, honey, trust me!  
I want to enjoy your body  
I want to take you much higher  
And play the game of desire  
  
Well I can't hide  
I'm getting hungry for a bite  
I'm blinded by this obsession  
I keep dancing like your possession  
  
I'll wrap my legs all around you I'll show you total devotion  
No need to talk love will speak to you with sweet emotions  
  
Hello, hello  
I'm so crazy about you, you know...baby  
Hello, hello, hello  
Yes I'm crazy, so crazy about you
