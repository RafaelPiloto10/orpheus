Can I swallow the soil  
Make it all beautiful?  
Can I carry it, carry it, carry it now?  
  
The truth can't bare the sunlight  
You're afraid for the day it does  
Hell when I told you so  
I got burn, burn, burned again  
  
Heaven forbid that my heart is forsaken  
Hope in the end truth prevails  
  
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world  
Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try  
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world  
Need to find my way home, home  
  
He earns fire as a god  
But I believed in your heart  
And I'm leaving you, leaving you, leaving you now  
  
The truth can't bare the sunlight  
And don't pretend to be my guide  
Heard you said you'd change it over  
But I got burn, burn, burned instead  
  
Heaven can wait cause my soul is forsaken  
Hope in the end truth prevails  
  
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world  
Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try  
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world  
Need to find my way home, home  
  
Just to fall out, no more rain  
Once upon a time
