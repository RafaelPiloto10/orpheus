Baby, I may never know exactly what you're feelin'  
But I've seen you on another roll  
Maybe I'm that last to see the glances you've been stealing  
What you're looking for is takin' its toll  
  
No guarantees, so baby please  
Got to keep the sugar coating to yourself  
Either stay with me, or set me free  
Gotta let me get myself off the shelf  
  
I've been here, it's all clear...  
You've already gone  
And I know  
'Cause it shows  
You're already gone!  
  
And you're already gone  
Down the road  
All on your own  
Check please, Louise  
What did I expect?  
  
And you're already gone  
Down the road  
Ain't nobody home  
Check please, new squeeze Thank you very... next!  
  
And so, now, we find ourselves  
Exactly where we started  
Tryin' to fall in love with somebody else  
Don't know how to play this game  
And not be broken-hearted  
And I can't believe the lies I'm gonna tell  
  
Don't lie to me, Pinocchio  
Gotta keep the sugar coating to yourself  
Baby, stay with me or let me go  
Gotta let me get myself off the shelf  
You can't hide, down inside  
You're already gone!  
  
I'll be fine in my mind  
You're already gone!  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
All on your own  
Check please, Louise  
  
What did I expect?  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
Ain't nobody home  
Check please, new squeeze  
Thank you very... NEXT!  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
All on your own...  
Check please, new squeeze  
What did I expect?  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
All on your own...  
Check please, new squeeze  
Thank you very... NEXT!  
  
And you're already gone, down the road All on your own...  
Check please, Louise  
What did I expect from you  
Baby, baby, baby  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
Ain't nobody home  
Check please, new squeeze  
Check please!  
  
I wants to thank you all very... NEXT!
