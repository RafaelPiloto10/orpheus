Why this car is automatic  
It's systematic  
It's hydromatic  
Why it's greased lightning (Greased lightning)  
  
We'll get some overhead lifters and some four barrel quads

(Keep talking whoa keep talking)  
A fuel injection cutoff and chrome plated rods oh yeah  
(I'll get the money I'll kill to get the money)  
With a four speed on the floor they'll be waiting at the door  
You know that ain't no shit we'll be getting lots of tit  
In Greased Lightning  
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Go greased lightning you're coasting through the heat lap trial  
You are supreme the chicks'll cream for greased lightning

Purple french tail lights and thirty inch fins

A Palomino dashboard and duel muffler twins

With new pistons, plugs, and shocks I can get off my rocks  
You know that I ain't bragging she's a real pussy wagon  
Greased lightning  
  
Go greased lightning you're burning up the quarter mile  
(Greased lightning go greased lightning)  
Go greased lighting you're coasting through the heat lap trial  
You are supreme the chicks'll cream for greased lightning  
Go greased lightning you're burning up the quarter mile
