You may have left your mistake with breakfast  
Watching the sun go down  
I've been lying awake till dawn now  
I'm not ready to face that  
I'm not ready to face that thing today  
  
I wish I was high  
Brighter than nothing  
Smarter than nobody  
I've wasted away  
  
I think of the things that matter  
And I think of the things that don't  
Whatever it is no matter  
I hate feeling the way I feel  
I hate feeling the way I eel today  
  
I wish I was high  
Brighter than nothing  
Smarter than nobody  
I've wasted away  
  
I see myself with headphones on  
I'm listening to Wake of the Flood  
I'm listening to Wake of the Flood  
Now I'm high  
  
I wish I was high  
Brighter than nothing  
Smarter than nobody  
I've wasted away  
I wish I was high  
Brighter than nothing  
Smarter than nobody  
I've wasted away
