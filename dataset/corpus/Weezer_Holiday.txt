Let's go away for a while  
You and I  
To a strange and distant land  
Where they speak no word of truth  
But we don't understand anyway  
  
[Chorus:]  
Holiday  
Far away, to stay  
On a Holiday, far away  
Let's go today  
In a heartbeat!  
Heartbeat, heartbeat  
  
Don't bother to pack your bags  
Or your map  
We won't need them where we're goin'  
We're goin' where the wind is blowin'  
Not knowin' where we're gonna stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We will write a postcard  
To our friends and family  
In free verse  
On the road with Kerouac  
Sheltered in Bivouac  
On this road we'll never die...  
  
Let's go away for a while  
You and I  
To a strange and distant land  
Where they speak no word of truth  
But we don't understand anyway  
  
[Chorus]
