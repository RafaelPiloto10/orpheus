Well I woke up this morning, looked out the door  
I could tell that was my milkcow, by the way that she lowed  
So if you see my milkcow, please send her home  
Well I ain't had no milk and butter  
Ooh, since my cow's been gone  
  
Tried everything baby, to get along with you  
Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do  
Gonna stop my cryin' , leave you alone  
If you don't think I'm leavin'  
You just count the days I'm gone  
'Cause you' re gonna need me  
Need your lovin' daddy one of these days  
Yeah, and you gonna be oh-so-sorry you treated me this way
