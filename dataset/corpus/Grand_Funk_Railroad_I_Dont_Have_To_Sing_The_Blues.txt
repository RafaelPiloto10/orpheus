I've got this good lookin' woman back home, let me tell ya'  
She cooks good and she looks good, and she just can't do no wrong.  
She cooks me cornbread in the morning, she's my dinner and my midnight snack.  
She sits up and she begs, and she even rolls over on her back.  
  
CHORUS  
Please don't tell me that's the way that it goes, 'cause I've tried hard and I
know.  
I ain't been playin' in your back yard, 'cause I got my baby and she loves me
so.  
  
She don't treat me mean, and she loves my machine, yeah.  
I digs her 'cause she's funky, and she sure keeps it clean, now.  
I'm a loafer, she's my chauffeur, and she sure likes to drive me, uh-huh.  
I lay my life on the line, and she steps right up besides me, yeah.  
  
CHORUS  
  
I don't have to sing the blues no more.  
A girl like mine is hard to find for sure.  
She lays it on me each and every night.  
She's my pleasure and my world's delight.  
  
I don't have to sing the blues no more.  
A girl like mine is hard to find for sure.  
She lays it on me each and every night.  
She's my pleasure and my world's delight.
