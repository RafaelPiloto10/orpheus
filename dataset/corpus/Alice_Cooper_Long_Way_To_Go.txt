We still got a long way to go  
We still got a long way to go  
We all got a long way to go  
  
What's keeping us apart isn't selfishness  
What's holding us together isn't love  
Listen to the man who's been  
touched all his life  
Yes he's the one they call the fool  
  
Where is the saviour of the sidewalk life  
and the road that takes us to the crusades  
I've seen those shadows  
as they're moving in my sleep  
leading the blind poet to his grave  
  
We still got a long way to go  
We still got a long way to go  
Yes we all got a long way to go  
  
Please don't waste your energy on me my friend  
cause we still got a long way to go  
we'll meet again some day  
but right now just go away  
'cause I still got a long way to go  
  
The silence is speaking  
so why am I weeping  
I guess I love it  
I love it to death  
  
Yes we still got a long way to go  
Yes we still got a long way to go  
Yes we all got a long way to go
