Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
  
She is sorry to be delayed,  
But last evening down at lovers lane, she strayed  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
  
When she woke from her dream  
And found that her love had gone  
Madam...  
She ran to the man  
Who had led her so far astray  
  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
  
Then the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail  
Madam...  
They strung her upon  
A willow across the way  
  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today
