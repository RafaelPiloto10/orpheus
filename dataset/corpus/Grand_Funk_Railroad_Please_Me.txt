Five million guys have tried to reduce her,  
To another girl out in the street.  
All those pretty eyes, have lied to seduce her,  
But they come crawlin' back at her feet.  
  
Too many times, I've seen them abuse her,  
Just like the times I've been deceived.  
The touch of her starlight makes me happy,  
I can see her shinin' through in my dreams.  
  
And I wake up cryin' ...  
Chorus  
Please me ...  
Please me, baby.  
Please me ...  
Please me out of my he...eaeaea...ad.  
Please me, baby.  
  
Everybody's been a toy for someone,  
So take me if you want to play.  
Tease me even if it's only for fun,  
And let me play the game on another day.  
  
Chorus  
  
Please me, baby.  
Please me, baby.  
Please me, baby.  
Please me baby, please me baby ... yeah,  
Please me, baby.  
Please me baby, please ...  
Please me, baby.  
Please me, baby.  
  
Suck it.
