Needed you, you were only using  
Needing you just tore me down  
And here I stand in isolation  
Feeling emptiness and doubt  
Walking down the broken highway  
Sucking sugar plain and sweet  
Did your mother ever tell you  
That the joyful are free  
  
I need some lovin'  
Like an inmate needs a dime  
I need some lovin'  
Like a poet needs a rhyme  
Here I stand in isolation  
My empty hands in isolation  
Walking down the broken highway  
Sucking sugar cause it's my way  
  
Find me one heart to complete with  
Heading for the farthest reaches  
I need some lovin'  
Like a body needs a soul  
I need some lovin'  
Like a fastball needs control  
Here I stand in isolation  
My empty hands in isolation  
Strike up the band  
In this proud land  
  
Got a lot to do  
Got a lot to say  
Got a life to live  
Here I stand-  
In isolation
