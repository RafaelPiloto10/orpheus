I spread my wings and fly  
I'm the ruler of the skies  
Avoided my detection  
So I've been here all my life  
Floating up, diving down, hovering left and right  
There's no escaping me  
I'll make you out at night  
  
Up from the sky I peek below  
Seeking easy prey  
To find the rodent that you are  
Dive forward, in a flash  
I'm taking aim and closing in  
Your life and limb are at my mercy  
  
I sink my claws  
Into your flesh  
Tear it up  
Rip it all apart  
You've got no choice, I will prevail  
  
I fly around and laugh  
Like the rascal that I am  
See my own reflection in a lake  
As I sweep across the land  
I crave a goat but the dogs are out  
Running left and right  
There's no escaping these  
I better make it home by night  
  
Up from the sky I peek below  
Seeking easy prey  
To find the rodent that you are  
Dive forward, in a flash  
I'm taking aim and closing in  
Your life and limb are at my mercy  
  
I sink my claws  
Into your flesh  
Tear it up  
Rip it all apart  
You've got no choice, I will prevail  
  
I sink my claws  
Into your flesh  
Tear it up  
Rip it all apart  
You've got no choice, I will prevail  
  
I spread my wings and fly
