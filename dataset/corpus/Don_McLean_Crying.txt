I was all right for a while, I could smile for a while  
But when I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight  
When you stopped to say "Hello"  
And though you wished me well, you couldn't tell  
  
That I'd been crying over you, crying over you  
Then you said "so long" left me standing all alone  
Alone and crying, crying, crying crying  
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand  
Can start me crying  
  
I thought that I was over you but it's tru-ue, so true  
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do  
For you don't love me and I'll always be  
  
Crying over you, crying over you  
Yes, now you're gone and from this moment on  
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying  
Yeah crying, crying, over you
