(CHORUS)  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, oh honey  
  
I've got your picture hanging on the wall  
But it can't see or come to me  
When I call your name  
I realize it's just a picture in a frame  
  
I read your letters  
When you're not here  
But they don't move me  
And they don't groove me  
Like when I hear your sweet voice  
Whispering in my ear  
  
Don't you know  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no  
  
I play my game of fantasy  
And I pretend that I'm not in reality  
I need the shelter of  
Your arms to comfort me  
  
No other sound is quite  
The same as your name  
No touch can do half as much  
To make me feel better  
So let's stay together  
  
I've got the memories  
To look back on and though  
They help me when you're gone  
I'm well aware, nothing can  
Take the place of your being there  
  
So glad we've got the real thing, baby  
So glad we've got the real thing, oh darling  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing  
  
Tell, tell me  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing
