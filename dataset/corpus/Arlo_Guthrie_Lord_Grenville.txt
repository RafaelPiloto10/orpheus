Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn  
It's time to haul the anchor up and leave the land astern  
We'll be gone before the dawn returns  
Like voices onthe wind.  
  
Go and tell Lord Grenville that our dreams have run aground  
There's nothing here to keep us in this shanty town  
None of us are caring where we're bound  
Like voices on the wind.  
  
And come the day you'll hear them saying  
"They're throwing it all away"  
Nothing more to say  
Just throwing it all away.  
  
Go and fetch the captain's log and tear the pages out  
We're on our way to nowhere now, can't bring the helm about  
None of us are left in any doubt  
We won't be back again.  
  
Send a message to the fleet, they'll search for us in vain  
We won't be there among the reaches of the Spanish Main  
Tell the ones we left home not to wait  
We won't be back again.  
  
And come the day you'll hear them saying  
"They're throwing it all away"  
Nothing more to say  
Just throwing it all away.  
  
Our time is just a point along a line  
That runs forever with no end  
I never thought that we would come to find  
Ourselves upon these rocks again.  
  
Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn...
