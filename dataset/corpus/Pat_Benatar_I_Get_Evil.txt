There's two kinds of people that I just can't stand  
An evil hearted woman and a lyin' man  
But don't you lie to me, don't you lie to me  
Because it makes me feel like it's as evil as I can be  
Told me that you loved me a long time ago  
The woman that you had, you don't want her no more  
But don't you lie to me, don't you lie to me  
Because it makes me feel like it's as evil as a woman can be  
  
You told me that you loved me a long time ago  
The woman that you had, you don't want her no more  
But don't you lie to me, don't you lie to me  
Because it makes me feel like it's as evil as a woman can be  
  
Hey, don't you lie to me  
Don't you lie to me  
No, no, don't you lie to me  
Don't you lie to me  
Because it makes me feel like it's as evil as a woman can be  
Don't you lie to me  
Don't you lie to me baby - no  
Don't you lie to me  
No don't you lie to me
