Love in Jamaica but I gotta go home  
Ten days I'm in Jamaica workin'  
Ain't had a chance to get out  
And do too much a nuthin' else but a workin'  
It's killin' me  
Ain't had a chance to get that chicken jerkin'  
Responsibility tasting victory but desire lurkin'  
He callin' me, I been recordin' writing vibin' and rhymin'  
Nothin' but heat haven't even had a chance to see the island  
I need that  
Me and the team we got a dreamer comin'  
Despite we heard about through word of mouth is club asylum  
Lets finish up and like the breeze of the seas we arrive at the party  
Hostess she desire flirtin' heavily with me  
Got me thinkin' things I really probably shouldn't be  
Every time she move, she look at me  
Girl stop shakin', you got my will breakin'  
Love in Jamaica but I gotta go home  
I got my girl waitin', I'm supposed to land at eight and  
If I'm not their then I can't go home

I'm about to ask you to take me home  
Please stop shakin', you got my will breakin'  
Love in Jamaica but I gotta go home  
Every time she moves  
I don't know how to act  
Came to get my groove on not to get my groove back  
Her eyes deep enough to swim in, she grinnin'  
Her innocence inspire thoughts of sin an'  
Crazy right, she got a flower so long and smilin'  
Her shakin' makin Jamaica seem like temptation island  
I'm wilin' 'cause man she hot  
What I'm a do  
Feeling like the moment of truth  
Making my conscious loving and move  
What's a brother to do  
Makin' me feen, desire the Jamaican queen  
Making me hatin' to leave 'cause the shakin' is mean  
Wind ya hips, got me going fine to this island miss  
But I'm monogomous so far y'all  
Girl stop shakin', you got my will breakin'  
Love in Jamaica but I gotta go home  
I got my girl waitin', I'm supposed to land at eight and  
If I'm not their then I can't go home

I'm about to ask you to take me home  
Please stop shakin', you got my will breakin'
