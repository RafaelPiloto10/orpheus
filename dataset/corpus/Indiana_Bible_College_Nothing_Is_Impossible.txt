[Chorus:]  
Through You I can do anything  
I can do all things  
'Cause it's You who gives me strength  
Nothing is impossible  
Through You blind eyes are open  
Strongholds are broken  
I am living by faith  
Nothing is impossible  
  
[Verse]  
I'm not gonna live by what I see  
I'm not gonna live by what I feel  
Deep down I know that You're here with me  
I know that You can do anything  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Tag] 2x  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe  
In You  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Tag]
