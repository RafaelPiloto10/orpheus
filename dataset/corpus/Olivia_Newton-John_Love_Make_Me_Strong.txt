There's no power capable of  
Coming between us--dividing our love  
To be faithful I have sworn  
Together we can weather the storm  
  
Our tomorrows are ticking away  
Our hands are tied--we're victims of fate  
In my darkness I will pray  
For destiny to send me your way  
  
Love make me strong  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Love make me strong  
A tower of strength to lean upon  
  
Love make me strong  
The seven seas won't keep us apart  
Not with an ocean of love in my heart  
My devotion will see me through  
  
'Cause nothing's gonna keep me from you  
Love make me strong  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Love make me strong  
  
A tower of strength to lean upon  
Love make me strong  
Oh it's a sad sad story  
True lovers forced to part  
  
Shot down in all it's glory  
You'll hear the sound of broken hearts  
My devotion will see me through  
'Cause nothing's gonna keep me from you  
  
Love make me strong  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Love make me strong  
A tower of strength to lean upon  
  
Love make me strong  
Oh oh love make me strong  
Love make me strong, make me strong  
Love make me strong
