On this day  
To be standing here with you  
There's no doubt  
I know this love is true  
See my tears  
Only you can understand  
A state of grace  
I feel blessed to hold your hand  
There's a room in my heart  
And you've unlocked a door  
That no one's ever opened before  
  
With your love I'm not alone  
In your world  
I'm never far away from home  
A life I thought I'd never find  
In your eyes I see all that I am  
With your love  
  
On my own  
I searched for something more  
In your arms  
The kiss I've waited for  
I was lost for words  
To say what's in my heart  
Just to be close  
To the beauty that you are  
If someone could see  
To the end of our lives  
I know they'd find me there  
By your side  
  
With your love I'm not alone  
In your world  
I'm never far away from home  
A life I thought I'd never find  
In your eyes I see all that I am  
With your love  
  
I've walked among the lonely  
Watching lovers come and go  
Fate finds us here as one  
You are salvation to my soul  
  
With your love I'm not alone  
In your world  
I'm never far away from home  
A life I thought I'd never find  
In your eyes I see all that I am  
With your love  
  
With your love  
With your love
