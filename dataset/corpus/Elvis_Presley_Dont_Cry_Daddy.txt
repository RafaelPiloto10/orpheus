Today I stumbled from my bed  
With thunder crashing in my head,  
My pillow still wet  
From last night's tears  
As I think of giving up  
A voice inside my coffee cup  
Kept crying out  
Ringing in my ears  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't cry, daddy  
Daddy, please don't cry  
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy  
And together we'll find a brand new mommy  
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again  
Daddy, ride us on your back again  
Oh, daddy  
Please  
Don't cry  
  
Why are children always first  
To feel the pain and the hurt the worst  
It's true but somehow  
It just don't seem right  
'Cause every time I cry I know  
It hurts my little children so I wonder  
Will it be the same tonight  
  
[Chorus:x2]  
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
