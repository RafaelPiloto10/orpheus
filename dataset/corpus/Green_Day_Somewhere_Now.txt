[Verse 1]  
I'm running late to somewhere now  
I don't want to be  
Where the future and promises ain't what it used to be  
I never wanted to compromise and bargain with my soul  
How did life on the wild side ever get so dull?  
  
I've grown up and am medicated  
On my own Cellular waves  
I put the riot in Patriot  
And we all die in threes  
I got a scene in the middle of the road  
Im gonna take my time  
I shop online so I can vote  
At the speed of life  
Im like a drone way up in the sky  
Im a shooting star  
There's a soldier thats freaking out  
Because this is war!  
  
I've grown up and am medicated  
On my own Cellular waves  
I put the riot in Patriot  
And we all die in threes  
  
All I want is weed and guns  
A new catastrophe, yeah  
Here comes nothing, theres nothing to lose  
Its a small price we pay  
When we all die in threes  
  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
  
Hallelujiah! I found my soul  
Under the sofa pillows  
Congratulations, I found myself  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere Now  
Somewhere Now
