  
  
In this grey world where nobody sings  
I saw the face of a human doll  
Her eyes were glass and her hair was gold  
From her sweet soft lips  
You could hear that song go  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
In a place where hell is around the corner  
I touched her hand it was baby sweet  
She kissed me there  
I could feel the song going down my throat  
She was singing to me  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
My daddy said if you want to live  
You better not touch this is not a toy  
The truth is boy I'm a bloody fool  
I left the one I loved behind, singing  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
Tell me what it is that brings me back to you  
Tell me what it is I can't stop loving you  
Tell me what it is that brings me back to you  
Tell me what it is I can't stop loving you  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
So take me back to the land of yours  
Where the black swan loves the one I lost  
My generation sings with the radio on  
The melody of the human doll  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...
