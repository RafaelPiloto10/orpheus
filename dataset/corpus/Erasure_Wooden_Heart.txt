Can't you see  
I love you  
Please don't break my heart in two  
It's not hard to do  
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart  
  
And if you say goodbye  
Then I know that I would cry  
Surely I would die  
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart  
  
There's no strings upon this love of mine  
It was always you from the start  
Treat me nice  
Treat me good  
Treat me like you really should  
I'm not made of wood  
And I don't have a wooden heart  
  
Muss I denn, muss I denn  
Zum stadtele hinaus  
Stadtele hinaus  
Und du, mein schat, bleibst hier?  
  
Muss I denn, muss I denn  
Zum stadtele hinaus  
Stadtele hinaus  
Und du, mein schat, bleibst hier?  
  
There's no strings upon this heart of mine  
It was always you from the start  
Sei mir gut  
Sei mir gut  
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst  
Wie du wirklich sollst
