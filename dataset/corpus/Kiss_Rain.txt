Tell me what you want me to be  
I can't stand myself anymore  
Tell me what you want me to see  
I can't find my way off the floor  
Took me like a hurricane  
  
I think it's gonna rain,  
Yeah I think it's gonna rain  
Rain down on me  
  
Tell me what you want me to hear  
Whisper words inside of my head  
Thunder like a gun in my ear  
Clouds are burstin' over my bed  
Wash me like a hurricane  
  
I think it's gonna rain  
Yeah I think it's gonna rain  
I think it's gonna rain down down down  
I think it's gonna rain  
  
Open your eyes  
You can't deny  
It's just a fantasy  
Yeah some things will end  
Some will begin  
Some things will never be  
Yea  
Rain down on me  
Tell me what you want me to know  
Tell me what you're dyin' to say  
Throw your feelings up in the air  
Let the pieces fall where they may  
  
Open your eyes  
You can't deny  
It's just a fantasy  
Yeah some things will end  
Some will begin  
Some things will never be  
Yeah I think it's gonna rain  
I think it's gonna rain  
I think it's gonna rain  
Yeah I think it's gonna rain  
Rain down on me  
Rain down on me  
Rain down on me
