  
CHORUS:  
LAY DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
WE'VE BOTH GOT TO SLEEP ON THE COLD, COLD GROUND  
THE WINDS BLOWIN' COLDER AND THE SUN'S GOIN' DOWN  
LAY DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
WE HIT THIS OLD BEEF TRAIL JUST TWO MONTHS AGO  
WE BLISTERED IN THE SUN AND WE FROZE IN THE SNOW  
IN TEN DAYS WE'RE COMIN TO A PACKING HOUSETOWN  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
THIS DODGE CITY TRAIL SHE'S A HARD ROAD TO GO  
UP THE TEXAS FLATLANDS THROUGH OLD MEXICO  
I GOT DUST IN MY EYES AND MUD IN MY NOSE  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
CHORUS  
THAT BAD HOLE OF WATER WE DRUNK AND GOT SICK  
CURLED UP OUT HAIR, TIED OUR TAILS BACK IN KINKS  
WE GOT LOST IN A BLIND CANYON, TIPPY-TOEIN' AROUND  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
HERE NOW WE COME TO THE END OF OUR TRAIL  
YOUR HAIR, HIDE AND CARCASS TO THE STOCKYARDS I SELL  
I'LL SEE YOU IN A TIN CAN WHEN YOU GET SHIPPED AROUND  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
CHORUS
