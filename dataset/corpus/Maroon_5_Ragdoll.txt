Rag Doll  
How ya feelin'?  
The day has had its way with both of us  
And no, I've gone out of my way  
But I'm not free  
From this pain I'm reelin'  
I was a fool to think some day you would come around  
But no no no I'm not thinking that way  
'Cause now I see  
  
You are not what you seem  
You are a mystery to me  
Sometimes I just wanna scream  
  
I think you should just go away cause  
There's no necessity for you to stay and  
Next time you come around my way  
Forget it baby your not comin' in  
  
How's your day been?  
'Cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns  
But no no no I feel better today  
'Cause I'm off my knees  
  
You are not what you seem  
You are a mystery to me  
Sometimes I just wanna scream  
  
I think you should just go away cause  
There's no necessity for you to stay and  
Next time you come around my way  
Forget it baby your not comin' in  
  
A heart made for a lot of sorrow  
No you can't come back tomorrow  
Shut my windows, lock my doors  
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore  
Yeah  
  
I think you should just go away cause  
there's no necessity for you to stay and  
Next time you come around my way  
Forget it baby your not comin' in  
  
A heart made for a lot of sorrow  
No you can't come back tomorrow  
Shut my windows, lock my doors  
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore  
Whoa
