How can I begin to  
Tell you what you do to  
Me every time I hear ya  
More willing to wanna see ya  
  
I know that there's no use in  
Tryin' to explain the confusion  
But still I'm not complainin'  
'Bout my situation  
  
Let's not talk about a  
Possible ending  
  
The very first time that I  
Was lookin' to be your fellow  
I found my inspiration  
Hidin' in your expression  
So I put myself on forward  
For your consideration  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let's not talk about a  
Possible ending  
Let's not think about it  
Every day  
And I know  
I'm so  
In love  
With you  
I'm finding it harder and harder to breath  
Every time I'm near  
My beautiful woman  
  
And so we put the top down  
To take you drivin' downtown  
I guess we'll know just what to do  
When you're lookin' to fool around  
  
It's too late to stop me  
I know we're gonna get down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My beautiful woman  
My beautiful woman  
My beautiful woman  
  
B is for beautiful as the sunshine  
E tells me everything is feelin' alright  
A goes to  
You and me swingin' it down  
T is two  
I want you  
You've got me actin' like a fool  
  
[Chorus:]
