I been caught sideways out here on the crossroads  
Tryin' to buy back the pieces I lost of my soul  
It's hard when the devil won't get off your back  
It's like carryin' around the past in a hundred pound sack  
  
Today, I'm gonna keep on walkin'  
I'm gonna hold my head up high  
Gonna leave it all behind  
Today, I'm gonna stand out in the rain  
Let it wash it all away, yeah, wash it all away  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
  
Skeletons and ghosts are hidin' in the shadows  
Threatening me with all the things that they know  
Choices and mistakes - they all know my name  
I'm through holdin' in and holdin' on to all that pain  
  
Today, I'm gonna keep on walkin'  
I'm gonna hold my head up high  
Got no more tears to cry  
Today, I'm gonna stand out in the rain  
Let it wash it all away, yeah, wash it all away  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
  
I know, I know, I know, I know I been forgiven  
I know, I know, I know, I'm gonna start livin'  
  
Today, I'm gonna keep on walkin'  
I'm gonna hold my head up high  
I'm gonna leave it all behind  
Today, I'm gonna stand out in the rain  
Let it wash it all away, yeah, wash it all away  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
  
Oh, oh, oh yeah
