I thought it was over, baby  
We said our goodbyes  
But I can't go a day without your face  
Goin' through my mind  
  
In fact, not a single minute  
Passes without you in it  
Your voice, your touch, memories of your love  
Are with me all of the time  
  
Let me let go, baby  
Let me let go  
If this is for the best, why are you still in my heart  
Are you still in my soul, let me let go  
  
I talked to you the other day  
Looks like you made your escape  
You put us behind, no matter how I try  
I can't do the same  
  
Let me let go, baby  
Let me let go  
It just isn't right, I've been two thousand miles  
Down a dead-end road  
  
Let me let go, darlin', won't you  
I just gotta know, yeah  
If this is for the best, why are you still in my heart  
Are you still in my soul, let me let go  
  
The lights of this strange city are shinin'  
But they don't hold no fascination for me  
I try to find the bright side, baby  
But everywhere I look, everywhere I turn, you're all I see  
  
Let me, let me let go baby, won't you  
Let me let go  
It just isn't right, I've been two thousand miles  
Down a dead-end road  
  
Oh, let me let go, darlin', won't you  
I just gotta know  
If this is for the best, why are you still in my heart  
Yeah, you're still in my soul, let me let go  
Let me let go, let me let go
