Baby, dry your eyes  
There's no need to cry  
'Cause I'll see you again  
It might be a while  
Before you understand  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just away down the river  
A hundred miles or more  
Crossing over Jordan  
To the other shore  
I'll be standing, waiting  
With all who've gone before  
I'm just away down the river  
A hundred miles or more  
  
Now the pictures on the wall  
Will help you to recall  
They're not there  
To make you sad  
But to remember  
All the good times we had  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When it's time to leave  
You're gonna feel the mountain breeze  
And the snow will fill the stream  
And carry you to me  
  
[Chorus]
