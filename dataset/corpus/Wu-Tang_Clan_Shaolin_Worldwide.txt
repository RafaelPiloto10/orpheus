Who's the knucklehead wantin' respect  
  
Yo, yo  
Never doubt the life  
Yo  
Who the fuck are you to criticize me  
Yo, I slap, yo, I slap dick ta' ya' wifey  
Yo, respect, that's my word  
  
Another Wu tradition, Street vision, listen  
All my life I've been poverty stricken  
Always took what's mines, never was given  
A second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision  
You can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin'  
Quick to stick the clip in, blow you out position  
Street jurisdictions, nigga, no restriction  
Concrete composition for emcee's in submission  
Special edition crash course mission  
Push through like the task force and crush all competition  
See you from a distance, dry snitchin', whisperin'  
Greet your man posted up like two little bitches  
When you get the heart, step live or catch stitches  
Or find yourself with Del, sleepin' with the fishes  
I got no love for fans that's fake ass niggas  
I can't stand the bid when it's all in my business  
Wu-Tang Forever and a day, don't get it twisted  
I get lifted, I just shoot somethin' from hot biscuit  
These street kids, we can't lost, we terrorize you district  
Leave no finger prints and no survivin' witness  
  
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide  
It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide  
Street Life, Homicide, nowhere to run to  
  
[Chorus:]  
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O.  
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go  
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go  
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go  
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!  
  
Yo, thoughts sharper than a Japanese kitana  
Ninja coma, piranhas crack teeth on my armor  
Scandalous, I ran contra-bomber, stalker like rebels of Rwanda  
Death before dishonor, snake charmer, persona of one who makes drama  
Godfather 4 type saga, tuckin' a revolver in my parker  
Bombin' unprepared for departure, might talk but strike harder  
Fear the bow of the silent archer  
Sure shotter, pass the rock to your starter  
Poison darter, news photographers document the horror  
While I bounce Shaunda with Tiwana and I from blue Honda  
Honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar  
Your highness, the crowd holla  
Got your head rock, feel the brain trauma  
Crowd sponsor, hotter than Bahama steam saunas  
The Rebel of opera, popped off the chocolate and the gosha  
Monster truck crush you impostors  
  
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide  
It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide  
I.N.S., Homicide, nowhere to run to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the four mic emcee with five mic potential  
Overlooked cuz y'all can't understand what I been thru  
You ain't got to love me, or even pretend to  
Actin' like the street, they ain't got no street credentials  
Crack villains, raps be killin' instrumentals  
The caps pealin' and slap a feelin' out ya dental  
Underground, sound, for ghetto residentials  
Up shits creek lookin' for some more shit to get into  
Got the clan jewels as I continue  
To serve you everythin' on that's on the menu  
With chef John Jacob, remember sons Of man told you wake up  
My nigga smell the coffee, I'm too hardcore to kill softly  
Come to free the mind and get the bullshit up off me  
The jedi, only use the force if ya force me  
Shaolin what  
Don't get it fucked up and cross me  
Rappers gettin' stuck for actin' stuck up and flossy  
Say it ain't so! Bust the callico  
Rap from the island called Stat', here we go  
  
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide  
It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide  
Method Man, Homicide, nowhere to run to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wantin' respect, wantin' respect  
Who's the knucklehead wantin respect  
Wantin' respect, wantin' respect  
Wantin respect, sharpest niggas in the ...
