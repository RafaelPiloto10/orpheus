Don't these city lights light these streets to life  
All these crazy nights bring us together  
Any rainy day, you can dance your blues away  
Don't these city lights bring us together  
Charlie Chaplin's cane, well it flicked away the rain  
Things weren't quite the same, after he came here  
But then when he left, upon our own request  
Things weren't quite the same, after he came here  
Don't these city lights bring the streets to life  
All these crazy nights bring us together  
Any rainy day you can dance your blues away  
Don't these city lights bring us together  
We're supposed to be a land of liberty  
And those city lights to blaze forever  
But that little tramp, ooh, on that street corner lamp  
When he left us, it's humor left for ever  
We're supposed to be a land of liberty  
And those city lights to blaze forever  
But that little tramp, leaning on that street corner lamp  
When he left us, it's humor left for ever  
Don't these city lights bring the streets to life  
All these crazy nights bring us together  
Any rainy day you can dance your blues away  
Don't these city lights bring us together
