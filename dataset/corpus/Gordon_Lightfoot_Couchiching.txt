There's a town they call Orillia, It is there of which I sing.  
It is just above Lake Simcoe, by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching.  
Cooooochiching, by Lake Couchiching.  
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching,  
Coooochiching  
  
Across the raging Narrows, Casino Rama stands.  
Where there once were only sparrows, people come from other lands.  
To the west lie hills aplenty, if skiing is your thing,  
You can while away the summer, by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
In Orillia they had movies, and sports and music too.  
And all around the shore line, were the folks that we all knew.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
Now I've spent my life in travel, now I've spent my life in dust.  
Now I've spent my life in family, now I've spent my life in trust.  
Any way you'd like to cut in, It'll hit you with a ping.  
When you think about Orillia, and it's by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
When I get my final slumber, when I pawn my diamond ring,  
I will do my final number, by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-
