[-Intro-] Hikaru Utada  
Mmm, Oooh, Oh  
[-Verse 1-] Foxy Brown  
Yeah, Uh, Yeah  
Why'all know why'all see us in the Benz or that Rover  
Fresh pair of And 1's, Luis? Pull over  
Whole city locked, Just like I always told you (uh-huh)  
If it ain't Boogie, Believe me, She a rookie  
You know how Fox drop it  
Dig up in they pockets  
Pussy get lost, Treat that nigga like a jump-off  
The act shady, This nigga must be crazy  
My girls sell units like Michael in the 80's (ugh)  
  
[-Chorus-] Hikaru Utada  
What am I supposed to do, I don't want to be your referee but,  
Anytime tonight i'm gonna, Blow my whistle soon  
Hold me 'til to the break of dawn 'til it's time to be your referee but,  
Later on tonight I'll let you, Blow my whistle too  
  
[-Verse 2-] Hikaru Utada  
Cast your vote on me, Say that's it for me, Just place your bets on me,  
Stop gettin' high off of jealousy, Whether you are a dear or not  
I'm comin' with all that I got ( I got), Then while you decide  
We are undefined  
My instincts says its hard to keep you free (I want to keep you free)  
And my mother says men besides stability (Oh, is it true?)  
My instincts says its hard to keep you free  
But I told you this life exclusively (oh)  
  
[-Repeat Chorus-]  
[-Verse 3-] Hikaru Utada  
Scared to show or tell, Keep what you just felt, The secrets to yourself,  
I gettin' tired of mistreatment, Even though I say they do not  
The games you play hurt me a lot (alot)  
When there's none to play, Will you go or stay?  
My instincts says its hard to keep you free  
When my mother says men will leave eventually (is it true?)  
Nothing lives forever, I agree  
But I wouldn't mind the possibility (Oh)  
  
[-Repeat Chorus-]  
[-Verse 4-] Foxy Brown  
Live from BK, Dippin' on the freeway (uh-huh)  
Visor twisted back with a couple wild cats (Oww!)  
Bunch of loose goons, Keep the muzzle on 'em  
We all 7-tre, who the fuck wan' what? (Iyye!)  
I numbs 'em like cocaine raw, Starvin' like you part of the V-8 this fall  
Homes, In many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own  
Bet I, keeps it poppin', keeps they shoulders lockin'  
Lahdy-Dahdy in the party, nigga,  
Up ya Yen, Fuck you lockin' for a pen? I just came to bone  
Reputation ill, Stay on chrome, I'm like E.T, beyotch  
No phone home  
Gavin always told me, Boogie,  
Watch ya paper, Keep it low, Bubble slow, Niggas, catch the vapors  
Fox in Calhoun in the Cadillac blue  
Too live, Shawn ain't got no ma's, Beyotch!  
  
[-Repeat Chorus until fade-]
