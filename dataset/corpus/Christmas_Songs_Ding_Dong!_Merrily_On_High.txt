[Refrain:]  
Ding dong! Merrily on high,  
In heav'n the bells are ringing:  
Ding dong! Verily the sky  
Is riv'n with angel singing.  
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!  
  
E'en so here below, below,  
Let steeple bells be swungen,  
And "Io, io, io!"  
By priest and people sungen.  
  
[Refrain]  
  
Pray you, dutifully prime  
Your matin chime, you ringers  
May you beautifully rhyme  
Your eve time song you singers
