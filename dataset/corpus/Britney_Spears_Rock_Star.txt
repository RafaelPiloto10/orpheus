Put your ass on your shoulders and you ain't nobody  
Nobody really wanted get down and hang with you  
Cause you only hand around fake people that barely know you  
Love to kiss your ass and have to agree with you  
Take a look around when you are down by yourself  
And you will see who is standing next to you  
No one buy you up and change your number every time  
You were blind nobody gave a damn but you  
  
Chorus  
So why do you play that game  
You don't even know my name  
So who do you think you are  
You wanna be a rock star  
Get up on your own pro  
... Be alone  
By the time you hear this song  
You're gonna be a rock star  
  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
  
Say say  
Xo xo xo  
  
... Every minute of the day of the second of the hour  
You try to come back but is way too late  
How does it feel all alone on the throne  
And the crowd is gone and you are holding on  
So I saw you at the... With your head back with your shoulders down low  
Is funny cause you don't even know  
So more people they can't even recognize  
Don't have a clue  
  
Chorus  
  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
  
Say say  
I hate to break it to you  
But I am not thinking about you  
You are so wrapped up in your voice  
For your noise don't go ask on your boys... Been  
You talk so much but so what  
They just want you shut yourself up  
All my girl scream and shout  
If you got an xo give them...  
  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you
