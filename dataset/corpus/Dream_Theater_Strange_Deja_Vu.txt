Subconscious strange sensation  
Unconscious relaxation  
What a pleasant nightmare  
And I can't wait to get there again  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
There's another vivid surprise  
Another whole life waiting  
Chapters unfinished, fading  
  
Closer now,  
Slowly coming into view  
I've arrived,  
Blinding sunshine beaming through  
  
There's a house I'm drawn into  
Familiar settings, nothing new  
There's a pathway leading there  
With a haunting chill in the air  
  
There's room at the top of the stairs  
Every night I'm drawn up there  
There's a girl in the mirror  
Her face is getting clearer  
Young child won't you tell me why I'm here?  
  
In her eyes  
I sense a story never told  
Behinde the disguise  
There's something tearing  
At her soul  
  
Tonight I've been searching for it  
A feeling that's deep inside m  
Tonight I've been searching for  
The one that nobody knows  
Trying to break free  
  
I just can't help myself  
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head  
Tears my heart into two  
I'm not the one the sleeper thought he knew  
  
Back on my feet again  
Eyes open to real world  
Metropolis surrounds me  
The mirror's shattered the girl  
  
Why is this other life  
Haunting me everyday  
I'd break through the other side  
If only I'd find the way  
  
Something's awfully familiar  
The feeling's so hard to shake  
Could I have lived in that other world  
It's a link that I'm destined to make  
  
I'm still searching but I don't know what for  
The missing key to unlock my mind's door  
  
Today I am searching for it  
A feeling that won't go away  
Today I am searching for it  
The only one I know  
Trying to break free  
  
I just can't help myself  
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head  
Tears my soul into two  
I'm not the one I thought I always knew  
  
I just can't help myself  
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head  
Uncanny, strange Deja Vu  
But I don't mind  
I hope to find the truth
