Tell you a little story and it won't take long  
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn  
The reason why I never could tell  
For that young man was always well  
He planted his corn in the month of June  
And by July it was up to his eyes  
Come September, came a big frost  
And all the young man's corn was lost  
His story, kith, had just begun  
Said, "Young man, have you hoed some corn?"  
"Well, I tried and I tried, and I tried in vain  
But I don't believe I raised no grain"  
He went down town to his neighbor's door  
Where he had often been before  
Sayin', "Pretty little miss, will you marry me?"  
Little miss what do you say?"  
"Why do you come for me to wed?  
You, can't even make your own corn grain  
Single I am and will remain  
A lazy man, I won't maintain"  
He turned his back and walked away  
Sayin', "Little miss, you'll rue the day  
You'll rue the day that you were born  
For givin' me the devil, 'cause I wouldn't hoe corn"
