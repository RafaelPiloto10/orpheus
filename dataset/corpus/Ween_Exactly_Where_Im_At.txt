Lets begin with the past in front and all the things that you really don't
care about now  
You'd be exactly where I'm at  
And to think you've got a grip well, look at yourself your lips are like two
flaps of fat  
They go front and back and flappidy flappidy flap  
  
I'm on stage its all an act, I'm really scared that I may fall back on the
abstract  
It'd be exactly where I'm at  
  
If you're to be  
The roaming eye well pry it open and let me tell you why it sees  
The harsh realities  
  
Lets begin with the past in front and all the things that you really don't
care about now  
You'd be exactly where I'm at
