I waited each day for your letter although I knew what it would cost  
But dear when it came I knew that your game had been won  
And I knew that I had lost  
But I just couldn't open your letter I know you're no longer my own  
The moment it came I wrote beneath my name  
These heartbreaking words address unknown  
  
I wanted to open your letter to see if you missed me sometimes  
But you have a way of making me pay cause I know what you write between the
lines  
You know I'd be so glad to see you in spite of the hurt you have done  
But deep down inside I can't lose my pride  
And forgive you just because you're the one  
So I just couldn't open your letter
