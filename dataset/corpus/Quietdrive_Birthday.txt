I'm falling into words I never knew,  
I never meant to say the words, "I love you"  
But it's in my heart and it feels new  
Is it true for you, is it true for you?  
  
Of course you'd like to play that we'd be friends,  
It couldn't stay that way 'cause we'd pretend,  
But then I heard about your new boyfriend  
Where did I go wrong, where did I go wrong?  
  
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday,  
I'm sorry 'cause I'm a shit face  
I thought it was on a Wednesday,  
A Monday or a Tuesday,  
It's all the same to me  
So what will make you happy?  
Tell me 'cause I'm sorry  
These colors that we find  
Look all the same to me  
  
I know that you've been hurt but in the end,  
I'd like to say it's worth all the things that we did  
But now you've found me out, my inside's dead  
What I have done wrong, what I have done wrong?  
  
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday,  
I'm sorry 'cause I'm a shit face  
I thought it was on a Wednesday,  
A Monday or a Tuesday,  
It's all the same to me  
So what will make you happy?  
Tell me 'cause I'm sorry  
These colors that we find  
Look all the same to me  
  
I couldn't take those things away from you  
I've made mistakes, but so have you  
We could have made it work but we lost  
When you left and you didn't have to,  
You didn't have to, didn't have to  
  
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday,  
I thought it was on a Wednesday  
What did all your friends say?  
They're all the same to me  
So what would make you happy?  
Tell me 'cause I'm sorry  
These days, they go by  
Feel all the same to me  
Feel all the same to me  
Feel all the same to me  
Feel all the same to me  
Feel all the same to me
