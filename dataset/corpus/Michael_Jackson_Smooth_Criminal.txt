As he came into the window  
It was the sound of a crescendo  
He came into her apartment  
He left the bloodstains on the carpet  
She ran underneath the table  
He could see she was unable  
So she ran into the bedroom  
She was struck down, it was her doom  
  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok  
Are you ok, Annie  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok  
Are you ok, Annie

So, Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie?  
  
(Annie are you ok?)  
(Will you tell us that you're ok?)  
(There's a sign in the window)  
(That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)  
(He came into your apartment)

You've been hit by  
You've been hit by  
A smooth criminal  
  
So they came into the outway  
It was Sunday - what a black day  
Mouth to mouth  
Resuscitation  
Sounding heartbeats - intimidation  
  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok  
Are you ok, Annie

Ran into the bedroom)
