I'm in love with you I know  
And I know that you love me too  
I'm in love with you I know  
I'm in love with everyone too  
We're all comrades now you know  
We're all brothers under the skin  
With a few adjustments now  
Living in the perfect system  
The adjustment's simple there is really no pain  
You'll hardly notice anything has changed  
Living in a programmed life never really has ups and downs  
There's no need for fighting now  
There's no reason to wear a frown  
In a perfect system  
There's no confrontation  
Unnecessary friction  
To impede our concentration  
We've simply done away with  
Unnecessary friction  
I live in a system  
I got an occupation  
I get enough nutrition  
By eating protein biscuits  
Recommended by the system  
It's routine regulation  
I had an operation . . .  
I'm in love with you I know  
And I know that you love me too  
I'm in love with you I know  
I'm in love with everyone too  
I can tell by the look in your blank dull eyes  
That you agree, but I'm not a bit surprised  
Living in a programmed life never really has ups and downs  
There's no need for fighting now  
There's no reason to wear a frown  
I had an operation  
With no adverse reaction  
They tampered with my brain some  
It helped me see the reason  
For living in the system  
It helped me see the reason  
(We're all brothers in a perfect world)  
In a perfect world there's uniformity  
(We're all brothers in a perfect world)  
In a perfect world there's conformity  
(We're all brothers in a perfect world)  
There's no need for spontaneity  
Perfect system we're all brothers to the end  
Brothers to the end  
Brothers to the end  
I know and I know that you love me too  
(Brothers to the end) I know I'm in love with everyone too  
(Brothers to the end) I know we're all comrades under the skin  
(Brothers to the end) I know living in a perfect system  
BROTHERS TO THE END
