I didn't see you standing there  
You took me by surprise  
In your long silk dress  
And those deep brown eyes  
I was captured by your smile  
But when fate put out it's hand  
You're walking to your love  
How was I to resist  
The passion and the kiss  
We raised the future alone  
She stole my body and soul  
With a heart next to mine  
I didn't wanna face the day  
But I have no choice when we kiss  
She said  
Goodnight my sweet pretender  
Tonight we live forever  
One heart, one soul  
On the edge of the world  
Goodnight my sweet pretender  
Feels like we died together  
In each others arms  
On the edge of the world  
When she touched me so warm  
And so was her body  
A kiss she gave to me  
The name she said to pain and pleasure  
Time my soul rescue me  
But I know I'd be here on my own  
As soon as the sun would rise  
I didn't wanna face the day  
But I have no choice when we kiss  
I've dreamed of a place I know  
With the shadows of my past  
Still remain  
You're buried in the midst of time  
For always you'll be the sun that shines  
Shines on me  
Goodnight, goodnight  
My sweet pretender ...
