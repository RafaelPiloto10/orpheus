Dinah, is there anyone finer  
In the state of Carolina?  
If there is and you know her  
Show her to me  
  
Dinah, with her Dixie eyes blazing  
How I'd like to sit and gaze in  
To the eyes of Dinah Lee  
  
Every night why do I shake with fright?  
Because my Dinah might change her mind about me  
  
Got to tell you about Dinah  
If she went to China  
I'd would hop an ocean liner  
Just to be with Dinah Lee
