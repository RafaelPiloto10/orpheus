Well, the very first time  
I saw you darling  
Not one single word  
Would come to my lips  
  
Yes, the very first time  
I saw you darling  
Not one single word  
Would come to my lips  
  
You see, I was so afraid  
You wouldn't love me  
I want to tell you right now  
I was frightened right down  
To my fingertips  
  
So baby, when you went away  
That unlucky day last September  
I was like a little lost boy  
In the wilderness  
Baby baby baby  
When you went away  
I was like a little lost boy  
In the wilderness  
  
And I've just been sitting here  
Thinking of everybody  
I've ever known  
Well, you know  
I still love you the best  
Yeah, the best
