I miss her face, but the girl left seven years ago.  
Guess I never should've let her go.  
That's how I feel because I love her so.  
But I'm afraid that she will never know.  
  
She just couldn't wait, she said she couldn't wait 'til "some day."  
She just couldn't wait, my baby just couldn't wait, no.  
She said she couldn't wait 'til "some day," 'til "some day."  
  
Oh, tell me now, where do the broken-hearted go from here.  
You missed her love and now you're steering clear.  
I ain't afraid of nothin' but my fear.  
The fear that she might see this rollin' tear.  
  
She just couldn't wait, she said she couldn't wait 'til sunday.  
She just couldn't wait, my baby just couldn't wait, no.  
She just couldn't wait, my baby just couldn't wait, no.  
  
Oh she couldn't wait 'til Sunday no, 'til sunday.  
She just couldn't wait, my baby just couldn't wait, no.  
She said she couldn't wait 'til sunday.  
She just couldn't wait, my baby just couldn't wait, no.  
She said she just couldn't wait.  
You know she just couldn't wait, no.  
She said she couldn't wait 'til Sunday, 'til sunday.  
Oh, oh...
