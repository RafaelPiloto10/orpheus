The lark in the morning she rises off her nest  
She goes off in the air with the dew all on her breast  
And like the jolly ploughboy she whistles and she sings  
She goes off in the air with the dew all on her wings  
  
Oh Roger the ploughboy he is a dashing blade  
He goes whistling and singing over yonder leafy shade  
He met with dark haired Susan, she's handsome I declare  
And she is far more enticing than the birds up in the  
Air  
  
The lark in the morning...  
  
One evening when they're coming from the rakes of the  
Town  
The meadows bein' all mown and the grass had been cut  
Down  
As she should chance to stumble all on the new mown hay  
Oh it's kiss me now or never, then this bonnie lass did  
Say  
  
The lark in the morning...  
  
When twenty long weeks, they were over and were past  
Her mammy asked the reason why she thickened round the  
Waist  
It was the jolly ploughboy, this bonnie lass did say  
He caused me for to tumble all on the new mown hay  
  
The lark in the morning...  
  
Here's a health to you ploughboys wherever you may be  
That like to have a bonnie lass a-sitting on each knee  
With a pint of good strong porter, you'll whistle and  
You'll sing  
And the ploughboy is as happy as a bird upon the wing  
  
The lark in the morning...
