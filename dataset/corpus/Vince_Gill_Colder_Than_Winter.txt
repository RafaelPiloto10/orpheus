It's colder than winter  
Right here in my heart  
Lord I'm gonna miss her  
She's torn me apart  
  
I couldn't make you love me  
I couldn't give any more  
It's colder than winter  
Since you closed the door  
  
It's colder than winter  
I'm freezing inside  
And my tears won't be bitter  
Even though our love died  
  
I couldn't make you love me  
I couldn't give any more  
It's colder than winter  
Since you closed the door  
  
Every time the sun sets  
I shed another tear  
And the lonelier I get  
Wishing you were still here  
  
I couldn't make you love me  
I couldn't give any more  
It's colder than winter  
Since you closed the door
