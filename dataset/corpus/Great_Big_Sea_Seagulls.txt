She left St.John's one day in May  
Dressed in her Sunday best  
A kind man sat beside her  
While she cried her way out West  
She moved in with her cousin  
Found a job down in the mall  
Her friends at home were jealous  
Said they'd see her in the fall  
Chorus:  
You know that she wants to try, never lets you see her cry  
You know that she wants to try, she's got seagulls in her eyes  
The people here seem really nice  
But the winter's way too long  
New friends, they don't understand  
Her mother wrote "be strong"  
She made some decent money  
But nothing comes for free  
The windy street, just can't compete  
With the sky, the rocks and sea  
Chorus  
Her parents came at Eastertime  
They wanted her to stay  
But she bought a panel van  
Moved home on her birthday  
Her friends were pretty cynical  
"Couldn't make it on your own..."  
Now the sky's a little smaller  
And it doesn't seem like home
