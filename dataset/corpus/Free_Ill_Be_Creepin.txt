If you are tryin' to screw me baby  
Take my advice  
Opportunity baby, never knocks twice  
If you are tryin' to fool me baby  
Don't play around  
'cause when I get to you baby  
I won't make no sound  
'cause I'll be creepin'  
I'll be creepin' baby  
  
I'll hold you in my arms  
Like nobody else  
And when I know we're apart  
I won't take no less.  
  
Take all you things and move far away  
Take all your furs and rings baby  
But don't you sing hurray  
You can change your address  
But you won't get far  
Don't make no difference wherever you are  
Yeah 'cause I'll be creepin' baby  
And I'll be creeping 'round your door  
  
I'll hold you in my arms, like nobody else  
And when I know we are apart, I won't take no less  
  
I'll hold you in my arms, like nobody else  
And when I know we are apart, I won't take no less  
  
Take all you things and move far away  
Take all your diamond rings now baby  
But don't you sing hurray  
You can change your address  
But you won't get far  
Don't make no difference baby wherever you are  
Yeah 'cause I'll be creepin' 'round your door
