A friend of mine called up,  
said, "I fin'lly had some luck-  
Could I have a minute of your time.  
I met a girl last night  
try as I might,  
I can't get her off of my mind.  
She walked in the room and right then I knew  
I fin'ly found somebody for me.  
But to tell you the truth,  
I don't know what to do.  
Should I go ahead or wait and see?"  
  
I said, "Give it all you got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?  
Than to never love at all?"  
  
Now I'm the kind of guy  
who's normally quiet shy.  
On romance, I don't know a thing.  
But when she led me to the floor,  
never danced before.  
Suddenly my feet had wings.  
I know that she wnats me,  
I want her too,  
but I'm so confused.  
I can't think straight.  
I feel so alive,  
but on the other side,  
should I go ahead or should I wait?  
  
I said, "Give it all you got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?".  
Than to never love at all?"  
  
So, when the music starts  
to flow from your hearts  
like the coming of an early spring,  
whe nthe river starts to flow  
between your soul to soul,  
may no man ever come between.  
Die in her arms if she wants you to.  
Be thankful for each passin' day.  
When your odds collide,  
let your spirits fly  
and pray to God it's here to stay.  
  
And I said, "Give it all You got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?  
  
Give it all you got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all,  
than to never love at all,  
than to never, never love at all?"  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?
