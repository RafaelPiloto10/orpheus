Pretty faces everywhere  
A few hard cases stop and stare  
They've got charm that is not right  
Pretty faces late at night  
Morning Glory what's the story?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again  
I remember our old rendezvous  
The key was kept inside a shoe  
Those moments will remain frozen in time  
Morning Glory's on my mind  
What's the story Morning Glory?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again  
It seems like only yesterday  
She married me and carried me away  
I found out what life was all about  
Morning Glory threw me out  
Hey, Morning Glory what's the story?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again  
Alimony, Palimony, puts a dent in me  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
For a dip in the shining sea  
A dip in the shining sea  
Pretty faces everywhere  
A few hard cases stop and stare  
Even when I know it ain't my day  
A lot of good faces anyway  
Morning Glory what's the story?  
What is it to be?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
For a dip in the shining sea  
A dip in the shining sea  
What's the story Morning Glory?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again  
Morning Glory what's the story?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again
