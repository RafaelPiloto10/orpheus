Ain't nobody listening, ain't nobody there  
Somebody is screaming this ain't fair  
30 pieces glistening, speak up if you dare  
That is what the book said if you care  
  
Sheep and God, the fourth, independence  
Waiting to be led  
Deep the pain, the sting of dependence  
This is what he said  
  
I'll take you all the way  
A lifetime spent in just one day  
I'll take you out the other side  
It's my hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
  
Think that something's missing or something's just not fair  
Somebody is hanging over there  
I was at my own christening, I wasn't quite aware  
I didn't have the choice to even dare  
  
I fell asleep at night independence  
Waiting for the word  
In nightmares and deceit of dependence  
This is what I heard  
  
I'll take you anyway  
Hopeless, faithless, it's okay  
I'll take you on the lifetime ride  
It's my hellish pride  
  
Fire  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
I got no pride  
  
I'll take you all the way  
I'll take you anyway  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun
