See the house lights start to blink  
And the sky is turnin' pink  
Gosh what will the neighbors think  
Cause here it is tomorrow again  
  
We could share a perfect day  
But we've danced the night away  
Guess you'd better hit the hay  
Cause here it is tomorrow again  
  
We saw the sunset in the sky  
Soon we'll see the dawn  
Mother Nature's about to rise  
And Father Time is marchin' on  
  
Did you hear my daddy yell?  
We've been leaning on the bell  
Kiss me quick and run like sixty  
Because here it is tomorrow again
