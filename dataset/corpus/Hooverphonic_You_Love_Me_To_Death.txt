Face your faith  
Remove all the lace  
You love me to death  
But death may love you more  
  
You paint with glaze  
But write me without grace  
You love me to death  
Our love was mortal hope  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But death may love you more  
  
You grow in me  
And although we disagree  
You love me to death  
You can not love me more  
  
The best things in life to find  
Will not always satisfy  
You can love me to death  
But I will have to go  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But I will have to go  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But I will have to go  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But I will have to go
