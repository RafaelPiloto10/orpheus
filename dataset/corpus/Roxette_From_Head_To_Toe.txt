I knew the minute I saw you  
That we, we were two of a kind  
And I knew, yea, when I danced with you  
Abduct in a miracle mind  
  
I keep my head up high  
I keep my love alive  
Yea, yea, yea!  
  
You go from head to toe  
This mystery has taken over me - I know  
You make the true love shine You go from head to toe  
There's all emotions flowing over me - I know  
You make the true love shine, eye to eye  
  
Well I've had a love that once blinded me  
But now it makes me wanna cry  
Well her heart is soaked with such cruelty  
Her 'hello' sure sounds like 'good-bye'  
  
But I keep my head up high  
I keep my love alive  
Yea, yea, yea!  
  
You go from head to toe...
