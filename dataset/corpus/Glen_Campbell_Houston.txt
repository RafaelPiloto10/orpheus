Home is where I'm goin'  
No matter how long it takes  
And I've been livin' high 'n' free, love  
It's time for me to try another way  
I think I'll send her a postcard  
So she can meet my plane  
Well I don't know what I'll say to her  
I've caused her so much pain  
Houston, I'm-a comin' to see you  
Houston, has it really been that lo-hong  
I know I've been away  
But I'm just callin' to tell you I'm leavin' today-hay-ay-hay-ay  
Sittin' here in San Francisco  
Lord I'm tryin' to get more pay  
You know it's good to hear your voice again  
You say the words I like to hear you say  
Now I'm tryin' to read your letter  
It's been almost a year  
It did me good to get away from you  
Now I'm wishin' you were here  
Houston, I'm-a comin' to see you  
Houston, has it really been that lo-hong  
I know I've been away  
But I'm just callin' to tell you I'm leavin' today-hay-ay  
Houston, I'm-a comin' to see you  
Houston, has it really been that lo-hong  
Houston, Houston, Houston (Yeah, I'm a comin' to see you)  
Houston, has it really been that lo-ho-ho-ong  
Houston, Houston, Houston  
(Yeah, I'm a comin' to see you), Houston (fade)
