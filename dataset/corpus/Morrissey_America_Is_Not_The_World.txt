America, your head's too big  
Because America  
Your belly's too big  
And I love you  
I just wish you'd stay where you is  
  
Oh...in America  
The land of the free, they said  
And of opportunity  
In a just and a truthful way  
But where the president  
Is never black, female or gay  
And until that day  
You've got nothing to say to me  
To help me believe  
  
Oh...in America  
It brought you the hamburger  
Oh well America you know where  
You can shove your hamburger  
And don't you wonder  
Why in Estonia they say  
Hey you big fat pig  
You fat pig, You fat pig  
  
Steely blue eyes  
With no love in them  
Scan The World  
And a humorless smile  
With no warmth within  
Greets the world  
And I, I have got nothing  
To offer you  
No-no-no-no-no  
Just this heart, deep and true  
Which you say you don't need  
  
See with your eyes  
Touch with your hands, please  
Hear through your ears  
Know in your soul, please  
For haven't you me with you now?  
And I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
And I love you  
I love you  
I love you
