I asked my father  
I said, "Father change my name"  
The one I'm using now it's covered up  
With fear and filth and cowardice and shame  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Yes and lover, lover, lover  
Lover, lover, lover, lover  
Come back to me  
  
He said, "I locked you in this body  
I meant it as a kind of trial  
You can use it for a weapon  
Or to make some woman smile"  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"Then let me start again," I cried  
"Please let me start again  
I want a face that's fair this time  
I want a spirit that is calm"  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"I never, never turned aside," he said  
"I never walked away  
It was you who built the temple  
it was you who covered up my face"  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
And may the spirit of this song  
May it rise up pure and free  
May it be a shield for you  
A shield against the enemy  
  
[Chorus: x2]
