So you're a trucker  
Hard driver  
Mr king of the road  
Feelin' lonely  
Drinkin' coffee  
She had only ever known  
Drove a lot today  
Was it yesterday?  
Just a memory you know  
You can't dilute it  
Or see to it  
Roll through it  
You head home  
There is a motel with a vacancy  
There is no possibility  
You could drive yourself to ever be  
The man you once were  
So you're a trucker  
Hard driver  
Mr king of the road  
Feelin' lonely  
Drinkin' coffee  
She was all he'd ever known  
Drove a lot today  
Was it yesterday?  
It's just a memory you know  
You can't see through an old tune  
Roll through it  
And head home  
There is a motel with a vacancy  
There is no possibility.  
But you could drive yourself to ever be  
The man you once were.
