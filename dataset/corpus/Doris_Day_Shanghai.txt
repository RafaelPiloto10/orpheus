Who's gonna kiss me  
Who's gonna thrill me  
Who's gonna hold me tight  
Tonight  
  
Why did I tell you I was goin' to Shanghai  
I want to be with you tonight  
Why did I holler I was goin' to Shanghai  
I want to be with you tonight  
It was just a little misunderstanding  
That a kiss on the cheek could patch  
I need you so badly  
I'd gladly start all over from scratch  
  
Oh, why did I tell you it was bye-bye for Shanghai  
I'm even allergic to rice  
Why don't you stop me when I talk about Shanghai  
It's just a lover's device  
  
Now who's gonna kiss me  
Who's gonna thrill me  
Who's gonna hold me tight  
  
I'm right around the corner in the phone booth  
And I want to be with you tonight  
  
Now why did I tell you it was bye-bye for Shanghai  
I'm even allergic to rice  
Why don't you stop me when I talk about Shanghai  
It's just a lovers device  
  
Now who's gonna kiss me  
Who's gonna thrill me  
Who's gonna hold me tight  
  
I'm right around the corner in the phone booth  
And I want to be with you tonight  
  
Who-oo-oo-oo's gonna kiss me  
Who's gonna thrill me  
Who's gonna hold me tight  
  
I'm right around the corner in the phone booth  
And I want to  
Yes I want to  
I want to be with you tonight.
