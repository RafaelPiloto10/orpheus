I can't say I ain't been around  
That I ain't done my time  
Seems like this big old world  
Has been one big shoe to shine  
  
But I never ever took a dime  
For what comes naturally  
And if I never knew the truth  
Well she'd be fine with me  
  
One night she stayed over here  
And left her little black book behind  
Well that little black book ain't little no more  
And it wasn't too hard too find  
  
Chorus:  
She'd leave me in this lonely room  
The thought just made me sick  
It's funny how the pieces fit  
My baby gets around a bit  
Yeah, my baby gets around a bit  
  
Her pager would ring, it's a funny thing  
She'd have to go right away  
She always had a wad of cash  
Much more than her job could pay  
  
I'd ask her where she's going to  
And this is what she'd say  
"i gotta meet someone for an interview  
He's only in town today"  
  
Always a little bit overdressed  
Much more than I thought he'd be  
High heel shoes and day glow dress  
Ain't seem strange to me  
  
She'd leave me in this lonely room  
While some stud got his sex  
Just then the thought occurred to me  
My baby gets around a bit  
My baby gets around a bit  
Oooh, my baby gets around a bit...  
  
Solo  
  
Took her to the local bar  
Where I like to hang  
Every guy that passed her by  
They all seemed to know her name  
  
They all called her by a different name  
And one of them winked at me  
Some guy named stan said "you're the man  
I heard you get it for free"  
  
She'd leave me in this lonely room  
And the thought hit me like a brick  
It's funny how the pieces fit  
My baby gets around a bit  
Ooooh, my baby gets around a bit  
Ooooh, my baby gets around a bit  
My baby gets around a bit  
  
My baby gets around....  
My baby..
