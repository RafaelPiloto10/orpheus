Autumn  
The frost has come and kissed all the leaves to sleep forever  
Time sketches a few lines and etches its wishes into our lives  
See how everything's changing  
And see how time is rearranging the people and the places  
Keeping nothing sacred  
And like the leaves  
In the autumn wind  
We're driftin'  
  
We've been too many places  
We've seen too much  
Touched too many faces  
To think that there's just one way to love  
Or that there's just a day to love  
Somewhere some special moment in time and space  
(....) face to face  
But our lives are borrowed  
We love today and die tomorrow  
Like the leaves in the autumn wind  
We're driftin'  
  
I will always be grateful  
That time has granted us the right  
To be lovers if for just a moment  
We live in the (....) and we know it  
So if today is our last one  
Let's run out into the sun, ohh  
Love, hold onto my hand  
Hold on as long as you can  
For just like leaves in the autumn wind  
We're driftin'  
Just like leaves in the autumn wind  
We're driftin'
