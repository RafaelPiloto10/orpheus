When the dream came I held my breath with my eyes closed  
I went insane like a smoke-ring day when the wind blows  
  
Now I won't be back 'till later on, if I do come back at all  
But you know me, and I miss you now  
  
Doo, doo, doo  
  
In a strange game I saw myself as you knew me  
When the change came and you had a chance to see through me  
  
Well the other side is just the same  
You can't tell my dream is real  
Because I love you  
Can you see me now  
  
Though we rush ahead to save our time  
We are only what we feel  
And I love you  
Can you feel it now
