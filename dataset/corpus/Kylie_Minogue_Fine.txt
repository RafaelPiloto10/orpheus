Fine, you're gonna be fine  
You don't have to worry don't you turn and run, run run  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
  
Standing in heaven but don't feel the light  
The brightest colors are the black and white  
You wanna dance but you don't trust your feet  
You know the rhythm but can't feel the beat  
  
The night, the night, the night is full of tears  
You cry, you cry, you cry  
When you feel everything's impossible  
Just know you're gonna be  
  
Fine, you're gonna be fine  
You don't have to worry don't you turn and run, run run  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
Fine, you're gonna be fine  
It's gonna be OK a brighter day will come, come, come  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
  
You got it all but you don't feel complete  
Even the sweetest things are bittersweet  
You're riding high but you just fear the fall  
Don't even recognize yourself at all  
  
The night, the night, the night is full of tears  
You cry, you cry, you cry  
Sometimes this world can leave you in the cold  
But everything will be  
  
Fine, you're gonna be fine  
You don't have to worry don't you turn and run, run, run  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
Fine, you're gonna be fine  
It's gonna be OK a brighter day will come, come, come  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
  
Fine, you're gonna be fine  
You don't have to worry don't you turn and run, run, run  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
Fine, you're gonna be fine  
It's gonna be OK a brighter day will come, come, come  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun  
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
