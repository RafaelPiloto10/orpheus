He's unimaginative at his best but you know that's all right  
We like the way he sings  
He's unimaginative at his work but we say that that's ok  
He's made for better things  
He's not intelligent, we like the way he dances, yeah  
But you wanna talk about this, and talk about that  
And everything he says is just impossibly fast  
He's never that bad, he's never that good  
He's always just a little bit and over understood  
And you say, "He's un-American, a little bit."  
And you think that that's so cool  
You like a little bit, and if he's un-American a little bit  
Then you think that he's no fool  
Not matter if he is  
So alternative, he likes to take our chances  
And you wanna talk about this, talk about that  
And everything he said is just impossibly crass  
He's never that bad, he's never that good  
He's always just a little bit and over understood  
And you say, "He's not intelligent, we like the way he dances."  
He's hearing voices he can't attribute to the ordinary noise  
What do you swallow to relax you ordinarily?  
He's looking forward to a little rest  
But you know that he's so tired  
He's fallen in a jar  
And everybody's sympathetic more or less even if he's bombed or wired  
It's just the way we are  
He's so alternative, he likes the blue romances  
But you wanna talk about this and talk about that  
And everything he does is just impossibly fast  
He's never that bad, he's never that good  
He's always just a little bit and over understood  
And you say, "he's so alternative, he like to take our chances."  
He's hearing voices he can't attribute to the ordinary noise  
What do you swallow to relax you ordinarily?  
Who's gonna explain this mess to the mother of an ordinary boy?  
Who was expected to act extra ordinarily  
But you wanna talk about this, talk about that  
And everything he says is just impossibly fast  
He's never that bad, he's never that good  
He's always just a little bit ah ah ah ah  
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it  
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna, I don't wanna  
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it  
I don't wanna no no no no no no yeah
