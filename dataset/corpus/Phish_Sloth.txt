They call me the sloth  
Way down in the ghetto  
Italian spaghetti  
Singing falsetto  
Sleeping all day  
Rip Van Winklin'  
Spend my nights in bars  
Glasses tinklin'  
I'm so bad  
He's so nasty  
Ain't got no friends  
Real outcasty  
Stay out of my way  
Ed up a cripple  
I'll take this piece of paper  
Slice your nipple  
They call me the sloth  
Way down in the ghetto  
Italian spaghetti  
Singing falsetto  
Sleeping all day  
Rip Van Winklin'  
Spend my nights in bars  
Glasses tinklin'
