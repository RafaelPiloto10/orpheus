Tempted and tried  
We're oft made to wonder  
Why could it be thus  
All the day long  
When there are others  
Living about us  
Never molested  
Though in the wrong  
Farther along  
We'll know all about it  
Farther along  
We'll understand why  
Cheer up my brother  
Live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all  
By and by  
  
When death has come  
And taken our loved ones  
It's leaving our home  
So lonely and drear  
Then do we wonder  
Why others prosper  
Living so wicked  
Year after year  
Farther along  
We'll know all about it
