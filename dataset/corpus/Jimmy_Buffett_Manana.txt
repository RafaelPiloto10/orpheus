Jimmy Buffett  
She said I can't go back to America soon  
It's so goddamn cold it's gonna snow until June  
Yeah, they're freezin' up in Buffalo stuck in their cars  
And I'm lyin' here 'neath the sun and the stars.  
Customs man tell her that she's gotta leave  
She's got a plan hidden up her shrewd sleeve  
Wants to find her a captain, a man of strong mind  
And any direction he blows will be fine.  
  
Chorus:  
Please don't say manana if you don't mean it  
I have heard those words for so very long  
Don't try to describe the ocean if you've never seen it  
Don't ever forget that you just may wind up being wrong.  
  
Tried and I tried but I don't understand  
Never seems to work out the way I had it planned  
Hanging out at a marina when Steve Martin called  
Singin' anybody there really want to get small.  
  
But women and water are in short supply  
There's not enough dope for us all to get high  
I hear it gets better, that's what they say  
As soon as we sail on to Cane Garden Bay.  
  
Chorus:  
Please don't say manana if you don't mean it  
I have heard your lines foe so very long  
Don't try to describe the scenery if you've never seen it  
Don't ever forget that you just may wind up in my song.  
  
Called all my friends on those cheap nightly rates  
Sure was good to talk to the old United States  
While the lights of St. Thomas lie twenty miles west  
I see General Electric's still doing their best.  
  
I've got to head this boat south pretty soon  
New album's old and I'm fresh out of tunes  
But I know that I'll get 'em, I know that they'll come  
Through the people and places and Caldwood's Rum  
  
Chorus:  
So please don't say manana if you don't mean it  
I have done your lines for so very long  
Don't try to describe a Kiss concert if you've mever seen it  
Don't ever forget that you just may wind up being gone  
And I hope Anita Bryant never does one of my songs.
