I don't have the time of day  
I don't know what day I is  
Someone's falling on my head  
Get up? Get up  
We're going out on the raz  
  
Razzle dazzle  
Call it what you want  
To me it don't matter  
It's where I belong  
It's a matter of distinction  
A real fine line  
Between an orgy of destruction  
And a wonderful time  
  
This room's so cold and bare  
There's nothing here for me  
I've got to find some heat somewhere  
Get up? Get up  
We're going out on the raz  
  
Razzle dazzle  
Call it what you want  
It really doesn't matter  
When I'm bangin' on a gong  
While someone's holding out  
To a willing congregation  
And we can all forget about  
The state of the nation  
  
Can't hear a thing  
But I see your lips are moving  
I'm working on my thinking  
And I think it's improving  
I'm going to get the blame  
So I might as well deliver  
If only I can swim across  
This weird human river  
  
I know I started out  
With the best of intentions  
Some blinding inspiration  
And a few not-to-mention  
And now I'm looking deep  
Into the last dying embers  
Shouting what are we doing here  
And nobody remembers  
  
I've lost a friend or two  
I don't know where they have gone  
Only one thing I can do  
Get up? Get up  
I'm going out on the raz  
  
Razzle dazzle  
Call it what you want  
To me it don't matter  
It's where I belong  
It's a matter of distinction  
A real fine line  
Between an orgy of destruction  
And a wonderful time
