Bop 'til you drop  
Bop 'til you drop  
Bop 'til you drop  
Bop 'til you drop  
  
No matter what you just can't stop  
Bop 'til you drop  
Bop 'til you drop  
  
Stick 'em up give me your money  
You act like a big shot but you're really a dummy  
They want your blood they want every drop  
  
Bop 'til you drop  
Bop 'til you drop  
Hey!  
  
You tried and tried but you're a flop  
You're thirty five still pushing a mop  
No time to cop do the cretin hop  
Bop 'til you drop  
Bop 'til you drop
