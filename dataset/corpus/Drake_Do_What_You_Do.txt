[Talking:]  
I do this for ya'll man  
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the remix!  
  
[Verse 1: Malice]  
  
[Background:]  
Are-E you-P G-A-N-G  
Are-E you-P G-A-N-G  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it  
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it  
So now you at the store for some blank cds  
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it  
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you  
And I'll be the only one she concerned with  
To the people that ignored me before this  
This one is for you as a song re-recorded  
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along  
Your vision's just been distorted  
I'm so [?] I live this, you ask me what the business  
And I write a sixteen and record it, uh  
The waiting is over I think music need it  
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded  
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude  
They expectations Imma exceed it uh  
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it  
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish  
Finally here Imma star with the timing  
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining  
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, a purchase [?]  
You only get the dough when you grindin  
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne  
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
[Verse 3: Nickelus F]  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do
