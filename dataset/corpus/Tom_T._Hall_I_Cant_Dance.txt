I can't dance and I never could, I guess my feet don't match  
I've been thinking 'bout dancing with you, but I'm afraid of hurtin' my back  
I don't know what you're doing but I like everything you do  
Just for a little bit baby I'd come out and dance with you  
  
[Chorus]  
But I can't dance and I'm feeling so good  
Some of us can and some of us can't and some of us wish that we could dance  
Some can't dance and I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few  
Just for a little bit, baby, I'd come out and dance with you  
  
My mind is out there with you now but I can't get my body to move  
Sitting here falling in love, love, love thinking something I can't prove  
My soul is willing and my mind is ready but it's something that I never could
do  
Just for a little bit, baby, I'd come out and dance with you  
  
[Chorus]
