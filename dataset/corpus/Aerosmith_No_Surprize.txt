Nineteen seventy one  
We all heard the starters gun  
New York is such a pity  
But at Max's Kansas City we won  
  
We all shot the shit at the bar  
With Johnny O'Toole and his scar  
And then old Clive Davis said  
I'm surely gonna make us a star  
I'm gonna make you a star  
Just the way you are  
  
But with all his style  
I could see in his eyes  
That we is goin' to trial  
  
It was no surprise  
  
The boys kept kickin' ass  
As usual time would tell  
But some bitch in the choir  
Threw water on the fires of hell  
She loved to show and tell  
Lord she loved to tell  
  
But with all our style  
You could see in our eyes  
That we is still on trial  
  
And it was no surprise  
No surprise  
No surprise  
No surprise  
  
Midnight lady  
Situation fetal  
Vaccinate your ass  
With a photograph needle  
  
I say  
Look it here  
Friend of mine  
Scratch like you need calomine  
Flamingo boots  
Sole's a creakin'  
Still in love and Puerto Rican too  
  
Ridin' on the wheels of hell  
Smokin' in our axle grease  
Oh the backstage is rockin'  
And we're coppin' from the local police  
That's right the local police  
Or the justice of peace  
  
But with all our style  
You could see in our eyes  
That we is still on trial  
  
Baby it's no surprise  
No Surprise  
No Surprise  
No Surprise  
  
Rock and roll  
Junkie whore  
Got my foot inside the door  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock  
Nobody's keepin' score  
  
Bad times  
Go away  
Come again some other day  
Topaz and sazzafrazz  
Will keep the blues away  
  
Candy store  
Rock and roll  
Corporation jellyroll  
Play the singles it ain't me  
It's programmed insanity  
  
You ASCAP  
If BMI  
Could ever make a mountain fly  
If Japanese can boil teas  
Then where the fuck's my royalties
