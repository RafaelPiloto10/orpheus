I saw you on the front page of the letter  
She had to run away but you just wouldn't let her  
So what is she supposed to do  
She can't do anything when she's with you  
Try to find her heart but it's so lost  
Now it's time to show you who's boss  
  
123 she doesn't wanna be  
Held down so she can't see  
All of the coolest things  
She can be'  
Nobody knows but me  
Take a chance a see  
She gonna make wish  
So kiss this  
  
When she finds the one  
Her heart starts to jump  
She thinks he's never gone  
He's says hell never run  
Away with her heart  
It's no longer lost  
It's time to show you who's boss  
  
123 she doesn't wanna be  
Held down so she can't see  
All of the coolest things  
She can be  
Nobody knows but me  
Take a chance a see  
She gonna make wish  
So kiss this  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhhhh  
Gotta get back to her heart  
Tell her where to go when she starts  
To cry and ask  
The world why  
  
Well baby... Here it comes  
  
123 she doesn't wanna be  
Held down so she can't see  
All of the coolest things  
She can be  
Nobody knows but me  
Take a chance a see  
She gonna make wish  
So kiss this  
2x  
  
C'mon c'mon and kiss this you can't c'mon and kiss this  
  
Ohhh
