When you hit your note  
It's like you had no choice  
I can't resist distraction's web  
When you use that voice  
On a crowded stage  
I play soliloquy  
I'm at the center of the earth  
When you gaze on me  
The familiar ring of the native drums  
Sometimes I hardly recognize it  
Inspiration comes  
With the tip of my mind  
Holding back the sea  
I have no choice but to prevail  
When you gaze on me  
I've got the ghost of a new machine  
Where I can find reality routine  
Every time you fix your gaze on me  
When you gaze on me  
I feel a ring of fire  
When you gaze on me  
And I lose all desire  
Fix your heart on me  
I'll show you what I've memorized  
Fix your gaze on me  
I need to see your eyes [uh - good god!]  
Out in the cold the assassin waits  
Armored by love no sword can penetrate  
Every time you fix your heart on me  
I'm a new machine  
Where I can find reality routine  
Every time you fix your gaze on me
