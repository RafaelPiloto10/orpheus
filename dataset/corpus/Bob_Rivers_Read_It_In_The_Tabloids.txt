I bet you're wondering how I knew  
That Prince Charles and Lady Di were through.  
Was waiting in line at the grocery store.  
Took a peek at the dirt about Demi Moore.  
And it took me by surprise I must say  
When I found out the Pope was gay.  
I read it in the tabloids.  
Elvis Presley's doing just fine.  
They put it in the tabloids.  
Got a look at Fergi's boobs, my my.  
Honey, honey, yeah.  
You know JFK didn't really die.  
They got a picture and he looks all right.  
And Ross Perot's hanging out with ET.  
This woman had a kid at a hundred and three.  
And you could have seen it all for yourself  
'Cause it's right there upon the shelf.  
Oh, I read it in the tabloids.  
You know Madonna used to be a boy.  
I saw it in the tabloids  
Right next to a cure for hemorrhoids.  
Honey, honey, yeah.
