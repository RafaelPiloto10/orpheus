Common as the cold  
Up for sale, never sold  
Getting older and it shows  
Your disappointment only grows  
And no one seems to care  
That you never got your share  
Who said life was fair?  
So smile - it's not so bad  
You lost your health  
Never had no wealth  
So tighten up your belt  
As you gather dust upon some shelf  
  
You lost by just a nose  
But there's no prize for place or show  
Now, at least, you know  
So smile - it's not so bad  
Tired out and broken down  
You've played the field and made the rounds  
Now you're stuck in this one-horse town  
Your only solace is the sound of melody and verse  
Though your bag's about to burst  
Others have it worse  
So smile - it's not so bad
