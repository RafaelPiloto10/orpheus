Oh baby it's been so long  
I've waited so long  
And now that I have you  
I want you to come, come, come  
  
Spirits move me every time I'm near you  
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind  
Oh sweet Peter, angel of my lifetime  
Answer to all answers I can find  
  
Baby, I want you, come, come, come into my arms  
Let me know the wonder of all of you  
Baby, I want you no, no, no, and hold on fast  
Could this be your magic at last?  
  
Baby, take me high upon a hillside  
High up where the stallion meets the sun  
I could love you, build my world around you  
Never leave you till my life is done  
  
Baby, I want you, come, come, come into my arms  
Let me know the wonder of all of you  
Baby, I want you no, no, no, hold on fast  
Could it be your magic at last?  
  
Baby I want you, come  
Now come and hold on fast  
Could this be your magic at last  
Could it be magic?  
  
Come, come, come into my arms  
Could this be your magic at last?  
Could it be magic?  
  
Come, come, come into my arms  
Let me know the wonder of all of you, all of you  
Baby I want you, now, now, oh now  
Oh come and hold on fast
