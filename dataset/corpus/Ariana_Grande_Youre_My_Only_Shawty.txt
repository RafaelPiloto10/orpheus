Ariana! Iyaz!  
  
Last night was crazy, and today it's settin' in  
Did you really mean it and could you say it again? Oh, oh  
Even if you just say it over the phone (come on and make it real)  
  
Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb, and paranoid  
But I'll take a chance on us and hope you don't destroy my heart  
Just give me one guarantee, I'm the only girl you see  
Whatchu say, boy?  
  
You're my only shawty  
You're my only shorty, yee yee yee  
I'm tellin' you the truth  
Girl, it's only you  
You're my only, you're my only  
You're my only one and only  
  
You're my only shawty (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (am I your only shawty?)  
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)  
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only, you're my only shawty  
  
Every day and night, you got an open invitation  
As long as I'm your one and only destination  
Fly with me, I'll be your fantasy  
  
You're in demand, but baby, baby so am I  
But if you're weak and try to sneak, I'll have to tell you bye-bye.  
Imma put you on the spot, am I your only girl or not?  
What ya say, boy?  
  
You're my only shawty  
You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (am I your only)  
I'm tellin' you the truth  
Girl, it's only you  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only)  
You're my only one and only  
  
You're my only shawty (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (am I your only shawty?)  
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)  
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only, you're my only shawty  
  
See yeah back in the day I was trapped in a daze  
Trying to run game, but I've actually changed (Same old)  
When I see you passing, the passionate flames  
Simple interaction is all that I crave  
I don't need to bring in all the attention  
Girl, I need you, your love and affection.  
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention?  
  
You're my only shawty (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (baby, come clean! )  
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)  
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only one and only  
  
You're my only shawty(am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (am I your only shawty?)  
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)  
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only, you're my only shawty  
  
Am I your only?  
Am I your only?  
Tell me, am I your only shawty? (yes, you are.)  
Why won't you say that (yes, you are.)  
Am I your only shawty?
