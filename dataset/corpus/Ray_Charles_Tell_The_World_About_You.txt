When I need company,  
I call on you to see about me,  
I wanna walk about it,  
Talk about it,  
Tell the world about you,  
When your with me it's so much fun,  
Your all the good things wrapped in one,  
I wanna walk about it,  
Talk about it,  
Tell the world about you.  
Woah, I wanna walk,  
I wanna talk,  
I wanna tell,  
I wanna live,  
I'm gonna give,  
We'll have a love.  
Chorus  
Your so fine,  
And your so sweet  
Your better at love than a kbb,  
I wanna walk about it,  
Talk about it,  
Tell the world about you.  
Instrumental  
Woah, I wanna walk,  
I wanna talk,  
I wanna tell,  
Wah, I'm gonna live,  
I'm gonna give,  
We'll have a love  
Chorus
