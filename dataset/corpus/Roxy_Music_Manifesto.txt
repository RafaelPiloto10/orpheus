I am for a life around the corner  
That takes you by surprise  
That comes leaves all you need  
And more besides  
I am for a life and time by numbers  
Blast in fast 'n' low  
Add 'em up, account for luck  
You never know  
  
I am into friendship and plain sailing  
Through frenzied ports o' call  
O shake the hand to beat the band  
With love is all  
  
Or nothing to the man who wants tomorrow  
There's one in every town  
A crazy guy, he'd rather die  
Than be tied down  
  
I am for the man who drives the hammer  
To rock you 'til the grave  
His power drill shocks  
A million miles away  
  
I am for the revolution's coming  
I don't know where she's been  
For those who dare because it's there  
I know I've seen  
  
Now and then I've suffered imperfection  
I've studied marble flaws  
And faces drawn pale and worn  
By many tears  
  
I am that I am from out of nowhere  
to fight without a cause  
Roots strain against the grain  
With brute force you'd better  
Hold out when you're in doubt  
Question what you see  
And when you find an answer  
Bring it home to me.
