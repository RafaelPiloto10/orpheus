I love you an' don't you forget it  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
I love you an' don't you forget it, baby  
  
Love me too an' you won't regret it  
Love me too an' you won't regret it  
Love me too an' you won't regret it, baby  
  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
I love you an' don't you forget it, baby  
  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
That makes seven times that I've said it  
I don't see how you can forget it now  
  
I love you in the springtime  
I love you in the fall  
I love you at a party  
We always have a ball  
  
And when you're in my arms dear, I love you most of all  
In the morning an' in the evening an' when it's cloudy or clear  
I'm in love with you, so in love with you, every day of the year  
  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
I love you an' don't you forget it, baby  
  
Love me too an' you won't regret it  
Love me too an' you won't regret it  
Love me too an' you won't regret it, baby  
  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
I love you an' don't you forget it, baby  
  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
That makes twenty times that I've said it  
I don't see how you can forget it now  
  
I love you an' don't you forget it  
There, that's one more time that I've said it  
I don't see how you can forget it now
