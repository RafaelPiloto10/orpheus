Yeah  
Whoa  
Gunfire left a hole  
In the tank  
Losing gasoline  
  
Fire is on my trail  
And he's after me  
Hope it don't get here  
Before I get where I'm going  
I gotta get where I'm going  
Take off my mask to breath  
  
You could've been a apart of a  
Masterpiece  
Fluid in the breaks  
Was the last to leak  
That's the thing  
  
Where I'm going  
I don't need my breaks  
Can't wait to see your face  
When your front windows break  
And I come crashing through  
  
The lovers near to clear the road  
Oh, oh, oh  
'Cause this thing is ready to blow  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I just wanna set you on fire  
So I wont have to burn alone  
Then you  
Then you'll know where  
I'm coming from  
Fire bomb  
Fire bomb  
  
Scenes go  
But baby no  
Doesn't have to be  
Microwaving a medal tragedy  
Watching it burn and  
Its beautiful and its blue  
And its pitiful  
When its through  
Its the other half of me  
  
I didn't do it  
You lit the match for me  
Now were flying  
From the blast, baby  
That's the thing  
  
Where were going  
We don't need no breaks  
Can't wait to see your face  
When your front windows break  
And I come crashing through  
  
The loveers near to clear the road  
Oh, oh, oh  
'Cause this thing is ready to blow  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I just wanna set you on fire  
So I wont have to burn alone  
Then you  
Then you'll know where  
I'm coming from  
Fire bomb  
Fire bomb  
  
Baby we were killing them  
They couldn't handle the millionth degree  
We were criminals (ah ah ah)  
As we were burning  
The world called the police  
Fire department, ambulance  
You can call me crazy cause I believe  
The only move for me and you  
Is to blow our flames  
And  
  
The lovers need to clear the road  
Oh, oh, oh  
'Cause this thing is ready to blow  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I just wanna set you on fire  
So I won't have to burn alone  
Then you  
Then you'll know where  
I'm coming from  
Fire bomb  
Oh, oh, oh  
Fire bomb
