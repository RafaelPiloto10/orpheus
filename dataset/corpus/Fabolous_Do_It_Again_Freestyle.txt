[Intro]  
Live from the 702, y'all know what this is  
Ta-ha, thank God it's Friday  
Felt it was only right  
In case you ain't think I could do it again  
Oh, I'm a do it again  
That Brooklyn flow, nigga, ha  
  
[Hook]  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
Throw they hands up (Oh)  
Throw they hands up (Oh)  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
Throw they hands up  
  
[Verse 1]  
You know how your boy come through on a Friday  
I'm a smooth operator like Sade  
I'll put you in your place like valet  
But they ain't really about nothin' like Wale  
Yeah, I ain't talkin' 'bout no album  
Time to turn up, I ain't talkin' 'bout no volume  
Crazy up in here, I ain't talkin' 'bout asylums  
You ain't talkin' income, they walkin' outs they outcome  
You ex on a nigga, I ain't talkin' bout no Malcolm  
Bird from Atlanta, I ain't talkin' 'bout no falcons  
No 'Julio' Jones or 'Roddy' White  
But she could catch it like them if her body tight  
If she walkin', lose her naughties, right  
If she stretch it like Pilates, right  
If she ride it like Ducati bikes  
But you ain't fuckin' everybody, right?  
You ain't out here bein' thotty, right?  
I mean, I see a lot of thots whenever I'm in the club  
I play my cards right, grab a dime in the club  
Sippin' Ace of Spade, got my nine in the club  
Cause niggas be tryin' to jack a diamonds in clubs  
See, you know how I be, posted up on IG  
Get under they skin like IV  
Check a Internet thug down by IP  
He ain't carry guns, all he carry was ID  
And, see, now a nigga bitchin' up  
Talkin' quick, in your face, now the story switchin' up  
How they gon' pray for your downfall, then wish they up?  
  
[Bridge]  
1 a.m., on my way to the club  
2 a.m., it was goin' up  
3 a.m., bad bitches with us  
4 a.m., now they leavin' with us  
5 a.m., at the after hours  
6 a.m., now we at the house  
6:15, I be diggin' her out  
7:15, Uber in route  
8 a.m., ESPN  
1 a.m., I'm gon' do it again  
We gon', we gon', we gon' do it again  
  
[Verse 2]  
How the fuck you gon' talk about emcees on my heels  
When all I see is Timb trees on my heels?  
New black Spur, them Bs on the wheels  
Pull up anywhere, Tim D. in your grill  
Don't come at me on some, 'She still my girl'  
I'm rich, boy, I throw some Ds in your girl  
All I be givin' is some G to your girl  
Dick in a box from me to your girl  
So, you got a flow, that's cool with me  
I hear the freestyles, that's cool with me  
I see your little cars, little jewelries  
But none of y'all motherfuckers can fool with me  
You know that funeral flow spit eulogies  
You tryin' to fool a Gs, I'm tryin' to fool a G  
Put some gas in the game, few jewels for me  
You tryin' to trick us with a fake chain, foolery  
I just hit two mil on the Instagram  
I should post two mil on the Instagram  
Get this on if you ever go against the fam  
I sit on thrones, I don't sit on benches, fan  
Fuck the snakes, I'm ridin' with Kane  
When I bring that Dodge Vipe out, python piped out  
The wave is mine, I never wiped out  
If you was countin', you would have less to type out  
Get your money up, hustlin', grindin' sowin', finessin'  
Fuck that, everybody, come on  
  
[Hook]  
Throw they hands up  
Throw they hands up  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Outro]  
Y'all know what it is, world-famous DJ Clue  
Desert Storm, that kid Loso  
Bar for bar, best in the game, nigga  
I said it, uh-huh, live from the 712  
That street fam  
Throw they hands up
