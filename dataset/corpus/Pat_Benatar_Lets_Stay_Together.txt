People walkin' 'round, all lost and confused  
Ready to throw their lives out in the gutter  
Ain't no love between 'em, father to son  
Man to woman, brother to brother  
You and me we move, in opposite directions  
Like two spheres on their separate planes  
Ain't nobody loved me better than you done  
So why can't we just find a way to (live) - Stay Together  
  
Let's Stay Together  
Life's too hard to make it all alone  
An' peace and harmony don't come in packages with bows  
An' true love ain't somethin' you find layin' around  
Don't you know, Let's Stay Together  
  
Let's Stay Together, Let's Stay Together  
  
Mothers don't you turn your backs on your children  
Children don't you leave the family  
Ain't no point in livin', life all by yourself  
So why can't we just find a way to (live) - Stay Together  
  
Let's Stay Together  
Life's too hard to make it all alone  
An' peace and harmony don't come in packages with bows  
An' true love ain't somethin' you find layin' around  
Don't you know, Let's Stay Together  
  
Let's Stay Together  
Life's too hard to make it all alone  
An' peace and harmony don't come in packages with bows  
An' true love ain't somethin' you find layin' around  
Don't you know, Let's Stay Together  
  
Let's Stay Together, Let's Stay Together  
Let's Stay Together, Let's Stay Together  
Let's Stay Together  
  
Yeah - Peace and love and war and hate  
Something's best and something just to get away  
  
Let's Stay Together, Let's Stay Together  
Let's Stay Together, Let's Stay Together  
Let's Stay Together, Let's Stay Together  
Let's Stay Together
