Glow little glow worm flier fire  
Glow like an incandescent wire  
Glow for the female of the specie  
Turn on the AC and the DC  
This night could use a little brightening  
Light up your little bug of lightning  
When you gotta glow you gotta glow  
Glow little glow worm glow  
Glow little glow worm turn the key on  
You are equipped with tail light neon  
You got a cute vest pocket Mazda  
Which you can make both slow or faster  
I don't know who you took a shine to  
Or who you're out to make a sign to  
I gotta gal that I love so glow little glow worm glow  
Glow little glow worm glow  
Glow little glow worm glow
