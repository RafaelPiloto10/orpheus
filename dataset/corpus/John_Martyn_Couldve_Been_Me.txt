It could've been, would've been, should've been, could've been  
It could've been, should've been, could've been, could've been me  
It could've been, should've been, would've been, could've been me  
Could've been me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been, could've been me)  
  
I see that mountain bear look in his eyes  
Watch you follow you back home  
Recognize that look in his eye  
Wish he'd leave you alone  
  
It could've been me, it could've been me  
I know it might been me  
I know it could've been me  
  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
  
See that man waving you goodbye  
I see no tear in your eye for him  
See that man who's got, who got a well kept suit  
?  
  
Could've been me, could've been me  
Oh yes, it might have been me  
Oh, could've been me  
  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
  
Help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
  
Could've been, would've been, should've been me  
Could've been, would've been, should've been me  
Could've been, would've been, should've been me  
  
You see that man with that gleam in his eye  
I watched him follow you 'round and 'round  
I recognize that gleam in his eyes  
Someday it would've been enough to lay his body on the ground  
  
Could've been me, I know  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been, would've been me)  
It might have been me, I know it could've been me  
  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me  
(Could've been, would've been, should've been me)  
Help me, help me
