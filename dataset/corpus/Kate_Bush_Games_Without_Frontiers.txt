Hans plays with Lotte, Lotte plays with Jane  
Jane plays with Willi, Willi is happy again  
Suki plays with Leo, Sacha plays with Britt  
Adolf builts a bonfire, Enrico plays with it  
Whistling tunes we hid in the dunes by the seaside  
Whistling tunes we're kissing baboons in the jungle  
It's a knockout  
If looks could kill, they probably will  
In games without frontiers-war without tears  
Games without frontiers-war without tears  
  
Jeux sans frontieres  
  
Andre has a red flag, Chiang Ching's is blue  
They all have hills to fly them on except for Lin Tai Yu  
Dressing up in costumes, playing silly games  
Hiding out in tree-tops shouting out rude names  
Whistling tunes we hide in the dunes by the seaside  
Whistling tunes we piss on the goons in the jungle  
It's a knockout  
If looks could kill they probably will  
In games without frontiers-wars without tears  
If looks could kill they probably will  
In games without frontiers-war without tears  
Games without frontiers-war without tears  
  
Jeux sans frontieres
