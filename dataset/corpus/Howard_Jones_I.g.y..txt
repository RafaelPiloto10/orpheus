Donald fagen  
  
Standing tough under stars and stripes  
We can tell  
This dream's in sight  
You've got to admit it  
At this point in time that it's clear  
The future looks bright  
On that train all graphite and glitter  
Undersea by rail  
Ninety minutes from new york to paris  
Well by seventy-six we'll be A. O. K.  
  
Chorus  
What a beautiful world this will be  
What a glorious time to be free  
  
Get your ticket to that wheel in space  
While there's time  
The fix is in  
You'll be a witness to that game of chance in the sky  
You know we've got to win  
Here at home we'll play in the city  
Powered by the sun  
Perfect weather for a streamlined world  
There'll be spandex jackets for everyone  
  
On that train all graphite a glitter  
Undersea by rail  
Ninety minutes from new york to paris  
(more leisure for artists everywhere)  
A just machine to make big decisions  
Programmed by fellows with compassion and vision  
We'll be clean when their work is done  
We'll be eternally free yes and eternally young
