Well a-hey there baby, do you want to make the scene?  
I said a-hey there baby, do you want to make the scene?  
Aw well come on over baby, step into my time machine  
You best jump into my action, I'm gonna make you feel right  
Aw, jump into my action, I'm gonna make you feel right  
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause I'm gonna love you tonight  
Step into the front row, I'm gonna show you how  
Step into the front row, I wanna show you how  
Don't worry 'bout no time we can always come back to right now  
Aw and I'm gonna' give it to you  
When you wanna come back, we just a turn about  
When you wanna come back, we just a turn about  
But we ain't gonna' come back 'till there ain't no doubt  
Now don't it get good to you, ah-do you know what I mean?  
Said don't it get good to you, don't you know what I mean?  
Well come on over baby, jump into my time machine
