You're not in control when there's demands put on your heart.  
You don't even know, cause when it's real you fall too hard.  
And yet even so, you try to play like nothing's wrong,  
No you can't run away, there is no hiding place,  
'Cause you can't run from your heart.  
  
[Chorus]  
Your eyes they tell me secrets that you, you can't deny.  
Your eyes they show me feelings that you hold deep inside.  
How do I know the secrets that you try to hide?  
'Cause when I look in your eyes, the truth is alive,  
I knew you'd be mine.  
  
So now that it's on, it's time to face reality,  
It's time to be strong, take all your insecurities, baby.  
Don't be afraid, you gotta let your feelings flow,  
No you can't run away, there is no hiding place,  
You gotta be true to your heart.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now that you're all turned out,  
Don't you just love the way that it feels?  
Now you can't do without my love,  
And you know that's for real.  
  
Now why you deny yourself,  
I will never never never understand,  
Because I love you and you love me too,  
And that's just the way that it is yeah.  
  
[Chorus]
