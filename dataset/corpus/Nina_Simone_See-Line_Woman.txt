Yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Alright ye  
  
See-line woman  
She drink coffee  
She drink tea  
And then go home  
See-line woman  
  
See-line woman  
Dressed in green  
Wears silk stockings  
With golden seams  
See-line woman  
  
See-line woman  
Dressed in red  
Make a man lose his head  
See-line woman  
  
See-line woman  
Black dress on  
For a thousand dollars  
She wail and she moan  
See-line woman  
  
Wiggle wiggle  
Turn like a cat  
Wink at a man  
And he wink back  
Now child  
See-line woman  
  
Empty his pockets  
And wreck his days  
Make him love her  
And she'll fly away  
  
See-line woman  
Take it on out now  
Empty his pockets  
And she wreck his days  
And she make him love her  
Then she sure fly away  
She got a black dress on  
For a thousand dollars  
She wail and she moan
