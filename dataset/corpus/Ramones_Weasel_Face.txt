Twenty four hours ago  
No one could help me  
I'm alone in life  
No where to go  
  
So I picked up the phone  
Called out for help  
Some one please help me  
I'm afraid and alone  
  
Weasel face  
Weasel face  
Weasel face  
  
It's way past midnight  
T.V. set is on  
It's my only friend  
One crisis after another  
  
Ain't no loser or quitter  
It's all or nothing baby  
Cause we fought so hard  
For our piece of this world  
  
Weasel face  
Weasel face  
Weasel face
