You're only acting like  
You are somebody  
But i don't no say  
You know nobody  
  
You're only a show off  
Your painted face, yeah  
But underneath that face  
Your just a disgrace  
  
[Chorus]  
You're just a brand new second hand gal  
No man no wan' no  
Brand new second hand gal  
You better go back around so  
You're just a brand new second hand gal  
  
You think it's the dress you wear  
That make you a lady  
Get that out of your mind gal  
You must be crazy  
  
Mama used to tell me  
Long time ago yeah  
Not everything you see glitter is gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See you watch them pass i  
Well hidy-tidy  
But them no-no say  
You very nasty  
  
Look 'pon you footback  
Look how them tough, yeah  
And you chaw bone favor  
Spanish town handcuff  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dick know 'bout you  
And tom do  
And harry just 'round the corner  
Know 'bout you too  
  
He got a police buk  
And take it for fun, yeah  
Them must see no-no say

You're just a brand new second hand, you're wicked  
  
Fool ya, you fool ya
