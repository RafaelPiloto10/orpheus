The colored lights, they brightly shine  
Unlike your eyes avoiding mine  
The snow is folding sheet upon sheet  
Our hands not holding as we cross the street  
  
[Chorus]  
You have had your fill your fill of me  
You have had your fill your fill of me  
  
I wore the dress I thought you loved.  
But my boots are filling with snow you shoved  
Off of the car we climb into  
You finished first, I must catch up to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How can I catch up when I don't don't want to?  
How can I catch up when I still want you?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
December baby, you are my,  
December baby, you are my,  
December baby, you are my,  
December baby, you are mine
