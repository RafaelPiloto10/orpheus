Uh  
Kick on back to the rap I format  
When its through what you do is just play it back  
Rewind it  
  
Find it  
That's how I desinged it  
And fellas if you see a big butt get behind it  
And grind on it  
  
I mean push and bump  
Cause it's about time we made this party jump  
Take a drink of your forty  
And lets get naughty  
  
Get on the floor and just move your body to the sound  
I found and also developed  
Lets trip don't sit, come on get the hell up  
Look at the black man, now what'd up  
He's not a skin head, that's the Abdul Jabar Cut  
  
Yeah...Yeah  
Streets of Romeo  
Mt. Clemens  
Detroit  
All over  
  
Now people always me and KDC  
If we take this activity a seriously  
I reply, with a sigh rather uniquely  
And say does Donald Trump have a lotta money  
  
Yes a stupid question, but I won't quote ya  
'Cause I'm the Geraldo, Philmore, Oprah  
I'm the K-I-D are-O-see-K  
Down with Jive, RCA  
  
Hey how could you judge me cause what I am  
Be blind to my mind  
And take a look and say fuck him  
Look at the black man, now what up  
He's not a skin head, that's the Abdul Jabar Cut  
  
Okay... Yeah  
Like I said  
Top Dog  
One, two, to the three  
And we always come back for more  
  
Kenny wears a low fade  
Danny wears no fade  
I wear the high fade  
And we all get paid  
  
Tryin' to blow my rap down the sink  
But go ahead cause my rap's made of brick  
And it sticks  
Kicks  
  
Hits  
And uplifts  
At shows, it flows but never drifts  
It's too swift and moves with quickness  
  
Top Dog again and you say what is this  
Its the under rated MC on top  
The young six foot one Kid Rock  
Look at the black man, now what's up  
He's not a skin head, that's the Abdul Jabar Cut  
  
Okay... Yeah  
Get down  
Come back
