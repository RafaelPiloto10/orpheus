You're a head case with a smile  
Can't stop to make up your mind  
Education is so lame (so lame)  
When you bitch and you moan  
You're a loose girl, I'm a guy (hey)  
You're a truth freak with a lie  
The situation is so strange  
It's a TV show  
  
In a hotel on the phone  
You're gonna leave me, I should've known (should've known)  
And I was thinkin', it's so sad  
I didn't want you to go  
Don't want to follow the laws of man  
Bloody apron, leg of lamb  
It's so hard to win  
When there's so much to lose  
  
Infiltrate the walls that are caving in  
It ain't a bad thing  
This ain't reality  
Infiltrate the walls that are caving in  
It ain't a bad thing  
Because it is natural  
  
Second Avenue, raising Cain  
I'm a sinner, ring my bell (hey)  
I'll tell you what, I get up  
If I knew I fell
