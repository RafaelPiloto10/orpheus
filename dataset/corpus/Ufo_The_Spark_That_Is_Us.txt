One more time said the lady Jane  
Walk on in the fire  
Chinese whispers ringing now  
Step into the mire  
I've been strung out to dry  
Blowing in the gale  
My names been left hanging,  
Hanging on your nail  
All the misfits  
Are flying like a kite  
All of my friends  
Have come to see the fight  
whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
This love has never gone away  
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
I hold a moment every single day  
I can hear the Quireboys singing  
And it's falling on my ears  
I can hear the trumpets playing  
Running down the years  
Don't ask me how the world looks  
How it looks tonight  
I'm gonna be leaving babe  
Outta here and outta sight  
I've been laying down  
Coming off the rails  
I've been chasing shadows  
Playing Happy trails  
whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
This love has never gone away  
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
I hold a moment every single day  
Solo  
whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
This love has never gone away  
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
I hold a moment every single day  
whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
This love has never gone away  
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
I hold a moment every single day
