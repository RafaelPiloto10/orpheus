"okay, for anyone who's still listening  
This is a song called I Froze Up  
I did  
What? Don't distract me. "  
You're the light wiping out my batteries  
You're the cream in my airport-coffees  
I don't know why I stick with you  
If I had a choice  
Like lambs into the slaughter  
Like cows to the thunderbolt  
You're the Genie of my lamp  
I could have been anyone  
But one day I froze up  
But one day I froze up  
But one day I froze up  
Like this...  
Oh, little boy...  
Little boy, little boy  
Oh, little boy...  
Little boy, little boy  
If you try to strangle the skylark  
Try to cut it up, to see how it works  
Stalactites and stalagmites  
Rows of never open doors  
Coz one day I froze up  
Coz one day I froze up  
Coz one day I froze up  
Like this...  
Colours won't [?]  
Colours won't [?]  
Colours won't [?]
