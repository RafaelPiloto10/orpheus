The spirit of American, the spirit of the skies  
It's standing tall for all to share wherever freedom flies.  
It stretches out across the hills and streams, over every mountain high,  
And turns the prairies into fields of dreams  
When you reach for lofty places, when you soar through open spaces,  
What your heart and soul embraces in the sky.  
The spirit of American, the spirit of the skies.  
It's standing tall for all to share wherever freedom flies.  
The spirit of American, the spirit of the skies  
It's standing tall for all to share wherever freedom flies.  
It's standing tall for all to share wherever freedom flies.  
(Something special in the air).  
The spirit of American, the spirit of the skies.  
That's where freedom flies.
