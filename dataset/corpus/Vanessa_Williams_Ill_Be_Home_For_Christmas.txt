I'll be home for christmas  
  
I'll be home for christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow, and mistletoe  
And presents, by the tree  
  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love light, gleams  
I'll be home for christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love light, gleams  
I'll be home for christmas  
If only in, if only in,  
  
If only in my, Dreams
