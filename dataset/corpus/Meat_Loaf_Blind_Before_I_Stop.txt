I'll go blind before I stop  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'll go blind before I stop, they're gonna have to come in and lock me up  
And I'll go blind before I stop, 'cause this boy mama just want to rock  
  
There's a two ton fireball burnin' through the headphones  
Cuttin' up my heart, makin' ashes of my soul  
A lightning bolt petition, tonight I'm gonna sign  
Trouble out my window and I'm gonna find it  
  
And I'm feelin' the fever, takin' in the heat  
Bouncin' to the boogie, hittin' with the beat  
Wrapped in rhythm, dancin' till we drop  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moonlite madness masquerade, I got my invitation, baby, time to play  
Rip off the headphones, shove my arm into the socket  
Sound comes rushing through me like an intravenous rocket  
  
And I'm feelin' the fever, takin' in the heat  
Bouncin' to the boogie, hittin' with the beat  
Wrapped in rhythm, dancin' till we drop  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Doin' it in the market, doin' it in the mall  
Doin' it in the bushes and the high school hall  
Doin' it in the alley, doin' it for free  
Now they're doin' it baby on MTV  
  
Doin' it in the backseat, doin' it on the beach  
Doin' it in the grandstand, just dancin' on the seats  
Doin' it in the movies, doin' it on the train  
Doin' it mile high in a big jet plane  
  
And I'm feelin' the fever, takin' in the heat  
Bouncin' to the boogie, hittin' with the beat  
Wrapped in rhythm, dancin' till we drop  
  
And I'll go blind before I stop, they're gonna have to come in and lock me up  
  
[Chorus]
