Weight of the world's on my shoulders  
Like I've never known before  
And the winter winds blowing colder  
And I just can't take anymore  
Feel I'm running down a dead end street  
Trying to change my direction  
All my troubles weighing hard on me  
It brings me down, down, down  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear,  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
  
Noise in my head, getting louder  
and it's spinning me around  
something's tugging at my sleeve now,  
trying to tell me  
That I'm to high off the ground  
I can't explain it to myself  
I fear I'm gonna drown (fear I'm gonna drown)  
Standing out here in the pouring rain  
I'm going down, down, down  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear,  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
  
So whisper words, so soft and low  
The words of love that heal  
And ease my soul  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear,  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
Only us drift away  
  
So far away  
Drifting away  
So far away  
Drifting away  
Drift away, away, away, away, away, away
