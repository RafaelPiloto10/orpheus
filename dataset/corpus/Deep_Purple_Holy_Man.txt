Called to Madonna  
To give me a line  
She said boy what have you done  
Passing your time with a holy man  
Talking about the moon and sun  
But I can't tell the difference  
Between the fool and wise  
Show me a river to follow  
Away from all these lies  
  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been picking up my bones too long  
Won't you understand  
  
Called to the captain  
To put me ashore  
For it looked like no man's land  
Is this the way to follow  
I cried as I shook his hand  
He told me had no answer  
He didn't really hold the key  
I am a simple man  
Was all he said to me  
  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me a hand  
I've been out in the cold too long  
Won't you understand  
I've been on the road so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been out in the cold too long  
Won't you understand  
  
Heard my mother crying  
She was calling out my name  
Whisper in the dark night  
Saying who's to blame  
The hour glass keeps turning  
With not enough sand to see  
I am a holy man  
So don't you bother me  
  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been pickin' up my bones too long  
Won't you understand  
I've been on my own so long  
Won't you lend me your hand  
I've been out in the cold too long  
Won't you understand?
