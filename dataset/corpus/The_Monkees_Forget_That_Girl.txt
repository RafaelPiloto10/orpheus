Forget that girl,  
She'll only make you sad someday.  
Forget that girl,  
  
She'll never make you happy.  
Stay away from her, my friend,  
Stay away from her.  
  
Forget that girl,  
She'll only bring you down again.  
Forget that girl,  
She'll only make you lonely.  
Stay away from her, my friend,  
Stay away from her.  
  
There was a time when she could really love you  
When she was thinking only of you  
But now she's thrown herself above you  
And there's nothing you can do.  
  
Forget that girl,  
Even tho you find it's hard.  
Forget that girl,  
Even though you love her.  
  
She's in love with him, my friend,  
She's in love with him.  
Oh yeah, she's in love with him.......
