If it's love that you want, there will always be someone  
If it's love that you need, I can lay here at your feet  
When your fingers want to hold someone close to you  
Oh, don't you know baby  
  
I want you...  
When it's time to begin, you can tell me, let me in  
Every moment, every day, I'll be waiting every way  
'Til you're here next to me and you want me too  
  
Oh, don't you want, baby I know you  
I want you...  
If it's love that you want, there will always be someone  
If it's love that you need and you want me too  
  
Don't you want, baby I know you  
Breathe in my love, breathe out your love  
Before its too late, too late  
I want you...
