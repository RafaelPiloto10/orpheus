When I was a stranger to you in the night  
And the feeling tells you, out of sympathy,  
To open up your wings, turn your head to the sky,  
Take off like a bird, let your heart be free.  
I found deep feeling devotion  
The day that I found your love.  
I can see above the diamond-studded sky,  
Hear the sound of night life passing by,  
Scent the early morning with every breath of air,  
Taste the secret potion that we both share.  
I found deep feeling devotion  
The day I found your love.
