I wanted to be with you alone  
And talk about the weather  
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face  
Won't escape my attention  
You keep your distance with a system of touch  
And gentle persuasion.  
I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much.  
Oh you're just wasting my time  
You're just wasting time.  
  
Something happens and I'm head over heels  
I never find out till I'm head over heels  
Something happens and I'm head over heels  
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart  
Don't don't throw it away  
  
I made a fire and watching it burn  
I thought of your future  
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last  
No no no have you no ambition  
My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air  
And dreaming I'm a doctor  
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand  
Oh I feel so  
  
Something happens and I'm head over heels  
I never find out till I'm head over heels  
Something happens and I'm head over heels  
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart  
Don't don't throw it away  
  
And this is my four leaf clover  
I'm on the line one open mind  
This is my four leaf clover
