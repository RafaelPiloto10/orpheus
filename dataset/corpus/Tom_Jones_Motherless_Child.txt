Sometimes I feel like a motherless child  
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child  
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child  
  
A long long way from home  
A long long way from home  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone  
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone  
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone  
  
And I know my time's not long  
I know that my time, it's not long  
Sometimes I feel like I'm heaven bound  
Sometimes I feel like I'm heaven bound  
Sometimes I feel like I'm heaven bound  
  
And I wear a golden crown  
I wear a golden crown  
Sometimes I feel like my soul is on fire  
Sometimes I feel like my soul is on fire  
Sometimes I feel like my soul is on fire  
  
And I'm about to die  
And I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
  
I ain't got nobody to love me  
I ain't got nobody to hold me  
I ain't got nobody to squeeze me  
I'm just a motherless child  
I'm just a motherless child
