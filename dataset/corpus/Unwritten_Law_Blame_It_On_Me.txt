My baby's got this set of jet black eyes  
I swear that girl's the devil in disguise  
  
I've been  
Let down  
Burned out  
So let me tell you what I'm talking about  
  
I've been  
Chastised  
Deprived  
She's got my skull filled with sentimental lies  
  
She's no good for me  
So I'm gonna set her free  
I'm gonna let you fly  
Bye bye so long my sweet baby  
  
Chorus:  
Me, my love  
Blame it on me  
Me, my love  
Say it was me now  
Me, my love  
Step back, don't jack me up now  
Please, my love  
Blame it on me  
  
My girl, she's got this jet black hair  
When she walks, heads stop, rotate and stare  
  
I've been  
Let down  
Locked out  
So let me tell you what she's all about  
  
There's  
Black lies  
Fake cries  
She's got this bag filled with sentimental lies  
  
She's no good for me  
So I'm gonna set her free  
I'm gonna let you fly  
Bye bye so long my sweet baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey I know I'm wrong  
So I'll go home  
Make me believe  
Believe don't tease me, please now  
  
Chrorus
