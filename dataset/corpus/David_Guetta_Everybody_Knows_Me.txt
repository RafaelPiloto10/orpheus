(Feat Niles Mason)  
  
In the big city, chasing big dreams,  
Seems like the spot lights out of reach.  
When will they notice?  
Why they don't hear?  
Why won't you listen to my melody?  
One day I will be a star  
Living life on a high  
My name on a mark big enough to see from Mars!  
  
Chorus:  
And I wanna be a celebrity!  
Everybody knows me, the celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
  
Paparazzi all around me, pictures in every magazine  
... rumors, commercial consumers,...  
This is the reality of a star...  
My name on mark big enough to see from Mars  
  
Chorus:  
And I wanna be a celebrity!  
Everybody knows me, the celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!  
Everybody know me!  
And I wanna be a celebrity!  
Everybody knows me, the celebrity!
