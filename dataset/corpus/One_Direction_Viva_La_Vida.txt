Liam: I used to rule the world seas would rise when I  
Gave the word now in the morning I sleep alone sweep the  
Streets that I used to own.  
Zayn: I used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemies  
Eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the old king is  
Dead long live the king  
All: I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing roman cavalry  
Choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and sheald my  
Missionaries in a foriegn field
