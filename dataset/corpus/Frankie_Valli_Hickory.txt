Someday baby, we'll leave this town  
For a little house and counrty scene  
But right now my love  
It's gonna take some time  
Saving our nickels  
Counting all our dimes  
Then hickory glows, 'cause hickory knows  
With each song she sings him  
A new day she brings him  
He says hickory when your singing the blues  
This downtown guy feels like uptown new  
Something in your voice sounded soothing and clear  
Like magic, this old ghetto seems to disappear  
There across town, in a brown stone cellar  
There's a bit of heaven singin'  
Every night a song keeps bringin'  
Crowds of people by the score  
Hickory's heart must be made of sunshine  
Singing songs of sweet salvation  
Brings back inspiration  
Keeps them coming back for more  
They sing hickory, when your singing the blues  
This downtown street feels like uptown new  
Something in your voice sounded soothing and clear  
Like magic this old ghetto seems to disappear  
Hickory got a guy she lives for  
He drives taxi downtown city  
That job of his is dirt and gritty  
'Nough to make a big man cry  
Countin' his coin till makes a dollar  
To pay the rent for where they're sleepin'  
She's always at the door to greet him  
Sayin' they'll make it by and by  
Hickory when your singin' the blues  
This downtown guy feels like uptown new  
Something in your voice sounded soothing and clear  
Like magic this old ghetto seems to disappear  
Hickory, hickory, hickorrryyyyy  
Hickory, hickory...
