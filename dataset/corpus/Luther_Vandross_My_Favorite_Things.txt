Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,  
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens,  
Brown paper packages tied up with strings  
These are a few of my favorite things.  
  
Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels,  
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles,  
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings  
These are a few of my favorite things.  
  
When the dog bites, when the bee stings  
When I'm feeling sad  
I just simply remember my favorite things  
And then I don't feel so bad.  
  
The girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,  
The snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,  
Silver white winters that melt into springs  
These are a few of my favorite things.  
  
When the dog bites, when the bee stings  
When I'm feeling sad  
I just simply remember my favorite things  
And then I don't feel so bad.  
  
When the dog bites, when the bee stings  
When I'm feeling sad  
I just simply remember my favorite things  
And then I don't feel so bad.  
So bad, any more, not any more
