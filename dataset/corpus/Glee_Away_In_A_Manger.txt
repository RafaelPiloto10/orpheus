New Directions:  
Away in a manger  
No crib for His bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Lay down His sweet head  
  
Kitty (with New Directions):  
The stars in the sky  
Look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus  
(Asleep on the hay)  
  
Rachel with Kurt and Santana:  
The cattle are lowing  
The poor baby awakes  
But little Lord Jesus  
No crying he makes  
  
Rachel with Kurt and New Directions:  
I love you Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle  
Til morning is nigh  
  
Santana:  
Be near me Lord Jesus  
I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
  
Santana, Kurt, Rachel and Kitty with New Directions:  
Bless all the dear children  
In thy tender care  
And take us to Heaven  
To live with thee there
