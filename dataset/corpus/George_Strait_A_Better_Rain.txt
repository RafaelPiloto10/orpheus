Baby, what do you say when love comes down on you  
Rainin' the blues on you  
Like it's never gonna end on you  
And all yourdreams like leaves in the gutter go floatin' by  
No, baby, I don't know why all God's children cry  
I'll miss your skin, as golden as your wheatfield hair  
And where you go I hope you find out there  
  
A better rain  
The kind that comes in off the coast and paints the sky  
And lets you know that God's alive  
A better rain  
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again  
And be all right again  
In a better rain  
  
Someday is gonna find you in a sweeter place  
Long after time has erased  
All the words like razor blades  
You'll remember you and me before the flood  
Once upon a time in love, a beautiful us  
I can see you on some stretch of sand  
Spinin' round in circles barefoot dancin' in  
  
A better rain  
That'll leave behind a rainbow in the sky  
Lets you know that God's alive  
A better rain  
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again  
And be all right again  
In a better rain  
  
A better rain  
That'll leave a rainbow in the sky  
Lets you know that God's alive  
In a better rain  
A better rain
