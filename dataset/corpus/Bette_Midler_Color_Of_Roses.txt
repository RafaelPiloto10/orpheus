I held you close to me  
Once in a distant dream,  
Far from the shores of my fear.  
I sailed on the ocean where  
All I imagined could happen,  
And now you are here.  
  
It's so hard to touch  
What is out of our hands,  
To know and to trust  
What the heart understands.  
  
Only the ones who believe  
Ever see what they dream,  
Ever dream what comes true.  
  
Life gives us magic and  
Life brings us tragedy.  
Everyone suffers some loss.  
Still we have faith in it,  
Childlike hope.  
There's a reason that outweighs the cost.  
  
And gravity throws  
All these rules in our way.  
And sometimes the sprit  
Refuses to play.  
  
Only the ones who believe  
Ever see what they dream,  
Ever dream what comes true.  
  
And oh, love,  
Turn me around in your arms.  
And in this dream we share  
Let us not miss one kiss.  
  
And add my regrets  
To the tears in the rain  
For that's what the color  
Of roses contain.  
  
Only the ones who believe  
Ever see what they dream,  
Ever dream,  
Ever dream what comes true.
