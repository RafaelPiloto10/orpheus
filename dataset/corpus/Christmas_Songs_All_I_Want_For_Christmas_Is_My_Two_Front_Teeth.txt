All I want for Christmas  
Is my two front teeth,  
My two front teeth,  
See my two front teeth!  
  
Gee, if I could only  
Have my two front teeth,  
Then I could wish you  
"Merry Christmas."  
  
It seems so long since I could say,  
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!"  
Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,  
If I could only whistle  
(Thhhh, thhhh, thhhh, thhhhhh)  
  
(Repeat 2X)  
  
All I want for Christmas  
Is my two front teeth,  
My two front teeth,  
See my two front teeth.  
  
Gee, if I could only  
Have my two front teeeeth,  
Then I could wish you,  
Yes I could wish you, oh I could  
Wish you "Merry Christmas!"
