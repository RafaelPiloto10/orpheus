Once I had a dream  
And this is it  
  
Once there was a child's dream  
One night the clock struck twelve  
The window opened wide  
Once there was a child's heart  
The age I learned to fly  
And took a step outside  
  
Once I knew all the tales  
It's time to turn back time  
Follow the pale moonlight  
Once I wished for this night  
Faith brought me here  
It's time to cut the rope and fly  
  
To a dream  
Far across the sea  
All the burdens gone  
Open the chest once more  
Dark chest of wonders  
Seen through the eyes  
Of the one with pure heart  
Once so long ago  
  
The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me  
This night will bring him back to me  
  
Fly to a dream
