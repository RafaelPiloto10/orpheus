Well, here I am this is my shelter  
Here I'm at one with these trees  
And all these birds sing to my rhythms  
And these waves they comfort me  
  
Do what you will while you're able  
Find what it is that you seek  
Only I'll fly, fly, fly above the ocean  
I will fly so high above the see  
  
If it's shelter you're searching for  
One that I cannot provide  
Well, I wish you well on your journey  
I hope your dreams they come alive  
I hope your dreams back down and they, they thrive  
I hope your dreams they come alive  
  
Do, Do, Do  
Do, Do, Do  
Do, Do, Do  
  
Well, I filled my cup with the answers  
And I filled my cup with your lies  
You topped it up with your mysterys  
And all those secrets I denied  
  
Do what you will while you're able  
Find what it is that you seek  
Only I'll fly, fly, fly above the ocean  
I will fly so high above the see  
  
If it's shelter you're searching for  
One that I cannot provide  
Well, I wish you well on your journey  
I hope your dreams they come alive  
I hope your dreams back down and they, they thrive  
  
I Hope Your Dreams They Come Alive  
I Hope Your Dreams Back Down And Thrive  
  
Do, Do, Do  
Do, Do, Do  
Do, Do, Do
