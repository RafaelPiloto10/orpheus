"Well, since we're recording tonight,  
And we're ah, we're indebted to you to  
Let us be on your album. We have to thank  
You for that, this is your album you know.  
We're gonna do a brand new song about a  
Highway that runs from Detroit all the way  
Down to Florida. The Dixie Highway."  
  
I said, What you want to do  
Would you like to be with me?  
'Cause I'll meet you back stage, baby  
Love is feelin' fancy and free.  
We'll rock the night away down by the Dixie Highway,  
Yeah, down by the Dixie Highway.  
  
My love, my love, movin' to the left now, movin' to the right.  
My love, my love, Ooh soft and tender, ooh so tight  
My love, my love, oh, oh, ooh, Dixie Highway.  
I don't care what you want to be, baby,  
Long as you're happy and free.  
  
She said, That's quite all right.  
I think I'll spend the night,  
And I want to hold you, Stevie,  
I want to hold you tight.  
We'll rock the night away down by the Dixie Highway,  
Down by the Dixie Highway.  
  
My love, my love, rockin' and a rollin' the night away.  
My love, my love, ooh, makin' love till the break of day.  
My love, my love, oh, oh, ooh, Dixie Highway.  
I don't care what you want to be, baby,  
Long as you're happy and free.  
  
Baby, oh, girl, you drive me crazy.  
Baby, oh, girl, you drive me crazy, baby.  
I want to hold on you, come with you, love with you all the night.  
Foolin' who do you think you're foolin', baby?  
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Who do you think your foolin', baby?  
You want to hold on me, love on me, love with me all the night.  
  
My babe, move it to the left, now move it to the right all night.  
Oh, yeah, Dixie Highway.  
I wish I was in Dixie, Dixie, Dixie.
