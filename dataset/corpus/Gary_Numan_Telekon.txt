Where is my outline I start to fade  
No concentration means 'fail' these days  
  
I leave the table saying 'i am real'  
I feel the pressure like your eyes on me  
Don't mention that name and books on love  
I can't be sure, I can't be sure  
  
You end on reel one  
You end on reel one  
  
You quote from 'anxious' and things we do  
I need protection from the likes of you  
  
Do you begin to see that I don't know  
I live on memories that are hard to find  
Send me a card and write 'i think of you'  
I'll say you lied, I'll say you're lying  
  
You are, you are  
  
Tell me a secret I'm sure to fall  
My dog runs a.w.o.l. I blame you all  
  
We're in formation saying 'safe, safe, safe'  
Turn up my collar and mix with dark  
The speaker turns on me spot her eyes  
It's hard to breathe, it's hard to breathe  
  
You end on reel one  
You end on reel one  
  
You are, you are
