Roll out down to midnight  
Then roll on downtown 'til it's light  
Because tomorrow we may die  
Oh, but tonight we're dancing in the faint light  
Don't you rob yourself of what you're feeling  
Don't rob yourself of all that you could be  
Roll hard 'til midnight  
Roll 'til it's light  
  
Come on now  
Stay up and make some memories  
Yeah, with us now  
Roll the red carpet out with friends  
To whom, to love and roll on  
  
Our love is so right  
I won't waste a minute here tonight  
Our love is so right  
And tonight my dance is all about you  
  
To midnight love you,  
Roll on and run the red lights  
You know the game now is keep it tight  
  
Oh, how I love your pretty rock-roll kisses  
Come on and stay with me  
Roll on and run the red lights  
Come on, this love is so right  
  
Stay up and make some memories  
Yeah, with us now  
To roll the red carpet out with friends  
Oh, to love and roll on now  
  
Our love is so right  
I can taste  
We're in it here tonight  
Our love is so right  
And tonight my dance  
Is all about you  
  
I'm going crazy  
And it's all 'cause of you (it's all 'cause of you)  
I'm going under, over you, over you...  
  
This time is so alive  
Everybody's tranced, dancing tonight  
Oh so beautiful, and so strange  
Oh, it was empty until you came...  
  
Our love is so right  
Forget the clouds that rain on your light  
Our love is so right  
I'll not forget how you look right now  
  
Our love is so right  
Remember let's just move together  
Our love is so right  
I swear it would last forever  
  
Our love is so right  
Forget the clouds that rain down on you  
Our love is so right
