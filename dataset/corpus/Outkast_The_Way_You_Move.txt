Boom, Boom, Boom.  
Heh, Heh.  
  
Ready for action, nip it in the bud  
We never relaxin', OutKast is everlastin'  
Not clashin', not at all but see my nigga want to do a little acting  
Now that's for anyone askin' give me one pass em'  
Drip drip drop there goes an eargasm  
Now you cumin out the side of your face  
We tapping right into your memory banks (Thanks!)  
So click it our ticket, lets see your seat belt fastened  
Trunk rattlin' like two midgets in the back seat grasping  
Speakerbox vibrate the tank, make it sound like aluminum cans in the back  
But I know y'all wanted that 808 can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass  
But I know y'all wanted that 808 can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass

Then the whole room fell silent  
The girls all pause with glee, turning left turning right are they looking at
me?  
Cause I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor  
Now they got me in the middle feeling like a man whore  
Specially the big girl, big girls need love too no discrimination here
squirrel  
So keep your hands off my cheeks, and let me study how you ride the beat  
You big freak!  
Skinny, slim women got the camel toe within them  
You can fuck them, lift them, bend them, give them something to remember  
Yell out timber when they fall through the chop shop  
Take a deep a breath and exhale your ex male friend, boyfriend was boring as
hell  
Now let me listen to the stories you tell  
And we can make moves like a person in jail on the loco

I love the way, I love the way

I love the way, I love the way  
  
Hey baby, girl don't you stop  
Come on baby dance on the top of me  
You so fine (you so fine) you so fine  
You drive me outta my mind (my mind, outta my mind!) Oh baby!  
If I could I would, just be with you baby  
Oh Cause you like me and excite me and you know you gotta leave baby!  
Oh
