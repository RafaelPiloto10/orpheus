You saw me crying in the chapel  
The tears I shed were tears of joy  
I know the meaning of contentment  
I am happy with the Lord  
  
Just a plain and simple chapel  
Where all good people go to pray  
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger  
As I live from day to day  
  
I searched and I searched but I couldn't find  
No way on earth to gain peace of mind  
  
Now I'm happy in the chapel  
Where people are of one accord  
Yes, we gather in the chapel  
Just to sing and praise the Lord  
  
You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find  
No way on earth to gain peace of mind  
  
Take your troubles to the chapel  
Get down on your knees and pray  
Then your burdens will be lighter  
And you'll surely find the way
