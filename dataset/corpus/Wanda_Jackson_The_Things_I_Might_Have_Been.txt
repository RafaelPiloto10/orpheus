(The things I might have been)  
I might have been a helpless soul with nothing much in store  
I might have been without a gold just dream and nothing more  
I might have known a life alone but that's where you came in  
Your lovin' arms have saved me from the things I might have been  
  
I might have been a kind who roam a stranger everywhere  
Or one of those for stay at home with no one's lips to share  
But your sweet kiss has changed all this and made my life begin  
Keep lovin' me don't let me be the things I might have been  
The things I might have been
