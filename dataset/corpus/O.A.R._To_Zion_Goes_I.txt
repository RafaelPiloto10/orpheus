Light of the candle, bright one's soul shined  
Woke up new morning feeling better than ever, fine  
Chest no hurt no more, something feel better  
What's all the hate for, now something feel better  
  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I  
Walk through the valley and I'll follow the stars  
I feel it so close now, it can't be that far  
Time some grow lonely, but time isn't done  
  
It's time to go home now, you're not on the run  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I  
One step forward and I crossed the line again  
  
One step forward and I crossed the line again  
Standing on the edge of a civilization  
No one's around  
Standing on the edge of a civilization  
  
And no one's around and I ain't heard a sound, yeah  
The path is snowed over, the path lies ahead  
Soon we'll be down there, and nothing is said  
There's no need to fear love, don't let love hide  
  
Conquer the mountains way down by the riverside  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I
