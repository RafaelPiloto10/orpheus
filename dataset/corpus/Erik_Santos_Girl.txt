I just can't believe it  
You are always on my mind  
I hope I can forget it  
And wish that I was blind  
  
And that you're with someone  
I can't believe it's true  
It's really hurting me  
  
When I see you  
When I see you  
  
Chorus  
Girl even though you love somebody  
I'm still here to love you  
Girl, I can't hide this feeling  
That I feel for you  
That I feel for you  
  
Can't accept the fact that you're with him right now  
And there's nothing I can do  
  
And that you're with someone  
I can't believe it's true  
It's really hurting me  
When I see you  
  
Epeat chorus  
  
I can't believe it's true  
Oh it's really hurting me  
When I see you  
  
Repeat chorus 3X
