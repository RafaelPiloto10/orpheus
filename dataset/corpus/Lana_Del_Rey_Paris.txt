[Intro:]  
Baby say goodnight  
Text me when you get home safetly  
Like you always did  
When we was first dating  
  
[Verse:]  
You sitting in your office dreaming of a different life  
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side  
If we don't leave town now  
We're never gonna get out of here alive  
I'm walking home from school my thoughts aredrifting into space  
Why don't we leave tonight and take off to a different place  
Don't tell my daddy why gotta get on that place and just fly  
  
[Chorus:]  
Take me to paris  
Let's go there and never look back  
Paris, we can be crazy like that  
You're such a naughty boy  
Why you taking that polaroid  
Put on a show you'll enjoy  
Take me to paris  
  
[Verse:]  
I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind  
Flying across the sea to somewhere that they'll never find  
We should go out while we young  
Cause one day we will wondering why  
Our time in paris  
Take me to movies and salons  
Paris, make out in a dark restaurant  
Will dance until we die  
Wanna go out every night  
Promise we won't say goodbye  
  
[Chorus:]  
Take me to paris  
Let's go there and never look back  
Paris, we can be crazy like that  
You're such a naughty boy  
Why you taking that polaroid  
Put on a show you'll enjoy  
Take me to paris  
  
[Verse:]  
Walking through the streets at dawn  
We dance by empty carousels  
Singing about the sacre coure  
And climbing up the tour eiffel  
Under the stars  
We are, we are dreaming  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're such a naughty boy  
Why you taking that polaroid  
Put on a show you'll enjoy  
Take me to paris  
Take me to movies and salons  
It's paris, make out in a dark restaurant  
Will dance until we die  
Wanna go out every night  
Promise we won't say goodbye  
  
[Outro:]  
Baby say goodnight  
Text me when you get home safetly  
Like you always did  
When we first dating
