I want to go outside, go outside, go outside, in the rain.  
  
[Verse One (Tiny):]  
I want to go outside, in the rain,  
Oh, I said I want to, I want to go outside, in the rain.  
Cause I, I think I'm gonna cry,  
Cause I, I don't want you to see me cry,  
No, no, no, no.  
I want to go outside, oh I want to go, in the rain,  
It may sound crazy, but I want to,  
I want to go outside, yes I do, in the rain.  
Hear me out,  
Hey, hey, hey.  
  
[Verse Two (Kandi):]  
Once the rain starts falling on my face,  
Then you won't to see, a single trace.  
Right now I think I'm cryin',  
Because of you I'm dying.  
Don't want you to see me cry,  
Let me go, let me go, let me go.  
I just want to go outside, in the rain,  
Oh, baby, oh I just want to,  
Oh, don't want you to see me this way,  
In the rain,  
Oh, that's why, I've gotta go.  
  
[Verse Three (Tiny):]  
Once the sun comes out,  
And the rain is gone away,  
I know I'm gonna see a better day.  
Right now, I think I'm dyin',  
Because of you, I'm cryin',  
Don't want you to see me cry,  
Let me go, let me go, let me go.  
Hey hey hey hey.  
In the rain,  
I want to go, I want to go, I want to go,  
(May sound crazy, may sound crazy).  
I want to go outside, go outside, go outside, in the rain,  
(Oh I just want to go),  
I've gotta go outside, yeah,  
I've just gotta hide the tears,  
In the rain.  
I don't want you to know,  
(May sound crazy, may sound crazy)  
Oh, yeah.  
I want to go outside, go outside, go outside, in the rain,  
Can't let you see me like this,  
No baby, I don't want you to know,  
I don't want you to know, that I'm cryin,  
Crying, over you.  
In the rain,  
I don't want you to know,  
(May sound crazy, my sound crazy)  
Can't let you see me, I can't let you see me cryin',  
I want to go outside, go outside, go outside, in the rain.  
No no, no no, oh, yeah,  
I gotta go, yeah,  
I've gotta go,  
I, I, I, I've gotta go, outside,  
In the rain.  
Baby, you wouldn't understand if I told you.
