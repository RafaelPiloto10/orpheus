Give me a moment here  
Just enough to catch my breath  
Something is happening here  
And it's scaring me to death  
You push me to the edge where I want to risk it all again  
For the first time in a long time I'm throwing caution to the wind  
  
You can break me down if you want to break me down  
Doesn't really matter how this crazy thing turns out  
Cause you take me there  
Where I lose myself  
Just for a moment if nothing else  
You can break me down if you want to break me down  
  
Yeah it's the strangest thing but it all makes perfect sense  
Funny how life falls in place when you dare to take a chance  
You push me to the edge where I want to risk it all again  
So take me where you want to I am willing to give in  
  
You can break me down if you want to break me down
