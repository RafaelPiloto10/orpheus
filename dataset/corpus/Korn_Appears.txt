Cracked phone line  
Means nothing  
My brain's in fights and vain  
My breathing  
So shallow  
It helps to curb the pain  
  
What's outside?  
Sneaks inside  
How we contaminate  
This warzone of my soul  
I underestimate  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've never really thought about it that much  
It's only ever violence that's in my touch  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
  
The pills they, quit working  
They take more than they give  
Emotions on flat line  
It's all that I can give  
  
The rising  
The falling  
My mind keeps tricking me  
It throws me a life raft  
Then leaves me out at sea  
  
I've never really thought about it that much  
It's only ever violence that's in my touch  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
  
I've never really thought about it that much  
It's only ever violence that's in my touch  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way
