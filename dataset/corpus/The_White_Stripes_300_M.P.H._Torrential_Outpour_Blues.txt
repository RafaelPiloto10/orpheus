I'm bringing back ghosts that are no longer there  
I'm gettin' hard on myself, sittin' in my easy chair  
Well, there's three people in the mirror, and I'm wonderin' which one of them
I should choose  
Well, I can't keep from laughin', spittin' out these 300 mile per hour outpour
blues  
  
I'm breakin' my teeth off tryin' to bite my lip  
There's all kinds of red-headed women that I ain't supposed to kiss  
And it's that color which never fails to turn me blue  
So I just swallow it and hold on to it, and use it to scare the hell out of
you  
  
I have a woman, says come and watch me bleed  
And I'm wonderin' just how I can do that and still give her everything that
she needs  
Well, there's three people in my head that have the answer, and one of them's
got to be you  
But you're holding tight to it - the answer  
Singin' these three hundred mile per hour outpour blues  
  
Put on gloves, a tied scarf and wrap up warm on this winter night  
Every time you get defensive you're just looking for a fight  
It's safe to sing somebody out there's got a problem with almost anything
you'll do  
Well, next time they stab you don't fight back just play the victim instead of
playin' the fool  
  
And the roads are covered with a million little molecules  
Of cigarette ashes, and the school floors are covered with pieces of pencil
eraser, too  
Well, sooner or later the ground's gonna be holdin' all of my ashes, too  
But I can't help but wonder if after I'm gone, will I still have these three
hundred mile per  
Hour, finger-breaking, no-answers-makin', battered-dirty-hands, bee-stung and
busted-up  
Empty-cup torrential outpour blues?  
  
One thing's for sure in that graveyard: I'm gonna have the shiniest pair of
shoes
