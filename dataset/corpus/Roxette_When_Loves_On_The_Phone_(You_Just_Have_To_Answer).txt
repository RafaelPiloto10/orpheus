Some situations need a little heart.  
A tenderness that's hard to understand.  
The falling in love for a start.  
Can easily turn to the fall of a man.  
You can't run and hide even if you want to.  
Things must be done that should be done.  
You can't run and hide  
When love's got you  
Tangled up on a tightrope  
Your heart's on the run.  
When love's on the phone you just have to answer.  
There's no way you can hang up.  
When love's on the  
Phone you just have to answer.  
Well, are you ready to fall in love?  
And everybody needs a reason  
Could be a dream of fire and ice.  
And you and me,  
We need each other,  
Need to be on each other's minds.  
Yes, some situations need a little heart  
To take to the sea with the sails unfurled.  
The falling in love for a start can easily  
Turn to the fall of a girl.  
When love's on the phone...
