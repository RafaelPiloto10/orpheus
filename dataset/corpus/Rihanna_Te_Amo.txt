Te amo, te amo, she say's to me.  
I hear the pain in her voice.  
Then we danced underneath the candelabra, she takes the lead.  
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over.  
  
Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist.  
I told her no, she cried Te amo,  
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go.  
My soul is awry and without asking why.  
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said.  
Don't it mean I love you.  
I think it means I love you.  
Don't it mean I love you.  
  
Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe.  
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uhh.  
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave.  
She's begging me and asking why it's over.  
  
Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist.  
I told her no, she cried Te amo,  
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go.  
My soul is awry and without asking why.  
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said.  
Don't it mean I love you.  
I think it means I love you.  
Don't it mean I love you.  
  
Yes we can dance.  
But you gotta watch your hands.  
Watch me all night.  
I move under the light because I understand.  
That we all need love, and I'm not afraid.  
I feel the love but I don't feel that way.  
  
Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist.  
I told her no, she cried Te amo,  
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go.  
My soul is awry and without asking why.  
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said  
Don't it mean I love you.  
I think it means I love you.  
Don't it mean I love you.  
I think it means I love you, I love you.  
  
Te amo, te amo, don't it mean I love you.
