Met this stranger there, so I was  
Feeling somewhat scared  
When I vacationed in a land that I  
Didn't know that well  
But all the ladies there were nice  
The gentlemen politely out of line  
I kept on thinking how I'd like  
To spend some time  
I couldn't make up my mind, still  
Waitin' for the right sign  
I was down in Tokyo  
Livin' in hotel Imperial  
Met this man, he was something  
Very strange  
Said he was a spy from somewhere  
Else way far away  
He told me things about myself that  
I could tell nobody else  
Passed this message on to me, said  
Spirits move in secrecy  
I could almost read the man's mind  
Waitin' for the right sign  
I really wanna know if I'm gonna go  
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in  
Tokyo  
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo  
He passed this message on to me  
Said spirits move in secrecy  
A double agent amnesty  
An Ian Fleming mystery  
I, I know I read the man's mind  
I know I got the right sign  
I really wanna know if I'm gonna go  
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in  
Tokyo  
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo  
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in  
Tokyo  
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo
