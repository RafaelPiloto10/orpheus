Hey you, where are you going with that suitcase  
Naw, put that down, you ain't going nowhere  
  
Just reflecting on the way it was - it is irrelevant  
The fact we're still together baby doll - is so significant  
I love you child I always will this will never change  
I sign myself to you baby every time I speak your name  
Back in the days when I was young and blind  
Hanging with the sista's we was fine as wine  
Checking you out on a regular basis  
I even let you touch me in all my secret places  
  
And I gave in when you held me  
And we move and we groove and you wanted me  
And you loved me and you wanted me  
And you moaned and you groaned so don't you be  
Crazy I'm your baby hold me tighter baby ahh  
I'm your main squeeze - come on and squeeze me baby  
Don't erase me I'm your baby  
Kiss me one time and it's over  
I'm your main squeeze - squeeze me - tease me  
  
Round and round we go  
In and out and up and over  
Give me your love - ooh I need your love - I want your love  
  
I couldn't see the forest for the trees  
And every guy that tried to turn my head  
Could not obstruct my view  
You love me child you always will  
In this you have no choice  
You sign yourself to me every time you hear my voice  
  
Back in the day when you was leading the pack  
Honey you're my man - young gifted and black  
Riding around in an old '64  
I even let you touch me, even let you score  
And I gave in when you held me  
And we moved and we grooved and you wanted me  
And you loved me and you wanted me  
And you moaned and you groaned so don't be crazy  
Couldn't see the forest baby, through the trees  
All I saw was you - ooh baby  
And we moved, and we grooved  
And we moved and we grooved and you wanted me
