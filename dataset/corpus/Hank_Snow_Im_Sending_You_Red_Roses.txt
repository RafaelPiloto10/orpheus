I'm far away from home out on the dashing foam,  
Just how far I have traveled I'll never know,  
Sometimes I feel so blue and I long for home and you,  
But I must stay and fight the foe.  
  
So I'm sending you red roses to tell you my love is true,  
And I send them so you will know dear that I'm always thinking of you.  
Enclosed you will find my heart dear so treat it with tender care  
And every time you look inside dear you'll find my love is there.  
  
May each petal be a memory of the happiness we knew,  
Each thorn may tell a story of the heartache that I've been through,  
So I'm sending you red roses although we're oceans apart,  
And remember when they fade dear that you'll always have my heart.
