I know what you did  
I know  
So I'ma let you taste her  
I ain't washing my sins  
I ain't washing my sins  
  
Now we're lying about the nights  
Hiding it all behind the smiles  
Take a look at what you did  
You probably thought that you'd break my heart  
You probably thought that you'd make me cry  
But baby it's okay  
I swear it's okay  
  
'Cause I know everything  
I know everything  
I know everything  
I know everything  
  
Now these tops don't twist like they did before  
Tried to keep you out  
And you are done  
But baby it don't hurt  
Oh, like you thought it would  
The more of you the merrier  
  
Now we're lying about the nights  
Hiding it all behind the smiles  
Take a look at what you did, hey  
You probably thought that you'd break my heart  
You probably thought that you'd make me cry  
Baby it's okay  
It's okay  
  
I know everything  
I know everything  
I know everything  
I know everything
