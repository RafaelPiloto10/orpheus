Can't see, can't breathe,  
Can't get up off my knees.  
I don't know what comes over me,  
Whenever you come near.  
  
Heart's poundin' in my chest  
Little voice inside my head  
I can't hear a word it said,  
But the feelin's loud and clear.  
  
Love must be tellin' me somethin'  
Givin' me some kind of sign  
Spellin' it out for me,  
Love must be tellin' me  
I must be fallin' tonight.  
  
Well I've been in love and lost.  
I swore us one and all,  
No matter what the cost,  
Gotta learn to live without.  
  
No you weren't in my plans,  
But baby here I am.  
I still don't understand,  
But I know there ain't no doubt.  
  
Love must be tellin' me somethin'  
Givin' me some kind of sign  
Spellin' it out for me,  
Love must be tellin' me  
I must be fallin' tonight.  
  
No you weren't in my plans,  
But now baby here I am.  
I still don't understand,  
But I know there ain't no doubt.  
  
Love must be tellin' me  
Love must be tellin' me  
Love must be tellin' me  
  
Love must be tellin' me somethin'  
Givin' me some kind of sign  
Spellin' it out for me,  
Love must be tellin' me  
I must be fallin' tonight.  
  
Love must be tellin' me  
Love must be tellin' me  
  
I must be fallin' tonight
