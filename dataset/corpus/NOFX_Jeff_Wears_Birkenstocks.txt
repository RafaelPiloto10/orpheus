Don't want to chill, don't want to sit  
Don't want to hear no chippy shit  
Don't tell me I've closed my mind  
  
Don't want to groove don't want to dig  
Don't want to spend the day naked  
Don't like my music country fried  
  
He's got a tye dyed Rancid shirt  
Wears his Birkenstocks to work  
Is he a jerk? No! Just confused  
Jeff don't wear regular shoes  
  
Fat Mike I gotta let you know  
It's not the tunes, it's their live show  
And all the people you get to meet  
Plenty of good vibes and decent drugs  
Stinky people give you hugs  
Walk around in your bare feet  
  
He's got a tye dyed Rancid shirt  
Wears his Birkenstocks to work  
Is he a jerk? No! Just confused  
Jeff don't wear regular shoes  
Jeff don't wear regular shoes
