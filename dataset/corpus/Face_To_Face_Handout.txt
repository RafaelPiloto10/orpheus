What's it going to take to be done?  
What's it going to be right or wrong?  
I don't have the strength left to fight  
I don't have to make up my mind  
  
I know you're never wrong  
No matter what it takes  
I know you're not the one  
But we all make mistakes  
Help me out  
  
I don't want your handout  
I don't need your way out  
  
So what's it going to be  
I've done everything  
Why won't you believe?  
You're the same as me
