Yes, sometimes it seems that I don't care  
Don't worry 'bout it, baby, don't you never, never, never fear  
That's a man's way, oh, that's a man's way  
(That's a man's way)  
Of lovin' you, yes, it is, yes, it is, child  
  
One more thing, I know I buy you so many fancy things  
When you already have so much, you just can hardly find room enough  
But that's a man's way, oh, that's a man's way  
(That's a man's way)  
Of lovin' you, yes, it is, yes, it is, child  
  
If I had to leave you and go away, you know what?  
I'd write you a letter each and every day  
One more thing, I know you get so tired of me callin' you on the phone  
But that's a man's way of sayin' you just don't wanna be all alone  
  
If you give me a million things to do, you know what?  
I'd do them all, baby, just to get back home to you  
That's a man's way, oh, that's a man's way  
(That's a man's way)  
Of lovin' you, yeah  
(That's a man's way)  
  
Yes, it is  
(That's a man's way)  
A real man's way  
(That's a man's way)
