Well, I heard there was a secret chord  
That David played to please the Lord  
But you don't really care for music, do you?  
  
Well, it goes like this the fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall and the major lift  
The baffled king composing Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
  
And she tied you to her kitchen chair  
She broke your throne and she cut your hair  
And from the lips she drew the Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Yeah, baby, I've been here before  
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor  
I used to live alone before I knew you  
  
And I've seen your flag on that marble arch  
Your love is not a victory march  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Well, there was a time when you let me know  
What was going on below  
Now you don't never show that to me, do you?  
  
But remember when I moved in you  
And the holy dove was moving too  
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Well, now maybe there's a God above  
But all I've ever learned from love  
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you  
  
And it's not your cry that I hear at night, no  
It's not someone who's seen the light  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah
