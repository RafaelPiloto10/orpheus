How clever is my pride, how it deceives my mind  
To think I am in control when I have really lost it all  
How brilliant is my greed for what it says I need  
And then I've come to find I'm empty on the inside  
Real, my heart is aching to be real  
So I am coming to You  
All my broken motives, all my selfish dreams  
All of my foolishness now I understand where it leads  
I wanna be in Your love, I wanna be so much more  
I know You're reaching out so what am I fighting You for  
So what am I fighting You for  
How quick is my doubt to leave my heart without  
The presence of Your peace so that I scarce believe  
How pardoned is my guilt to crush the life You built  
And to keep me far away from any kind of shame  
Real, my heart is aching to be real  
So I am coming to You  
All my broken motives, all my selfish dreams  
All of my foolishness now I understand where it leads  
I wanna be in Your love, I wanna be so much more  
I know You're reaching out so what am I fighting You for  
'Cause only You can save me  
And only You can change me  
And only You can love me  
Here I come, here I come  
So I come to You  
All my broken motives, all my selfish dreams  
All of my foolishness 'cause I understand where it leads  
I wanna be in Your love, I wanna be so much more  
I know You're reaching out so what am I fighting You  
All my broken motives, all my selfish dreams  
All of my foolishness now I understand where it leads  
I wanna be in Your love, I wanna be so much more  
I know You're reaching out I don't wanna fight anymore  
I don't wanna fight anymore  
I don't wanna fight anymore  
I don't wanna fight anymore  
I don't wanna fight
