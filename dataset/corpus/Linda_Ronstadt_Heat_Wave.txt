Whenever I'm with him  
Something inside starts to burning  
And I'm filled with desire  
  
Could it be the devil in me  
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?  
  
It's like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Can't keep from crying  
It's tearing me apart  
  
Whenever he calls my name  
Soft, low, sweet and plain, I feel, yeah yeah  
Well I feel that burning flame  
  
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me  
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?  
  
It's like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Can't keep from crying  
It's tearing me apart  
  
Sometimes I stare into space  
Tears all over my face  
I can't explain it don't understand it  
I hadn't ever felt like this before  
  
Now that funny feeling has me amazed  
I don't know what to do my head's in a haze  
  
It's like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Can't keep from crying  
It's tearing me apart  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah, oh oh  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh  
  
Don't pass up this chance  
This time it's true romance  
  
Heat wave  
Heat wave  
Heat wave  
Ooh, heat wave
