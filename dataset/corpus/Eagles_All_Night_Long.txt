We get up early and we work all day  
We put our time in 'cause we like to stay up  
All night long  
  
We keep on grinnin' till the weekend comes  
Just a pinch between your cheek and gum  
All night long, all night long  
  
Start in the morning and get the job done  
Take care of bus'ness and we have some fun  
All night long, all night long  
  
We like a long neck and a good old song  
Turn it up and then we sing along  
Sing along  
We're all stayin' up all night long  
  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long
