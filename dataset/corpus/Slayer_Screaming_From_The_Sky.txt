I stalk close in from above  
Silent wings will test your faith  
Death will never hear me pass  
Launch attack you're too late  
I hear flak inside my head  
Deafening thunder cities burn  
Carpet-bombing laid to waste  
Throwned inside a death mask  
  
Holy cross embedded in your tomb  
Casualties are buried through your mind  
Certain death is screaming from the sky  
  
I live to destroy below  
Hunted victims are unseen  
Flying wrath a fortress hell  
War machine to kill all  
I leave carnage in my wake  
Choking bleeding for your life  
Faceless prey has been erased  
Silence reigns you're dead now  
  
Holy cross embedded in your tomb  
Casualties are buried through your mind  
Certain death is screaming from the sky  
  
Listen to the rhythm of a dead man walking  
Silent is the heartbeat of the predator stalking  
Hear the sound of air feel the warmth touch your neck  
Reality is not fair no time to second guess  
Hear the distant ringing of the blade as it cuts through your neck  
Silent is the cry lying on your mattress of blood  
An easy mark for a veteran of execution  
I walk step by step with death  
Where all bludgeoned bodies lie  
You will see my face of rage  
Cut your heart out of your chest  
Leave impaled the consummation of mankind
