Lovers depend on moonlight for a love affair  
Babies depend on mothers for their tender care  
Flowers depend on sunshine and the morning dew  
Each thing depends on something and I depend on you  
  
I can be happy, I can be sad  
I can be good or I can be bad, it all depends on you  
I can be lonely out in a crowd  
I can be humble, I can be proud, it all depends on you  
  
I can save money or spend it, go right on living or end it  
You're to blame, honey, for what I do  
I know that I can be beggar, I can be queen  
I can be almost any old thing, it all depends on you  
  
I can be happy, I can be sad  
I can be good or I can be bad, it all depends on you  
I can be lonely out in a crowd  
I can be humble, I can be proud, it all depends on you  
  
I can save money or spend it, go right on living or end it  
You're to blame, honey, for what I do  
I know that I can be beggar, I can be queen  
I can be almost any old thing, it all depends on you
