Daybreak, I can't hide the truth  
It seems I'm not so strong  
And suddenly, there's no more to lose  
So where did I go wrong  
I should have known before  
Her love for me was gone  
  
Now I'm waiting for the light  
To fill this empty room  
I need you now to break through the night  
Whose shadows came too soon  
I waited far too long and now  
I feel I can't go on  
  
CHORUS  
Daybreak, oh daybreak  
I let her walk away  
I should have said, don't go  
I know I should have found another way  
Now I don't know what to do  
So daybreak, please break through  
  
Daybreak, I feel so alone  
Why won't you come to stay  
  
I waited far too long and now  
I feel I can't go on  
  
REPEAT CHORUS
