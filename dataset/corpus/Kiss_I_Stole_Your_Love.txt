Alright!  
I remember the day that we met  
I needed someone, you needed someone too, yeah  
Spend time takin' all you could get  
Givin' yourself was one thing you never could do  
  
You played with my heart, played with my head  
I got to laugh when I think of the things you said  
  
Cause I stole your love, stole your love  
Ain't never gonna let you go  
I, oh yeah, stole your love, I stole your love  
Stole your love, I stole your love  
  
You never stop runnin' around  
You pick me up, then you could still put me down  
You were the girl that nobody could own  
Stay for a while, then you would leave me alone  
  
I'm somethin' different, ain't like the rest  
How does it feel to find out you're failin' your test  
  
Cause I stole your love, stole your love  
Ain't never gonna let you go  
I, I, stole your love, I stole your love  
Stole your love, I stole your love  
Guitar  
  
Listen, I stole your love, stole your love  
Ain't never gonna let you go  
I, I, stole your love, I stole your love  
Stole your love, I stole your love  
I stole your love, stole your love  
I stole your love, stole your love  
I stole your love, oh  
I, oh yeah, stole your love, I stole your love  
Stole your love, I stole your love  
I, oh yeah, stole your love,  
Oh yeah, stole your love, alright
