I walked down by the river where we used to go  
And underneath the bridge where we first kissed  
The old town that we knew is dead and gone  
Gone  
The sickly sun shines grayly through the mist  
And like the love we used to know  
The poisoned river waters flow  
And then they're gone  
For some of us still life moves on  
Our love is just a relic of the past  
You'd never recognise the old town now  
Somewhere behind the concrete and the glass  
The monuments of england's sacred cow  
Where are all the human beings?  
Have they been sent to milton keynes?  
They used to live round here but now they're gone  
For some of us still life moves on
