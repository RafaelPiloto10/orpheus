Three thirty on a sick summer's day  
I round myself staring at a Newcastle bus stop  
A total stranger in a herringbone suit  
Asked me the time through his cigarette lighter  
Fifteen years later on a Wednesday night  
L round myself dreaming in a Manchester night-club  
A total stranger in a luminous tracksuit  
Gives me a kiss and he tastes of aluminium  
Then he's gone  
And in his place a cat with green eyes  
A cat with no tall at all  
Just a very sad expression on his race  
Mandarin quotes on a wrought iron gate  
I'm ringing the doorbell, but the petrol keeps leaking  
A total stranger in a cashmere coat  
Tells me politely, "Your wife is on fire"  
A family outing at the Gosforth Park Hotel  
The girl in the kitchen is working a job scheme  
L told my wife I'm sure I've seen her before  
She told me I kissed her al a Newcastle bus stop  
Then I was gone  
And in my place a cat with green eyes  
A cat with a tale to tell
