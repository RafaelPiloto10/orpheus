This heart is your heart  
And can't nobody take it away  
Ooh no, this heart is your heart  
And can't nobody take it away from me  
Ooh no, no, no, no, just can't take my love away  
I give my heart to you to have and keep  
May it pleasure your desires  
And keep our love from getting weak  
We'll keep the fire burning and our love wheel turning  
You can surely have my all, all you have to do is call  
Because (this heart) this heart  
(is your heart) is your heart  
(and can't nobody)  
Always baby, (take it away from me) yeah, yeah  
(this heart) this heart (is your heart) is your heart  
(and can't nobody) yeah baby  
(take it away from me)  
No, no, never, never, never, never take it away from me  
Oh, ho, our love will always be so safe and sound  
Always lifting you up, never letting you down  
The guys will come and go, making scenes rather sad  
But I let them all know just how it is (just how it is)  
Oh just how it is (just how it is)  
Yeah, I knew the day that I first met you boy, ooh, hoo  
That it would be hard to leave you, a rah, na, na, dah  
Now that I know that I have you boy, you know  
I thank God that I'll never, never, never, never have to  
Yes I do (thank God I'll never, never, never, never have to)  
(thank God I'll never, never, never, never have to)  
Every day  
(thank God I'll never, never, never, never have to)  
I say thank you  
(thank God I'll never, never, never, never have to)  
Thank you god  
(thank God I'll never, never, never, never have to)  
Thank god, thank god, thank you  
(thank God I'll never, never, never, never have to)  
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you  
(thank God I'll never, never, never, never have to)  
I thank god  
(thank God I'll never, never, never, never have to)  
Oh, baby (this heart) listen to me (is your heart)  
Is yours baby  
(and can't nobody) nobody, nobody (take it away)  
Take it away  
(this heart) this heart (is your heart)  
Is yours baby  
(and can't nobody) nobody, nobody (take it away)  
Can't take it away (yeah, yeah) yeah  
(yeah, yeah) yeah, yeah  
(yeah, yeah) yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah) (yeah, yeah)  
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)  
Yeah, (yeah, yeah) (yeah, yeah) yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Yeah, thank God (yeah, yeah)...
