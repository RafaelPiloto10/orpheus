Marilyn:  
You harmed her, no reason why  
She fuckin hates yeah you  
Like she hates the"one true god"  
  
She tried to give you everything  
You just threw it away  
Turned it into bullshit  
And runned away  
  
Girl:  
Now its your turn  
To cry and beg  
For some miracle from your god  
And whine like a hog  
Everthing that comes  
Goes by  
Its your turn  
I hope you die  
In the shadow of the Valley of Death  
  
Marilyn:  
Shes now looking for me  
Someone who does aprecciate  
Like drugs for life  
  
Don't believe you let her go  
Now she gets me high high  
While you beg and fuck  
  
Girl x 2  
  
Marilyn:  
Now she sees the real thing  
Doesn't know  
Why she cryed for a motherfucker like you  
Like you... Like you.....  
  
Shouting both: This song is dedicated for all the motherfuckers  
Who harm with no reason, hey your not the drug, so don't try to be one  
Remember that shit comes.. And goes by... The sorrow exists
