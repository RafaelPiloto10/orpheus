I'm going down  
Won't you help me  
Save me from myself  
I hear the sound of the memory  
Maybe time will tell  
  
Suddenly my life is like a river  
Taking me places I don't want to go  
But like all good men who swim too well  
It takes all that I have just to cry for help  
Then that voice in my head tells me no  
  
I'm going down  
Won't you help me  
Save me from myself  
I hear the sound of the memory  
Maybe, who can tell ?  
  
Let me live my life beside the river  
Take me to places where a child can grow  
And then maybe the boy inside will forsake me  
Maybe the child in me will just let me go  
  
I'm going down  
The cold, cold water is rushing in  
I'm going down  
And I would beg to be forgiven  
  
If I knew my sin
