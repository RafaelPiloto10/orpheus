Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum  
You came along and everything's startin' to hum  
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come  
  
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?  
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine  
  
A-Wait till the warm-up's underway  
Wait till our lips have met  
And wait till you see that sunshine day  
You ain't seen nothin' yet  
  
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?  
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine  
  
Come the day you're mine  
I'm gonna teach you to fly  
We've only tasted the wine  
We're gonna drain the cup dry  
  
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround  
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground  
  
A-Wait till you're locked in my embrace  
Wait till I draw you near  
A-Wait till you see that sunshine place  
Ain't nothin' like it here  
  
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?  
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine  
  
Come the day you're mine  
And you're gonna be mine
