This garden that I built for you  
That you sit in now and yearn  
I will never leave it, dear  
I could not bear to return  
And find it all untended  
With the trees all bended low  
This garden is our home, dear  
And I got nowhere else to go  
  
So bring it on  
Bring it on  
Every little tear  
Bring it on  
Every useless fear  
Bring it on  
All your shattered dreams  
And I'll scatter them into the sea  
Into the sea  
  
The geraniums on your window sill  
The carnations, dear, and the daffodil  
Well, they're ordinary flowers  
But they long for the light of your touch  
And of your trembling will  
Ah, you're trembling still  
And I am trembling too  
To be perfectly honest I don't know  
Quite what else to do  
  
So bring it on  
Bring it on  
Every neglected dream  
Bring it on  
Every little scheme  
Bring it on  
Every little fear  
And I'll make them disappear  
  
So bring it on, bring it on  
Bring it on  
Every little thing  
Bring it on  
Every tiny fear  
Bring it on  
Every shattered dream  
And I'll scatter them into the sea
