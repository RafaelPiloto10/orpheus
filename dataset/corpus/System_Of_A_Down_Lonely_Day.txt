Such a lonely day  
And it's mine  
The most loneliest day of my life  
  
Such a lonely day  
Should be banned  
This day that I can't stand  
  
The most loneliest day of my life  
The most loneliest day of my life  
  
Such a lonely day  
Shouldn't exist  
A day that Ill never miss  
Such a lonely day  
And it's mine  
The most loneliest day of my life  
  
And if you go, I wanna go with you  
And if you die, I wanna die with you  
  
Take your hand and walk away  
  
The most loneliest day of my life  
The most loneliest day of my life  
The most loneliest day of my life  
Life  
  
Such a lonely day  
And it's mine  
A day that I'm glad I survived
