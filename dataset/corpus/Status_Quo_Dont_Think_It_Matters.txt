Maybe I'm right, or maybe I'm wrong  
I got to go on anyway  
I'm finding it hard to try and play the right card  
And woman you're getting in my way  
Oh, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
  
I'm working all night, you know I'm working all night  
Trying to get something out of my head  
I live for the day when everybody will say  
It's better than all of the rest  
Oh, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
  
Maybe I'm right, or maybe I'm wrong  
I just do the best that I can  
I been working all night, yeah I work through the night  
Woman can't you understand?  
  
Oh, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all
