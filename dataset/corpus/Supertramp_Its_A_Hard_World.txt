I live in a vacumn, no air  
I'm stuck in back room, somewhere  
But it don't bother me amyway 'cause I know  
Goin' to get out soon, I got places to go  
  
There's a big world waiting for me  
I just need a break, someone to believe  
but right now I'm just tryin' to survive  
Livin' rough, shackin' up, hangin' tough, shapin' up  
  
Get the picture, get the scene I paint fo ryou  
Ah, but it's worth it, all the pain I'm goin' through  
Beat the sidewalk, hear the fast talk, everyday  
I don't worry 'cause I know I'm on my way  
  
The view from my window, ain't too good  
Should be some mail for me soon from Hollywood  
When the phone rings, could be big things, anytime  
Operator is there somethin' wrong with this line  
  
Rejections, I've had a few  
Happens to the best, it ain't nothin' new  
Still I keep on swingin' away  
S'gonna be a breakthrough any day  
  
Keep hanging in there, that's my philosophy  
And soon I'll find my big chance, wait and see  
Some make it fast, but they just come and go  
Me, I'm built to last and that's one thing I know  
  
Those straight life people, they don't understand  
Yeah they just want it all laid out and planned  
Me, I'm not like them, I do things my own way  
I know I'm gonna break through any day  
  
Life in the city, can get you down  
There's amillion guys out there all snooping around  
You gotta think you're the best, beat out all the rest  
And fight your way up to the top of the town  
  
There's a big world waiting for me  
I just need a break, someone to believe  
Right now I'm just tryin' to survive  
I'm know I'm gonna get there, dead or alive  
  
I'm going to reach for the moon  
And all the stars too  
I'm gonna get there real soon, I know I will  
I want the universe, and all the planers too
