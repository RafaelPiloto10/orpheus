No one lives forever  
So don't waste your time  
Just ain't right to walk away  
Roll the dice, lay it on the line  
Many roads to travel  
In your search you might find  
That getting there will have no meaning  
If you can't enjoy the ride  
Too high a price that everyone's paying  
The world ain't so nice, trying to survive  
Spending your life, takin' chances you're given  
That's always enough to keep the dream alive  
If you're lookin' for trouble  
You can bet it's gaining from behind  
When you give, you get back double  
You can't lose, let your heart decide  
Too high a price that everyone's paying  
The world ain't so nice, trying to survive  
Spending your life, takin' chances you're given  
That's always enough to keep the dream alive  
No one lives forever  
So don't waste your time  
Just ain't right to walk away  
Roll the dice, lay it on the line  
Too high a price that everyone's paying  
The world ain't so nice, trying to survive  
Spending your life, takin' chances you're given  
That's always enough to keep the dream alive  
Too high a price  
The world ain't so nice  
Spending your life, takin' chances you're given  
That's always enough to keep that dream alive  
Too high a price  
The world ain't so nice  
Spending your life  
That's always enough  
Too high a price  
The world ain't so nice  
Spending your life  
That's always enough  
Too high a price  
The world ain't so nice
