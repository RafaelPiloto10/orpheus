Get back the fact is that their giving me slack cause I'm the  
prophet of naught and the gospel aphrodisiac. Give me

not to worry ya. Bury ya make you bounce like a berry ya'll.  
Make you giddy in you stomach like your sisters are ba ra  
bop. And now you met your match as I drain out your power  
and make you stop like a Seiko sports watch.

motherfucking weirdo  
  
You see the laughing man he's a nut cause he's a Salinger  
fan It's the Quarashi plan taken from the Koran. They beat  
us up and they wait till we break but in the end this is just  
another earthquake. Repent and your lost, forget with all  
cost. It's a malady a sickness you can't floss. You gotta  
leave it behind, look around find a sign get back on the  
track and walk the fine line.  
  
Your a blank zero, forsaken hero you're always gonna be a  
motherfucking weirdo

the man from the crew, little boy blue. Wait until it's dark  
and we'll be home for you. Now you may fuck up, you  
fucking stuck up prick you better watch it before you make  
the whole world sick that's it. Making me ill, you know  
against your will. I'm throwing rhymes like grenades,
