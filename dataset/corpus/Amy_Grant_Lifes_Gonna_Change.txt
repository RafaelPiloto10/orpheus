Just like tarzan,swinging on a vine.I move hard left then come back right.My
life is like a bommerang flow.It's far away then it's right back home.The
giant pendulum is swinging to and fro.This road were riding on where does it
go?And maybe soon is gone end than you never know.  
  
Chorus  
Hard as I try to get all arranged.Life's gonna change,uhh!Just when i'm used
to the pouring rain.That's when the sun starts shinin again.Life's Gonna
Change!  
  
Why not smile,while you got your smile.The tears might come.Might last a
while.Might as well live,while you got your life ,cause it's a little too late
when it's time to die.The giant pendulum is ticking off the days.I only blink
and may have passed away.And that's why anytime i turn around it's been
amazed.  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Just When I'm Used To The Pouring Rain.That's when the sun starts shinin
again!Life's Gonna Change!  
  
Instrumental  
Sun is gonna shine on me!  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Just when i'm used to the pourin rain.That's when the sun starts shinin
again,Life is gonna change.Repeat Chorus.Sings Life's gonna change till
fade.Repeat Chorus Till Fades.
