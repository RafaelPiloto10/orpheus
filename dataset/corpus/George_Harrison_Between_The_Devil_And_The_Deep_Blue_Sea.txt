I don't want you  
But I hate to lose you  
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I forgive you  
'Cause I can't forget you  
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I want to cross you off my list  
But when you come knocking at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I come running back for more  
  
I should hate you  
But I guess I love you  
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
