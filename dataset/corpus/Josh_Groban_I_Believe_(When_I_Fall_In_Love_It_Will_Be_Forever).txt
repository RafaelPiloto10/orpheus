Shattered dreams, worthless years  
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell  
Life began, then was done  
Now I stare into a cold and empty well  
  
The many sounds that meet our ears  
the sights our eyes behold  
Will open up our merging hearts  
And feed our empty souls  
  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
  
Without despair we will share  
And the joys of caring will not be replaced  
What has been must never end  
And with the strength we have won't be erased  
When the truths of love are planted firm  
They won't be hard to find  
And the words of love I speak to you  
will echo in your mind  
  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever,  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever,  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
  
This time  
  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever,  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
  
And oh that love will call  
And if I believe you're the only one for me  
  
I believe, I believe, I believe, when I fall in love, oh  
I believe, I believe, I believe, when I fall in love, oh  
  
When I fall  
  
I believe, I believe, I believe, when I fall  
  
When I fall  
  
When I fall in love
