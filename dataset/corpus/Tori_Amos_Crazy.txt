not sayin'  
Not charmed at all  
Not sayin'  
That you weren't worth  
The fall  
And I was alone when  
I knew it was real  
Down the canyon  
When I knew I had come  
  
To the line  
Through the dawn  
To the light  
To the turn  
When you said  
  
You could drive  
All night  
Drive all night  
  
So I let crazy  
Take a spin  
Then I let crazy  
Settle in  
Kicked off my shoes  
Shut reason out  
He said "first let's just  
Unzip your religion  
Down"  
  
Found that I  
I craved at all  
Saw me melt  
Into your  
Native shelter  
Where you carved my  
Name  
Paper tigers scare  
And came  
  
Alive  
Through the dawn  
To the light  
To the turn  
When you said  
  
You could drive all night  
All night  
Drive all night  
  
So I let crazy  
Take a spin  
Then I let crazy  
Settle in  
Kicked off my shoes  
Shut reason out  
He said "first let's just  
Unzip your religion  
Down"  
So I let crazy  
Pull me in  
Then I let crazy  
Take his spin  
Kicked off my shoes  
Shut reason out  
He said "first let's just unzip  
Your religion down"  
Heard that you were once  
"temptation's girl"  
  
And as soon  
As you have  
Rearranged the mess  
In your head  
He will show up looking  
Sane  
Perfectly sane  
If I know crazy
