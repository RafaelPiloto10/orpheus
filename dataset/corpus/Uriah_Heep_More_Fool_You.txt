I held the rope so tightly  
As she climbed  
Down from her room  
We said we'd make our getaway  
Underneath the moon  
I always will remember  
The night that we left home  
And the words of warning  
Ringing in my ears  
  
More fool you, more fool me  
  
New job, new friends and a family  
In a house on the sunny side  
We played on the wheel of fortune  
But it was me that took the ride  
It didn't work between us  
I had to give it all away  
And in the end I knew it had to be  
  
If I've told you once  
Then I've told you twice  
But I'll tell you once again  
Now she's taken away  
Most everything  
And I've lost my only friend
