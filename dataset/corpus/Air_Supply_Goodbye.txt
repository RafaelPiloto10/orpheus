I can see the pain living in your eyes  
And I know how hard you try  
You deserve to have so much more  
I can feel your heart and I sympathize  
And I'll never criticize all you've ever meant to my life  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to let you down  
I don't want to lead you on  
I don't want to hold you back  
From where you might belong  
You would never ask me why  
My heart is so disguised  
I just can't live a lie anymore  
I would rather hurt myself  
Than to ever make you cry  
There's nothing left to say but good-bye  
You deserve the chance at the kind of love  
I'm not sure I'm worthy of  
Losing you is painful to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You would never ask me why  
My heart is so disguised  
I just can't live a lie anymore  
I would rather hurt myself  
Than to ever make you cry  
There's nothing left to try  
Though it's gonna hurt us both  
There's no other way than to say good-bye
