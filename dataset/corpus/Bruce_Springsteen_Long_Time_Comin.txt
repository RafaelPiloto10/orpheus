Out where the creek turns shallow and sandy  
And the moon comes skimmin' away the stars  
The wind in the mesquite comes rushin' over the hilltops  
Straight into my arms  
Straight into my arms  
  
I'm riding hard carryin' a catch of roses  
And a fresh map that I made  
Tonight I'm gonna get birth naked and bury my old soul  
And dance on its grave  
And dance on its grave  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here  
  
Well my daddy he was just a stranger  
Lived in a hotel downtown  
When I was a kid he was just somebody  
Somebody I'd see around  
Somebody I'd see around  
  
Now down below and pullin' on my shirt  
I got some kids of my own  
Well if I had one wish in this god forsaken world, kids  
It'd be that your mistakes would be your own  
Yea your sins would be your own  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here  
  
Out 'neath the arms of Cassiopeia  
Where the sword of Orion sweeps  
It's me and you, Rosie, cracklin' like crossed wires  
And you breathin' in your sleep  
You breathin' in your sleep  
  
Well there's just a spark of campfire burning  
Two kids in a sleeping bag beside  
I Reach 'neath your shirt, lay my hands across your belly  
And feel another one kickin' inside  
I ain't gonna fuck it up this time  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here
