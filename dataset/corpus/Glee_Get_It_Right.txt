What have I done? I wish I could run  
Away from this ship going under  
Just trying to help, hurt everyone else  
Now I feel the weight of the world is  
On my shoulders  
  
What can you do when your good isn't good enough?  
When all that you touch tumbles down?  
'Cause my best intentions keep making a mess of things  
I just want to fix it somehow  
But how many times will it take?  
Oh, how many times will it take for me?  
To get it right  
To get it right  
  
Can I start again with my faith shaken?  
'Cause I can't go back and undo this  
I just have to stay and face my mistakes  
But if I get stronger and wiser  
I'll get through this  
  
What can you do when your good isn't good enough?  
When all that you touch tumbles down?  
'Cause my best intentions keep making a mess of things  
I just wanna fix it somehow  
But how many times will it take?  
Oh, how many times will it take for me?  
To get it right  
  
So I throw up my fist  
Throw a punch in the air  
And accept the truth, that sometimes life isn't fair  
Yeah, I'll send out a wish  
Yeah, I'll send up a prayer  
And finally, someone will see  
How much I care  
  
What can you do when your good isn't good enough?  
When all that you touch tumbles down?  
'Cause my best intentions keep making a mess of things  
I just wanna fix it somehow  
But how many times will it take?  
Oh, how many times will it take?  
To get it right  
To get it right
