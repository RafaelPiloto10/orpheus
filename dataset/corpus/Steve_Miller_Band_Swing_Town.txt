Ooo oh  
Ooo oh  
Come on and dance, come on and dance  
Let's make some romance  
You know the night is fallin'  
And the music's callin'  
And we've got to get down to Swingtown  
  
We've been workin' so hard  
We've been workin' so hard  
Come on baby  
Come on baby let's dance  
Come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on  
  
Ooo oh  
Ooo oh  
Come on and dance, come on and dance  
We may not get another chance  
You know the night is fallin'  
And the music's callin'  
And we've got to get down to Swingtown
