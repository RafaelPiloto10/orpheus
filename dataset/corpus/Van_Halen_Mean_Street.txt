At night I walk this stinkin' street past the crazies on my block  
And I see the same old faces and I hear that same old talk  
And I'm searching for the latest thing, a break in this routine  
I'm talkin' some new kicks, ones like you ain't never seen  
This is home, this is Mean Street  
(This is) Yes-ah home, the only one I know  
  
An' we don't worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause we're sick of these four walls  
Now what you think is nothin' might be somethin' after all  
Now you know this ain't no through street, the end is dead ahead  
The poor folks play for keeps down here, they're the living dead  
  
Come on down, (Huh! Ow!) down (This is) to Mean Street  
They're dancin' now, look! Out on Mean Street  
Dance baby!  
  
(Guitar Solo)  
  
It's always here and now my friend, it ain't once upon a time  
It's all over but the shouting, I come to take what's mine  
We're searchin' for the latest thing, a break in this routine  
Talkin' some new kicks, ones like you ain't never seen  
  
This is home, (Ooh) this is Mean Street  
(This is) Yes-ah home, only one I know  
  
(This is home) See, a gun is real easy  
(This is Mean Street) in this desperate part of town  
(This is home) Turns you from hunted into hunter (Yeah)  
(This is Mean Street) You go an' hunt somebody down  
Wait a minute, ah (This is home) Somebody said "Fair warning", Lord  
(This is Mean Street) Lord, strike that poor boy down!
