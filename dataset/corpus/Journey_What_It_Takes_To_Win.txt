Day has come  
You're prepared  
Electricity in the air  
Feel the calm  
Feel the rush  
You want to leave victorious  
Will you look in their eyes  
They want you gone, they want the prize  
When day is done, risk it all  
One will stand, and one will fall  
  
When you learn to lose  
You'll know what it takes to win  
Wanna go the distance  
With a hunger that never ends  
When you want to prove  
You're the best that's ever been  
They can knock you down  
You're on your feet again  
'Cause you know what it takes  
What it takes to win  
  
Seal the deal  
Get it done  
Earn the right to say you've won  
Work it out  
Sacrifice  
Someone's gonna have to pay the price  
Face to face  
Stand your ground  
Stay in the zone, now don't back down  
More than pride  
You depend  
Fighting hard 'til the very end  
  
When you learn to lose  
You'll know what it takes to win  
Wanna go the distance  
With a hunger that never ends  
When you want to prove  
You're the best that's ever been  
They can knock you down  
You're on your feet again  
'Cause you know what it takes  
What it takes to win  
  
When you share the dream  
There's no "I" in team  
Let the spirit take you higher  
It's a state of mind  
No one can define  
There's no limit to desire  
  
When you learn to lose  
You'll know what it takes to win  
Wanna go the distance  
With a hunger that never ends  
When you want to prove  
You're the best that's ever been  
They can knock you down  
You're on your feet again  
'Cause you know what it takes  
What it takes to win  
  
Wanna go the distance  
With a hunger that never ends  
When you want to prove  
You're the best that's ever been  
They can knock you down  
You're on your feet again  
'Cause you know what it takes  
What it takes to win  
  
What it takes to win  
What it takes to win
