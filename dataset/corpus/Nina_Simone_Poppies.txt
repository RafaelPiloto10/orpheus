A child ran through the meadow on a sun drenched summer day  
And then he stopped his play  
And kneeled in a field of poppies.  
A man walked through my ghetto on a humid summer day  
And then he stopped to pay and he dealed in a field of poppies.  
Oh, flower of forgetfulness, just an hour away to the moon  
Take a deep breath if you are reaching for truth  
While you're in the stupor  
The door knocks and death takes another youth.  
Poppies, red poppies..., red poppies...  
A boy I used to know, a boy I used to know who's laughter rang to the skies  
Was a joy to behold  
Then I looked into his eyes, a look so cold, a boy who (rose on (? ? ? sorry))  
In a field of poppies  
Poppies, red poppies, red poppies, red poppies..., red poppies...,  
Red poppies...., red poppies..., red poppies..., red poppies...,
