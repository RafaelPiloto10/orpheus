You're pretty as a daisy in an open field  
The way you make me feel from the get-go  
I had to let go of every little thing that Ive ever known  
You shake me up like Coke in a bottle  
You're a pedal to the floor, full throttle  
Ain't nothin' else on my mind when I see that pretty smile  
Go on  
  
Show me how it's done this side of Dixie  
I'm a broke down truck, baby, won't you fix me  
Just keep on dancin' til the break of dawn, come on, come on  
Stars fall down, make the world stop, kiss me  
Wherever I go, I want you with me  
Somethin' bout you makes my heart run wild  
You're love's poster child  
  
Damn girl, you make me feel so free  
Like a summer sun shining down on me  
And we're flying so high and good Lord we ain't even trying  
You got a hold on me now, like a southern wind  
Taking me places Ive never been  
And I'm lost in your eyes and come on darling, do it again  
  
Show me how it's done this side of Dixie  
I'm a broke down truck, baby, won't you fix me  
Just keep on dancin' til the break of dawn, come on, come on  
Stars fall down, make the world stop, kiss me  
Wherever I go, I want you with me  
Somethin' bout you makes my heart run wild  
You're love's poster child

Wherever I go, I want you with me

You're love's poster child
