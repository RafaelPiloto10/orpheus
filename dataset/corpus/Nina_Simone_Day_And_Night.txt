When you like a fellow  
Try to treat him right  
Give him your attention  
Day and Night  
  
When he starts to smilin'  
And he's got you uptight  
Shower him with kisses  
Day and night  
  
Tell him how you love him  
Tell him he's out of sight  
Then he'll know you dig him  
Day and night  
  
If he wants to leave you  
And you think he might  
Beg him not to leave you  
Day and night  
  
Tell him that you're lonely  
Tell him that you're cold  
Tell him that you need him  
Here to (Satisfy your soul)  
  
If he likes to dance now  
Tell you what you do  
When you see him comin' down the street  
You start to (Do the bungaloo)  
  
Oh no, even when he's wrong  
Tell him that he's righr  
You can take the blame  
Both day and night
