If I cried out loud  
over sorrows I've Known  
And the secrets I've heard  
It would ease my mind  
Someone sharing the load  
But I won't breathe a word  
  
We're two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We'll find a way to work it out  
  
While the children laughed  
I was always afraid  
of the Smile of the clown  
So I close my eyes  
Till I can't see the light  
And I hide from the sound  
  
We're two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We'll find a way to work it out  
  
I can hear the cry  
Of the leaf on a tree  
As it Falls to the ground  
I can hear the call  
of an Echoing voice  
And there's no one around  
  
We're two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We'll find a way to work it out
