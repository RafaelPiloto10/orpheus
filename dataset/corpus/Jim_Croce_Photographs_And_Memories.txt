Photographs and memories  
Christmas cards you sent to me  
All that I have are these  
To remember you  
  
Memories that come at night  
Take me to another time  
Back to a happier day  
When I called you mine  
  
But we sure had a good time  
When we started way back when  
Morning walks and bedroom talks  
Oh how I loved you then  
  
Summer skies and lullabies  
Nights we couldn't say good-bye  
And of all of the things that we knew  
Not a dream survived  
  
Photographs and memories  
All the love you gave to me  
Somehow it just can't be true  
That's all I've left of you  
  
But we sure had a good time  
When we started way back when  
Morning walks and bedroom talks  
Oh how I loved you then
