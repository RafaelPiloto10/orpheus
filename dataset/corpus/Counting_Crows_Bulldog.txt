Hey now bulldog  
Don't you rush in  
With your eyes wild  
Hey there big bear  
Take a moment  
To decide  
All these angels together  
Walk the wire line  
Scarecrow angels  
Says the bulldog  
With a smile  
They catch you in a corner  
Shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
They catch you in a corner  
Shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
One less bell to warn you..  
One more chance to say goodbye  
I don't I don't I don't think  
I understand you..  
Don't really think I do  
I don't I don't I don't  
.. Think I understand you  
Don't really think I do  
Hey Louise what's the barrier  
Between love and need?  
How far is it from love underneath  
What are you supposed to mean to me  
What do you mean to me?  
They catch you in a corner shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
They catch you in a corner  
Shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
One less bell to warn ya one more song to play..  
I'm going back to california  
Your gonna get your chance to say goodbye  
Hey mathew, is anybody mean to you  
And don't you harbor points of view  
Secretly belive in your doom  
I don't think I understand you  
I don't really think I do  
I don't think I understand you  
I don't really think I do  
Well ya got One less bell to warn ya  
One more song to play  
I'm going back to California  
Gonna get your chance to say goodbye  
One less bell to warn ya, one more chance to say goodbye...
