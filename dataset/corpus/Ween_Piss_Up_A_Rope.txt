My dinner's on fire while she watches TV  
And if you've ever wondered what it's like to be me  
She takes all my money and leaves me no smokes  
Yells at my buddies and insults my folks  
I'm breakin' my back doin' the best that I can  
She's got time for the dog and none for her man  
And I'm no dope, but I can't cope  
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope  
  
You can piss up a rope  
And you can put on your shoes, hit the road get truckin'  
Pack your bag, I don't need the ag  
On your knees you big, booty bitch start suckin'  
You ride my ass like a horse in a saddle  
Now you're up shits creek with a turd for a paddle  
And I can't cope piss up a rope  
  
Uh, you can piss up a rope and feel the pissy dribble  
You can piss up a rope and watch me giggle  
For the last 6 months I been packin' your bag  
You can wash my balls with a warm, wet rag  
Till my balls feel smooth and soft like silk  
I'm sick of your mouth and your 2 percent milk  
And I'm no dope, but I've lost all hope  
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope  
  
You can piss up a rope  
And you can put on your shoes, hit the road get truckin'  
Pack your bag, I don't need the age  
On your knees you big, booty bitch start suckin'  
You ride my ass like a horse in a saddle  
Now you're up shits creek with a turd for a paddle  
And I can't cope piss up a rope
