We'll take a taxi to the show  
We could report by phone  
We could remind ourselves that  
We must laugh  
  
Reconsider: 'fame'  
I need new reasons  
This is detention it's not fun at all  
  
[Chorus]  
Remind me to smile  
You know, 'the old friends' line  
It gets so I feel like  
I'm in this cold, glass, cage  
  
I've got the horrors  
Check, over my shoulder  
I punch the air and fight but  
No-one's there  
  
You you oh no  
Old scars don't show  
We fall you see  
Crawl crawl in love  
I dive so clean  
Young things don't scream  
Toys toys so far  
Boys boys you are  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Get off the car  
Get off the phone  
Move from my window, leave me alone  
  
Keep your revivals  
Keep your conventions  
Keep all your fantasies that's all we are
