CHORUS: Pharaoh, Pharaoh, whoa baby, let my people go! (2x)  
  
A burnin' bush told me just the other day  
That I should go to Egypt and say,  
"It's time to let my people be free -  
Listen to God if you won't listen to me!"  
  
CHORUS  
  
Well me and and my people goin' to the Red Sea,  
With Pharaoh's best army comin' after me.  
I took my staff, stuck it in the sand,  
And all of God's people walked on dry land.  
Singin...  
  
CHORUS  
  
Now Pharaoh's army was a-comin' too,  
So whattaya think that God did do?  
Had me take my staff and clear my throat,  
And all of Pharaoh's army did the dead man's float.  
  
CHORUS  
  
Well that's the story of the stubborn goat.  
Pharaoh should've know that chariots don't float.  
The lesson is simple, it's easy to find,  
When God says, "GO!" you had better mind!
