Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh yeah, there's something about you)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh yeah, there's something about you)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Beautiful, I just want you to know (Oh!)  
You're my favorite girl (Oh yeah, there's something about you)  
  
I know you gon' lose it, this new Snoop shit  
Come on baby boo, you gotsta get into it (Oh!)  
Don't fool wit the player with the cool whip  
Yeah-yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit  
Walk to it, do it how you do it  
Have a glass, lemme put you in the mood and, (Oh!)  
Lil' cutie lookin' like a student  
Long hair, with ya big fat booty  
Back in the days you was a girl I went to school wit  
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it (Oh!)  
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it  
Here to walk wit some pimp-pimp clue wit'  
Mommy don't worry, I won't abuse it  
Hurry up and finish so you can watch "Clueless" (Oh-hooo!)  
I laugh at these niggas when they ask who do this  
But everybody know who girl that you is  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish  
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it (Oh!)  
Homeboy, she taken, just move it  
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it  
We just blow 'dro and keep the flow movin'  
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin' (Oh!)  
Body rag interior blue, and  
Have them hydraulics squeakin' when we screwin'  
Now she's yellin', hollerin' out Snoop, and  
Hootin', hollerin', hollerin', hootin' (Oh!)  
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'  
Hair long and black and curly like you're Cuban  
Keep groovin', that's what we doin'  
And we gon' be together until your moms move in (Oh!)  
  
Oh yeah, there's something about you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
See I just want you  
To know that you are really special  
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why  
  
See I just want you  
To know that you are really special  
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why  
  
Oh yeah, there's something about you  
  
Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in  
You got my pictures on the wall in your room-in (Oh)  
Girls be complainin' you keep me boomin'  
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone  
(Oh yeah, there's something about you)  
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'  
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you-in (Oh)  
You don't ask why I roll wit a crew, and  
Twist up my fingers and wear dark blue-in  
(Oh yeah, there's something about you)  
On the east side, that's the crew I choose  
Nothin' I do is new to you (Oh-hooo!)  
I smack up the world if they rude to you  
Cause baby girl you're so beautiful  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
See I just want you  
To know that you are really special  
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why  
  
See I just want you  
To know that you are really special  
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why  
  
See I just want you  
To know that you are really special  
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why  
  
See I just want you  
To know that you are really special  
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why  
  
Yeah, oh yeah there's something about you  
Yeah, oh yeah there's something about you  
Yeah, oh yeah there's something about you
