You must have heard of all the rules  
Thick and thin teaches you hard  
And all the tricks come back on you  
Leave them behind  
There's a better way  
A better way  
All along you must have known  
Where your life was leading  
The good and bad times  
Where your life was leading  
  
And I know you've been through hell  
Yes I know all about it  
And I've seen your cool white face  
But I can't seem to care about it  
Care about it
