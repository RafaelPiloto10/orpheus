Peter's on the loose  
I'd like to see him again  
I remember when  
We made love  
On the jetty in the rain.  
When the fishing boats would  
Come back in  
At the end of the day  
He'd run up the hill to my cabin  
With a swordfish and he'd say:  
"Girl I want you all over again"  
All over again  
  
[Chorus]  
In Menemsha, Menemsha  
Menemsha, Menemsha  
  
The sunset on the sound  
Were almost too much to take  
We would dance on the hill  
With our friends  
'Til the morning would break  
Everybody drank too much beer  
In those days  
Thank God it wasn't whisky  
Or we'd all be dead  
And Peter and me we'd pull the shades  
Everyone was interested  
In Peter and me  
  
[Chorus]
