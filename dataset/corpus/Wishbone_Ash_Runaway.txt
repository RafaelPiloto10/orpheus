I thought I had been every place a man could be  
'Till I met a lady who brought me to my knees  
The day I stop loving is the day that I die  
But now I'm running from her game 'cause the lady is a lie  
  
I've got a choice  
Run away or be torn to shreds  
I've got a life and I want to live  
Don't want to be dead  
  
I met her down in the underground  
Got a taste of the low life, just creepin' around  
I got what I came for and more, that's for sure  
'Cause now I'm running from her game, can't take any more  
  
I've got a choice  
Run away or be torn to shreds  
I've got a life and I want to live  
Don't want to be dead  
  
When I first met you, baby  
I knew you could come on strong  
But when you held a knife to me  
You know, that just ain't too friendly  
I've heard of liberated,  
But that's so understated  
I should have listened to them  
When they told me you were crazy  
And you said I was a runaway
