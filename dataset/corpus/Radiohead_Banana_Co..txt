Oh, Banana Co.  
We really love you, and we need you  
And oh, Banana Co.  
We'd really love to believe you  
  
But everything's underground  
We gotta dig it up somehow  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Oh, she said "No go"  
She said she'd like to, she's seen you  
And oh, Banana Co.  
She knows if you die then we all do  
  
And everything's underground  
We've gotta dig it up somehow  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Everything's burning down  
We gotta put it out somehow  
Yeah, yeah
