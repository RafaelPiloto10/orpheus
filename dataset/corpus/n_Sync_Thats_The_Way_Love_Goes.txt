Like a moth to a flame  
Burned by the fire  
My love is blind  
Can't you see my desire  
  
That's the way love goes  
  
Come with me don't you worry  
I'm gonna make you crazy  
I'll give you the time of your life  
I'm gonna take you places  
You've never been before and  
You'll be so happy that you came  
Oh, I'm gonna take you there  
  
Chorus:  
  
That's the way love goes  
  
Don't mind if I light candles  
I like to watch us play and  
Baby, I've got on what you like  
Come closer baby closer  
Reach out and feel my body  
I'm gonna give you all my love  
Oh sugar, don't you hurry  
You've got me here all night  
Just close your eyes and hold on tight  
Oh baby, don't stop, don't stop  
Go deeper baby deeper  
You feel so good I'm gonna cry  
Oh I'm gonna take you there  
  
Repeat Chorus
