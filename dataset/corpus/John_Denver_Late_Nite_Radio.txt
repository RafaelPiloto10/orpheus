There's lonely hearts in Arkansas  
There's truckers in Des Moines  
All there to keep me company in the early morn  
A world unknown to daytime  
Is forever going on  
The airways of the nation  
Between midnight and the dawn  
  
Late night radio  
Take it everywhere I go  
Best friend when I'm lonely  
Is my late night radio  
  
Well I turn the dial  
A little bit past one-o-one point two  
In time to catch the news  
And see who's shooting who  
Then I hunt around for old songs  
They're so good to hear again  
To think of how it was  
Imagine how it might have been  
  
Late night radio  
Take it everywhere I go  
Best friend when I'm lonely  
Is my late night radio  
  
La La La I sing along  
'Cause I never know the words  
La La La La La La La La La  
I'd love to call a talk show  
But I haven't got the nerve  
La La La Oh Oh Oh radio  
  
The Lord is still my shepherd  
But these preachers got to go  
This time of night my interest  
Lies in U.F.O.'s  
So I turn the dial a little  
Past fifty-six point three  
To find myself a lullaby  
To rock me off to sleep  
  
Late night radio  
Take it everywhere I go  
Best friend when I'm lonely  
Is my late night radio  
  
Late night radio  
Take it everywhere I go  
Best friend when I'm lonely  
Is my late night radio
