At last  
My love has come along  
My lonely days over  
And life is like a song  
  
Ooh At last  
The skies above are blue  
Well my heart was wrapped up in clover  
The night I looked at you  
  
I found a dream  
That I could speak to  
A dream that I could call my own  
I found a thrill  
To press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
  
You smile  
You smile  
Oh and then the spell was cast  
And here we are in heaven  
For you are mine at last  
  
I found a dream  
That I could speak to  
A dream that I  
Could call my own  
I found a thrill  
To press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
  
You smile  
You smile  
Oh and then the spell was cast  
And here we are in heaven  
For you are mine at last  
  
Ooo yea  
You are mine  
You are mine  
At last  
At last  
At last  
At last
