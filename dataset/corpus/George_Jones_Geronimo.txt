The pages of the history books can tell you of his fame  
And the fear that struck the settlers at the mention of his name  
And in Mexico they won't forget the vengence of this man  
Who blazed a bloody battle trail and terrorized their land.  
  
Geronimo (Geronimo.)  
  
He blazed a bloody battle trail and terrorized their land  
(And terrorized their land.)  
  
Some called him a runagade and some called him cheif  
Some called him a warrior and some called him a theif  
But this Cherakowa red man no braver hero falls  
Apache brave and no ones slave he feared no man at all.  
  
Geronimo (Geronimo.)  
  
Apache brave and no ones slave he feared no man at all  
(He feared no man at all.)  
  
And no matter where he wandered  
No matter where you go  
His name will live forever  
The famed Geronimo (the famed Geronimo.)  
  
Geronimo (Geronimo.)  
Geronimo (Geronimo.)  
Geronimo (Geronimo...)
