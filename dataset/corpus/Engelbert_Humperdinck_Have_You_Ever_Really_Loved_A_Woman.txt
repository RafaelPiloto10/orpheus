To really love a woman  
To understand her, you gotta know it deep inside  
Hear every thought, see every dream  
N' give her wings, when she wants to fly  
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms  
You know you really love a woman  
  
When you love a woman you tell her  
That she's really wanted  
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one  
She needs somebody to tell her  
That it's gonna last forever  
So tell me have you ever really  
Really really ever loved a woman?  
  
To really love a woman  
Let her hold you  
Til ya know how she needs to be touched  
You've gotta breathe her, really taste her  
Til you can feel her in your blood  
N' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes  
You know you really love a woman  
  
When you love a woman  
You tell her that she's really wanted  
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
