This is a song about an innocent  
Who died at the hands of a desperate man  
He trusted those who he thought he knew  
He trusted those who he looked up to  
I'll never forget the joy in his face  
He'd laugh and he'd cry and he'd ruin my place  
He'd drive me crazy, and he'd drive me wild  
I used to scream and shout all day long  
  
Now I hope you know this song  
Is about a child who now has gone  
And other children like him, too  
Abused and used by what adults do  
So don't tell me about politics  
Or all the problems of our economics  
When you can't look after what you can't own  
You scream and shout all day long
