Everybody have you heard?  
He's gonna buy me a mockingbird  
And if that mockingbird won't sing  
He's gonna buy me a diamond ring  
And if that diamond ring won't shine  
He's gonna surely break this heart of mine  
And that's why I keep on tellin' ev'rybody, sayin'  
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo  
  
Hear me now and understand  
He's gonna find me some peace of mind  
And if that peace of mind won't stay  
I'm gonna find myself a better way  
And if that better way ain't so  
I, I, I'll ride with the tide and go with the flow  
And that's why I keep on shoutin' in your ear sayin'  
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo  
  
Everybody have you heard?  
She's gonna buy me a mockingbird  
And if that mockingbird won't sing  
She's gonna buy me a diamond ring  
And if that diamond ring won't shine  
She's gonna surely break this heart of mine  
And that's why I keep on tellin' ev'rybody, sayin' no, no, no, no,no  
  
Listen now and understand  
She's gonna find me some peace of mind  
And if that peace of mind won't stay  
I'm gonna find myself a better way  
I might rise above , I might go below  
I, I, I'll ride with the tide and go with the flow  
And that's why I keep on shoutin' in your ears y'all  
No, no, no, no, no, no, now, now, baby
