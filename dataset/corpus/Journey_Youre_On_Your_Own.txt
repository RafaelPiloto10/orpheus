Well, try to make up your mind  
Well, try to make up your mind, yeah  
Now you're on your own, yeah, yeah, baby  
Now you're on your own, yeah  
There's a new moon rising on the other side  
The other side of you  
Talk to yourself and someone else  
What you tryin' to do  
You maybe will, you maybe won't  
It's all for you to say  
You say you do, and then you don't  
It's only you in the way, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Baby, now you're on your own  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby  
Hey, now you're on your own, yeah  
When the light is gone that left your eyes  
I haven't spoke too soon  
And now we know your pretty words  
Is just another tune  
You spoke your mind, you've been quite kind  
It's all according to you  
Well go inside, keep your pride  
I can't get through to you, no no  
Now you're on your own  
Now you're on your own  
Well, try and make up your mind  
Well, try and make up your mind
