All I have  
And all I do  
Cannot compare  
To the love of you  
  
You make me feel alive  
You are my highest high  
All I can do is smile  
When I look in my little girl's eyes  
  
When I look in my little girl's eyes X4  
You're my star  
And when I'm far  
You're not alone  
  
'Cause your heart's my home  
You are my biggest prize  
So beautiful and so wise  
I can see the woman from within my child  
  
When I look in my little girl's eyes  
When I look in my little girl's eyes X4  
You make me feel alive  
And you are my highest high  
  
All I want to do when I come into the room is see her smile  
When I look in my little girl's eyes  
When I look in my little girl's eyes [Repeat: x 4]
