Day's turning to night  
Pray for the light  
Let me come through  
Let me take you away over the line  
  
Everyone falling  
Everyone falling  
Dreamers come crawling  
Neighbors jump walling  
Let me come through  
Let me take you away over the line  
  
And we're away to be where there's life  
Shake the will to comply  
Fears don't try me  
Tears don't cry me  
  
And we're away to be where there's life  
When we come call out  
Everything's sold out  
TV just closed down  
There's nothing on the news now  
  
Fears don't try me  
Tears don't cry me  
We're away to be where there's life  
Be where there's life  
(Be where there's life)  
  
Dig out your soul, cos here we go  
We gotta move, it's what we do  
Let me come through  
Let me take you  
Away to be where there's life  
To be where there's life  
(To be where there's life)  
  
Take you over the light  
Under the signs  
In through locked doors  
To secret floors  
Where we've lost 'em before
