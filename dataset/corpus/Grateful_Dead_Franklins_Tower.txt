In another time's forgotten space  
your eyes looked through your mother's face  
Wildflower seed on the sand and stone  
may the four winds blow you safely home  
  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
  
I'll tell you where the four winds dwell  
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell  
It can ring, turn night to day  
It can ring like fire when you lose your way  
  
Roll away, the dew,  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
  
God help the child who rings that bell  
It may have one good ring left, you can't tell  
One watch by night, one watch by day  
If you get confused just listen to the music play  
  
Roll away, the dew,  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
  
Some come to laugh their past away  
Some come to make it just one more day  
Whichever way your pleasure tends  
if you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind  
  
Roll away, the dew,  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
  
In Franklin's Tower the four winds sleep  
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep  
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind  
May the four winds blow you home again  
  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
Roll away, the dew  
You better roll away the dew
