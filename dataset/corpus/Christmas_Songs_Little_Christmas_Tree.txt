I watch the snow flakes fall  
Against my window pane  
And wonder if you  
Are watching snow flakes too  
  
I take a walk downtown  
To where you used to meet me  
Theres joy everywhere  
But all that's waiting there  
  
Is just a little Christmas tree  
Lookin sorta sad n lonely just like me  
Noone seems to care  
They just went away  
And left it standing there  
All alone on Christmas Eve  
  
I hear the Christmas bell  
The happy people singing  
The songs of good cheer  
That only brings me tears  
  
I sadly close my eyes  
And say a little prayer  
You'll be waiting there for me  
I look but all I see  
  
Is just a little Christmas tree  
Lookin sorta sad n lonely just like me  
Noone seems to care  
They just went away and left it standing there  
All alone on Christmas eve  
  
This is the season of love  
But I'm as sad as I can be  
Why did you have to leave me  
  
Oh little Christmas tree  
Lookin sorta sad n lonely just like me  
Noone seems to care  
They just went away  
And left it standing there  
All alone on Christmas Eve
