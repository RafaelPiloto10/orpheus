I've noticed how few emotions stand the test of time.  
Feelings come, feelings go, and the days are fine.  
  
Night is dark, night is cold,  
Passion lies down to die.  
Tenderness [Repeats]  
  
It's funny how romance fails us, giving way to love.  
You look around, feel your freedom you're a slave to love.  
  
Night is dark, night is cold,  
Passion lies down to die.  
Tenderness spirit moves me  
Tenderness try to show me  
Tenderness come on show me  
Tenderness feelings grow and change.  
  
I've noticed how few emotions stand the test of time.

Night is dark, night is cold,  
Passion lies down to die.  
Tenderness really moves me  
Tenderness try to show me  
Tenderness come on show me  
Tenderness feelings grow and change.  
  
Don't think that because I don't know what's happening  
That I ain't achin'  
I never thought you would be showin'  
Just what you been takin'.  
It's not as simple as that  
Don't think I don't know just when my heart's breakin'?  
  
I ain't chosen I ain't chosen  
I ain't chosen chosen chosen chosen chosen.
