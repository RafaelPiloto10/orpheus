We're living in repetition  
Content in the same old shtick again  
Now the routine's turning to contention,  
Like a production line going over and over and over,  
Roller coaster  
Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice  
I'm speechless and redundant  
Cause I love you's not enough  
I'm lost for words  
Choreographed and lack of passion  
Prototypes of what we were  
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous  
Taken for granted now  
Now I waste it, faked it, ate it, now I hate it  
Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice  
I'm speechless and redundant,  
Cause I love you's not enough  
I'm lost for words, now I cannot speak
