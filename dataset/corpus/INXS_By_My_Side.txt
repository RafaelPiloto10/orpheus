In the dark of the night  
Those small hours  
Uncertain and anxious  
I need to call you  
  
Rooms full of strangers  
Some call me friend  
But I wish you were so close to me  
  
In the dark of night  
Those small hours  
I drift away  
When I'm with you  
  
In the dark of night  
By my side  
In the dark of night  
By my side, by my side, by my side  
I wish you were  
I wish you were  
  
Here comes the clown  
His face in a wall  
No window  
No air at all  
  
In the dark of night  
Those faces they haunt me  
But I wish you were  
So close to me  
  
By my side  
By my side  
I wish you were  
I wish you were  
By my side  
  
In the dark of night  
Those faces they haunt me  
I wish you were so close to me  
  
Yes I wish you were  
By my side
