There's a soldier here today  
But she don't bear steel in anywhere  
She's like a bow  
Seeking a wooden arrow  
Pointing the way to love  
We all know how we can hate  
Just as strong as we could ever love  
We can love, we can love  
God bless you, God  
For Sending me a woman  
Pointing the way to love  
We gotta love a woman  
There's a statue in the square  
But the things they hadn't  
It ain't fair, it ain't fair, Lord  
The things they hadn't  
Cause beneath the stone  
The greatest Man is all alone  
Without a woman to love  
Without a woman to shove  
Without a woman to point the way to love  
We gotta love a woman
