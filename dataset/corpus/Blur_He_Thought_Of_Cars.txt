Moscow's still red  
The young man's dead  
Gone to heaven instead  
The evening news says he was confused  
The motorways will all merge soon  
Lottery winner buys the moon  
They've come to save us  
The space invaders are here  
  
He thought of cars  
And where, where to drive them  
And who to drive them with  
And there, there was no one, no one  
  
There's panic at London Heathrow  
Everybody wants to go up into the blue  
But there's a ten year queue  
Columbia is in top gear  
It shouldn't snow at this time of year  
Now America's shot gone  
And done the lot  
  
He thought of planes and where,  
Where to fly to  
And who to fly there with  
And there, there was no one, no one
