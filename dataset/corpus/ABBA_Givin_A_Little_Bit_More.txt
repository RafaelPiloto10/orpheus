There's a gentleness to everything you do  
And it's rubbing off on me I feel it too  
I've been waiting but my loneliness I get  
When you call me on the phone  
And I'm feeling so alone  
When you ask me to come over  
Baby you know I will  
I could never stay on my own  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more
