When I fall in love  
It will be forever  
Or I'll never fall in love  
  
In a restless world like this is  
Love is ended before its begun  
And too many moonlight kisses  
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun  
  
When I give my heart  
It will be completely  
Or I'll never give my heart  
  
And the moment I can feel that  
You feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you  
  
And the moment I can feel that  
You feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you...
