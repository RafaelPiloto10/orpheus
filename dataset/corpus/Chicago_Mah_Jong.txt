A third floor walk-up...  
One block east of Chinatown.  
She walked by my window,  
While the rain is pouring down.  
Looking in she sees the easy money life everywhere  
And it's clear she don't approve.  
(And it's clear she don't approve)  
Through a cloud of smoke I shoot a little smile over there.  
And I wonder what shes thinking  
  
[Chorus]  
She don't Mah Jong, Mah Jong she don't play.  
She don't Mah Jong, Wait she don't let me wait.  
She don't Mah Jong, Mah Jong she don't play.  
  
But she loves to play  
  
With the dark eyes burning,  
I am opening the wall.  
Can there be no other chance?  
I feel my fortune's turning,  
And I wish for nothing else at all.  
Looking up I see her signal with her fingers through her hair  
Telling me the hands are clean.  
On the  
I turn a dragon tail into a pair.  
And the game is over.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though I don't obey her,  
Still she loves to play her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though I don't obey her,  
Still she loves to play her  
  
A tree blows up  
From where the lanterns light the parlors on the street  
Better not wage another her  
And though there are not many things a pawn would  
I'll beat.  
We enjoyed the difference.  
  
[Chorus: Repeats till fade]
