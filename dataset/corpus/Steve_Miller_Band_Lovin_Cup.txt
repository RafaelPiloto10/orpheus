My mama  
She done told me  
Soon you be a man  
And when you find your own woman  
You got to love her the best that you can  
  
Well, if you give your love to somebody  
Make sure they don't use you up  
And if you get your love in return  
Make sure you fill the lovin' cup  
  
Oh, yeah  
Uh-huh  
La-de-ay  
  
Well, I'm goin' to the country  
Mama, don't you want to go  
The sun's gonna shine in our back door  
I know  
  
Mama  
She done told me  
Lord, you gonna be a man  
And when you find your own woman  
Gotta hold to her the best that you can  
  
I'm goin' to the country  
Baby don't you want to go  
The sun's gonna shine in our back door  
And I know  
  
To fill the lovin' cup  
Fill the lovin' cup  
Fill the lovin' cup  
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
