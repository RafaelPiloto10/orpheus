The other side  
The other side  
The other side of me  
  
By day, I play  
The part in every way  
Of simple sweet, calm and collected  
  
Pretend, to my friends  
I'm a chameleon  
Can make a girl feel disconnected  
  
I feel like a star  
A super hero  
Sometimes it's hard to separate  
(Got to much on my plate)  
  
Chorus  
If you could see  
The other side of me  
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell  
I hold the key  
To both realities  
The girl that I want you to know  
If only I could show  
  
2nd chorus  
The other side... The other side  
I want you to see  
The other side... The other side  
The other side of me  
  
Inside, I try  
To make the pieces fit right  
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere  
  
'Cause I flip the script  
So many times I forget  
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror  
  
Back in the spotlight  
The crowd is calling  
The paparazzi and the fame  
(It can drive a girl insane)  
  
Chorus  
  
2nd Chorus  
  
Down inside I'm not that different  
Like everyone, I have a dream  
Don't want to hide, just want to fit in  
Sometimes it's harder than it seems  
  
Chorus  
  
2nd Chorus
