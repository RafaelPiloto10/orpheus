I'm Alabamy bound  
They'll be no heebie-jeebies hangin' 'round  
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth  
All I'm worth to put my tootsies in an upper berth  
  
Just hear the choo-choo sound  
I know that soon we're gonna cover ground  
And then I'll holler so the world will know  
Here I go, I'm Alabamy bound  
  
I'm Alabamy bound  
They'll be no heebie-jeebies hanging 'round  
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth  
All I'm worth to put my tootsies in an upper berth  
  
Just hear the choo-choo sound  
I know that soon we're gonna cover the ground  
And then I'll holler so the world will know, here I go  
I'm Alabamy, I'm Alabamy bound, I'm gone
