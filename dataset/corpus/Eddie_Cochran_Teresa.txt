Hey Teresa, I saw you in school today  
This is what I got to say  
Mmm, you're a honey, worth more to me than money  
Cuter to me than a rose-bud  
I'll love you forever, if you'll be my girl  
Oh, I'm gonna ask you out  
That's what I'm talkin' about  
I wanna make a date, mmm, I'd better not wait  
Hey Teresa, right away  
You've got eyes that sparkle  
Hair that's soft like an angel  
I love you Teresa, Teresa, hope you'll be my girl
