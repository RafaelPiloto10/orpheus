I wandered so aimless life filed with sin  
I wouldn't let my dear savior in  
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night  
Praise the lord I saw the light.  
  
[Chorus]  
I saw the light I saw the light  
no more darkness no more night  
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight  
Praise the lord I saw the light.  
  
Just like a blind man I wandered along  
Worries and fears I claimed for my own  
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight  
Praise the lord I saw the light.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was a fool to wander and astray  
Straight is the gate and narrow the way  
Now I have traded the wrong for the right  
Praise the lord I saw the light.  
  
[Chorus]
