A little girl prayed at the close of the day,  
Cause her daddy had gone far away,  
On her little face was a look of despair,  
I stood there and listened, and I heard this prayer  
My Mommie says daddy has brought us to shame  
And I'm never no more to mention his name  
Lord take me and lead me and hold to my hand  
Oh heavenly father help me understand  
  
You know friends I wonder  
Just how many homes are broken tonight  
And just how many tears are shed  
By some little word of anger  
That never should have been said  
  
I'd like to tell you a story  
Of a family I once knew.  
We'll call them Mary and William  
And their little daughter sue  
  
Now Mary was just a plain mother  
And bill was just a usual dad  
And they had their little family quarrels  
(Like everybody else)  
But neither one really got mad  
  
Then one day something happened  
It was nothing of course  
But one word led to another  
And the last word led to a divorce  
  
Now here were two grown up people  
Who failed to use common sense  
They strengthened their own selfish pride  
At little Sue's expense  
  
You know she didn't ask to be brought to  
This world  
To drift from pillar to post  
But a divorce never stops to consider  
The ones it hurts the most  
  
There'd be a lot more honest loving  
In this wicked ole world today  
If just a few parted parents  
Could hear little sue say  
  
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand  
Oh heavenly father, help me understand
