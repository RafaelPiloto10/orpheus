[Chorus]  
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen  
Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou  
You're every young mans dream  
Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain  
  
Oh no, here ya coming down the road  
With your cotton dress a swishing  
You're getting some attention  
From all the boys in Thibodaux  
Oh my, you're really filling up their eyes  
Smiling and a winking  
I know what they're thinking  
But I'm the only one who loves you so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no, the hottest little dish I know  
I know that you can tell it  
You're making me so jealous  
From my head down to my toes  
Oh me, you could make a red neck green  
The way that you're a looking  
You got me a cooking  
And I ain't talking bout Etoufee'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida  
Just to stand beside of my sweet Adalida  
I'd swim the Ponchartrain
