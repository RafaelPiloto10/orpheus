Some people think  
That she's one of those mink-coated ladies  
They say she wakes up at one  
And makes the paparazzi run till dawn  
She wines and dines with Argentines and Kuwaitis  
After she sips margaritas on the White House lawn  
  
That's not her style I can tell you  
That ain't my woman  
It's just not her style I can tell you  
Because I'm her man  
  
The papers say  
She was seen in L.A. with a stranger  
She found a perfect body  
With a Maserati right outside  
  
And then she chartered a Lear  
When she heard her career was in danger  
And gave the pilot  
Somethin' extra for a perfect ride  
  
That's not her style I can tell you  
That ain't my woman  
It's just not her style I can tell you  
Because I'm her man  
  
Not that she's never d  
One something crazy or done something wild  
It's just that she's better  
At doing whatever suits her style  
And that's not her style  
  
I've read where it's said  
That she sleeps in a bed made of satin  
She's had her face done in every place you can try  
They say she gets a piece  
  
Of every lease in Manhattan  
And says she's thirty  
When she's really pushing forty-five  
  
That's not her style I can tell you  
That ain't my woman  
It's just not her style I can tell you  
Because I'm her man
