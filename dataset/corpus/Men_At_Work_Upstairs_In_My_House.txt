No one knows what I can see and and what I see it pleases me on my roof  
South Pacific hot sea pool, Coney Island amusement school for mispent youth  
Its all in my own front yard, seagulls grazing in the park and foreshore  
South-East wind pins back my ears, Luna Park lights up the years of painless
days  
  
I like it, upstairs in my house  
  
Dealers selling junk and trash, people spend their hard earned cash on Sundays  
Its quiet when they fade away, Westgate Bridge breakes up the day, into red
sky  
  
I like it, upstairs in my house, upstairs in my house  
  
No one knows what I can see and what I see it pleases me on my roof  
  
I like it, upstairs in my house, upstairs in my house
