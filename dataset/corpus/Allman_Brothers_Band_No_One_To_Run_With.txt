Everybody wanna know  
Where Jimmy has gone  
He left town  
I doubt if he's comin' back home  
Tony gotta job  
Three kids and a lovely wife  
Workin' in the commerce bank  
For the rest of his life  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody wants to do the crazy things  
We used to do before  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
I'm gonna hit the road  
Adios my friend  
Go some place  
And start all over again  
Don't know where I'm goin'  
Like a gypsy out on the road  
Go some place and join a travelin' show  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody wants to do the crazy things  
We used to do before  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
I think Jimmy must've had the right idea  
He packed his stuff  
And he got right out of here  
I don't know where he's at  
But I'm sure that he's ok  
Now I realize  
What Jimmy was tryin' to say  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody wants to do the crazy things  
We used to do before  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
No no nobody left to run with anymore
