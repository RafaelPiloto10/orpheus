Wynona's got herself a big brown beaver and she shows it off to all her
friends.  
One day, you know, that beaver tried to leave her, so she caged him up with
cyclone fence.  
Along came Lou with the old baboon and said "I recognize that smell,Smells
like seven layers,That beaver eatin' Taco Bell!".  
  
"Now Rex he was a Texan out of New Orleans and he travelled with the carnival
shows.  
He ran bumper cars, sucked cheap cigars and he candied up his nose.  
He got wind of the big brown beaver So he thought he'd take himself a peek,but
the beaver was quick and he grabbed him by the kiwis,  
and he ain't pissed for a week.(And a half!)  
  
Wynona took her big brown beaver and she stuck him up in the air, said "I sure
do love this big brown beaver and I wish I did have a pair.  
Now the beaver once slept for seven days And it gave us all an awful fright,  
So I tickled his chin and I gave him a pinch and the bastard tried to bite me.
Wynona loved her big brown beaverAnd she stroked him all the time.  
She pricked her finger one day and it occurred to her she might have a
porcupine.
