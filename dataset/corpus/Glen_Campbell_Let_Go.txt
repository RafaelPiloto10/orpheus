Moonlight and roses are the goin' thing  
Champagne, a little love, and a weddin' ring  
But every time she leaves it's gonna break your heart  
It's happened before, don't come to me, I don't want no part  
  
Let go, it ain't worth it if it hurts you  
Let go, you don't need it if-a she don't care  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go  
  
First time for both of you makes for urgent love  
It gives a feel that it's all unreal, it's from up above  
Tellin' some small secrets, dreamin' dreams by phone  
And terrified there'll be a time she won't be alone  
  
Well let go, it ain't worth it if it hurts you  
Let go, you don't need it if-a she don't care  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go  
  
Walk away, leave well alo-one, you know you should  
To be in love has as much that's bad as it has it's good  
To counsel friends ain't wise but you sure need to see  
You should know that before you, she di-id the same to me  
  
Well let me tell ya, let go, it ain't worth it if it hurts you  
And let go, you don't need it if-a she don't care  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go  
  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go, oh-oh (fade)
