My friend had a girlfriend  
She liked her drink  
Sucked the head off her lagger  
Threw me a wink  
And she said to me buddy, whats your sign?  
  
I was off I was runnin  
Knocked me clean off my feet  
Her tongue kept on selling  
What any blind man could see  
I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs  
  
She said what you hiding underneath that shirt?  
Right behing the buttons theres a heart that hurts  
Adams evening left the curse  
Take it off make it work  
Naked - naked - just get back to basics  
Naked - face it - you can't fake it when youre naked  
Naked - face it  
All I'm saying  
  
The tail you been chasing  
Put the k back in kink  
Threw a coin in her jukebox  
I started to think  
She just smiled and offered me a peace sign  
  
How far you gonna run in those designer shoes  
The soul with holes aint gonna be the one you lose  
I don't know which one is worse  
Adam, me or you  
  
Naked - naked - just get back to basics  
Naked - face it - you can't fake it when youre naked  
Naked - face it  
All I'm saying  
  
Take it, embrace it  
Baby, here we are  
Can't you almost... Taste it  
  
Naked - naked - just get back to basics  
Naked - face it - you can't fake it when youre  
Naked - naked - naked - naked
