What about the time?  
You were rollin' over  
Fall on your face  
You must be having fun  
  
Walk lightly!  
Think of a time.  
You'd best believe  
This thing is real  
  
Put away that gun  
And this part is simple  
Try to recognize  
What is in your mind  
  
God help us!  
Help us lose our minds  
These slippery people  
Help us understand  
  
What's the matter with him? (He's alright!)  
I see his face (The lord won't mind)  
Don't know no games (He's alright)  
Love from the bottom to the top  
  
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)  
See for yourself (The lord won't mind)  
We're gonna move (Right now)  
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel  
  
I remember when  
Sittin' in the tub  
Pulled out the plug  
The water was runnin' out  
  
Cool down  
Stop acting crazy  
They're gonna leave  
And we'll be on our own  
  
Seven times five  
They were living creatures  
Watch 'em come to life  
Right before your eyes  
  
Backsliding!  
How do you do?  
These slippery people  
Gonna see you through
