One dumb thing  
Is how it starts  
One dumb thing  
Is all it takes  
One dumb thing  
Leads to another  
One dumb thing  
Is how it started  
One dumb thing  
Is all he said  
One dumb thing  
Led to another  
Now it's over 'cause of  
One dumb thing  
A glance, a stance  
A broken romance  
A disconnected telephone  
What's behind it?  
How to define it?  
Makes the world go around  
and around  
and around  
One dumb thing  
Is how it started  
One dumb thing  
Is all she did  
One dumb thing  
Led to another  
One dumb thing  
Is the beginning  
One dumb thing  
It never ends  
One dumb thing  
Goes right on making  
More and more of  
One dumb thing
