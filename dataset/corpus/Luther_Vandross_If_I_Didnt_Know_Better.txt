I think sometimes I can read your mind  
When you make things up I can tell you lie  
I see the things that your man can't see  
And I wonder what kind of man is he  
The one who you say is your lover  
Who you insist takes care of you under the covers  
And who is there for you and loves you like no other  
Then you kiss and tell me that you love me like a brother  
  
[Chorus]  
If I didn't know better  
I'd think that you were mine, you're with me all the time  
If I didn't know better  
I'd swear we're more than friends, you're touching me again  
If I didn't know better  
I'd think we were in love  
Girl, do you want to tell me something  
Oh, oh, oh  
I could be wrong about the things you say  
But I don't rub up on my friends that way  
You tell me that you've always been a flirt  
But if it goes wrong, I could get hurt  
But no, you insist it's harmless playin'  
It's just a part of who you are, that it's just your nature  
And that it's fine  
You know I'm a friend, it's really nothing  
You say that I'm just like a  
That I'm just like a brother  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My idea of a friend is when you  
Do a lotta things together and have a lotta fun  
But my definition of love is different  
You touch and hold each other  
And you only want to be alone clinging to each other  
Like you and he should be, but like you and I are  
Well, I know it sounds crazy but  
  
[Chorus]
