Why don't you ask the kids at Tienanmen Square?  
Was fashion the reason why they were there?  
  
They disguise it, Hypnotize it.  
Television made you buy it.  
  
I'm just sitting  
In my car and  
Waiting for my  
  
She's scared that I will take her away from there.  
Dreams and her country, left with no-one there.  
  
Mesmerized the simple minded  
Propaganda leaves us blinded.  
  
I'm just sitting  
In my car and  
Waiting for my girl.  
  
I'm just sitting  
In my car and  
Waiting for my girl.  
  
I'm just sitting  
In my car and  
Waiting for my girl.  
  
I'm just sitting  
In my car and  
Waiting for my girl
