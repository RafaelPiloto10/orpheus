This is just a nightmare  
Soon I'm gonna wake up  
Someone's gonna bring me 'round  
  
Running from the bombers  
Hiding in the forest  
Running through the fields  
Laying flat on the ground  
  
Just like everybody  
Stepping over hills  
Running from the underground  
  
This is your warning  
4 minute warning  
  
I don't wanna hear it  
I don't wanna know  
I just wanna run and hide  
  
This is just a nightmare  
But soon I'm gonna wake up  
Someone's gonna bring me 'round  
  
This is our warning  
4 minute warning
