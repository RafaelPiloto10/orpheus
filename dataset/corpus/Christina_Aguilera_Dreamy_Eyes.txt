I'm reaching out to touch you  
In the middle of the night.  
And I don't know if I've been sleeping  
But I hold my pillow tight.  
Are you real or are you  
My imagination playing games?  
I can't set you free  
You'll always be my eternal flame.  
  
Your dreamy eyes...  
They just won't say goodbye.  
Well it must be my fate  
'Cause I just can't escape.  
And the passion never dies  
Oh dreamy eyes  
No matter how I try  
I just can't reach you, dreamy eyes.  
  
Your dreamy eyes...  
They just won't say goodbye.  
Well, it must be my fate  
'Cause I just can't escape.  
And the passion never dies  
Oh, dreamy eyes  
No matter how I try  
I just can't reach you, dreamy eyes.  
  
You're a vision of tomorrow  
And a ghost from yesterday  
And I'll be trying not to let you  
Take my breath away  
You're a summer breeze that comes and goes  
But somehow lingers on  
Tell me how can I forget you  
If you're never really gone  
What do I have to do  
To get that close to you  
And your- your dreamy eyes  
Oh, I try so hard to release you  
I just keep seeing your dreamy eyes.  
  
Your dreamy eyes...  
They just won't say goodbye.  
Well, it must be my fate  
'Cause I just can't escape.  
And the passion never dies  
Oh, dreamy eyes  
No matter how I try  
I just can't reach you, dreamy eyes.
