I, I long for the moment  
When I see you again  
I long to touch and stroke your hair again  
Though my heart goes on beating not knowing when  
  
I, I wait for the time  
I feel your hair once more through these hands of mine  
My heart will sing, you know I will soar  
Just like before, just like before  
  
Chorus:  
Until then  
All I'll have is just a memory of you  
That I could hold on to  
Until then  
All I'll have is just this space and time  
To wait and think of you  
Coz you'll be on my mind  
Until then (until then)  
  
I, I wait for the time  
I feel your hair once more through these hands of mine  
I know that someday, you'll come back and stay  
  
We'll be together once more  
Just like before  
  
Until then  
All I'll have is just a memory of you  
That I could hold on to  
Until then  
All I'll have is just this space and time  
To wait and think of you  
Coz you'll be on my mind  
Until then...  
  
Bridge:  
I long for the moment  
I long for the time  
I'll take all my chances  
Until you are mine  
  
All I'll have is just a memory  
That I could hold on to  
Until then  
All I'll have is just this space and time  
To wait and think of you  
Coz you'll be on my mind...  
Until then...  
Until then...
