Say goodbye,  
Well I know it's true.  
I know you're leaving me but i,  
I'm leaving too.  
You won't forget me,  
Or the sound of my name.  
Please believe me,  
I feel the same.  
  
It seems so empty now.  
Close the door.  
Ain't it hard to believe that you ever,  
Lived this way before.  
All that nothing,  
Causes all that pain.  
Please believe me,  
I feel the same.  
  
Well this broken soul,  
That I know a, a heart that's breakin'.  
You can't make it whole  
Until you know what has been taken.  
And all those pieces,  
Uh that you find them all your own.  
  
I said goodbye.  
Now you know it's true.  
You said you're leaving me, but honey i,  
I'm leaving too.  
You won't forget me  
Or the sound of my name.  
Please believe me,  
I feel the same.  
Please believe me,  
I feel the same.
