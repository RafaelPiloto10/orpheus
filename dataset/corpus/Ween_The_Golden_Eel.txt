Sitting alone in the den watching the eel  
Help me find my way home watching the eel  
Burrows it's head in the sand, daylight has come  
There shall be rest in a while, daylight has come  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
  
Who can explain all these thoughts racking my mind  
An endless barrage of shit racking my mind  
The eel offered his help I can't understand  
Speaking it's truth from the bank now I can see  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
I can not reveal the words of the golden eel  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
I can not reveal the words of the golden eel
