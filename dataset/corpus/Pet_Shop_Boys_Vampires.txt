Brother, it don't matter  
Sister, don't worry  
Say what you like  
I'll do what you want me to do  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
  
Sun in the kitchen  
Boy, you're still sleeping  
When you get hungry  
I'll do what you want me to do  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
  
Night in the city  
New Orleans pretty  
Do what you want  
And then can I do it to you?  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
  
It's a reflex  
Just a reflex  
Like fear or sex  
  
Brother, it don't matter  
Sister, don't worry  
Say what you like  
I'll do what you want me to do  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
You're a vampire  
I'm a vampire too  
  
Brother, it don't matter  
Sister, don't worry  
Brother, it don't matter  
Sister, don't worry
