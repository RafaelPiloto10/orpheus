Sat on a cliff wondering what did I miss  
I watched the waves come in,  
Roll in, roll out, without a single doubt  
Lone on the bluff, is there ever enough  
I stare into the air, somewhere out there,  
The family affair, bring home the night  
  
There I know that you turn off the light  
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
She gave me the love, she gave the love  
  
Coming up short and I'm sad to report, with us invite tonight  
Your kiss, my kiss, another day to waste  
Lovers don't miss, when they can't even face a plot that has a twist  
To share, my Wrayer, I need my baby bed,  
Come home tonight  
Whoa  
  
There I know that you turned off the light  
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
There I know that you turned off the light  
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
Love of my life  
  
There I know that you turned off the light  
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
There I know that you turned off the light  
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
  
There I know that I waited so long  
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life  
Oh she gave me the love of my life  
Tell 'em Frank, go ahead
