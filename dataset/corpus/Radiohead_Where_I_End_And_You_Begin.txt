There's a gap in between  
There's a gap where we meet  
Where I end and you begin  
  
And I'm sorry for us  
The dinosaurs roam the earth  
The sky turns green  
Where I end and you begin  
(4, 5, 6, 7)  
  
I am up in the clouds  
I am up in the clouds  
And I can't, and I can't come down  
  
I can watch and not take part  
Where I end and where you start  
Where you, you left me alone  
You left me alone  
  
X will mark the place  
Like the parting of the waves  
Like a house falling in the sea  
In the sea  
  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
  
And there'll be no more lies  
There'll be no more lies  
There'll be no more lies  
There'll be no more lies  
  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
  
And there'll be no more lies  
There'll be no more lies  
There'll be no more lies  
There'll be no more lies  
  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
  
And there'll be no more lies  
There'll be no more lies  
There'll be no more lies  
There'll be no more lies  
  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive  
I will eat you alive
