Haa, huh  
Well, I'm a wreck and I'm a tangle  
And though I try to find an angle  
Can't find my way around you  
No matter what I do  
And nothing's right since you left me  
My life was full but now it's empty  
Can't find my way around you  
You say, that you can't see a way  
(No matter what I do)  
That I can be a part of you  
It doesn't matter what I do  
Tried every trick that I can think of  
But you don't seem to think it's true love  
You take no notice of me  
Oh my, chance has passed me by  
(Oh, why can't you see?)  
See a way to change your mind  
Just let me know and I'll keep trying  
All my confidence is gone  
I was pretty sure that you would come along  
Thought that I would be your man  
But now I never know just where I stand with you  
I used to be the kind of guy  
Who could be in your arms before you'd realize  
Now the tables have been turned  
If you play with fire you know you sure get burned  
Now, all my confidence is gone  
I was pretty sure that you would come along  
Thought that I would be your man  
But now I never know just where I stand with you  
Oh, where I stand with you  
Just where I stand, where I stand, where I stand with you?  
I never know, you had to go  
Where I stand with you?  
You broke my heart, it came apart  
Where do I stand with you?  
Where I stand?  
(Where I stand?)  
Where I stand?  
(Where I stand?)  
Just where I stand with you?  
(Where I stand with you?)  
I never know  
(I never know)  
You have to go  
Where I stand with you?
