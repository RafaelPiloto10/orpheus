The stars would cry in the blue if you said no  
Their tears would fall like the dew if you said no  
The fragrance of the flowers would fade if you turned away  
And the warmth of the summer day would leave me so cold  
  
So hold me close in your arms and don't say no  
And never ask me to leave, how could I go?  
The countless stars in the heavens are trembling above  
So don't say no, I beg of you, don't say no to my love  
  
The countless stars in the heavens are trembling above  
So don't say no, I beg of you, don't say no to my love
