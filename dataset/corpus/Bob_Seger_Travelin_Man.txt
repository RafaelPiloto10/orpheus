Up with the sun, gone with the wind,  
She always said I was lazy.  
Leavin' my home, leavin' my friends,  
Runnin' when things get too crazy.  
Out on thr road, out 'neath the stars,  
Feelin' the breeze, passin' the cars.  
  
Women have come, women have gone,  
Everyone tryin' to cage me.  
Some were so sweet, I barely got free,  
Others, they only enraged me.  
Sometimes at night, I see their faces,  
I feel the traces they left on my soul.  
Those are the memories that made me a wealthy soul.  
  
Travelin' man, love when I can,  
Turn loose my hand 'cause I'm goin'.  
Travelin' man, catch if you can,  
But sooner or lare I'm goin'.  
Travelin' man, travelin' man, yes I am.  
  
Sometimes at night, I see their faces,  
I feel the traces they left on my soul.  
These are the memories that made me a wealthy soul.  
These are the memories that made me a wealthy soul.
