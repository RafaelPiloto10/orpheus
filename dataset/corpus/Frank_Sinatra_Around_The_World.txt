Around the world I've searched for you  
I traveled on when hope was gone to keep a rendezvous  
I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow  
You'd look at me and I would see the smile you're smiling now  
  
It might have been in County Down  
Or in New York, in gay Paree , or even London town  
No more will I go all around the world  
For I have found my world in you  
  
It might have been in County Down  
Or in New York, in gay Paree , or even London town  
No more will I go all around the world  
For I have found my world in you
