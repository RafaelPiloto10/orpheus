CLOSE YOUR EYES AND FILL THE SKIES  
WITH COTTON CANDY CLOUDS  
STEP INSIDE THE RAINBOW  
RIDE WHERE DRAGONFLIES SING LOUD  
COLORS FALLING, BUTTERFLIES AND FLOWERS  
PAINT THE GROUND  
CUCKOOS CALLING, DO I HAVE TO GO  
AND IT'S HARD, SO HARD TO FORGET HER  
  
THIS IS WHERE WE ALWAYS SAID  
THAT EVERYTHING IS REAL  
HANGING FROM A SPIDER'S WEB  
THE VALLEYS AND THE FIELDS  
FOLLOW ME INSIDE THE TREE  
AND CATCH ME IF YOU CAN  
SOMEONE ELSE IS PLAYING IN THE SAND  
AND IT'S HARD, SO HARD TO FORGET HER
