Now I've always been a dreamer  
I've had these fantasies run through my mind  
The vivid memories of days we spent together  
They seem so long ago  
Why'd you have to leave me, why'd you let me go  
  
We're used to chasing rainbows, but they're not hard to find  
My baby used to love me, fame left it all behind  
Now I've become a prisoner, locked up behind four walls  
You say I've got life easy, but I've got no life at all  
So now I've made the grade, they know who I am  
I've made it to the top a lonely man  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Smile for the cameras is all they ever say  
Transmitting my emotions a thousand miles away  
They chase me through the streets, calling out my name  
I'm coming home to you, this life is driving me insane  
Climbing up those stairs, knocking on the door  
She don't recognize me or want me anymore  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back, the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood Dreams  
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back, the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot Lights  
The spot lights can't bring back you're love to me  
Chasing those Hollywood...
