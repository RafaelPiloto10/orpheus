Such a sad procession  
Winding down the lane  
What a strange impression  
Was branded on my brain  
  
A band was playing endless mindless  
It was like a hooligan's lament  
It was dumb but it was timeless  
I still wonder what it meant  
  
But whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
"Behold the lights of London"  
The skipper said as his hands shook,  
His aura eaten by his jealousy  
And all the drugs he took  
He said "This is the real world, Buddy  
  
Toughen up your ass or it'll break"  
I said "I'm not your buddy, Buddy  
And your real world is a fake"  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
The D.J. took his vengeance  
As the weeding guests arrive  
  
There was malice in his handshake,  
Quicksand in his eyes  
As he slunk across the courtyard  
From far-off I heard a horn  
Somewhere in the bleak mid-distance  
Something beautiful is born  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
I stumbled down a street of shadows  
A black hallelujah split the night  
Anarchists and priests were playing strip jack  
Underneath the crude lamplight  
I came upon a weeping soldier  
He said "I'm all washed up now hush !"  
But when I glanced across his shoulder  
He held the royal flush  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
I'm still here, I'm still breathing  
I'm who I thought I was or just about  
I'll be walking down this boulevard  
Until my legs give out  
  
Thoughts like storms and seas are raging  
I know it is a matter of degree  
But it's not the world outside that's changing  
It's me  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
Whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected  
Over me
