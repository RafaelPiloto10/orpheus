Can I play with madness?  
  
Give me the sense to wonder  
To wonder if I'm free  
Give me a sense of wonder  
To know I can be me  
Give me the strength to hold my head up  
Spit back in their face  
Don't need no key to unlock this door  
Gonna break down the walls  
Break out of this bad place  
  
[Chorus]  
Can I play with madness?  
The prophet stared at his crystal ball  
Can I play with madness?  
There's no vision there at all  
Can I play with madness?  
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:  
Can I play with madness?  
He said you're blind, too blind to see  
  
Said you're too blind to see  
  
I screamed aloud to the old man  
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know  
I say you'll pay for this mischief  
In this world or the next  
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance  
And the hell fires raged in his eyes  
He said you wanna know the truth son?  
Lord, I'll tell you the truth  
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Listen to me, said the prophet  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can I play with madness?
