I am the modren man  
With this guitar in hand  
I'll do my best and try  
To keep rock and roll alive  
...Keep it alive  
...Keep it alive  
...Keep it alive...  
  
Don't let it end  
Don't let it end  
Don't let it end  
Don't let it end  
  
I'm gonna keep on rockin' all through the night  
Shake it, shake it, baby, 'cause it feels so right  
Motivate your body, gonna cure your soul  
Keep on rockin' 'til I lose control  
  
Don't let it end  
I shake to soul music  
Don't let it end  
I gotta gotta have that music  
Don't let it end  
Chuck Berry  
Don't let it end  
The Platters  
Don't let it end  
Little Richard - ahoo!  
Don't let it end
