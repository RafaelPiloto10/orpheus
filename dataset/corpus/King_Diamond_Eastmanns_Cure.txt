It was in the local paper: "we will cure your every phobia  
At devil lake sanitarium  
We will make you feel you're right at home"  
No more sleepless nights, no more unpleasant sights  
We can recreate paradise  
And you don't even have to sacrifice a thing  
It only took about a minute's time  
For poor old harry to make up his mind  
So he headed for devil lake, knowing doctors were awaiting him  
No more sleepless nights, no more unpleasant sights  
We can recreate paradise  
And you don't even have to sacrifice a thing  
Harry:  
"my name is harry and I am from the country side  
I'm looking for a doctor, eastmann is the name"  
Dr. eastmann:  
"we welcome you with open arms  
We've all been looking forward to having you here  
At devil lake sanitarium  
You must always sign a special paper first"  
Harry:  
"I will sign anything, just to get rid of my fears  
I just want to live a life, where do you want me to sign? "  
Dr. eastmann:  
"right here on the dotted line  
This will give me the freedom I need for you  
At devil lake sanitarium  
You know we are the very best at what we do... oh yes!"  
Now that we have got his signature  
I think it's time to start the eastmann cure  
So put him in the straight  
I think room 17 is still our whitest room  
No more sleepless nights, no more unpleasant sights  
We can recreate paradise  
And you don't even have to sacrifice a thing
