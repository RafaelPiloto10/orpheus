Some people they call me Jack  
Some people they call me insane  
I'm looking for somebody  
And I don't even know her name  
I might be looking for you  
Wherever you may be  
For there is something I've got to do to you honey  
And it's between you and me  
Now you might think it's fun  
Or maybe it's a joke  
But you've got plenty of reason to worry honey  
'Cause you wouldn't stand a hope  
  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A lady killer on the loose  
  
Now I'm not trying to be nasty  
Or I'm not trying to make you scared  
But there's a killer on the loose  
Or haven't you heard  
He'll be walking around this town  
Just about midnight  
Yes, that's Chinatown  
That's right  
That's right  
  
Now you might think I'm messing  
Or he don't exist  
But honey I'm confessing  
I'm a mad sexual rapist  
  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A ladykiller on the loose  
  
"I'll be standing in the shadows of love  
Waiting for you  
Don't unzip your zipper  
'Cause you know I'm Jack the Ripper  
Now don't wail, don't"  
  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Standing in the shadows  
A killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Coming to get you  
A lady killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Standing in the shadows of love  
  
A killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A lady killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Standing in the shadow  
A killer on the loose, of love  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Oh  
A lady killer on the loose  
You better watch out  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A killer on the loose  
Play that back  
Check it back  
There's a killer on the loose
