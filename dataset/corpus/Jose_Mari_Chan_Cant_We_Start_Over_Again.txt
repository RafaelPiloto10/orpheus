It's been a long long while  
I know I've caused you pain  
Living without you it's not quite the same  
Can we start over again  
  
I played around to long  
Running from end to end  
Took you for granted I've been such a fool  
Can't we start over again  
  
All through my life of seasons  
No matter how far I long  
Always there's something missing inside  
Yearning to come back home  
  
You are the one I return to  
Love only love leads the way  
Give us this chance to start over again  
Darling I'm coming home to stay  
  
You are the one I return to  
Love only love leads the way  
Give us this chance to start over again  
Darling I'm coming home to stay
