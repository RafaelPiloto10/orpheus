[Latoiya Williams]  
I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you  
This love's exactly how I picture (how I picture)  
It's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you  
We're flowing smooth just like a river (like a river)  
Express my true  
When, I make love to you (to you)  
Just like that day back in September  
If we might run in some problems  
I know you'll see me through  
There's nothing for you I won't do  
Cause I believe in you (you)  
Oh I believe in you (you)  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
And I believe in you too  
See can't nobody make me do what you do  
I mean I'm so in love with you (boo)  
I never thought a girl could make me  
Take me  
To a whole new world  
Re-shape me, love me, hate me  
Lately  
We ain't been fussing or fighting  
You play all day and I be working at night and  
The only one who understands my life and  
The cake and the icing  
These other girls  
In the world  
Live their life so trifling  
I couldn't do it no more  
I had to sit you down  
And make you my wife and (yaa)  
Cold thing  
But you know  
It's a cold gain (goal gain)  
It's so real  
I had to bless you with my last name (last name)  
Slowed me down  
Straight took me out the fast lane (fast lane)  
Hold me down  
Come on baby  
Watch me do this thing (do it)  
I been crowned king  
So I guess that means you're my queen  
You have my seeds  
Lets go ahead and raise this team  
It's so special  
You're all I ever need  
  
[Latoiya Williams]  
I'm feeling good and my baby's home  
You're spending time  
Holding hands  
To this beat  
The fellow that can satisfy my every need  
Is he the one?  
We've been around and we're both grown... (grown)  
Look at me... (me)  
I'm like a baby  
I took that chance  
And I feel secure about this love romance  
Let's have some fun  
And I believe when you say  
Ain't that special (oh)  
Touch my soul (soul)  
Feel the same  
When you whisper softly  
And call my name  
Here I come  
It's more than words that I ever could sing  
You're that chill bring  
Maybe your walk or just the way you do me  
I really think we are the two  
Cause I believe in you  
Take a second realize we can make it if you  
Don't stop  
Come on boy we about to take it  
To the top  
I know you're gonna love what you're about to see  
Do you believe in me?  
We can make it all night long  
Baby if we  
Don't stop  
Come on boy you know you got me  
So hot  
I know I'm gonna love what you're about to do  
Cause I believe in you  
I believe in you  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
And I believe in you too  
Cause its the right thing to do  
And I believe in you too  
Cause its the only thing to do  
I couldn't give you away  
No matter what my friends sizzay  
See when I'm gone  
Away from home  
I'm alone every dizzay  
I left a gang of messages for you  
On your two way  
But you ain't hollered back  
But you know how, you play  
You say, OK  
I say, no way  
We got to be together forever  
And a dizzay  
Cause I believe in you
