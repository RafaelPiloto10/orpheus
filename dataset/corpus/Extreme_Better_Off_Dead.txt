I heard your mother died  
Just a few days ago  
And tears fill your eyes with grief and sorrow  
'Cause you to question why because you don't know  
If there comes a time when we all, when we all must go  
  
[Chorus]  
Better off dead, if you're going to believe  
Better off dead, in some painful (painful) memories  
Better off dead, for truly you'll be free  
Then to get down on your knees  
  
Can you continue to go on and ignore?  
A most certain fate you have grown, grown to abhor  
If what you believe is true  
And you have no remorse  
No matter what you do, no matter what you do  
Oh, you'll be on, you'll be on the same course  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can someone tell me why I'm not better off dead?  
I no longer deny these thoughts filling my head  
I'm left to decide for this path I've been led  
If there's more to life than just death  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's alright, I'm only bleeding
