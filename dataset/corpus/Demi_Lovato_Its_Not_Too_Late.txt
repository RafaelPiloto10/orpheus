Oh  
Here I am  
Feels like the walls are closing in  
Once again it's time to face it and be strong  
I wanna do the right thing now  
I know it's up to me somehow  
I've lost my way  
  
If I could take it all back I would now  
I never meant to let you all down  
And now I've got to try to turn it all around  
And figure out how to fix this  
I know there's a way so I promise  
I'm gonna clean up this mess I made  
Maybe it's not to late  
Maybe it's not to late, oh  
  
So I'll take a stand  
Even though it's complicated  
If I can I wanna change the way I've made it  
I've gotta do the right thing now  
I know it's up to me somehow  
I'll find my way  
  
If I could take it all back I would now  
I never meant to let you all down  
And now I've got to try to turn it all around, yeah  
And figure out how to fix this  
I know there's a way so I promise  
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made  
Maybe it's not to late  
  
I'm gonna find the strength  
To be the one who that holds it all together  
Show you that I'm sorry  
But I know that we can make it better  
  
If I could take it all back I would now  
I never meant to let you all down  
And now I've got to try to turn it all around  
And figure out how to fix this  
I know there's a way so I promise  
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made  
(Mess I made)  
Maybe it's not to late  
  
I never meant to let you all down  
Now I've got to try (got to try) to turn it all around (all around)  
And figure out how to fix this  
I know there's a way so I promise (promise)  
I'm gonna clean up this mess I made  
Maybe it's not to late  
Maybe it's not to late
