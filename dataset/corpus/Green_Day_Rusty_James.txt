This whiskey sour, amateur hour  
Raise your glass and toast your friends  
Some day we will fight again, well  
Your enemies, your tragedies  
Pocket knifes and rusty chains  
Where in the hell is the old gang, yeah?  
  
And all the losers  
Can't even win for losing  
And the beginners  
Don't even know what song they're singing  
  
Well there's no one left around  
And you're the last gang in town  
And your heart can't even break  
When it doesn't even pound  
  
Well there's no one left around  
And you're the last gang in town  
And your heart can't even break  
When it doesn't even pound  
  
This broken scene is turning green  
Brass knuckles left in the rain  
Death wish kids among the living  
I want to ride on the divided  
Anything but the mainstream  
Where the fuck is your old gang, man?  
  
Well there's no one left around  
And you're the last gang in town  
And your heart can't even break  
When it doesn't even pound  
  
Well there's no one left around  
And you're the last gang in town  
And your heart can't even break  
When it doesn't even pound  
  
So long  
Didn't even say goodnight  
So long  
There's nowhere to go  
When you're hiding in plain sight  
  
Well there's no one left around  
And you're the last gang in town  
And your heart can't even break  
When it doesn't even pound  
  
Well there's no one left around  
And you're the last gang in town  
And your heart can't even break  
When it doesn't even pound  
  
Well there's no one left around  
And you're the last gang in town  
And your heart can't even break  
When it doesn't even pound
