I've seen the world, done it all  
Had my cake now  
Diamonds, brilliant, in Bel-Air now  
Hot summer nights, mid July  
When you and I were forever wild  
The crazy days, city lights  
The way you'd play with me like a child  
  
Will you still love me  
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?  
Will you still love me  
When I've got nothing but my aching soul?  
I know you will, I know you will  
I know that you will  
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?  
  
I've seen the world, lit it up  
As my stage now  
Changeling angels in a new age now  
Hot summer days, rock n roll  
The way you play for me at your show  
And all the ways, I got to know  
Your pretty face and electric soul  
  
Will you still love me  
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?  
Will you still love me  
When I've got nothing but my aching soul?  
I know you will, I know you will  
I know that you will  
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?  
  
Dear lord, when I get to heaven  
Please let me bring my man  
When he comes tell me that you'll let him  
Father tell me if you can  
All that grace, all that body  
All that face, makes me wanna party  
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds  
  
Will you still love me  
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?  
Will you still love me  
When I've got nothing but my aching soul?  
I know you will, I know you will  
I know that you will  
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?  
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?  
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?
