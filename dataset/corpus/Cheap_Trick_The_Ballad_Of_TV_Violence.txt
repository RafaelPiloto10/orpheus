I needed a girl to give me some love  
I need some love, gimme your love  
Gimme your love  
  
I need a knife to give me a wife  
I need a knife, gimme your life  
Gimme your life  
  
I need a gun to have me some fun  
I need a gun, (gimme your love  
Gimme your love)  
  
I need some rope, it's my only hope  
(after twenty or so) I just don't know  
  
[Verse:]  
  
I was a lonely boy  
I was a lonely boy  
I'm not the only boy  
I was a lonely boy  
I was a lonely boy  
I'm not the only boy  
  
[Verse:]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
  
I need some rope, it's my only hope  
And why you fight it so I just don't know  
  
[Verse:]  
  
I was the lonely boy  
I was the lonely boy  
I'm not the only boy  
  
I'm not the only boy, no  
No no no
