I see you have made yourself a brand new life  
Such a cool blue star with a bright new shine  
I see you wear your checkered past just like a shining suit of gold  
  
I know you think you look so special  
I am told you have found yourself a brand new time  
Watch the world stand still as the years go by  
I know you think you are so new and different  
  
But it makes no sense to me  
There is nothing new about you  
Just another self-made man  
There is nothing new that I can see  
Enjoy it while you can  
  
I know you think you look so special  
What makes you think you are so special?  
What makes you think you are unique?  
I see you smile and I get angry  
As I watch you go colossal  
  
Like a California king  
All these Californians, coming up here  
And changing everything  
They're just a bunch of carpetbaggers  
And I wish they'd all just go  
Go!  
  
I hear you gave the world a brand new voice  
Such a happy melody with a new wave whine  
Yeah I see you hide behind your own noise  
I think I've seen enough  
  
I will find you in the crowded room  
I will knock you off your feet  
I will burn you just like teenage love  
I will eat you just like meat  
I will break you into pieces  
  
Hold you up for all the world to see  
What makes you think you're better than me?  
What makes you think you're better?  
What makes you think you are complete?  
What makes you think you are the only one immune to falling down  
  
Why can't you see  
I see you fall and I get happy  
I will watch you burn like fire  
I will watch you burn like a California king
