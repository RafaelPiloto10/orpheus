Ah well, I've got a woman and I love, love her so  
She is big, fat and lazy but I want you all to know  
That I love her and I need that woman so  
She is my little lady and I'm glad that you all know  
  
When she wakes in the morning and her figure tells no lies  
My eyesight is broken when the light shines on her tights  
But I love her and I need that woman so  
Oh how can I tell you what I'd do if she should go  
  
And I love her and I need that woman so  
Oh well how can I tell you what I'd do if she should go  
  
Ah well she is so lazy, how she moves I'll never know  
She was so different eleven years ago  
But I love her and I need that woman so  
She's a big lakky lady but I love that woman so
