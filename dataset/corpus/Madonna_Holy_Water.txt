I can give you everything that you want  
You can't buy this in a luxury store  
There's aplace you have to go  
Before I let you take it all  
It's like a drug  
It should be illegal  
  
Baby you should get down low  
And drink my precious alcohol  
You look so thirsty  
I think you need it  
  
Kiss it  
Kiss it back  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Kiss it back  
Make it wet  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Kiss it better  
Kiss it better  
  
I can teach all the things you don't know  
It's rare like making something you wanna own  
Bitch get out my poem  
Bitch get out my poem  
  
There's something you got to hear  
It's secret and immaculate  
I can let you in Heaven's door  
I promise you it's not a sin  
Find salvation right within  
We can do it here on the floor  
  
Kiss it  
Kiss it back  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Kiss it back  
Make it wet  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Kiss it better  
Kiss it better  
  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?  
Like holy water  
Doesn't it taste like holy water?
