This is my wooooooorld  
Z-Ro, king of the ghettoooooo  
[Z-Ro]  
Once upon a time, not long ago  
There was a hustling motherfucker, with a cold ass flow  
Everytime he hit the studio, his beeper go off  
He left the beef to get his cheese, by selling people that raw  
With a pistol on his right side, and one in his back  
I-10 again and again, from running that crack  
Girlfriend kept complaining, cause he never at home  
So he told her deal with it bitch, or get the fuck on  
It was money over bitches, on his mind  
Plus all of his partnas, thought that he would never shine  
The number be 15 and 5, up in the kitchen  
He could do it straight up, or he could do it with a whipping  
But then came a drought, and then he put his first album out  
Decided to do it full time, cause record stores kept selling out  
Still in the game, cocaine on top of the brain  
From the studio to the streets, Z-Ro is everything

King of the ghetto, I'm sitting on my throne  
Got a red light, sitting on my chrome  
Ridgemont Texas, representing  
With a taper fade, sitting on my dome  
I mash niggaz, and I trash niggaz  
When it come down, to the cash nigga  
Beat that ass, in a flash nigga  
Pistol play, and I'ma blast nigga  
Gangstafied, from Goderhead  
All day long, I chase my bread  
But on the low, I don't fuck with FED's  
Cause a snitch nigga, get dressed in red  
Shut up bitch, she look so lie  
But they don't know, she'll take your life  
Not giving a fuck, or get fucked up  
And end up dead, with your dick in the sky  
Go my way, we gon have fun  
Instead of happiness, we have done  
About our business, corrupting our kidneys  
All that codeine, weed and drugs  
I'm leaning over, but still a soldier  
Pimp my pen, like I'm suppose to  
Nothing but the finest, light green doja  
Got it from see-Note, from the Clover  
Animal thug, I thug for life  
So I ain't going, to the club tonight  
Block is bleeding, I'm here for the eating  
And supervising, my funds tonight  
I scuffle and hustle, on my grind  
No matter the weather, no matter the time  
Roll out the red carpet for Z-Ro, this world is mine

Who that bumping, who that beefing  
Hope you brought something, to put your chief in  
Interrupting me, while I'm reefer chiefing  
I'm a gangsta, not Erkle Steven  
Cause I don't laugh, and I don't play  
And no, is something that I don't say  
I don't give a motherfuck, about your day  
Hoe, get the fuck out of my way  
I'm lean as fuck, and don't like nobody  
My style of rap, is I'm like nobody  
I let off fo' shots, and hit fo' bodies  
OG with it, like Amas Rodney  
Still in the game, as a MVP  
Dealing with haters, that envy me  
Fuck fabricated, and commercializing  
I'ma bring my block, to MTV  
Show love, and do all I can  
For all my people, and all my fans  
But motherfuckers, be hating me  
For the life of me, I can't understand  
Cause I'm cool as hell, till a hater get bold  
Step out of line, fuck around get stoled  
I must be, their motherfucking issue  
Cause all these niggaz, getting drove  
Up a lot, like a Volkswagon  
I get a commission, for toe tagging  
A slim killa, with a wide body  
Polo top, and Polo sagging  
I live my life, like I don't care  
But every night, I be deep in prayer  
Then I get off, my knees  
And hustle, straight like that there
