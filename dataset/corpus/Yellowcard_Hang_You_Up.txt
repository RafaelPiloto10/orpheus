I can not hold this anymore  
My hands are tired of only waiting to let go  
And I am waiting, still  
  
I used to know which way to turn  
You were a light inside a tunnel in my head  
I try to follow, still  
I try to follow, still  
  
It's hard to see you, we are older now  
And when I find you, you just turn around  
This is a black and white of you I've found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
  
No more apologies from me  
My arms are tired of picking up what I put down  
You're all I think of, still  
  
I'm gonna miss you everyday  
I turn my back on anyone who won't believe  
And it gets lonely, still  
It gets lonely, still  
  
It's hard to see you, we are older now  
And when I find you, you just turn around  
This is a black and white of you I've found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
  
I get lost sometimes  
Another year flies by  
But I know if I try  
Memories of the light in your eyes  
Can take me back in time  
  
It's hard to see you, we are older now  
And when I find you, you just turn around  
This is a black and white of you I found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
It's hard to see you we are older now (we are older now)  
And when I find you, you just turn around (you turn around)  
This is a black and white of you I found (you I found)  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
(Pull you down)  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
(Pull you down)  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
(Pull you down)  
  
I don't hear music anymore  
My ears are tired of all the pictures in the words  
'Cause you are in them, still
