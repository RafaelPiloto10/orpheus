That's the very same door that I carried her through  
On the night we were married last June  
And right over there is the very same chair that she sat in when she said
we're through  
Over here you can see where I got on my knees and I begged but her heart was a
stone  
Over here's where I cried did you know I'd died right here in this very same
room  
  
To your right there's a crib and it's never been used perhaps that's why we're
apart  
And there sits a phone that she used on alone to make plans with her new
sweetheart  
Then she walked over here and she picked up her things then left me alone in
the gloom  
Over here's where I cried did you know I'd died right here in this very same
room  
Right here in this very same room
