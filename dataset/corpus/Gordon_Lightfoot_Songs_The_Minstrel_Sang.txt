One, two, three, four  
  
It's almost over, it's almost done  
And you can't put the blame on anyone  
It's almost easy and it's almost fun  
Did you get caught with your britches on?  
  
Hi, derry day in the month of May  
Was the song the minstrel sang  
To the good of Robin Hood  
Maid Marion and all the gang  
  
His aim was mean and his shot was clean  
And his suit was the shade of evergreen  
The folks he knew, hadn't naught to fear  
When the sheriff was there, they were over here  
  
Hi, derry doon in the month of June  
Was the song the minstrel sung  
To the good of Robin Hood's  
Good name and a place to run  
  
He loved strong ale and a run down jail  
Was the kind of a scene where he never failed  
There was no man on the sea or land  
Who could get Maid Marion on the trail  
  
Hi, derry day in the month of May  
Was the song the minstrel sang  
To the good of Robin Hood  
Maid Marion and all the gang  
  
It's almost over, it's almost done  
And you can't put the blame on Marion  
She almost made it to the friar's gate  
But the old wooden bridge wouldn't elevate  
  
Hi, derry doon in the month of June  
Was the song the minstrel sung  
To the good of Robin Hood's  
Good name and a place to run
