So you fucked this up again  
It's time for you to leave  
You never had many friends and you thought this was all right  
You're rushing to meditate  
You should eat but probably wait  
You never thought of yourself  
Why are you shaking  
Why are you right when I will be the only one who gives  
And lets you in tonight  
Walk you could never walk away  
From this speed freak collagen  
Caffeinated place  
You were always reaching in  
Looking for somewhere to go  
Nobody needs to find out  
Nobody needs to know what you know  
So you wonder about the past  
When you know that its already been  
Nothing seems to last  
Can it last will it last
