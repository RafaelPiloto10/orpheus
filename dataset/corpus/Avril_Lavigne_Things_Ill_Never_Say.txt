I'm tugging at my hair  
I'm pulling at my clothes  
I'm trying to keep my cool  
I know it shows  
I'm staring at my feet  
My cheeks are turning red  
I'm searching for the words inside my head  
  
Cause I'm feeling nervous  
Trying to be so perfect  
Cause I know you're worth it  
You're worth it  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
If I could say what I want to say  
I'd say I want to blow you, away  
Be with you every night  
Am I squeezing you too tight  
If I could say what I want to see  
I want to see you go down  
On one knee  
Marry me today  
Guess, I'm wishing my life away  
With these things I'll never say  
  
It don't do me any good  
It's just a waste of time  
What use is it to you  
What's on my mind  
If ain't coming out  
We're not going anywhere  
So why can't I just tell you that I care  
  
Cause I'm feeling nervous  
Trying to be so perfect  
Cause I know you're worth it  
You're worth it  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What's wrong with my tongue  
These words keep slipping away  
I stutter, I stumble  
Like I've got nothing to say  
  
Cause I'm feeling nervous  
Trying to be so perfect  
Cause I know you're worth it  
You're worth it  
Yeah  
  
Guess I'm wishing my life away with these things I'll never say  
If I could say what I want to say  
I'd say I want to blow you, away  
Be with you every night  
  
Am I squeezing you too tight  
If I could say what I want to see  
I want to see you go down  
On one knee  
  
Marry me today  
Guess I'm wishing my life away  
With these things I'll never say  
These things I'll never say
