Make up the rules for me to live by  
Rules you break and just let it slide  
You try and find you inside of me  
Be as great as you want me to be  
Hypocrite, the word that fits  
Do as you say  
Not as you do  
You're pushing me to a breakpoint  
Pushing me to a breakpoint  
Pushing me to a breakpoint  
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint  
Self esteem you seem to lack  
Point the finger  
There's three pointing back  
Control's the illusion with all good intent  
Bad times are contagious  
You laugh and infect  
Criticist, the word that fits  
Put me down to lift you up  
Watching pain's your only pleasure  
Fascination for sick disaster  
Suffering since you were born  
Mess with the bull and you get the horns.  
Misery, the word that fits  
Times are good when times are bad  
"In my opinion as a professional I recommend we straight-jacket the son of a  
bitch, lock him in a rubber room, sedate him, heavily, and when he wakes up,
if  
he wakes up, we'll see if he can be a nice boy"  
"Well... I don't know... It's gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt him"  
"Let's do it!"  
"Sedate me? Cool! a straight jacket? Hey, hey, let go of me!"  
You push me to a breakpoint  
Push me to a breakpoint  
Push me to a breakpoint  
Don't push me, you piece of shit!
