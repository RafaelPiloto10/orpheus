I've been demoralized too many times  
But now I realize, Ah ah, no more.  
I'm gonna get me a gun  
I'm gonna get me a gun  
And all those people who put me down  
You better get ready to run,  
'cause I'm gonna get me a gun  
  
I know my destiny is like the sun  
You see the best of me when I have got my gun  
I'm gonna get me a gun  
I'm gonna get me a gun  
And all those people who put me down  
You better get ready to run,  
'cause I'm gonna get me a gun  
  
So you think you can push me around  
And make me run  
Well I'm gonna tell you now  
I'm gonna get me a gun  
I'm gonna get me a gun  
And all those people who put me down  
You better get ready to run,  
'cause I'm gonna get me a gun  
  
Gonna get me a gun
