Funky is as funky does  
Walked on over, there she was  
Standing by the jukebox  
With her ear up against refused to hear  
  
What I'm sayin', I'm only prayin'  
I just want to make sweet love to you  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Understand?  
I wanna be your man  
I got a plan  
She said speak to the hand  
She said I'm gonna rock your world, y'all  
Oh oh oh  
I-i'm gonna rock your world, y'all  
  
Chorus  
Black or white, love or hate  
You should get it off your chest  
Before it's too late  
Say it, if you got something on your mind,  
Say it  
  
You must learn to release your  
I got a car, it go fast  
Keep fuzzy dice on the dash  
Gotta bumper sticker, it says peace  
Keep a gun under my seat  
To protect you in case one of them bad guys come along  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Am I too rough, not rough enough  
You like whips and chains, I'll buy that stuff  
Oh oh oh  
  
Chorus  
Love or hate, skin black or white  
Gonna eat you up if you keep it inside  
So say it  
Girl you got something on your mind, say it  
Baby am I not your type, say it  
Like wow, do you love me know, say it  
  
Like tiger sanchez, your latin lover  
Get up the nerve, gonna make a scene,  
Walk it on over like a sex machine  
Takin' it to the floor, doin' my funky dance,  
Show her the tiger that's in my what what  
Everybody funny, now you actin' funny too  
Was it something I said, something I've done,  
Something that I do  
Did did I rock your world, y'all  
Did did I rock your world y'all  
  
Black white gay straight get raped  
Did it late religious gone love hate  
Stayed out way too late  
Say it, got something on your mind, say it  
What's wrong baby, I ain't your type, say it  
Why don't you love my now
