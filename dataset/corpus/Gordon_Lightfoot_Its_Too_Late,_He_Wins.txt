The days may come, the days may go  
Like the dreams of love that we shared so long ago  
It's the time, it's the place to realize that I was wrong  
It's too late, he wins and it's there that you belong  
It's there you will find all the love I couldn't give  
While I live in regret, for as long as I may live  
The years will pass but your memory will live on  
It's too late, he wins and it's there that you belong  
It's there you will find all the love I couldn't give  
It's there you will stay, for as long as you may live  
It's the time, it's the place to realize that I was wrong  
It's too late, he wins and it's there that you belong  
It's too late, he wins and it's there that you belong
