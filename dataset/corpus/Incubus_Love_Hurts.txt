Tonight we drink to youth  
And holding fast to truth  
Don't want to lose what I had as a boy  
  
My heart still has a beat  
But love is now a feat  
As common as a cold day in LA  
Sometimes at night alone I wonder  
Is there a spell that I am under  
Keeping me from seeing the real thing  
  
Love hurts  
But sometimes it's a good hurt  
And it feels like I'm alive  
  
Love sings  
When it transcends the bad things  
Have a heart and try me  
'Cause without love I won't survive  
  
I'm fettered and abused  
Stand naked and accused  
Should I surface this one man submarine  
  
I only want the truth  
So tonight we drink to youth  
I'll never lose what I had as a boy  
Sometimes at night alone I wonder  
Is there a spell that I am under  
Keeping me from seeing the real thing  
  
Love hurts  
But sometimes it's a good hurt  
And it feels like I'm alive  
  
Love sings  
When it transcends the bad things  
Have a heart and try me  
'Cause without love I won't survive  
  
Without love I won't survive  
  
Love hurts  
But sometimes it's a good hurt  
And it feels like I'm alive  
  
Love sings  
When it transcends the bad things  
Have a heart and try me  
'Cause without love I won't survive  
  
Love hurts, oh  
Love hurts  
Without love I won't survive  
  
Love hurts, oh  
Love hurts  
Without love I won't survive
