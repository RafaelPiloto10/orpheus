He walked where I walked  
He stood where I stand  
He felt what I feel  
He understands  
He knows my frailty  
Shared my humanity  
Tempted in every way  
Yet without sin  
  
God with us  
So close to us  
God with us Emmanuel  
Emmanuel  
  
One of a hated race  
Stung by the prejudice  
Suffering injustice  
Yet he forgives  
Wept for my wasted years  
Paid for my wickedness  
He died in my place  
That I might live  
  
Emmanuel  
Emmanuel  
Emmanuel  
Emmanuel
