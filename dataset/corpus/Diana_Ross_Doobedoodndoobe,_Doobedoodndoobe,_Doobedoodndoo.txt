Go with what I've sent you...Someone to love  
  
Heaven must have sent you to me  
And I'm not gonna let you go back  
I'm gonna love you till the stars don't shine  
And angels start dressing in black  
  
I wanna shout "Hallelujah"  
Oh, heart I've finally fooled ya  
Somebody strike up the band  
I've got a good, good feeling  
  
Doobedood'ndoo doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
Oh, doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
Oh, doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
I love you, yes I do  
Doobedood'ndoo  
  
I just started living  
The day you started giving your love to me  
And now music feels my soul  
It sounds just like a rock 'n' roll symphony  
Listen to the music in my soul  
Ahhhh...  
  
I see words inside your eyes  
They beg me not to leave  
Could it be we might have passed  
On the same road to loneliness  
  
Let us put bad memories  
Of our past up on the shelf  
(And leave it there forever)  
And give ourselves a second chance  
To enjoy love's priceless wealth  
  
Don't it make you wanna shout "Hallelujah"  
When you're feeling love go through ya  
Somebody strike up the band  
Here it comes again  
  
Doobedood'ndoo doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
Oh, doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
Oh, doobedood'ndoo doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
I love you, yes I do  
Doobedood'ndoo  
  
I just started living  
The day you started giving your love to me  
And now music feels my soul  
It sounds just like a rock 'n' roll symphony  
Listen to the music in my soul  
  
Doobedood'ndoo doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
Oh, doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
Oh, doobedood'ndoo doobedood'ndoobe doobedoobedoo  
I love you, yes I do  
Doobedood'ndoo  
  
I just started living  
The day you started giving your love to me...  
  
Doobedood'ndoo doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
Oh, doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoobe doobedood'ndoo  
Oh, doobedood'ndoo doobedood'ndoobe doobedoobedoo  
I love you, yes I do  
Doobedood'ndoo  
  
I just started living  
The day you started giving your love to me...
