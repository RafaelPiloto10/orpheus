Hallelujah  
  
I am a preacher with a message for my people  
Over the world, scratching on the ground  
Looking for the peace that nobody has found  
  
I am a spokesman for a better way of living  
Love is the word and it can be heard  
If you are young the message can be sung  
  
Let me hear you sing,  
Hallelujah  
  
Oh, tell it to the man who's power is the sermon on the wall  
Tell it to the man who says you can misjudge them all  
Tell it 'till it can be heard above the wailing of the crowd  
Tell it on the field of war and hope you'll soon be justified  
  
There is a better way of life and it's not so hard to find  
If you live and let the people in your world speak it's mind  
  
I am the pupil who sells his life for freedom  
All over the world and it can be heard  
If you are young the message can be sung  
  
Hallelujah
