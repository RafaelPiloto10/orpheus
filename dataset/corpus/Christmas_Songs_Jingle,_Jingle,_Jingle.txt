Jingle, jingle, jingle  
You will hear my sleigh bells ring  
I am old Kris Kringle  
I'm the King of Jingling  
  
Jingle, jingle, reindeer  
Through the frosty air they go  
They are not just plain deer  
They're the fastest deer I know (Ho! Ho!)  
  
You must believe that on Christmas Eve  
I won't pass you by  
I'll dash away in my magic sleigh  
Flying through the sky  
  
Jingle, jingle, jingle  
You will hear my sleigh bells ring  
I am old Kris Kringle  
I'm the King of Jingling (Ho! Ho!) For Thy mercy and Thy grace  
Constant through another year  
Hear our song of thankfulness  
Father and Redeemer hear  
  
Dark the future
