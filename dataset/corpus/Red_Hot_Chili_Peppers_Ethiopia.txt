"We're rolling everybody,  
It starts with bass"  
  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
When you give your love away  
You get a feeling for  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
Live to love another day  
Even when you feel unsure  
More and more I wanna raise  
Raise my bar and raise your stay  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
When I lie they're wide awake  
For my son I make  
  
Tell my boy I love him so  
Tell him so he know  
Lost in Ethiopia  
Walk out in that road  
  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
Something good gon' come your way  
Just look out your door  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
Tell him what you wanna say  
No matter whatcha mad at girl  
  
Tell my boy I love him so  
Tell him so he know  
Lost in Ethiopia  
Walk out in that road  
  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
Steal my heart to give away  
Make me wanna say  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
You and I are so no same  
More and more and more each day  
  
Tell my boy I love him so  
Tell him so he know  
Lost in Ethiopia  
Walk out in that road
