Ohh-oh ohh-ahhh  
Yeah, ohh, uh-uh-uh-ah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now we're looking on and finding  
Things are looking up  
My life is moving on  
Onto better than the love  
  
'Cause I'm feelin' fine  
And love is, love is hard to find  
It's suddenly a game  
And you won this heart of mine  
  
[Bridge]  
I never believe it  
After all that I've been through  
So good to receive it  
All alone that I found you  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is waiting (love is waiting)  
And this time I'm taking it all (this time)  
So amazing (so amazing)  
I don't need a reason to fall (uh no no)  
  
You know everyday you see it  
Love is burning out  
And I just have to say  
That's the way it's turning now  
Well it's plain to see  
Baby, what you do to me  
What used to be a dream  
Is now everything that's on me, yeah  
  
[Bridge  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
(Moving on) moving on baby  
(Moving on) moving on  
(Looking on) looking on baby  
(Looking on) looking on  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus: x 4]
