I loved this song when I was little, I won a talent contest singing this song,  
and I believe it was a little something like this:  
  
Guess mine is not the first heart broken  
My eyes are not the first to cry  
I'm not the first to know there's  
Just no getting over you  
  
Ladies and gentleman, Olivia Newton John!  
You know I'm just a fool who's willing  
To sit around and wait for you  
(But) baby can't you see there's nothing else for me to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now there's no where to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you (you)  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Whoo  
  
Olivia Newton John!
