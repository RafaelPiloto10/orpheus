Now you're very much like your mother  
And that's a natural fact  
But you couldn't look much like your brother's wife  
Or anyone like that  
  
And you don't look much like your sister  
'Cause she's all big and fat  
But don't breath a word to your mean old dad  
'Cause I'll be coming back  
  
I'm coming home to see you early in the morning  
I'll be around and on the first train today  
I'm coming home to see you while day's dawning  
All aboard, all aboard  
  
Put on some fancy clothes and meet me at the station  
Make sure I don't mistake you for your sister Jane  
Don't want to see you with your goddamn relations  
That's all for now, I'll see you, ciao
