In question is how all this came to be  
You and me, kinda free, it's destiny  
  
I look around and I like everything I see  
Just us three, kinda free, it's destiny  
  
Oh I'd like to know just what it is  
That makes some things the way they are  
Oh what sets the pace, what is that maze  
That gives me wings to fly  
  
Come on lets keep flying baby, sweet baby  
(I said) come on let's keep flying baby, sweet baby  
  
We found this place, an endless space  
Can't let go, no baby no, it's destiny  
  
Oh, by God's grace there's no other place for me to be  
No, don't you go, it's destiny  
  
Oh I'd like to know just what it is  
That makes some things the way they are  
Oh, what sets the stage, what is that face  
That gives me wings to fly
