The woods eats the woman and dumps her honey-body in the mud  
Her dress floats down the well and it assumes the shape of the body of a
little girl  
  
Yeah I recognize that girl  
She stumbled in some time last loneliness  
But I could not stand to touch her now  
My one and onlyness.  
  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging.  
  
Worms make their cruel design  
Saying D-I-E into her skin  
Saying dead into belly and death into shoulder  
Well last night she kissed me but than death was upon her.  
  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging.  
  
Now the killed waits for the killer  
And the trees all nod their heads, they are agreed  
This knife feels like a knife feels like a knife that feels like it's feed.  
Yeah I recognize that girl  
I took her from rags right through to stitches (pray for me now)  
Oh baby, tonight we sleep in separate ditches.  
  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging.  
  
Love is for fools and all fools are lovers  
It's raining on my house and none of the others  
Love is for fools and God knows I'm still one  
The sidewalks are filled with love's lonely children  
The sidewalk regrets that we had to kill them.
