I played the state,  
The capital,  
And people said  
Don't stop,  
Until you play the Palace,  
You haven't played the top.  
For years I had it preached to me,  
And drummed into my head,  
Until you play the Palace,  
You might as well be dead.  
A team of hoofers was the headline,  
At the Majestic, down in Dallas.  
But they canceled the day,  
Their agent called to say,  
You can open the bill at the palace.  
So, it became the Hall of Fame,  
The Mecca of the trade.  
When you had played the Palace,  
You knew that you were made.  
So, I hope you understand my wondrous thrill,  
'cause Vaudevilles back as the Palace,  
And I'm on the bill.  
  
Shine on  
Shine on  
Harvest moon  
Up in the sky  
I aint had no lovin  
Since January  
Febuary  
June or July  
  
Some of these days  
Your gonna miss me honey  
Some of these days  
Your gonna feel so lonely  
You miss my hugging  
You miss my kissing  
You'll miss me honey  
When I'm far away  
  
Oh my man  
I love him so  
He'll never know  
All my life is just despaire  
But I don't care  
When he takes me in his arms  
The world is bright alright  
  
I don't care  
I don't care  
If people frown  
On me  
I'm happy go lucky  
They say that I'm plucky  
Contented and carefree,  
I don't care  
I don't care  
If he's a clerk or just a millionare,  
If I'm not successful  
It wont be degressful  
'cause I don't care.  
  
And all around me  
I hear voices that I can't ignore.  
The voices of the stars  
Who played the Palace long before.  
The stars who entertained you,  
Until the rafters rang.  
You don't need there names  
For the whole world acclaims them  
For the wonderful songs they sang.  
There's Eddie Canter,  
Georgie Jessle,  
Louie Holts,  
Johnson and olson.  
Cowerson boys,  
Howerdson boys  
Aand that singing fool Al Jolson.  
And so with deep humility,  
I stand in front of you  
I'm proud to play the palace,  
It's like a dream come true,  
Which is why I'd like to shout it up and down.  
Just to tell Broadway  
That the two a day is back in town.
