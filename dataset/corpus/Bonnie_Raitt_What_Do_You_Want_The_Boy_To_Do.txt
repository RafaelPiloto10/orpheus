So you think the man is crazy  
He eats up your lies  
Like they're good for him  
Apple pie, he don't even cry  
  
He's not a fool  
He's just tryin' to do  
What his heart says to  
To love you  
  
As you take to the wind  
To the wind again my friend  
As he breaks down within  
Within, within, within  
He waits for you patiently  
Hopin' that one day you'll see  
That all he really wants to be  
Is yours and yours alone eternally  
  
What do you want the boy to do?  
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two?  
What do you want the boy to do?  
All he really wants is you  
  
He knows what you are  
Still he'll be up game  
Saved the world today  
But you know better  
You don't go around him  
  
Now and then you promise  
All the way out things that you're gonna get  
You will see, you will be,  
So damn glad that you finally found him  
  
As he watches you come and go  
Or you show  
As he watched you promise a zero  
He waits for you patiently  
Hopin' that one day you'll see  
That all he really wants to be  
Is yours and yours alone eternally  
  
What do you want the boy to do?  
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two?  
What do you want the boy to do?  
Don't you see that you're breaking the child in two?
