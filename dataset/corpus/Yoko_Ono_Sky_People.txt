I stopped flying a long time ago,  
Thinking that's just for the birds and bees.  
But when I look up (I look up)  
And see the sky, (see the sky)  
I like the blue and I know why.  
  
You came from Zeus, we come from Uranus,  
Hoping to meet soul to soul.  
We see you clearly, (clearly)  
With our third eye, (with our third eye)  
There's no more fear and I know why.  
  
Sky people, that's what we are,  
Sky people, that's what we are.  
One day we'll fly and leap through the sky  
To look for a good land hand in hand.  
  
Sky people, that's what we are,  
Sky people, that's what we are,  
Sky people, that's what we are,  
Sky people, that's what we are.
