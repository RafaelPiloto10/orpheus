Maybe I should go to bed  
Maybe I'm the glutton for the truth  
You've got me standing on my head  
Trying to put on someone else's shoes  
  
And  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain of mine alive  
  
I promise you a miracle  
I promise you everything he is  
Please don't get hysterical  
Can't you see I'm trying to take the piss  
  
But-  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain on mine alive  
  
You float around inside my head  
Going from one extreme to the other  
But words like these should go unsaid  
So I'll keep y big mouth shut forever  
  
And  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain of mine alive  
  
The thought of you  
Is enough to make a million angels sing  
The thought of you  
Make the bells of hell go ting a ling a ling
