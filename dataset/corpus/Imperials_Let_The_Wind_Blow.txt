There's a storm on the horizon,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
There is thunder in the heavens,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
Let the rain fall down from the sky above,  
Let the tempest roar 'til it's had enough,  
I'm trusting in the Lord of love,  
Let the wind blow.  
  
There is lightning in the distance,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
There is darkness all around me,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
Let the world give all the hurt it can,  
Let the evil one devise his plans,  
I'm trusting in the great I am,  
Let the wind blow.  
  
Let the wind blow... Blow as hard as it can,  
Let the wind blow,  
Upon the solid rock of God I stand,  
Oh, let the wind blow.  
  
There's a storm on the horizon,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
There is thunder in the heavens,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
Let it's mighty fury be unleashed,  
Let the doubters fall upon their knees,  
I'm trusting in the prince of peace,  
Let the wind blow.  
  
Let the wind blow... Blow as hard as it can,  
Let the wind blow,  
Upon the solid rock of God I stand,  
Oh, let the wind blow.  
  
Let it's mighty fury be unleashed,  
Let the doubters fall upon their knees,  
I'm trusting in the prince of peace,  
Let the wind blow.  
  
Let the wind blow... Blow as hard as it can,  
Let the wind blow,  
Upon the solid rock of God I stand,  
Let the wind blow, the wind blow.  
  
Let the rain fall down from the sky above,  
Let the tempest roar 'til it's had enough, (let the wind blow)  
Let the world give all the hurt it can,  
Let the evil one devise his plans, (let the wind blow)  
Let the rain fall down from the sky above,  
Let the tempest roar 'til it's had enough,  
I'm trusting in the Lord of love,  
Let the wind blow
