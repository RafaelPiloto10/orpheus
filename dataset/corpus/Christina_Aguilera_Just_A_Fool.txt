Another shot of whiskey please bartender  
Keep it coming til I don't remember at all  
How bad it hurts when you're gone (na na na)  
  
Turn the music up a little bit louder  
Just gotta get past the midnight hour  
Maybe tomorrow it won't  
Be this hard  
Who am I kidding  
I know what I'm missing  
  
I had my heart set on you  
But nothing else hurts like you do  
Who knew that love was so cruel  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
And I  
Waited and waited so long  
For someone who'd never come home  
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)  
I'm just a fool  
(Yeah)  
  
I said that I don't care  
I'd walk away whatever  
And I tell myself we were bad together (uh huh)  
But that's just me trying to move on  
With out you  
  
But who am I kidding  
I know what I'm missing  
  
Hey, I had my heart set on you  
But nothing else hurts like you do  
Who know that love was so cruel  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
And I  
Waited and waited so long  
For someone who'd never come home  
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)  
I'm just a fool  
  
For holding on to something that  
Is never ever gonna come back  
I can't accept that it's lost  
  
I should have let it go  
Held my tongue  
Can't fight the motion  
Cause now everything's so wrong  
Wrong, wrong  
  
I'm just a fool  
A fool for you  
I'm just a fool  
  
Hey, I had my heart set on you  
And nothing else hurts like you do  
Who knew that love was so cruel  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
And I  
Waited and waited so long  
For someone who'd never come home  
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)  
I'm just a fool  
I'm just a fool  
I'm just a fool  
  
It's my fault to think you'll be true  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
I'm just a fool
