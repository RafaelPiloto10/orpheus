Turn the pages of this old book  
Sounds familiar, it may be worth a second look  
Wrapping up dope in a paper bag  
Talking to yourself taking a drag  
  
What does it matter the things you say  
They'll never hear it anyway  
Gotta get past the negative things  
Lawyers and business, you get what you bring  
  
No one's sorry you did it yourself  
It's time to relax now and then give it hell  
  
Someday you'll find what you're looking for  
Someday you'll find everything you're looking for  
  
You didn't bet on the Dodgers to beat the Giants  
And David came up,  
Now you gotta pay up  
You didn't count on that  
  
Geez, half the money's gone  
The month is still young  
Where are you gonna go now?  
You gotta trust someone  
  
Trust someone  
Someone to trust.  
Can't go to your brother  
'Cause that money's all gone  
Can't go to your friends  
  
Someday you'll find what you're looking for  
Someday you'll find everything you're looking for  
Someday you'll find everything you're looking for  
Someday you'll find everything you're looking for, yeah  
  
Made out like a bandit for so many years  
What're you looking for?  
One more big score?  
What're you trying to prove?  
  
Try to get closer but not too close  
(Try to get past it but not too far past it)  
Try to get through but not be through  
  
No one can touch you now  
No one can touch you now  
I can touch you now  
(Nobody can see you now But I can see you)  
  
You're invisible, you've got too many secrets  
Bob Dylan said that  
Or something like that  
  
Someday you'll find what you're looking for  
Someday you'll find everything you're looking for  
Someday you'll find everything you're looking for  
Someday you'll find everything you're looking for, yeah
