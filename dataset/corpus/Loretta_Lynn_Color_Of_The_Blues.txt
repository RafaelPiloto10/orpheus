Up above me are the skies like the twinkle in your eyes  
These things are the colors of the blues  
In the mail your letter came the ink and paper looked the same  
Blue must be the color of the blues  
Bluebird's singing in the trees seems to sympathize with me  
But he ain't singing like he used to do  
The pearly waters in the sea are as cold as you left me  
Blue must be the color of the blues  
  
There's a rainbow overhead with more blue than gold and red  
Blue must be the color angels choose  
A blue suit you proudly wore when you left to return no more  
Blue must be the color of the blues  
Blue days come and blue days go how I feel nobody knows  
Life is mighty empty without you  
There's a blue note in each song that I sang since you've been gone  
Blue must be the color of the blues
