It's so easy, but I can't do it  
So risky - But I gotta chance it  
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about  
My money, that's all you want to talk about  
I can see what you want me to be  
But I'm no fool  
It's in the lap of the Gods  
I can see what you want me to be  
But I'm no fool  
No beginning, there's no ending  
There's no meaning in my pretending  
Believe me, life goes on and on and on  
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong  
You say I can't set you free from me  
But that's not true  
It's in the lap of the Gods  
I can see what you want me to be  
But I'm no fool  
It's in the lap of the Gods  
Wo wo la la la wo  
Wo wo la la  
Wah wah ooh  
But that's not true
