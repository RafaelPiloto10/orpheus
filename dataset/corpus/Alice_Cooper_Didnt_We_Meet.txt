Pardon me,  
But you see,  
I've seen that face before  
I know those eyes  
Unearthly wise  
I feel it more and more  
To look at you,  
Deja vu,  
Chills me to the core  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
But that only confused me  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
And that frankly amused me  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
  
Gradually  
I can see  
Things are getting clear  
That ageless face  
Satanic grace  
This sudden rush of fear  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin'  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
So I'd better be leavin'  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
  
Here I am  
Door's been slammed  
They're gonna roast my hide  
Make me bleed  
'Til I plead  
For you to let me die  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin'  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
God, I wish I'd believed them  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
Didn't we meet  
In the night in my sleep?  
Didn't we meet  
In the night in my sleep  
Somewhere?
