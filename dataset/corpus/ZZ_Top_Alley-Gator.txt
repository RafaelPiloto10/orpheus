Crawlin' 'cross the floor at the Holiday Inn motel  
I saw that girl that my swamp bone knew so well  
She crawled out of Texas flipped off to Baton Rouge  
She got that Gulf Coast sun tan that give a poor boy the blues  
Alley-gator, with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alley-gator, she'll make you 'fraid 'em  
She'll chew you up it ain't no lie, yeah yeah yeah  
Crawlin' through the weeds with a Louisiana mean-toothed grin  
You can tell her that you love her, then you better tell her once again  
She might scratch your back and rub you with her rack  
You better watch out or stand back  
Alley-gator, with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alley-gator, she'll make you 'fraid 'em  
She'll chew you up it ain't no lie, listen here  
Alley-gator, with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alley-gator, she'll make you 'fraid 'em  
She'll chew you up it ain't no lie, listen here  
Alley-gator, with those hypnotic big green eyes  
Alley-gator, alley-gator, alley-gator, alley-gator  
Alley-gator, alley-gator, alley-gator, alley-gator  
Crocodile, a crocodile, alley-gator, alley-gator, alley-gator
