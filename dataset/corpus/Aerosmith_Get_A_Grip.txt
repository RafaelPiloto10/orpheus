Got to get a grip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
If you think I'm vain, better shut ya lip  
I can't explain how to be a fat city  
You gotta live large, gotta let it rip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip  
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city  
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta get a grip - rip  
Once upon a crime I thought I was cool  
But I don't want to brag  
Once I crossed the line I think I musta  
Zigged when I shoulda zagged  
Got to get a grip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
If you think I'm vain, better shut ya lip  
I can't explain how to be a fat city  
You gotta live large, gotta let it rip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip  
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city  
Same old, same old every day  
If things don't change you're just gonna rot  
'Cause if you do what you've always done  
You've always get what you've always got  
(uuh, could that be nothing)  
Got to get a grip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
If you think I'm vain, better shut ya lip  
I can't explain how to be a fat city  
You gotta live large, gotta let it rip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip  
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip  
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city  
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta get a grip  
Who knows for sure without a doubt  
What goes on when the lights go out  
Or who pulls in when I pull out  
And what is a one-eyed trouser trout  
I was so shortsighted  
Now the wrong been righted  
I feel so delighted  
I get so excited  
Got to get a grip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
If you think I'm vain, better shut ya lip  
I can't explain how to be a fat city  
You gotta live large, gotta let it rip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip  
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip  
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city  
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta get a grip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip  
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city  
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta get a grip  
You wanna get high in a new york minute  
Choke that smoke, honey crack the whip  
Your head gets dead as long as you're in it  
You wanna hang loose, gotta get a grip  
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity  
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip  
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city  
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta get a grip
