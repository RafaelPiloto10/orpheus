You've been playin' it cool  
I've been playin' a fool  
(Oh wah)  
Now don't you give me that cool love  
(Give me that cool love)  
Give me the kind I need  
(The kind I need)  
Let's start gettin' with it, baby  
You're actin' like a square to me (baby!)  
Well, love's gotta be warm  
And love's gotta be right  
And this ain't no ice cube that you're with tonight  
So don't you dish me out the cool love  
(Give me that cool love)  
It don't move me at all  
(Move me at all)  
And if you'd live it up, baby  
Man, we'd really have a ball (baby!)  
You've been playin' it cool  
I've been playin' a fool  
(Oh wah)  
Now don't you give me that cool love  
(Give me that cool love)  
Give me the kind I need (The kind I need)  
Let's start gettin' with it, baby  
You're actin' like a square to me (baby!)  
Now the clock is strikin' one  
And we ain't had no fun  
Just throw your arms around me  
And the night has just begun  
Now that's a little more like it (A little more like it)  
Now you're doing all right (Doing all right)  
And if you keep it up, baby  
I'll see you tomorrow night (see you tomorrow night)  
See you tomorrow night  
(See you tomorrow night)  
See you tomorrow night  
(See you tomorrow night)  
See ya!  
(Yeah)
