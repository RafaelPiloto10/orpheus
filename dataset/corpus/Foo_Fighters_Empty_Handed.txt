[Verse 1]  
Blast on near a wall  
Tell it or say  
Blast it  
Read a bow  
Wear it all away  
Empty handed  
Empty handed  
  
[Verse 2]  
Peel oh peel the rest  
Need a bit of salt  
Beg for it, son  
Nail it to a wall  
Empty handed  
Empty handed  
  
[Chorus 1](x2)  
It's never enough  
It's never enough  
It's never enough  
Yeah, you had another rule  
  
[Verse 1]  
  
[Verse 2]  
  
[Chorus](x4)  
  
Wow!
