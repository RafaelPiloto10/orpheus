We never spoke a word  
But every thought she had I heard from across the room  
  
If we were standing face to face  
I couldn't find the words to say  
Give me one more move  
  
I don't even know her name  
I guess foolish pride's to blame  
  
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away  
And my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say  
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day  
Now I'm falling in love  
As she's walking away  
  
Wise man next to me did say  
'Bout the one that got away  
Son I missed my chance  
  
Don't you let regret take place  
Of the dreams you have to chase  
Ask her to dance, go on son  
  
You might fall down on your face  
Roll the dice and have some faith  
  
And don't be falling in love as she's walking away  
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say  
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day  
Don't be falling in love  
As she's walking away  
  
You might fall down on your face  
Roll the dice and have some faith  
  
And don't be falling in love as she's walking away  
When your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say  
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day  
Don't be falling, falling, falling in love  
As she's walking away
