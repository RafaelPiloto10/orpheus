Driving home I saw her on the street  
Her dress so tight, yeah she looked so neat  
All the boys as they were passing by  
They tried to catch that little girls eye  
I said to myself, don't it seem like a crime  
To think that little girl used to be mine.  
They call her little sinner (little sinner)  
Cause they can see, she's got the devil in her  
Little sinner (call her little sinner)  
There's nothin that I wouldn't do  
To have a little sinner like you.  
It's comin back to me, the times we had  
How could something so good, ever get so bad  
Yeah, me and Jimmy we got drunk that night,  
God knows baby, I didn't do you right.  
They say you haven't loved until you've lost  
I'll get you back no matter what the cost  
They call her little sinner (little sinner)...  
Wild, wild days and wild, wild nights  
I stood up for you baby, and you were worth the fight  
Didn't care about tomorrow...  
Cheap red wine, we couldn't get much higher  
So reckless and young, full of lust and desire  
How could I waste it, I want you so bad I can taste it.  
Hey, don't it seem like a crime  
To think she used to be mine
