Sometimes I'm mad at the world  
Mad at this town  
Mad 'cause I can't lose the same five pounds  
That I've been tryin' to lose for three or four years now.  
  
Sometimes I feel like a truck that just won't run  
On the side of the road in the July sun  
There ain't another car for miles  
That I can thumb down.  
  
I guess every now and then  
You're going to land on a bad day  
Though I still do  
I know I can't complain.  
  
'Cause I love what I do  
Love where I'm at  
The stage, my band, and my old black hat  
My big wool blanket  
Sleepin' in my cowboy boots  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
My red guitar I bang around on some  
And I love lovin' you  
Baby, I love lovin' you.  
  
Now heaven to me it's a simple thing  
It's just you and me  
And a phone that don't ring  
Popcorn poppin' on a lay around Friday night.  
  
Seein' you smile when I wake up  
The way you slide to the middle of my pick up truck  
The way you say baby, it's all gonna be all right  
When I walk in at the end of a worn out day  
And I see you baby, how can I complain.  
  
'Cause I love what I do  
Love where I'm at  
The stage, my band, and my old black hat  
My big wool blanket  
Sleepin' in my cowboy boots  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
My red guitar I bang around on some  
And I love lovin' you  
Baby, I love lovin' you  
Yes, I do.  
  
Well, I love where I've been  
I don't look back  
I thank God for the life he lets me have  
My big wool blanket  
Sleepin' in my cowboy boots  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
My red guitar I bang around on some  
And I love loving you  
Baby, I love lovin' you.  
  
Baby, I love  
Oh yes I do.  
Love lovin' you.  
  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run.  
  
Lovin' you...
