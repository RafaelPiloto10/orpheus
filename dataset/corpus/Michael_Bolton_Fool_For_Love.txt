(duet with Johnny Hallyday-english version)  
  
(Johnny's part)  
I'm coming out with my hands up,  
Put down your guns and I'll... Confess.  
I loved her more than life itself,  
My angel in a pale blue dress.  
But if you want to shoot, then shoot,  
I'd welcome an eternal sleep.  
No man has ever felt a love,  
So deep.  
  
(Michael's part)  
I took her life, her tender life,  
I couldn't bear to think that she,  
Could laugh and love and give herself,  
To any other man than me.  
So if my world would end tonight,  
I will not cry... I do not care.  
I'll meet her in another life,  
Somewhere.  
  
Chorus:  
(Johnny and Michael)  
I was a fool, a fool for love,  
A fool who believed, that she came from above.  
I'll stay a fool, until I die,  
She was my world, my breath, my sky.  
I'm just a fool, who lost all control,  
Along with my soul.  
In time the fool, becomes a clown,  
And you all laugh, as I fall down.  
  
(Michael's part)  
I'll never be at peace again,  
I'll never feel her warm caress,  
I'll leave each day just thinking of,  
My angel in a pale blue dress.  
  
(Johnny's part)  
And when her body's in the ground,  
Make sure you save a space for me,  
For that's the only place, I long to be.  
  
Chorus:
