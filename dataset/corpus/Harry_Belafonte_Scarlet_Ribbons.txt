I peeked in to say good-night  
When I heard my child in prayer  
"And for me, some scarlet ribbons  
Scarlet ribbons for my hair"  
  
All our stores were closed and shuttered  
All the streets were dark and bare  
In our town, no scarlet ribbons  
Not one ribbon for her hair  
  
Through the night my heart was aching  
Just before the dawn was breaking  
In our town, no scarlet ribbons  
Scarlet ribbons for her hair  
  
I peeked in and on her bed  
In gay profusion lying there  
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons  
Scarlet ribbons for her hair  
  
If I live to be a hundred  
I will never know from where  
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons  
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
