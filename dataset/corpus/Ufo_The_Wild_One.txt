We Was going through A lifetime  
I had a banshee on my back  
We're down in corpus christie now  
Picking up the slack  
Now I was wondering where the wild boys  
Had started off and gone  
This memories jamming buttons  
Stuck on some old song  
And if you get this message  
Leave a sign or make a call  
Mohammed's left his calling card  
And it's written on the wall  
Looking for the wild one, wild one  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one  
She was gone in twenty seconds  
Right before my eyes  
No more honey kisses  
No more long goodbyes  
And I feel like pink nevada  
Or cooler shade of blue  
Mother earth is closer now  
Walk me out in the morning dew  
And if you get this message  
Leave a sign or make a call  
Mohammed's left his calling card  
And it's written on the wall  
Looking for the wild one, wild one  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one  
Looking for the  
Solo  
Sometimes I stop breathing  
Just to feel reborn  
And it's like rolling thunder  
Blowing through the corn  
Through my back pages  
I can see the change  
There's a storm a coming now  
Coming through the rain  
Solo  
and I'm out here drifitng  
A million miles alone  
Floating in a spaceship somewhere  
Falling like a stone,  
Falling like a stone  
Still looking for the wild one,  
Yeah yeah
