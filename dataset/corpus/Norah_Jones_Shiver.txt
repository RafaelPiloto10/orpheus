So I look in your direction  
But you pay no attention, do you?  
I know you don't listen to me  
Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?  
but on and on  
from the moment I wake  
to the moment I sleep  
I'll be there by your side  
Just you try and stop me  
I'll waiting in line  
Just to see if you care  
  
Oh, did you want me to change?  
Well I'd change for good  
And I want you to know  
That you'll always get your way  
I wanted to say.............  
  
Don't you shiver  
You shiver  
Singing loud and clear  
I'll always be waiting for you  
  
So you know how much I need you  
But you never even see me, do you?  
And is this my final chance of getting you?  
  
But on and on  
Did she want me to change?  
Well I'd change for good  
And I want you to know  
That you'll always get your way  
I wanted to say..........  
  
Don't you shiver  
You shiver  
Singing loud and clear  
I'll always be waiting for you  
  
So you know how much I need you  
But you never even see me, do you?  
And is this my final chance of getting you?  
  
But on and on  
from the moment I wake  
to the moment I sleep  
I'll be there by your side  
Just you try and stop me  
I'll be waiting in line  
Just to see if you care, if you care  
Oh, did you want me to change  
Well I'd change for good  
and I want you to know  
That you'll always get your way  
And I wanted to say.........  
  
Don't you shiver  
you shiver  
I sing it loud and clear  
That I'll always be waiting for you
