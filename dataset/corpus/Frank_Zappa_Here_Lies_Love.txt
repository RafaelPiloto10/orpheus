Here lies love  
In a grave caused by jealousy  
Here lies love  
In a grave caused by jealousy  
Hate was a pall bearer  
And on the tombstone was written misery  
It was a bad situation  
From the beginning to the end  
It was a bad situation  
From the beginning to the end  
I say, baby you killed my love  
Now the undertaker is your friend  
Now I'm sad and I'm blue  
There's not much I can do  
If these blues don't leave me  
The undertaker will get me too  
Ooh-hoo here lies love  
In a grave caused by jealousy  
You know that hate was the pall bearer  
And on the tombstone was written misery
