Oh Thunderhead, you're a man with a problem  
Ahh - old habits too hard to break  
And soon you'll be dead from that poison that you're on  
Oh - the venom that's worse that the snakes  
  
And I say, hey, hey, hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey: white thunder  
Needles and pins a dead man you're in  
So deep you'll never climb out  
Hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey white thunder  
A gun to your head, the trigger you're dead  
It's quicker and there ain't no doubt  
  
Oh thunderhead, tie it off you're in heaven'  
Oh you'll drown in the Heroin flood  
And die in your bed and sweat and detox  
You are leaving this world  
Oh your epitaph's written in blood  
And I said  
  
Hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey - white thunder  
Needles and pins  
A dead man you're in so deep you'll never climb out  
Hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey - white thunder  
A gun to your head, the trigger you're dead  
It's quicker and there ain't no doubt  
  
Killer - ya scream and ya bleed  
Thriller - you spread you disease  
Watch out, watch out  
  
Thunderhead - yes I am your master  
Will you steal for me - yes  
Will you ruin yourself and give everything unto me - yes  
Will you lie, cheat, deceive, dishonor everything  
And even kill thy brother for me, yes - yes  
Will you worship only me as your true master. Yes  
Thunderhead, will you die for me, yes master  
  
Hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey white thunder  
Needles and pins  
A dead man you're in  
So deep you'll never climb out  
Hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey  
Oh no, hey-hey-hey white thunder  
A gun to your head  
The trigger you're dead  
It's quicker and there ain't no doubt, no no
