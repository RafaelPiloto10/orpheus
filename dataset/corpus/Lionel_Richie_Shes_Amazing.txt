She came on the scene, I felt like I was in a movie, yeah  
She parted the room the way that Moses did the Red Sea, yeah  
And from across the room, I felt her body talking to me, yeah  
'Cause thing about her, thing about her  
Is she is amazing, so amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing  
No man alive would ever, ever dream of talking to her, yeah  
She gave off a vibe like, come to me, I want to see ya, yeah  
And for whatever reason, I was feeling lucky that day, yeah  
'Cause thing about her, thing about her  
Is she is amazing, so amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing in the daylight  
She's amazing in the night  
Once you see her  
She's the only thing on your mind, yeah  
She's amazing, she's amazing, she's amazing  
(Talkin' about her fever, every time she walks in to the room)  
She's amazing, she's amazing  
(She's a party girl, she's a party girl, she's a party girl)  
She's amazing, she's amazing  
(Everyone she meets, start dancing in the streets, 'cause she's amazing  
Everyone she meets, start dancing in the streets, 'cause she's amazing)
