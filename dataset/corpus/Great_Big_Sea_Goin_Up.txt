Well come gather all around me  
There is something you should know  
There's no place quite like this place  
If we get it on the go  
  
So, pile your boots up in the corner  
Hang your jacket from the door  
There's thirty people in the kitchen  
And there's always room for more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh-oh-oh, come on now  
Let's lock the world outside  
Oh-oh-oh, come on I tell you now  
She's goin' up tonight  
  
Well there'll be music all around you  
You should see the way it feels  
Come on off we go now  
Heel and toe now  
To the jigs and reels  
  
Cause somebody's got a fiddle  
And someone else bought a guitar  
And we got Bobby on the squeezebox  
Grab a chair and mason jar  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well there'll be smilin', there'll be laughin'  
Well that's good enough for me  
There'll be dancing all around you  
This is where you want to be  
  
So pile your boots up in the corner  
Hang your jacket from the door  
There's thirty people in the kitchen  
And there's always room, yes there's always room
