Without you woman by my side,  
I'm contemplatin' suicide.  
Torn from all my pride.  
Man tells me: "Son, that ain't the way,  
Gonna make a deal with you child,  
Gonna live another day.  
Just sign right here, son, everything'll be alright."  
  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
All and everything for you,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Your love's all I know and ever knew,  
Therefore, I have sold my soul for you,  
  
I was told by this man it'd be worth my while,  
He'd return me to my woman.  
Return me to my smile.  
It's all I ask for in this life.  
Whatever's wrong son, he told me he'd make right.  
"Just sign right here, child, everything'll be alright."  
  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
All and everything for you,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Your love's all I know and ever knew,  
Therefore, I have sold my soul for you.  
  
All for you  
  
"Sign right here, son, everything'll be alright."  
  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
All and everything for you,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Your love's all I know and ever knew,  
Therefore, I have sold my soul for you.
