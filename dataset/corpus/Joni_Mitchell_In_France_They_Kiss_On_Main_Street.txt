Downtown  
My darling dime store thief  
In the War of Independence  
Rock 'n Roll rang sweet as victory  
Under neon signs  
A girl was in bloom  
And a woman was fading  
In a suburban room  
I said, "Take me to the dance"  
"Do you want to dance?"  
"I love to dance"  
And I told him, "They don't take chances  
They seem so removed from romance"  
"They've been broken in churches and schools  
And molded to middle class circumstance"  
And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling  
  
Downtown  
The dance halls and cafes  
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart  
Just doing the latest dance craze  
Gail and Louise  
In those push-up brassieres  
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings  
Drinking up the band's beers  
Young love was kissing under bridges  
Kissing in cars, kissing in cafes  
And we were walking down Main Street  
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays  
"In France they kiss on Main Street"  
"Amour, mama, not cheap display"  
And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling  
  
Downtown  
In the pinball arcade  
With his head full of pool hall pitches  
And songs from the hit parade  
He'd be singing "Bye, Bye, Love"  
While he's racking up his free play  
Let those rock 'n roll choir boys  
Come and carry us away  
Sometimes Chickie had the car  
Or Ron had a car  
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head  
We'd all go looking for a party  
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead  
And I'd be kissing in the back seat  
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said  
And we'd be rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling
