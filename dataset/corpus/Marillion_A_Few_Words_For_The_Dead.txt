"The songs and the music that I portray comes from the heart, and comes from
the mind. That makes it... that makes me feel that I am delivering the right
information"  
  
Can you make it your own  
Can you take it by the throat  
Make your own luck, learn the skills  
Get in early for the kill  
  
It carries on  
  
Pick up the weapon  
Marry it, give it your name  
Define yourself by it  
Take it down 'the disco  
  
Trigger happy, pulling power  
Lady killer, take 'em out  
See the weirdos on the hill  
Come to get you if you stand still  
  
It carries on  
  
Somewhere in history you were wronged  
Teach your children to bang the drum  
Tell all your family, tell all your friends  
Teach your brothers to avenge  
  
It carries on  
  
Or you could love  
You could love  
  
Lie down in the flowers  
In the blue of the air  
Open your eyes  
Why use up your life for anything else?  
No need to fight for what everyone has  
What do you need?  
It's already there  
It's already there  
  
You could love  
  
So he carried the stars in his pocket  
Drank the sunrise till he was drunk  
He embraced the angels  
They swam like little minnows in his blood  
Ghosts in his eyes  
Out walking beside him  
Laughing like children in his mind  
They chanted his mantra together  
  
You could love  
  
They were happy
