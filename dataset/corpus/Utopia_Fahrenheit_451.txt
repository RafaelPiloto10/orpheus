Yeah  
Fahrenheit four fifty-one  
Ya  
Fahrenheit four fifty-one  
Smoke is in the air now  
It's been spreading just like wild-fire all over town  
Everybody wants to get in on the latest thing  
Going down to the bookstore - burn that mother down  
Ya  
Somebody has to do what's right  
Fahrenheit four fifty-one  
Burning black and white  
Well I got some education  
I go down to the library every night  
And I'm looking for somebody with a dream like mine  
We could share a few pages 'round the fire so bright  
Now it's spreading 'cross the nation  
And it's time to seize the moment, that's what they says  
'cause it's all been well reported in the daily news,  
You can read all about it before it turns to ashes
