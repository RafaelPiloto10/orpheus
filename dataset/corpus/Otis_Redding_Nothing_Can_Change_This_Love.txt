If I go million miles away  
I'll write a letter each and every day now  
Oh, honey, nothing, nothing, nothing  
Nothing is ever gonna change this love  
I have for you, oh no, oh no  
You can make me weep  
Or you can make me moan  
Tell me you just got back, darling  
I'll just say, "Well, welcome home now"  
For honey, nothing, nothing in this world  
Could ever stop this love  
Could ever stop this love  
I have for you, oh no, oh no  
Oh, you're the apple of my eye  
My sweet little cherry pie  
[Incomprehensible], you can be  
My cake and ice cream  
Sugar and spice  
Everything nice  
You can be the  
Girl of my dreams  
If you would only [Incomprehensible]  
When you get back, when you get back  
I'll just say, "Well, welcome home now"  
Oh my darling, nothing  
Nothing, nothing  
Nothing could ever change  
This love I have for you, oh no, oh no
