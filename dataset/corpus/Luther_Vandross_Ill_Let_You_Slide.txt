Back to back and side to side  
There's only music on my mind  
Nothing to worry about but the beat  
I wanted you to come and dance with me  
But you wanted to stay home and watch TV  
Ahhh, but when I got there to my surprise  
There was another guy looking in your eyes  
  
I don't want, don't want us to fuss and fight  
From right now 'til tomorrow night  
So if you promise to love only me and be by my side  
I'll let you slide  
  
Without a doubt tonight is the night  
That we gon' really roll when the time is right  
And we're gonna carry it into the dawn  
Oh, but where are you, where can you be?  
I've been waiting, it seems an eternity  
I took our favorite song from the record stack  
It was "Hey, Jimmy Mack"  
When are you coming back?  
  
Well I'm so disappointed you're gone tonight  
'Cause your love is the spice of my life  
But if you hurry back in the mornin'  
Then, alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
Up and down, pacing around, walking in my sleep  
'Cause you've got a promise to keep  
You've got to come back  
And love, love, love, love me right  
And, huh, I'll let you slide tonight  
  
I can't wait till tomorrow, baby  
Can't you come over tonight?  
I can't get to sleep my baby  
Come and rock my cradle left to right  
I tossed and turned and called you up  
But there wasn't anybody home  
It makes me sad, I need you bad  
But I guess I'm just gonna have to wait until tomorrow comes  
Slide, I knew it, I knew it.  
How could you do it?  
Slide, it's alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
I'll let you slide  
Oh, how could you do it, how could you do it?  
Slide, it's alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
  
I hired me a private eye  
To check up on your cool little alibis  
And what he discovered was woeful to me  
Baby, if you intend to stay with me  
Then you can't see the guys I know you see  
Come on, let's make up and promise to start anew  
Let's take the morning off, I've got some plans for you  
  
Making love by the moon can be mighty fine  
But when the sun rises, so do I  
So if you rock it to me in the morning  
Then alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
Really missed you today, I was on the run  
So wake me up when the morning comes  
I think I'll dance to some music and groove on the party lights  
And let you slide tonight  
  
Get up, oooh, let's love baby  
Be my sugar and spice in the mornin'  
And alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
  
Get up, oooh, let's love baby  
It's really nice in the mornin'  
And alright, I'll let you slide tonight
