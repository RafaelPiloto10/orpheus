From dust to blood  
Who wants to live forever?  
From blood to dust  
Eternity is now or never  
  
I've been waiting for a long time, baby  
I've been waiting for the world to  
  
Burn the churches!  
Burn the banks!  
Burn the precincts!  
Burn City Hall!  
Burn the Court House!  
Burn the schools!  
Burn the prisons!  
Burn the shopping malls!  
  
Stone after stone  
You build a road to nowhere  
Mile after mile  
The future isn't going anywhere  
  
I've been waiting such a long time, baby  
I've been waiting for the world to  
  
Burn the churches!  
Burn the banks!  
Burn the precincts!  
Burn City Hall!  
Burn the Court House!  
Burn the schools!  
Burn the prisons!  
Burn the shopping malls!  
  
Disrupting the orderly routine of the Institution  
Disrupting the orderly routine of the Institution  
  
Burn!  
Burn motherfucker  
Burn!  
Burn!  
Burn motherfucker  
Burn!  
Burn!  
Burn motherfucker  
Burn!  
Burn!  
Burn motherfucker  
Burn!  
  
Burn the churches!  
Burn the banks!  
Burn the precincts!  
Burn City Hall!  
Burn the Court House!  
Burn the schools!  
Burn the prisons!  
Burn the shopping malls!
