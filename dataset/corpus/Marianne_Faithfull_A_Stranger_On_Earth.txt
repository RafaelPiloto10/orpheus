Some fools don't know what's right from wrong  
But somehow those folks belong  
Me, I try for all I'm worth  
But I still remain a stranger on this earth  
  
Some people gloom, other folk cry  
Me, I have to struggle to keep alive  
Ever since the day of my birth  
I've been a stranger, stranger on this earth  
  
I try to be what all folks should  
Forgetting the bad and doing good  
But no matter how I try  
My troubles always multiply  
  
Now I've been doing the best I can  
Ever since life began  
Some day when I prove my worth  
I won't be a stranger on earth  
  
Now I've been living the best I can  
Ever since my life began  
The day's gonna come when I prove my worth  
And I won't be no stranger  
No, I won't be a stranger  
On this earth
