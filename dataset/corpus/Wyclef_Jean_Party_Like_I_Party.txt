Yo it's a lot a tension on this dance floor right now  
A lot a thugs  
A lot a thugettes  
A lot a sets  
A lot a projects  
A lot a hungry people  
I can't take this pressure no more  
I gotta scream for the people, man  
  
Ay  
Ay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To my killers in the club wit the burners that be screamin out blow  
Ain't no need to shoot tonight  
To my ladies that be shakin they ass to that Wyclef sound  
We gon get in crunk tonight  
To my ballers and my ballettes that be comin to the party high style  
y'all better watch y'all jewels tonight  
If you smoke like I smoke in your high life everyday  
I'm talkin bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday  
Yo you don't want to beef cause if I pull artillery  
You and your man'll be sorry  
Cause I ain't come for war  
I just came to dance  
So grab a shorty  
Let's party today  
You and I know that you can't win  
That's why you standin by the bouncer for protection  
Clef ain't the one for the testin  
You better off steppin before I clay your section  
Anyway  
Back to the girls that keep it movin  
Teflon keep it groovin  
We got you in the mood-n  
After the club we can take a ride  
I got this new G5 on dubs outside  
Yo you can call your crew and I can call my crew and we could do this every
weekend  
Cause if you party like I party dem niggas call 911 everyday  
I'm talkin bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you ain't from my hood you get robbed like every day  
I'm talkin bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday  
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, anyway  
Now the night is through girl what you want to do  
Like Bubba Sparxxx let's get ugly  
You and I know that you want this  
So tell your girls follow us in they Lexus  
Back to the Delano, the W, the Sheraton, the Mondrian  
It's the after party  
If you drink like I drink then you drunk like everyday  
I'm talkin bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday  
Ay yo, Clef, pass dem keys dog  
You toe down, baby
