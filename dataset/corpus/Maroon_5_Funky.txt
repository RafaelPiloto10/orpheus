Funky is the word,  
You're right,  
Or grow strong,  
Funky is the word.  
  
Oh, this is so funky,  
Funky in my heart,  
This girl is funky,  
The girl in my dreams cracks me up.  
  
Funky, oh that's the word,  
But Jane, do you really care how funky styles of your could be?  
Can you just see me lone-ly?  
Funky is the word you could only say.  
  
It's so funky,  
Jane, can't you see?  
You could be loved by any boy in the world,  
Funky, it's the word.  
  
The word is funky,  
The word is funky,  
Oh how a shame,  
It's too funky.
