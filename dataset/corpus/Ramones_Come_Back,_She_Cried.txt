I lied, I lied  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
I lied, I lied  
I tried, I tried  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
I lied...  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied, I lied  
Come back, come back, come back she cried  
I walked out, I walked out, I walked out  
Down the drain  
Of something else, I was in it  
So silly, so unfair, she stayed standing there  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied, I lied  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
I lied, I lied  
I tried, I tried  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied, I lied  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
I freaked out, I freaked out, I freaked out  
Is the water as high as it'll get  
Super wet, mom told me,  
Every chance I have seen  
Trying to get clean  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied, I lied  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
I lied, I lied  
I tried, I tried  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
I lied, I lied  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about [x6]
