[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Down to Earth  
Keep on falling when I know it hurts  
Going faster than a million miles an hour  
Trying to catch my breath some way, somehow  
Down to Earth  
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns  
Stuck in motion, but the wheels keep spinning 'round  
Moving in reverse with no way out  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne]  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
Two steps far from you  
When everybody wants you  
Everybody wants you  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
Eyes can't shine  
Unless there's something burning bright behind  
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine  
I feel myself running out of time  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
Two steps far from you  
When everybody wants you  
Everybody wants you  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity
