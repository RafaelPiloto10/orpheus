Those mighty wheels keep rollin' on  
On to that crazy place  
That still feels like home  
The world outside is rushing by  
It feels good to take that road  
Time after time  
  
I don't know how you feel  
My heart is beating fast  
It has been way too long  
But here I am I'm back  
  
It's good to know you're still around  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
You get my feet back on the ground  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
  
No regrets, well just a few  
You haven't lost a thing  
I'm still crazy for you  
  
I don't know how you feel  
Are you excited too  
It has been way too long  
Tonight I'm back with you  
  
It's good to know you're still around  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
You get my feet back on the ground  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
  
I've been no stranger  
To every corner of your heart  
Your dream still lives inside of me  
  
I don't know how you feel  
My heart is beating fast  
It has been way too long  
But here I am I'm back  
  
In my city, my town  
Deep in my heart, I'm so proud  
Of my city, my town  
I'll never, ever let you down  
  
It's good to know you're still around  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
You get my feet back on the ground  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
My city, my town
