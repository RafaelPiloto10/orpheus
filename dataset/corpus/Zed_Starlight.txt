It's alright  
It's Ok  
I'll keep holding on today  
'Cause I'm waiting for the starlight in your eyes  
  
No more faith  
No more hope  
All that I can do is grope  
For a shred of loving care from my girl  
  
The pain you felt has burdened you  
You can't feel loved  
I'm glad that I have been with you  
But that's not enough  
  
In your arms I would be  
Overjoyed as any boy  
Holding on to what he loves  
Oh so much  
  
Feel your touch every night  
When I dreamed to be alright  
There you are in front of me  
With your smile  
  
The pain you felt has burdened you  
You can't feel loved  
I'm glad that I have been with you  
But that's not enough  
Whoa, that's not enough  
  
The pain you felt has burdened you  
You can't feel loved  
I'm glad that I have been with you  
But that's not enough  
Whoa, that's not enough  
  
In your arms I would be  
Overjoyed as any boy  
Holding on to what he loves  
Oh so much  
  
Holding on to what he loves  
Oh so much  
  
Holding on to what he loves  
Oh so much
