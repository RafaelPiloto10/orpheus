Me and you, we're different  
Don't always see eye to eye  
You go left, and I go right  
And sometimes when we even fight  
That don't mean that I won't need a friend, oh  
You and me, we're in this till the end, oh  
  
I think we're on our our way  
Through all the lows and highs  
I need you by my side, singing  
I think we're on our way  
To better days, better days, oh  
Let's say we turn the page  
Move on from all the times  
Should've laughed, not cried, feeling  
What is there more to say? (say)  
I think that we're on our way  
  
Together, we'll weather  
Many storms as family  
That bond is forever  
It can take almost anything  
The love I feel for you grows everyday, yeah  
The more we get to learn from our mistakes, yeah, yeah  
  
I think we're on our our way  
Through all the lows and highs  
I need you by my side, singing  
I think we're on our way  
To better days, better days, oh  
Let's say we turn the page  
Move on from all the times  
Should've laughed, not cried, feeling (oh)  
What is there more to say? (say, yeah, yeah)  
I think that we are on our way  
  
Someday soon I'll need advice  
Hope you're there to shed some light  
And maybe one day you'll be wanting mine  
And we can (we can) be there be for each other  
  
I think we're on our way  
I think we're on our way (ha)  
I think we're on our way  
Let's say we turn the page  
Move on from all the times  
Should've laughed, not cried  
What is there more to say? (oh)  
I think that we're on our way  
I think we're on our way  
Through all the lows and highs  
I need you by my side, yeah  
  
I think we're on our way  
To better days, better days, yeah  
Let's say we turn the page  
Move on from all the times  
Should've laughed, not cried  
What is there more to say? (no more to say)  
I think that we are on our way  
  
Yeah  
Oh  
  
No more to say  
No more to say, yeah  
  
No more to say, ha
