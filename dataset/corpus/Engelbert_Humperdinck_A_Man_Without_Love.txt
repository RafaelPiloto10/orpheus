I can remember when we walked together  
Sharing a love I thought would last forever  
Moonlight to show the way so we can follow  
Waiting inside her eyes was my tomorrow  
Then something changed her mind, her kisses told me  
I had no lovin' arms to hold me  
  
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up  
Lonely is a man without love  
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love  
  
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up  
Knowing that it's cloudy above  
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love  
  
I cannot face this world that's fallen down on me  
So, if you see my girl, please send her home to me  
Tell her about my heart that's slowly dying  
Say I can't stop myself from crying  
  
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up  
Lonely is a man without love  
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love  
  
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up  
Knowing that it's cloudy above  
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love  
  
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up  
Lonely is a man without love  
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love
