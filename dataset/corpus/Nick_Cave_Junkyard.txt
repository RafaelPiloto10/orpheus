I am the King, I am the kind  
One dead marine through the hatch  
Scratch and scrape this heavenly body  
Every ince of winning skin  
There's garbage in honeys sack again  
Honey honey honey honey  
Come on and kiss me  
Honey honey honey  
Honey's child is taken over this place  
Two dead marines standing in line  
Drink to me! This heavenly body  
Every inch a winning thing  
Honey honey honey  
Hack hack hack hack this heavenly body  
Yack yack yack yack yack goes junk-face  
Scratch scape scratch this winning skin  
There's garbage in honey's sack again  
Garbage in honey garbage in honey  
Garbage in honey's sack again  
Garbage in honey  
Junkwayrd king junkyard king  
King king king
