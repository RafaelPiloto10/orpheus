Who knows how long I've loved you?  
You know I love you still  
I would wait a lonely life-time  
If you want me to, I will  
  
And if I ever met you  
I did not catch your name  
But it doesn't really matter  
Cause I love you all the same  
  
I will love you forever and forever  
Love you with all my heart  
Love you whenever were together  
Love you when were apart  
  
And now, at last, I've found you  
Your song will fill the air  
Sing it loud so I can hear you  
Make it easy to be near you  
Cause the things you do endear you to me  
Oh, you know I will,  
  
I will
