The High Street shops are boarded up  
An' the Terrace it is fenced in  
See-through shields are walled across  
The way that you came in  
But there's no need to get excited  
As the lorries bring the bacon in  
'Cos the housewives are all singing  
Groovy times are here again  
They discovered one black Saturday  
That mobs don't march they run  
So you can excuse the nervous triggerman  
Just this once for jumping the gun  
As they were picking up the dead  
Out of the broken glass  
Yes it's Number One, the radio said  
Groovy times have come to pass!  
Groovy times groovy times groovy times  
The intake is on the uptake  
The acceleration's pretty grim  
I can remember his first appearance  
Now look what's happened to him  
So they put him in a dog suit  
Like from 1964  
The King of Early Evening TV  
Groovy times forever more  
Groovy times
