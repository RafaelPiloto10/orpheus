I'm the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest  
But they won't take me  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
  
When the autumn wind blows  
They're already gone  
They flutter to the ground  
'Cause they can't hang on  
There's nothing in the world  
That I ain't seen  
I greet all the new ones that are coming in green  
  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest but they wont take me  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
  
They say I got staying power  
Here on the tree  
But I've been here since Eisenhower  
And I've out lived even he  
  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest but they won't take me  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
  
I fight off the snow  
I fight off the hail  
Nothing makes me go  
I'm like some vestigial tail  
I'll be here through eternity  
If you want to know how long  
If they cut down this tree  
I'll show up in a song  
  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest but they won't take me  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
I'm the last leaf on the tree
