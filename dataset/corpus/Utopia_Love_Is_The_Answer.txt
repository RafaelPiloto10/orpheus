Name your price  
A ticket to paradise  
I can't stay here any more  
And I've looked high and low  
I've been from shore to shore to shore  
If there's a short cut I'd have found it  
But there's no easy way around it  
  
Light of the world, shine on me  
Love is the answer  
Shine on us all, set us free  
Love is the answer  
  
Who knows why  
Someday we all must die  
We're all homeless boys and girls  
And we are never heard  
It's such a lonely world  
People turn their heads and walk on by  
Tell me, is it worth just another try?  
  
Tell me, are we alive, or just a dying planet?  
What are the chances?  
Ask the man in your heart for the answers  
  
And when you feel afraid, love one another  
When you've lost your way, love one another  
When you're all alone, love one another  
When you're far from home, love one another  
When you're down and out, love one another  
All your hope's run out, love one another  
When you need a friend, love one another  
When you're near the end, love one another  
We got to love one another  
  
Light of the world, you got to shine  
Love will be a means, yeah, yeah  
Shine on us all  
Know that love can save the day  
Just give it one more chance  
Lord you just can't let it stop lord  
Love is the answer  
Got to be free to let love into your life  
Let it shine
