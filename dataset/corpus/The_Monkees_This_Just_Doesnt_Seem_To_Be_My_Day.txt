I guess I should have stayed in bed,  
My pillow wrapped 'round my head.  
Instead of waking up to find  
A nightmare of a different kind.  
She went away,  
This just doesn't seem to be my day.  
  
She didn't have to say a lot,  
Her pretty eyes revealed the plot.  
'Twas someone else she want more,  
And so I walked her to the door.  
What can I say?  
This just doesn't seem to be my day.  
  
My, oh my, how sad am I.  
How I wish she would have stayed  
This just doesn't seem to be my day.  
  
My whole world is upside down,  
She turned my smile into a frown.  
It's such a pity the shape I'm in,  
I must get on my feet again.  
Can't stay this way  
This just doesn't seem to be my day.
