Stood in the dark, sat a man who beckoned him in,  
But leaving his grass was a sin, but he did.  
  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.  
He saw the light in the cellar reflect in his eyes,  
Yet early that morning was he to receive a surprise.  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.  
  
Said 'Are you leaving or are you receiving my friend,  
Doesn't need any money till then" and he did .  
He said "I'm the owner,not you, and this is my stead,  
So give it to me now I'm dead, and he did , said:  
  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.
