I was a good kid,  
I wouldn't do you no harm,  
I was a nice kid,  
With a nice paper round  
Forgive me any pain,  
I may have brung to you,  
With God's help I know,  
I'll always be near to you  
But Jesus hurt me,  
When he deserted me, but, I have forgiven you Jesus  
For all the desire,  
You placed in me when there's nothing I can do with this desire  
  
I was a good kid,  
Through hail and snow,  
I'd go just to moon you,  
I carried my heart in my hand  
Do you understand, do you understand  
  
But Jesus hurt me,  
When he deserted me, but, I have forgiven you Jesus  
For all of the love,  
You placed in me when there's no one I can turn to with this love  
  
Monday - humiliation,  
Tuesday - suffocation,  
Wednesday - condescension,  
Thursday - is pathetic  
By Friday life has killed me,  
By Friday life has killed me,  
Oh pretty one, oh pretty one  
  
Why did you give me so much desire,  
When there is nowhere I can go to offload this desire?  
And why did you give me so much love in a loveless world,  
When there is no one I can turn to  
To unlock all this love?  
And why did you stick in self deprecating bones and skin?,  
Jesus do you hate me?  
Why did you stick in self deprecating bones and skin?  
Do you hate me?, Do you hate me?, Do you hate me?, Do you hate me?, Do you
hate me?
