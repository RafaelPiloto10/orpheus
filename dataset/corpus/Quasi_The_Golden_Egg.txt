Shoot yourself in the leg  
And the goose lays the golden egg  
I had that golden egg before  
But it disappeared as I limped out the door  
  
Never reveal that you know  
That the whole thing is just for show  
A cardboard world with painted skies  
'Cause we all must agree to believe in the lies  
  
Bring yourself down to your knees  
And they'll give you the golden keys  
The keys will open any lock  
To an empty room or a Chinese box  
  
I can't forget how I feel  
And pretend that it's all for real  
The pot won't call the kettle black  
And I don't even feel the knife in my back.  
  
When we go off to our beds  
After struggling for our bread  
A pleasant dream may stand instead  
Of the clamor and noise that goes on in your head  
  
So carry on like before  
And don't listen to me anymore  
Don't believe a word I say  
'Cause it's only a song and it don't mean a thing
