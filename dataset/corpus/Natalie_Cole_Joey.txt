Joey---, joey----  
Joey, where are you going  
Where will you sleep tonight  
Will you be alright  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Joey, I really love you  
Won?t you make here your home so you?ll never live alone anymore, oh  
We both took a ride on that merry-go-round  
We?ve seen a lot of faces of the same ole? clowns  
But let?s not be a part of that continuous game  
Let?s start a new life that will never change  
Joey, where are you going  
Won?t you take me along, your place is my home  
Joey---, hoo, hoo  
There?s no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  
True fortunes are deeper than the world is old so  
We?ve got to dig up and plant love again  
Just don?t let it vanish, no  
And you settle  
My joey, where are you going, where are you going  
Dont, don?t, don?t go, joey, joey, joey, joey  
Don?t you hear me calling, don?t you hear me calling to you  
Joey, joey, joey, joey, joey, joey, joey, joey, joey  
Hoo, don?t you hear me calling to you, joey, joey, joey  
Don?t leave me alone, I wanna be with you  
I wanna go with you, I wanna be with you, joey, joey, joey
