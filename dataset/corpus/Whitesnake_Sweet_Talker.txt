I can tell by way you walk,  
You give it all away  
By the sweet way that you talk, yes you do  
  
You got long legs, a black girl sway,  
The way you shake your booty  
Gives your schoolgirl game away, yes it does  
  
You're just a sweet talker, bad daughter,  
An' you've just begun  
The bitch is in heat,  
So you better run  
  
I know you know  
You got what it takes,  
You got the fever,  
But, you give me the shakes, yes you do  
  
Straight out of Lolita  
With nothing to lose,  
When I got your number  
My juke box blew a fuse, yes it did  
  
You're just sweet talker, bad daughter,  
An' you've just begun  
The bitch is in heat,  
So you better run, you better run,  
So you better run, you better run  
Or you better hide  
  
Sweet talker, bad daughter,  
You've just begun  
The bitch is in heat  
So you better run, you better run,  
You better run, you better run,  
Or you better hide  
  
I can tell by way you walk,  
You give it all away  
By the sweet way that you talk, yes you do  
  
You got long legs, a black girl sway,  
The way you shake your booty  
Gives your schoolgirl game away, yes it does  
  
You're just a sweet talker, bad daughter,  
An' you've just begun  
Sweet talker, bad daughter,  
An' you've just begun  
The bitch is in heat,  
So you better run
