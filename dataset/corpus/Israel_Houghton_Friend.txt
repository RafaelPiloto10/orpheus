Chorus  
Friend, there will never be a friend  
As dear to me as You  
There will be another closer than a brother  
Friend, always worth the wait  
Faithful as the day You say we are friend  
Oh...  
  
Verse  
You know all about me  
The good and the bad  
The moment I rise and fall  
You see my beginning  
You stand at the end  
And yet You remain faithful to say I'm your friend  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse  
You know all about me  
The good and the bad  
You know when I rise and fall  
You see my beginning  
You stand at the end  
And yet You remain faithful to say I'm your friend  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Every time You call  
I receive Your healing  
Every time You call me friend  
  
Chorus
