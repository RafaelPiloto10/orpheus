Oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
I was there to match my intellect on national TV  
Against a plumber, oh, and an architect, both with a PhD  
I was tense, I was nervous, I guess it just wasn't my night  
Art Fleming gave the answers  
Oh, but I couldn't get the questions right, aight, aight  
  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
  
Well, I knew I was in trouble now  
My hope of winning sank  
Oh, 'cause I got the Daily Double now  
And then my mind went blank  
I took Potpourri for one hundred  
And then my head started to spin  
Well, I'm givin' up Don Pardo  
Just tell me now what I didn't win, yeah, yeah  
  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
  
That's right, Al You lost. And let me tell you what you didn't win: a twenty
column set of the Encyclopedia International, a case of Turtle Wax, and a
year's supply of Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco Treat. But that's not all. You
also made yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people. You
brought shame and disgrace to your family name for generations to come. You
don't get to come back tomorrow. You don't even get a lousy copy of our home
game. You're a complete loser!  
  
Don't know what I was thinkin' of  
I guess I just wasn't too bright  
Well, I sure hope I do better  
Next weekend on The Price Is Right, aight, aight  
  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby (oh)  
I lost on Jeopardy, baby
