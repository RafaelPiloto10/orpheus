Travis McGee's still in Cedar Key  
That's what John McDonald said  
My rendezvous so long overdue  
With all of the things I've sung and read  
They still apply to me, they all make sense in time  
  
Chorus  
But now I'm incommunicado  
Driving by myself down the road with a hole in it  
Songs with no vibrato  
Takin' the long way home  
  
Now on the day that John Wayne died  
I found myself on the continental divide  
Tell me where do we go from here?  
Think I'll ride into Leadville and have a few beers  
Think of "Red River","Liberty Valence" can't believe the old man's gone  
  
Chorus  
But now he's incommunicado  
Leaving such a hole in a world that believed  
That a life with such bravado  
Was taking the right way home  
  
So when I finished the last line  
I put the book by itself on the shelf  
With my heart in it  
Never wasting time takin' the right way home  
I know you're never wastin' time  
Findin' the right way home  
  
Still I am incommunicado  
Livin' next door to a leg with a pin in it  
Never wastin' time, takin' the right way home  
(Repeat)
