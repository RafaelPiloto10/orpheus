You mercy taught us how to dance  
To celebrate with all we have  
And we'll dance to thank You for mercy  
Your glory taught us how to shout  
To lift Your name in all the earth  
And we'll shout to the praise of Your glory  
It's the overflow of a forgiven soul  
And now we've seen You, God  
Our hearts cannot stay silent  
And we'll be a dancing generation  
Dancing because of Your great mercy, Lord  
Your great mercy, Lord  
And we'll be a shouting generation  
Shouting because of Your great glory, Lord  
Your great glory, Lord
