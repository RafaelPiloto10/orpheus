Let the color all drain out  
And won't you draw the curtain down on me  
A silence never spoke so loud  
And it's what I need  
So let me be  
With my disease  
  
And I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Cause I've realized I can't rely on you  
For what I need  
Yeah I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
I ain't got no shelter from this storm  
  
On market street cars all stand still  
And this city is so beautiful tonight  
I'll drink you up to get my fill  
But I don't believe  
It's come to these  
So naturally  
  
And I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Because I've realized I can't rely on you  
For what I need  
Yeah I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Cause I ain't got no shelter from this storm  
  
And into this mind and body I was born  
And I've realized by now that I have lost control  
But I'll be okay  
Yeah I'll be okay  
  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Because I've realized I can't rely on you  
For what I need  
Yeah I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Cause I ain't got no shelter from this storm  
  
So rain on me  
Yeah, yeah  
So rain on me  
Yeah, yeah  
So rain on me  
Yeah, yeah  
The rain on me
