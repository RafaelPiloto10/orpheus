Keep your promise, Willie Thomas  
We pledged our love one day beneath the whispering maple tree  
You made a promise, Willie Thomas  
That all the leaves would still be green when you returned to me  
  
But my heart is chilled and my eyes are filled  
As I watch the leaves of red and brown fall sadly to the ground  
You must keep your promise, Willie Thomas  
There'll be on spring until you bring your love again to me  
  
I shall keep my promise, Willie Thomas  
I pledged my love to you beneath the whispering maple tree  
So, I'll keep my promise, Willie Thomas  
Though all the leaves might not be green when I return to thee  
  
Let your heart not be chilled nor your eyes be filled  
'Cause I love you though you say the leaves are falling slowly down  
So, I'll keep my promise, Willie Thomas  
And there'll be spring because with the birds I'll sing  
My love again to you  
  
Keep your promise, Willie Thomas
