"A Situation"  
  
Well I live here with you  
In, in a kind of "yes, will do"  
Oh what part of now don't you understand  
I'm showing you well apparent  
Yeah I get the bluff if I'll get out  
No room for three, you, me and your doubts  
One of us has got to leave  
And it sure will be me  
  
And I think we could have a situation  
We could have a situation  
  
Any reason we can't just settle around now  
Yeah, ok, and how?  
Rather than shout and praise  
Adjust with them, not without friends  
Oh, what part of our old tune don't you understand  
I think I made it clear that you're in the mend  
In the mend  
  
Oh, we could have a situation  
Oh, we could have a situation
