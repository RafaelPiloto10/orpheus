It was a Friday morning, I was really boring  
I wish it was night, a struggle and a fight  
When I saw her there was a good affair  
She's so nice, she's so cool, I don't think she's a fool  
When I saw her last time, was a day at school  
But at school it isn't fine, yeah the school isn't cool  
I was drunken that night, without thinking about  
I was really gone 'cause we had much fun  
  
Without thinking about, I went go more far  
I was really almost, knocked down by a car  
  
Chorus 2X:  
I would take her, I would find her, she's my target  
The way I want her, and her money, that's sounds funny  
  
I hope her friends like me, or do they hate me  
My friends don't like her, but I really don't care  
She is more important, than my stupid friends  
They can say what they want to, ''just do what you want to! ''  
When I saw her last time, was a day at school  
But at school it isn't fine, yeah the school isn't cool  
I was drunken that night, without thinking about  
I was really gone 'cause we had much fun  
  
Without thinking about, I went go more far  
I was really almost, knocked down by a car  
  
Chorus 4X
