Where's that diamond ring you promised?  
My fingers looking bare  
Where's that valentine, be honest,  
The postman didn't bring it here  
The thing I wasn't looking for  
I found in your bedroom drawer  
The letter that you loved her better,  
Made me want you even, more  
  
And too much love's not good for you  
Your heart can get too full  
And too much love's an iou  
And if I give you that, you'll  
Send me the blues.  
  
Ooohhhh, yeah  
  
Where is all that time you promised?  
The first hand's on the three  
Where's the second hand, I'm bothered  
To see it stroking on her knee  
The thing I wasn't looking for  
I found in your bedroom drawer  
The letter that you loved her better,  
Made me want you even, more  
  
Chorus
