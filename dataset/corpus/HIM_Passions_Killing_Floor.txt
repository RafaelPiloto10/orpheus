It's poetry carved in flesh  
This beautiful hell of ours  
To the deadliest sin we confess  
(Tears of joy fill our eyes)  
We are safe where disfigured saints  
Cry out their prophecies of doom  
  
My heart's a graveyard, baby  
And to evil we make love  
On our passion's killing floor  
In my arms, you won't sleep safely  
And of lust we are reborn  
On our passion's killing floor  
  
At the first kiss  
the seeds of hatred are sown  
Back into darkness we flee  
(To tear our hearts out)  
We are saved where all faiths fail  
Alive inside of our tomb  
  
My heart's a graveyard, baby  
And to evil we make love  
On our passion's killing floor  
In my arms, you won't sleep safely  
And of lust we are reborn  
On our passion's killing floor  
  
My heart's a graveyard, baby  
And to evil we make love  
On our passion's killing floor  
In my arms, you won't sleep safely  
And of lust we are reborn  
On our passion's killing floor  
  
(My heart's a graveyard, baby)  
My heart's a graveyard, baby  
On our passion's killing floor  
  
(In my arms, you won't sleep safely)  
And to evil we make love  
On our passion's killing floor  
  
Forever more
