It was one fine March morning, I bid New Orleans Adieu  
And I took the road to Jackson Town, my fortune to renew  
I cursed all foreign money, no credit could I gain  
Which filled my heart with a longing for, the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
I stepped on board of a railroad car beneath the morning sun  
I rode the rods till evening and I laid me down again  
All strangers there no friends to me 'til a dark girl towards me came  
And I fell in love with the Creole Girl, by the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
I said "Me pretty Creole Girl, me money here's no good,  
If it weren't for the alligators, I'd sleep out there in the wood"  
"You're welcome here kind stranger, Our house is very plain"  
"But we never turned a stranger out, by the Lakes of Ponchartrain"  
  
She took me into her mammy's house and treated me right well  
The hair upon her shoulders in jet black ringlets fell  
To try and paint here beauty, I'm sure 'twould be in vain  
So handsome was my Creole girl by the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
I asked her if she'd marry me, she said that ne'er could be  
For she had got a lover and he was far at sea  
She said that she would wait for him and true she would remain  
Till he'd return to his Creole girl, on the Lakes of Ponchartrain  
  
It's fare thee well, me Creole girl, I'll never see you more  
I'll never forget your kindness in the cottage by the shore  
And at each social gathering, a flowing bowl I'll drain  
And I'll drink a health to my Creole girl, by the Lakes of Ponchartrain
