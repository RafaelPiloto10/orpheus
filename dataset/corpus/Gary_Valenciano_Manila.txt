I keep coming back to Manila  
Simply no place like Manila  
Manila, I'm coming home  
  
I walked the streets of San Francisco  
I've tried the rides in Disneyland  
Dated a million girls in Sydney  
Somehow I feel like I don't belong  
  
Hinahanap hanap kita Manila  
Ang ingay mong kay sarap sa tenga  
Mga jeepney mong nagliliparan  
Mga babae mong naggagandahan  
Take me back in your arms Manila  
And promise me you'll never let go  
Promise me you'll never let go  
  
Manila, Manila  
Miss you like hell, Manila  
No place in the world like Manila  
I'm coming here to stay
