Give me release  
Witness me  
I am outside  
Give me peace  
  
Heaven holds a sense of wonder  
And I wanted to believe  
That I'd get caught up  
When the rage in me subsides  
  
In this white wave  
I am sinking  
In this silence  
In this white wave  
In this silence  
I believe  
  
Passion chokes the flower  
'til she cries no more  
Possessing all the beauty  
Hungry still for more  
  
Heaven holds a sense of wonder  
  
I can't help this longing  
Comfort me  
I can't hold it all in  
If you won't let me  
  
Heaven holds a sense of wonder  
  
In this white wave  
I am sinking  
In this silence  
In this white wave  
In this silence  
I believe  
  
I have seen you  
In this white wave  
You are silent  
You are breathing  
In this white wave  
I am free
