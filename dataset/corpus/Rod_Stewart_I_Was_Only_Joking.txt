Ever since I was a kid in school  
I messed around with all the rules  
Apologized, then realized  
I'm not different after all  
  
Me and the boys thought we had is sussed  
Valentino's all of us  
My dad said we looked ridiculous  
But, boy, we broke some hearts  
  
In and out of jobs, running free  
Waging war with society  
Dumb, blank faces stared back at me  
But nothing ever changed  
  
Promises made in the heat of night  
Creepin' home before it got too light  
I wasted all that precious time  
And blamed it on the wine  
  
I was only joking, my dear  
Looking for a way to hide my fear  
What kind of fool was I?  
I could never win  
  
Never found a compromise  
Collected lovers like butterflies  
Illusions of that grand first prize  
Are slowly wearin' thin  
Susie, baby, you were good to me  
Giving love unselfishly  
But you took it all too seriously  
I guess it had to end  
  
I was only joking, my dear  
Looking for a way to hide my fear  
What kind of fool was I?  
I could never win  
  
Now you ask me if I'm sincere  
That's the question that I always fear  
Verse seven is never clear  
But I'll tell you what you want to hear  
I try to give you all you want  
But giving love is not my strongest point  
If that's the case, it's pointless going on  
I'd rather be alone  
  
'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong  
Pouring my heart out in a song  
Owning up for prosperity  
For the whole damn world to see  
  
Quietly now while I turn a page  
Act one is over without costume change  
The principal would like to leave the stage  
The crowd don't understand
