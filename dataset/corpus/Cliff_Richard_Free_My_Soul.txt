I took your name you took my number  
Look me up if you're in my town  
You made a friend be sure of that  
Let me know if you're free come down  
You're making plans-things you'll do  
Said I'll be someone I'm telling you  
  
I'm gonna leave this town play me some rock'n'roll  
I'm gonna find myself I'm gonna free my soul  
  
We took a walk out in the grey  
You didn't speak but had much to say  
Don't talk too loud walls have ears  
Criticise and you'll disappear  
A souvenir from where you've gone  
A pair of jeans or some chewing gum  
  
I'm gonna leave this town play me some rock'n'roll  
I'm gonna find myself I'm gonna free my soul  
They built the wall until they had something to hide  
To keep me out or is it to keep you inside  
  
I'm gonna free me...
