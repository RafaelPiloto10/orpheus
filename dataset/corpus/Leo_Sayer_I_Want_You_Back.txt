You know I thought I could live without you  
I thought I could get along  
But I never realized that I could be so wrong  
Was I a fool to leave you  
Or was I a fool to let you go  
Doesn't seem to matter much now baby  
I should have never let you go  
I want you back  
I want you back  
And I will never stop until I got you back  
I wander the road where we used to walk  
And lots of people pass by  
They all look like they're in love  
Everybody but me  
I see your face in the crowd  
I hear your voice everywhere I go  
And when I turn around thinking you've come back  
Ah, you're never, never, never there  
I want you back  
I want you back  
And I'll keep on searchin' until you're really here  
I want you back  
I want you back  
And I'll never stop until I get you back  
Back in my arms to stay[Solo]  
I want you back  
I want you back  
And I will never stop until I know I've got  
You back in my heart to stay
