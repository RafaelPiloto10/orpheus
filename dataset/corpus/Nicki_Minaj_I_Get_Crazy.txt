I just came out of the mutherfuckin old school  
Got my mac notebook with the pro tools  
Yaeh bitches ain't ready for nicki lewinsky  
Bad woof woof flyer then a frisbee  
So I'm' up in mid-la eating mangos  
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals  
Got some bangles all over my ankles  
Such a star they say I'm' a star spangle  
Buh buh buh buh buh banner I am the rap Hannah  
Mah mon Montana so fix your antenna  
I keep three hoes, but don't call me santa  
And I am flyer then reindeer in the winter (in the winter)  
  
I get crazy, I get crazy  
I get crazy, I get crazy  
I I get crazy  
I get crazy,I get crazy  
I get crazy,I get crazy  
  
So I got a bad bitch mentality  
'Cause I just came from another galaxy  
I be with the president up in the white house  
If we in the oval office then the lights out  
'Cause I am the wicked witch I'm' the nickster  
And I keep a bad bitch on my jickster  
But I leave her in a second for a thicker  
Rockstar little mama with a guitar  
I am Nicki EL.EM.EN.OH.winsky  
I mean my name ring bells like tinky  
I mean tinker, tell that niqga link her  
'Cause I'm' looking for some good brains from a thinker  
  
I get crazy,  
I get crazy,  
I get crazy,  
I I get crazy,  
I get crazy  
I get crazy,  
I get crazy,  
I get crazy,  
I get crazy,  
  
1, 2, 3rd floor hospital bound  
Niqgas is doors and I knock niqgas down  
Straight jacket crooked, I hear you lookin  
I promise I'm' hard, and I swear you pussy  
I ain't crazy, no yes I am  
Right up in the coo-coo nest I land  
I'm' fly now eat mah bird shit  
Yeah I'm' crazy, I'm' crazy bout' your bitch  
Wild animal on mah bewildered shirt  
I love brain so I'm' looking for a nerd bitch  
It's' Nicki Minaj, the superb witch  
And weezy f. baby, no weezy f. crazy
