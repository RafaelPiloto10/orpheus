Ride swift across the plain  
Don't you turn back, keep heed in your flame  
Kings with no mercy, this planet at war  
Torn from enchantment, this land forevermore  
  
Born from obsession, you cried death for light  
You saw things before and after you died  
Back from beyond to rule again  
But this life denies you its fight to the end  
  
Back from the dawn  
Deliver us right from wrong  
Kings forge the way  
For your last day  
  
You search the eyes of those  
Who fear the law  
Dark and light we all must keep the balance strong  
One day a king will rise with the sun  
The moon, and the stars  
And you are he and you must die, to be  
Born again, come again, once more be again the king  
  
Back from the dawn  
Deliver us right from wrong  
Kings forge the way  
For your last day
