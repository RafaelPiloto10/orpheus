Well, lawdy, lawdy, lawdy Miss Clawdy  
Well, you sure look good to me  
Well, please don't excite me, baby  
You know I can't be free  
Well, I give you all my money  
But you just don't treat me right  
You like to ball every morning  
Don't come home til late at night  
  
I'm gonna tell, tell your mama  
What you been doing to me  
Well, please don't excite me, baby  
I'm in misery  
  
Oh, come on  
  
Well, a-bye, bye, bye, baby  
You won't see me now more  
Well, bye little darling  
Down the road I go  
Down the road I go  
Down the road I go
