House of fire  
House of fire, yeah  
Let's build a house of fire, baby  
Not one of wood or stone  
Walk through my door of desire, baby  
Come on in and make it your home  
Don't need a window to watch you, baby  
Don't need no roof overhead  
Don't need no key to unlock ya, baby  
I'll use my lovin' instead  
I won't tire  
Take me higher  
  
Building a house of fire, baby  
Buildin' it with our love  
We are buildin' a house of fire every time we touch  
House of fire  
House of fire  
  
We ain't gotta pay rent now, baby  
No landlord to throw us out  
I want to play in your garden, baby  
When you want to give me a shout  
I won't tire  
Take me higher  
  
Building a house of fire, baby  
Buildin' it with our love  
We are buildin' a house of fire every time we touch  
We are building this house together, baby  
Standing on solid ground  
We are building a house of fire that you can't tear down  
  
Brick by brick the flames get higher  
Build it strong with our desire  
  
Building a house of fire, baby  
Building it with our love  
We are building a house of fire every time we touch  
Baby we are..  
We are building this house together, baby  
Standing on solid ground  
We are building a house of fire that you can't tear down  
Building a house of fire, baby  
Building it with our love  
We are building a house of fire every time we touch  
We are building this house together baby  
Staning on solid ground  
we are building a house of fire that you can't burn down
