She lives in a house  
That reflects her state of mind, mind  
Organized chaos  
In this labyrinth she hides, hides  
  
She got locked up years ago  
All these voices whisper  
All these voices whisper  
Whisper and whisper  
And day after day  
Marinated in wine and tobacco  
All these voices whisper  
All these voices whisper  
Whisper and whisper  
And day after day  
After day  
  
Pink fluffy dinosaurs  
Are almost back in town, town  
Pulling all the strings  
That will finally bring her down, down  
  
She got locked up years ago  
All these voices whisper  
All these voices whisper  
Whisper and whisper  
And day after day  
Marinated in wine and tobacco  
All these voices whisper  
All these voices whisper  
Whisper and whisper  
And day after day  
After day  
After day  
After day
