Open my mind let me find new vibrations  
Tell me the way I must take to reach my destination  
And a place where I can stay  
Where is the love of my life couldn't find her  
Show me the way to find myself  
'Cause I'm nowhere in the darkness of these days  
  
Is there anybody there who feels that vibration  
Who shows me the way to my love  
Is there anybody there with that inclination  
To bring back to sun to my heart  
  
I find myself in a state of confusion  
Life's like a pantomime trick or a laser illusion  
Where's a place that I can stay  
Save me don't let me get lost in the ocean  
I need your help everyday to control my emotions  
In the darkness of these days  
  
Is there anybody there who feels that vibration  
Who shows me the way to my love  
Is there anybody there with that inclination  
To bring back the sun to my heart
