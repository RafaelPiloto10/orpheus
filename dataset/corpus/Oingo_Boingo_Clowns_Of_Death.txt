I'm the one who preys upon the weakest  
And the weakest always preys upon the one who's underneath  
I'm the one who doesn't see the waves of human kindness or the tides that  
Turn the day  
I'm the one who always turns and looks away  
Turns and looks away  
[chorus 1]  
Because after all, we are only boys  
Because after all, we are only boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
I'm the one treads upon the weaker ones  
Those that I can find  
And there'll always be some others who could march along in line, yeah  
March along in line  
And, we'll move upon the world in a massive tidal wave  
And we'll shout and make some noise, yeah  
Shout and make some noise  
[chorus 1]  
[chorus 2]  
The clowns of death are marching on their hideous parade  
Their glaring eyes are filled with hate, but I am not afraid  
Their painted faces cracked with age, their makeup old and worn  
With tattered wings and toothy grins to amplify their scorn  
They're looking for the helpless ones  
They're looking for the misbegotten  
They prey upon the weak and fractured  
The crippled and the freaks of nature  
And when the come upon one who's lost or is alone  
Their smiles get even bigger and their noses start to glow  
Making snarling sounds to pantomime with furious abandon  
And with a scream they pounce to kill and all the while they're laughing  
I'm the one treads upon the weaker ones  
Those that I can find  
And there'll always be some others who will march along in line  
And, we'll move upon the world in a massive tidal wave  
And we'll shout and make some noise, yeah  
Shout and make some noise  
[chorus 1]  
[chorus 2]  
Your sons and daughters, innocent, lay sleeping in their beds  
They'll catch them when you're not around and smash their little heads  
If you think it just a dream, or that it isn't fair  
Just look around outside your door, the clowns are everywhere
