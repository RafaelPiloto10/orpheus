Forget about it  
I'm admittin' I was wrong  
And I'll just take what's mine  
And walk right out the door  
  
Forget about it  
I'll split and I'll be gone  
And you'll have memories  
You'll find hard to ignore  
  
'Cause after all  
I'll see you sometime maybe  
When I can't recall  
How you drove me crazy  
Forget about it  
When forever's over  
I won't remember how much  
I loved you anymore  
  
Forget about it  
Put me out of your head  
Now that you're free and easy  
Out there on the town  
Forget about it  
When you're lying in bed  
Just wishing I was there to lay you down  
  
'Cause after all  
I'll see you sometime maybe  
When you will recall  
How I drove you crazier  
Forget about those stars in your eyes  
Laying by the fireside  
Holding you tight  
I can't remember when I felt so right  
So just forget about it  
  
Forget about it  
When you see me on the street  
Don't wink, don't wave  
Don't try to tease me with your smile  
Forget about it  
If we chance to meet somewhere  
Don't think it's 'cause I'm trying to reconcile  
  
'Cause after all  
I'll see you sometime maybe  
When I can't recall how you drove me crazier  
Forget about those stars in your eyes  
Laying by the fireside  
Holding you tight  
I can't remember when I felt so right  
So just forget about it
