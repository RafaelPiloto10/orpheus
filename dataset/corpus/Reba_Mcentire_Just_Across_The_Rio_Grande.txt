The lights of Laredo dance on the water  
And shine in a young man's eyes.  
Who stand on the border and dreams of paradise.  
He's heard crazy stories of how people live over in the promised land.  
He heard they eat three meals a day, just across the Rio Grande.  
He's got a wife named Maria, and a baby  
Named Rose, and another one to feed on the way.  
Two willing hands, that couldn't find work today.  
He stares at the river and curses the future,  
That he can't understand.  
He knows the child would have a chance, just  
Across the Rio Grande.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's only a river,  
That's not so deep or wide.  
A boy can throw a stone across and  
Reach the other side. It's just some  
Muddy water, cutting through the land.  
But a man can make a dream come true  
Just across the Rio Grande.  
  
The lights of Laredo dance on the water and  
Shine in a young man's eyes. Who stand on the  
Border and dreams of paradise.  
He's heard crazy stories of how good life is  
Over in the promised land, and  
Sometimes it seems like God must live just  
Across the Rio Grande.  
  
[Chorus]
