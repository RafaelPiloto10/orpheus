Why, why, why won't you sympathize  
And tell me where you're coming from?  
My, my, my, don't you realize  
We're not lovin' when there's something wrong?  
  
Come here mama, let me make it right  
I know that we can work it out  
No sense talkin' 'bout a love gone bad  
  
You got to hold on, hold on baby  
Hold on, hold on baby  
You got to hold on, hold on baby  
You got to hold on  
  
Why, why is it always something new?  
Baby, I'm just dyin' to please  
Cry, cry, cry when you're singin' the blues  
I'm just bringin' my sympathies  
  
Hey, little mama won't you change your mind?  
Don't go running away  
Please come home where you know you belong  
  
You got to hold on, hold on baby  
Hold on, hold on baby  
You got to hold on, hold on baby  
You got to hold on  
  
And I know when the feeling gets you  
It's gonna get you  
And I know where it's gonna get you  
Right there in the back of your mind  
  
And I know when the feeling gets you  
I won't forget you  
Yes, you know that I won't forget you  
Got too much on my mind  
  
And I know when the feeling hits you  
It's gonna hit you  
Yes I know where it's gonna hit you  
Right there in the back of your mind  
  
I know when the feeling hits you  
I'll never quit you  
Yes, you know that I'll never quit you  
Got too much on the line  
  
And I know when the feeling get you  
It's gonna get you  
And I know where it's gonna get you  
Right there in the back of your mind  
  
I know when the feeling gets you  
I won't forget you  
Yes, you know that I won't forget you  
Got too much on my mind  
  
And I know when the feeling hits you  
It's gonna hit you  
Yes I know where it's gonna hit you  
Right there in the back of your mind  
  
I know when the feeling hits you  
I'll never quit you  
Yes, you know that I'll never quit you  
Got too much on the line  
  
You got to hold on, hold on, baby  
Hold on, hold on, baby  
Got to hold on, hold on baby  
Got to hold on, hold on baby
