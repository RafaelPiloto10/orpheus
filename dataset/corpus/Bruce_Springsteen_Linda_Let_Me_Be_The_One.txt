The midnight boys are outside  
Scraping tears up off the street  
Standin' guard beneath the window  
Where only Linda sleeps  
The leader is a kid named Eddie  
Walkin' like an angel in defeat  
He trashes her old man's car, slashes Linda's name in the street  
And calls out  
  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
  
In a room full of contenders  
Eddy spars 'til he drops to his bed and surrenders Draped in the scarves  
He stole from Linda's bedroom  
The night he laid at her feet  
When the midnight boys were stranded  
Down on Cason Street  
  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
  
In the basement of St Mary's  
Eddy hides from the rain  
In with the stolen sisters 'til the streets are dry again  
Talkin' fast cars and spare parts  
Empty homes and hearts  
Distant worlds with strange girls  
And kneeling with Linda in the dark  
  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one  
Linda will you let me be the one
