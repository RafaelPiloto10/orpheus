He sits with the guitar on his knee thinking of love that he's had  
If it makes a sound he writes it down he's a songwriter  
He's trying to paint little pictures of mountains  
Turn little teardrops into mighty fountains he's a songwriter  
He smiles at the good lines frown at the bad lines  
Cries with the sad parts rewrites the bad parts he's a songwriter  
He looks through the window of life some people think he's a joke  
But who can tell the thing might sell he's a songwriter  
He's trying to paint...  
Thank you for hearing my tune now I'll get out of your room  
It's late you know I've got to go I'm a songwriter mhm mhm
