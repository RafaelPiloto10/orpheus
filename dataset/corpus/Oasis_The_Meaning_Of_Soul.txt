I gotta show you 'bout the meaning of soul, I'm taking a love tonight.  
Get outta my way, I did what you say, but that ain't enough alright.  
I'm different bleach and an Armarni elite, I'm ten outta ten all night.  
Get outta my way, I did what you say, but that ain't enough alright.  
  
All rise, I see the love in your eyes.  
If it's all right, then I'll be your light.
