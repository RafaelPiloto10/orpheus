All right,  
Wild child full of grace  
Savior of the human race,  
Your cool face  
Natural child, terrible child  
Not your mother's or your father's child  
Your our child, screamin' wild  
An ancient rulage of grains,  
And the trees of the night  
Ha, ha, ha, ha  
With hunger at her heels,  
Freedom in her eyes  
She dances on her knees,  
Pirate prince at her side  
Stirrin' into a hollow idols eyes  
Wild child full of grace,  
Savior of the human race  
Your cool face,  
Your cool face,  
Your cool face  
Do you remember when we were in Africa?
