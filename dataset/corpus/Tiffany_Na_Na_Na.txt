Na na na  
You're in my head  
I can't believe I ever let you go  
But here you are  
You're with me everywhere I go  
Like a song  
I can't stop singin when the music ends  
Na na na  
I know exactly how it goes  
And it goes  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet  
I'm in so deep  
I can't believe that this is happening  
I feel the rush  
Whenever you are close to me  
In all my life  
I never thought I'd hear a song so sweet  
And I will never  
Ever lose this melody  
And it goes  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet  
Now I found you  
I won't never ever let you go  
We'll be together  
Now for all eternity  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and there you are  
I breathe the words  
And hear a simple melody  
And it goes  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet...
