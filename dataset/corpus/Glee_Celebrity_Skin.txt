Oh make me over  
I'm all I wanna be  
A walking study  
In Demonology  
  
Hey, so glad you could make it  
Yeah, now you've really made it  
Hey, so glad you can make it now  
  
Oh look at my face  
My name is might have been  
  
My name is never was  
My name's forgotten  
  
Hey, so glad you could make it  
Yeah, now you've really made it  
Hey, there's only us left now  
  
When I wake up (in my makeup)  
It's too early for that dress  
Wilted and faded (somewhere in Hollywood)  
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh  
  
No second billing cause you're a star now  
Oh Cinderella, they aren't sluts like you  
  
Beautiful garbage, beautiful dresses  
Can you stand up or will you just fall down?  
  
You better watch out  
Oh what you wish for  
It better be worth it  
So much to die for  
  
Hey, so glad you could make it  
Yeah, now you've really made it  
Hey, there's only us left now  
  
When I wake up (in my makeup)  
Have you ever felt (so used up as this?)  
  
It's all so sugarless  
(Hooker, waitress)  
Model, actress  
(Oh just go nameless)  
  
Honeysuckle  
She's full of poison  
She obliterated everything she kissed  
  
Now she's fading somewhere in Hollywood  
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh  
  
You want a part of me  
Well I'm not selling cheap  
No, I'm not selling cheap
