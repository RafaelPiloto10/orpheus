After all this time, I still miss you everyday  
The same world spins around  
I guess some things never change  
  
Sometimes I go out, but it never feels the same  
I still look for you  
Baby some things never change  
  
When I said I'd love you for eternity  
I just never knew how true those words would be  
  
Just an old love song, just the mention of your name  
My heart breaks in two again  
I guess some things never change  
  
Maybe someday, someone else will set me free  
Until then, I'll live with your love's legacy  
  
And I'll keep holding on  
Hoping you'll come back someday  
You can rest assured baby, some things never change  
  
Girl, I'm still in love with you, I guess  
Some things never change
