You said before me met  
That your life was awful tame  
Well, I took you to a night club  
And the whole band knew your name. oh,  
  
Well, baby, baby, baby  
I've got news for you  
Oh, somehow your story don't ring true,  
Well, I've got news for you.  
  
Well, you phoned me you'd be late  
Cause you took the wrong express  
And then you walked in smiling  
With your lipstick all a mess  
  
Oh, let me say to you little mama,  
Whoa, I've got news for you  
Ah, your story don't ring true lil' girl  
Yeah, I've got news for you.  
  
Oh, you wore a diamond watch,  
Claimed it was from uncle Joe.  
When I looked at the inscription  
It said love from daddy-o.  
  
Oh, well baby, whoa lil' girl, I want to say  
I've got news for you.  
Ah, if you think that jive will do  
Let me tell you, oh,  
I've got news for you  
Well, somehow your story don't ring true  
Wo, I've got news for you.
