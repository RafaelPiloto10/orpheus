Came in from the city  
Walked into the door  
I turned around when I heard the sound of footsteps on the floor.  
Love just like addiction now I'm hooked on you  
I need some time to get it right  
Your love gonna see me through.  
  
Can't stop now  
don't you know  
I ain't never gonna let you go, don't go!  
  
Baby  
make your mind up  
give me what you got  
Fix me with your loving shut the door and turn the lock.  
Hey  
go get the doctor  
doctor came too late  
Another night I feel alright my love for you can't wait.  
  
Can't stop now  
don't you know  
  
I ain't never gonna let you go, don't go!  
Came in from the city  
walked into the door  
I turned around when I heard  
The sound of footsteps on the floor.  
Said he was a killer  
now I know it's true  
I'm dead when you walk out the door  
hey babe  
I'm hooked  
  
Can't stop now  
don't you know  
Can't stop now  
don't you know  
Can't stop now.  
don't you know
