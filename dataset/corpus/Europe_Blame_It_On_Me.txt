I take the picture  
A picture in my hands  
We have everything  
All the good times that we have  
There was a time in our lifes  
When everything was bright  
We had love  
But there's nothing sacred  
Sacred anymore  
That's why I need your lovin'  
Oh just like I did before  
There was a time in our lifes  
When everything was bright  
We had love  
So by the light in the morning  
I'm gonna make my way  
Not a way not a warning  
To be a harder way  
So by the light in the morning  
That's where I'll be  
Oh darling darling darling  
Just blame it on me  
I'll be searching  
Time to time again  
Since I lost your lovin'  
It has never been the same  
There was a time in our lifes  
When everything was right  
We had love  
So by the light in the morning  
I gonna make my way  
Not a word, not a warning  
To be a harder way  
Just by the light in the morning  
That's where I'll be  
Oh darling, darling, darling  
Just blame it on me  
Blame it on me  
So by the light in the morning  
I gonna make my way  
Not a word, not a warning  
To steal your heart away  
Just by the light in the morning...
