Don't ask me just how it happened  
I wish I knew  
I can't believe that it's happened  
And still it's true  
  
I got lost in his arms, and I had to stay  
It was dark in his arms, and I lost my way  
From the dark came a voice, and it seemed to say  
"there you go, there you go"  
  
How I felt, as I fell, I just can't recall  
But his arms held me fast and it broke the fall  
And I said to my heart as it foolishly  
Kept jumping all around  
  
I got lost  
But look what I found
