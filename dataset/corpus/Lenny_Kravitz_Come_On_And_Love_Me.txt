I need you and I need love  
I need truth and I need God  
I don't know just how to say  
But I love you anyway  
You and I can't be too strong  
Come on and love me  
  
With the stars and moon above  
Take me in your arms let love  
Rule us in our hearts and in our minds  
Just come here baby tell me what you feel  
What you feel  
Oh you and I can't wait for that too long  
Oh come on and love me  
  
Lay your body next to mine  
You don't have to take off all your clothes ooh  
But if the only thing you take off is your mind  
You and I goin' have a real good time  
Oh you and I can't wait for that too long  
Oh come on and love me  
Come on and love me  
  
Ooh ho what you feel yeah yeah  
Ooh ho what's real  
What'cha feel  
What'cha fell now
