There's a shadow on the terrace  
A snow dance for the living  
There's heavy weather on the way  
I heard it on the news.  
  
And life's a tough principal who won't reward the losers  
Your name is on the tea-cup  
There's nothing I can do.  
  
But to wish you'd think about me before you go to sleep  
And I wish you the best there is before you go to sleep.  
  
There are tears without the colour  
A million seas with water  
An ocean full of people where shattered hearts can go.  
  
And love's a golden ripple where answers are so simple  
But the explanations are very hard to do.  
  
And I wish you'd think about me before you go to sleep  
And I wish you the best there is before you go to sleep  
Go to sleep.
