Movin' up where you want to be  
Talking tough, that won't work with me  
It's my heart, it ain't Hollywood  
You want it baby  
Oh you got to be good  
  
(Heyya) mm  
(Heyya) heyyy  
(Heyya) ooo  
(Hey Hey ya)  
  
Take you up where you never been  
Tie your seat belt, oh strap yourself in  
Start a rumor, nothing to it  
Oh it's you and me baby are just the ones to do it  
  
I don't want to be the lonely game in town  
I just want to be the only girl around  
Yeah I'm gonna take you straight to the top  
Never gonna stop  
Show you what I got  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'll take your heart (I'll take your heart)  
Before you know it's gone  
Leave you standing but you won't be alone  
Take your rhythm and leave you out of time  
I'll take everything and give you all of mine  
(I'll take your heart) I'll take your heart  
And you ain't gonna feel it  
Can't do nothing babe  
You know I'm gonna steal it  
  
And I'll take your heart  
Before you know it's gone  
(Heyya, Heyya, Heyya, Hey Hey Heyya)  
  
Lady luck just be good to me  
Send me love special delivery  
Ain't in a movie, I ain't on TV  
I'm a living, loving breathing leading kind of lady  
I don't want to be alone at the end of the phone  
I just want to be the one that turns you on  
  
Yeah I'm gonna take you straight to the top  
Never gonna stop  
Show you what I got  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Some girls will cut you like a knife  
Some girls will even stay the night  
But this girl is gonna stay for life  
Ya know it's right  
  
(Heyya) mm  
(Heyya) heyy  
(Heyya) oo  
(Hey Hey ya)  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
