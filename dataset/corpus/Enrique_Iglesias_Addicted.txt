Have I told you how good  
It feels to be me  
When I'm in you  
I can only stay clean  
When you are around  
Don't let me fall  
  
If I close my eyes for ever  
Would it ease the pain  
Could I breath again  
  
Baby I'm addicted and out of control  
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying  
Baby I'm a lair but all I really know  
Is you're the only reason I'm trying  
  
I'm wasting away  
Made a million mistakes  
Am I to late  
There's a storm in my head  
And it rains on my bed  
When you're not here  
I'm not afraid of dying  
But I'm afraid of losing you  
  
Baby I'm addicted and out of control  
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying  
Baby I'm a lair but all I really know  
Is you're the only reason I'm trying  
  
When you're lying next to me  
Love is going through to me  
O it's beautiful  
  
Everything is clear to me  
Till I hit reality  
I lose it all  
I lose it all  
I lose it all  
  
Baby I'm addicted  
And trying ,trying ,trying  
Baby I'm addicted  
Don't want to lose it all  
Baby I'm all lair but all I really know  
Is you're the only reason I'm trying  
  
Baby I'm addicted  
Baby I'm addicted  
Baby I'm addicted
