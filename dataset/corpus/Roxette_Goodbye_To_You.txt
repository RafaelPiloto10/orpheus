Goodbye to you,  
Goodbye to broken hearts,  
Goodbye to romance,  
Hiding in the dark,  
  
Nights that leave a scar.  
Goodbye to you,  
Goodbye to empty cards,  
Goodbye to this ball of bliss,  
  
I'm dancing from your arms.  
And I fill the bedroom  
With silent visions of rain.  
And I paint the morning  
  
With echoes from pleasure in pain.  
I don't want to touch emotions,  
I just got to run away.  
Electric blue like oceans,  
  
Wild like lovers sway.  
Goodbye to you...  
And I seal the pillow  
And shatter dreams down the hall.  
  
And I hang the heartache  
Like pictures on the wall.  
Can you hear the sound of angels  
They're playing hurting games?  
  
Well, I'm a stranger when I'm leaving,  
I was a stranger when I came.  
Goodbye to you
