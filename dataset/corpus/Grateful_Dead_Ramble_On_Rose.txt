Just like jack the ripper, just like mojo hand,  
Just like billy Sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band,  
Just like New York city, just like Jericho,  
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow.  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?  
Ramble on baby, settle down easy  
Ramble on rose.  
  
Just like Jack and Jill, mama told the jailer  
One hear up, and one cool down, leave nothin' for the tailor.  
Just like Jack and Jill, papa told the jailer  
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor.  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?  
Ramble on baby, settle down easy  
Ramble on rose.  
  
I'm gonna to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime,  
I know this song it ain't never gonna end.  
I'm gonna march you up and down along the county line,  
Take you to the leader of a band.  
  
Just like crazy Otto, just like wolfman jack,  
Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back.  
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein,  
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line.  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?  
Ramble on baby, settle down easy  
Ramble on rose.  
  
I'm gonna to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime,  
I know this song it ain't never gonna end.  
I'm gonna march you up and down along the county line,  
Take you to the leader of a band.  
  
Good-bye mama and papa  
Good-bye Jack and Jill  
The grass ain't greener  
The wine ain't sweeter  
Either side of the hill.  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?  
Ramble on baby, settle down easy  
Ramble on rose.
