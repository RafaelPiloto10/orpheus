Mom of my dad woman so sad  
Oh granny's gonna sleep in peace  
Grandmommy of children you love  
Oh granny one more minute with me  
Walk my granny back home to her house in the sky  
I'm gonna walk my granny back home  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
Oh virgin of life widow and wife  
My nana's heart was torn in two  
Cause granddaddy died and he bleeds for his lonely bride  
Oh nana I make a prayer for you  
Walk my granny back home to her spouse in the sky  
I'm gonna walk my granny back home  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
Walk my granny back home to her house in the sky  
I'm gonna walk my granny back home  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
So long goodbye  
Oh granny you gonna sleep in peace
