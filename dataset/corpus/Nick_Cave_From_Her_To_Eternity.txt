Ah wanna tell ya 'bout a girl  
You kno, she lives in Apt. 29  
Why... That's the one right up top a mine  
Ah start to cry, Ah start to cry  
O ah hear her walkin  
Walkin barefoot cross the floor-boards  
All thru this lonesome night  
And ah hear her crying too.  
Hot-tears come splashin on down  
Leaking thru the cracks,  
Down upon my face, ah catch'em in my mouth!  
Walk'n'cry Walk'n'cry-y!!!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
Ah read her diary on her sheets  
Scrutinizin every lil piece of dirt  
Tore out a page'n'stufft it inside my shirt  
Fled outa the window,  
And shinning it down the vine  
Outa her night-mare, and back into mine  
Mine! O Mine!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
Cry! Cry! Cry!  
She's wearing them bloo-stockens, ah bet!  
And standin like this with my ear to the ceiling  
Listen ah kno it must sound absurd  
But ah can hear the most melancholy sound  
Ah ever heard!  
Walk'n'cry! Kneel'n'cry-y!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
O tell me why? Why? Why?  
Why the ceiling still shakes?  
Why the fixtures turn to serpants snakes?  
This desire to possess her is a wound  
And it's naggin at me like a shrew  
But, ah kno, that to possess her  
Is, therefore, not to desire her.  
O o o then ya kno, that lil girl would just have to go!  
Go! Go-o-o! From her to eternity!
