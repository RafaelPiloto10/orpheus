I'm headin' to Atlanta  
Leavin' on a Delta plane  
Uh huh, all right  
I'm headin' to Atlanta  
Leavin'on a Delta plane  
Uh huh, good good  
I'll carry my trenchcoat  
But I sure don't think it's gonna rain  
Ah ah, oh no  
The gold is in my pockets  
Caps and tabs are in my sleves  
Ah ha  
Gold is in my pockets  
Caps and tabs are in my sleeves  
Oh yeah  
Stand to make a thousand  
If I can just get past the thief  
Oh yeah, oh there they are, ohhh  
I'm a junk runner honey  
Hotter than the noonday sun  
Oh mercy  
I'm a junk runner honey  
Hotter than the noonday sun  
Oh yeah, come true  
If I don't make Orlando  
You know my runnin' days are done
