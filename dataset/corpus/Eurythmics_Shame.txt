Now there's a lifestyle  
With painted lips  
Now there's a lifestyle  
Everybody wants it  
But it don't exist  
  
And I said shame  
In the dance halls and the cinema  
Shame  
On the TV and the media  
Shame  
We loved you  
  
Now there's a lifestyle  
With fashion chic  
Now there's a lifestyle  
Everybody in it wants  
To be elite  
And I said  
"You with yer brand new shoes and  
You with yer greasy hair and  
You with your mother's pride and poetry  
Don't you want to feel the shame?"  
  
In the dance halls  
Can't you feel the shame?  
And the TV  
Can't you feel the shame?  
We loved you  
  
Shame  
In the dance halls and the cinema  
Shame  
On the TV and the media  
Shame  
We loved you  
  
At the Lido and the opera  
Shame  
At the races  
And the theater  
Shame  
We loved you.  
  
And they said all we need is love  
All we need is love  
With the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.  
Day after day  
Day after day
