Life  
Coast to coast  
White hot as a ghost  
When you live  
In a countdown  
  
Time  
Is free as a jailbird  
At least that's what I heard  
When you live  
In a hideout  
  
Love  
Comes cheap at a swapmeet  
It all comes so dirt cheap  
When you live  
In a bedroom  
  
Love  
Cuts deep as a razor  
But that ain't amazin'  
When you live  
In a cancer  
  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah  
  
Mind  
Gets scrambled like eggs  
Get bruised and erased  
When you live  
In a brainstorm  
  
Noise  
Seems logically right  
Ringing ears in the night  
When you live  
In an airport  
  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah  
  
Hard hearted Alice  
Is what we want to be  
Hard hearted Alice  
Is what you want to see  
  
Hard hearted Alice  
Is what we want to be  
Hard hearted Alice  
Is what you want to see
