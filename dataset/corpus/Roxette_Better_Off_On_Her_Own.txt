My girl came home to me  
Just the other day acting okay  
I was reading alone  
In my favourite room the TV was on  
  
May I be excused  
For not telling the truth  
  
Cause she's gone  
She said she's better off on her own  
She turned her head  
Much better off on her own  
  
My girl knocked on the door  
To the place I usually refer to as home  
I died surely some tied  
She looked in my eyes  
Small and surprised  
  
And God closed every gates  
The moon fell into the lake  
  
Boy she's gone, adrift  
She's better off on her own  
She closed, then she left  
Much better off on her own  
  
Sitting naked by the window sill  
Watching cars upon the hill  
Am I sleeping? I was dreaming  
For just a moment time stood still  
  
Better off on her own  
Better off on her own  
  
Now she's gone, she said  
She's better off on her own  
She turned her head  
Much better off on her own  
  
She's gone, she sighed  
She's better off on her own  
The tears I cry  
Much better off on her own  
  
My girl came home to me  
Just the other day
