Please don't Judas me  
Treat me as you like to be treated  
Please don't blacklist me  
Leave me as you'd wish to find me  
Don't analyze me, sacrifice me  
Please don't Judas me.  
  
Please don't chastise me  
Show me just one shred of kindness  
Try to help me see  
Guide me in my eyes of blindness  
Don't despise me, categorize me  
Please don't Judas me.  
  
No, no don't Judas me  
No, please don't Judas me  
  
Please don't head shrink me  
Don't disguise your innuendos  
Make no lies to me  
I can see the way the wind blows  
Don't deface me, annihilate me  
Please don't Judas me.  
  
Please don't number me  
Don't betray my trusted promise  
Please don't anger me  
I find it hard to bear no fairness  
Don't frustrate me, manipulate me  
Please don't Judas me  
  
No no don't Judas me  
No,please don't Judas me
