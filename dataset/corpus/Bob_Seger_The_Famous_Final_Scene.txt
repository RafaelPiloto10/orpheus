Words and music by bob seger  
  
Think in terms of bridges burned  
Think of seasons that must end  
See the rivers rise and fall  
They will rise and fall again  
Everything must have an end  
Like an ocean to a shore  
Like a river to a stream  
Like a river to a stream  
It's the famous final scene  
And how you tried to make it work  
Did you really think it could  
How you tried to make it last  
Did you really think it would  
Like a guest who stayed too long  
Now it's finally time to leave  
Yes, it's finally time to leave  
Take it calmly and serene  
It's the famous final scene  
It's been coming on so long  
You were just the last to know  
It's been a long time since you've smiled  
Seems like oh so long ago  
Now the stage has all been set  
And the nights are growing cold  
Soon the winter will be here  
And there's no one warm to hold  
Now the lines have all been read  
And you knew them all by heart  
Now you move toward the door  
Here it comes the hardest part  
Try the handle of the road  
Feeling different feeling strange  
This can never be arranged  
As the light fades from the screen  
From the famous final scene
