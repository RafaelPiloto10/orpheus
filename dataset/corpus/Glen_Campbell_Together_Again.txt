(Nothing else matters we're together again)  
Together again my tears have stopped falling  
And the long lonesome nights have come to an end  
The key to my heart yes you hold in your hand  
And baby nothing else matters we're together again  
(We're together again)  
Together again oh my grey skies are gone  
Cause you're back in my arms right back where you belong  
And the love that we knew yes all our love is living again  
And nothing else matters cause we're together again  
No baby nothing else matters as long as we're together again
