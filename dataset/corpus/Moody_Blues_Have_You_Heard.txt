Part 1  
Now you know that you are real,  
Show your friends that you and me  
Belong to the same world,  
Turned on to the same word,  
Have you heard?  
Now you know that you are free,  
Living all your life at ease.  
Each day has its always,  
A look down life's hallways, doorways,  
To lead you there.

Part 2  
Now you know how nice it feels,  
Scatter good seed in the fields.  
Life's ours for the making,  
Eternity's waiting, waiting,  
For you and me.  
Now you know that you are real,  
Show your friends that you and me  
Belong to the same world,  
Turned on to the same word,  
Have you heard?  
Have you heard?  
Have you heard?  
Have you heard?  
Have you heard?
