Diesel smoke climbin' to the clear blue sky I sit here wonderin' wanderin' why  
I leave her everytime I love her  
Green grass growin' by picket fence Lord I just don't make no sense  
But I leave her everytime I love her  
I guess it's just to my blood to roam I ain't never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
I guess it's just knowin' that she'll be there  
With her dark brown eyes and her yellow hair  
And I love her Lord knows I love her  
Though my mind's dis-satisfied just a hoppin' that big ole Mack and ride  
And leave her everytime I love her  
I guess it's just to my blood to roam I ain't never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
  
One of these days I want to go back  
To that yelllow haired girl and the tumble down shack  
And never leave her all I do is love her  
Well I guess to that I'll be content  
Just to drivin' this track and sendin' home the rent  
And leave her everytime I love her  
Well I guess it's just to my blood to roam I ain't never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
You guess it I really love her
