It seems no matter how far I may roam  
Like some ol' tumbleweed my thoughts go tumblin' back home  
In memory I recall those simpler times  
And a way of life I never left behind.  
  
Down at the old corral  
Just sittin'  
Watchin' the sun go down  
Oh, How I'm wishin' that I  
Could be there now  
Down at the old corral.  
  
I remember everything I ever heard  
Like how to judge a man's true worth by how he keep's his word  
That saddle wisdom never seemed to end  
Everything I need to know I learned back then.  
  
Down at the old corral  
Just sittin'  
Watchin' the sun go down  
Oh, How I'm wishin' that  
I could be there now  
Down at the old corral.  
  
Down at the old corral  
Just sittin'  
Watchin' the sun go down  
Oh, how I'm wishin' that  
I could be there now  
Down at the old corral  
Down at the old corral  
Down at the old corral
