You promised not to say a word  
You promised you would keep it quiet  
But you and I both knew it  
It was written all over your face  
So I cried.. Ohyah....  
The day you said goodbye  
So I cried..  
The day that our love died  
The day you said goodbye....... Died.....  
We had a love I thought could last  
I guess I was thinking four leaf clovers  
But you wished we were over  
Now I've lost three and I only got one  
So I cried.. Ohyah....  
The day you said goodbye.. Ohyah....  
So I cried..  
You cried..... I cried..  
The day you said goodbye....... Yah.....  
Let's not even bother be talking about  
It doesn't really matter to you  
So get it on....... Baby  
Get it on....... Baby.... Ohhow  
A secret's something that you keep  
And a heart is something you hold on to  
But you play by your own rules  
And one day it will blow up in your face  
So you cry... Ohyah....  
The day he says goodbye  
The day that your love died  
You cried..... Ohhh  
The day he says goodbye  
So you cry... Ohyah....  
The day he says goodbye  
You cried....  
The day that your love died  
The day he says goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
So you cry... Ohhhoow....  
The day he says goodbye  
So you cry... Ohhhoow....  
The day he says goodbye  
So I cry... Ohhhoow....  
The day he says  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Here's to you............. Goodbye
