She looked so proud and held her head up high  
And her eyes were softer than a summer sky  
And in the distance there were clouds  
Somebody made her cry  
And the salt of the tears she couldn't hide  
Told her broken hearts need time to mend  
Mostly thinkin' that this girl might need a friend  
But suddenly her eyes met mine, world went in a spin  
And I knew I'd never be the same again  
  
Baby blues oh baby blues  
All caught up in those baby blues  
I found heaven and my refuge  
Live and die for those baby blues  
Caught up in those baby blues  
  
Now I'm with those blue eyes everyday  
And even in the silence they have so much to say  
Talk to my heart, bring some sunshine and the rain  
Make me look at love a brand new way  
  
Baby blues oh baby blues  
All caught up in those baby blues  
I found heaven when I found you  
Live and die for those baby blues  
Caught up in those baby blues  
All wrapped up in those baby blues  
  
Oh baby baby oh baby blues  
All caught up in those baby blues  
I found heaven when I found you  
Live and die for those baby blues  
Caught up in those baby blues  
All wrapped up in those baby blues  
  
Baby blues  
Baby blues  
All caught up in those baby baby blues  
All wrapped up in those baby baby blues  
Baby blues
