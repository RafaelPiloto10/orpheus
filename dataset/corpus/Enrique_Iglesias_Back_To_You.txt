I've been down  
I've been beat  
I've been so that I could not speak  
I've been so lost that I could not see  
I wanted things that were out of reach  
Then I found you and help me through and you show me  
What to do  
That's why I'm comin' back to you  
  
Like a star that guides a ship across the ocean  
That's how your love can take me home back to you  
And if I wish upon that star that someday i'll be where you are  
Cause I know that day is comin' soon yeah I'm comin' back to you  
  
You've been alone but you did not show it  
You've been in pain when I did not know it  
You let me do what I needed to  
You where there when I needed you  
  
Mighta let you down  
Mighta messed you round  
But you never change you point of view  
That's why I'm comin back to you.........
