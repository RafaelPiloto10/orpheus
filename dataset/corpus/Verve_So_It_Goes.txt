Life  
Roll my die  
Change this life  
You said this movie was mine  
But now you go and change your mind  
This is my life  
So it goes  
You come in on your own in this life  
You know you leave on your own  
'Cause I don't need no cause  
When my feelings fall  
You showed me things I didn't want to see  
I don't believe that love is free  
Sure fine way to treat a man  
  
So it goes  
You come in on your own in this life  
And you know you leave on your own  
  
Life  
This is my Life  
So it goes  
You come into this life on your own  
You know you'll leave on your own  
Life  
This is my life  
So it goes  
You come into this life on your own  
You know you leave  
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella  
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella  
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella  
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella  
Another drink and I won't miss her  
Another drink and I won't miss her  
Another drink and I won't miss her  
Another drink and I won't miss her
