Oh, when he was a man, my father would stand  
I never saw him run  
There wasn't anyone could make the man bend  
The strength of his will was the tool of his trade  
And he did his work well  
Till the powers that be took a liking to him  
And they traded his body for a cold empty shell  
Don't beat me down  
Don't beat me down  
I've got something to say  
Don't you stand in my way  
And don't beat me down  
Oh, when I was a youth, I found the truth  
In the eyes of a friend  
There wasn't anyone could make the light dim  
And we talked and we rambled and we gambled to win  
And the learning was good  
Till the powers that be to a liking to him  
They traded their fortunes for the sight of his blood  
When I was a child and my mother smiled  
At the cradle she bought  
For the little tot she held to her breast  
And the song that she sang was an anthem to love  
It was all that I heard  
Till the powers that be took a liking to me  
And they told me that love was a four-letter word  
Don't beat me down  
Don't beat me down  
I've got one life to live  
And that's all I can give  
So don't beat me down  
And now I've got a place, I got a worried face  
And a question in mind  
Please let me find a reason somehow  
Why some reap the harvest while other men die  
And the joker runs wild  
And if powers that be take a liking to us  
Then we all must return to the ways of a child  
We all must return to the ways of a child  
So don't beat me down  
Don't beat me down  
I've got something to say  
Don't you stand in my way  
And don't beat me down  
I've got one life to life  
And that's all I can give  
So don't beat me down  
Don't beat me down  
Don't beat me down
