She feels the earth is giving way  
But she thinks we're better off that way  
The more you take the less you feel  
The less you know the more you believe  
The more you have the more it takes today  
You gotta give it away  
You gotta give it away  
You gotta give it away  
She doesn't care what it's worth  
She's living like it's the last night on earth  
The last night on earth  
  
She's not waiting on a savior to come  
She's at a bus stop with the News of the World  
And the  
Sun  
Sun here it comes  
She's not waiting for anyone  
  
You gotta give it away  
You gotta give it away  
You gotta give it away  
She knows just what it's worth  
She's living like it's the last night on earth  
The last night on earth  
  
Slipping away  
Slip slide  
The world turns and we get dizzy  
Slipping away  
  
She's living next week now  
You know she's going to pay you back somehow  
The future is so predictable  
The past is too uncomfortable  
  
You gotta give it away  
You gotta give it away  
You gotta give it away  
She already knows it hurts  
She's living like it's the last night on earth  
The last night on earth  
Last night on earth  
Last night on earth
