[Chorus]  
I knew that, I knew that  
You were lookin' at me  
That's when the blunt start rushing  
I knew that, I knew that  
You would leave your spot when you got hot  
And you're goin' again  
I love when you seein' she's goin' to the bathroom  
Got 5 minutes to exchange them buds  
No I'm not callin' you, what's your sign  
I know your name, it must be under cover  
  
[Verse 1]  
Went out tonight, I think of my life  
I'm sick and tired of rouge, yea  
Then, threw caution to the wind cause F it, who cares  
So tonight I'm gon' be  
  
[Pre-Chorus] x2  
Riding on your, riding on your  
Riding on your wave girl  
And I feel like, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
Thinkin' to myself if I was a freaky dink  
What's crackin' homie?  
Ain't you ain't gonna see me in this club next week, no  
So tonight' I'm gon' be  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'm hoping that you rest and you don't need to sleep  
Don't be slacking homie  
Grab me by the proof so I don't miss a beat  
Baby, so tonight I'm gon' be  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]
