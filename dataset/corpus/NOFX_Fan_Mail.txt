Dear Sirs,  
To whom is may concern  
There's facts I'd like to learn  
So many things I wanna know  
Especially trivial info paraphernalia  
Badges and regalia please send me everything  
  
Cause I  
Am interested in you  
And everything you do  
I find myself at all your shows  
Could you tell me were you buy your clothes  
Could you sign my little sisters face  
Put your signature any place and please send me a bio  
  
Cause we've got fan mail  
We really really read it  
Fan Mail  
We really really read it  
  
I sent you my letter now I want a reply  
You don't know any better than you won't take your time  
With my Fan Mail  
  
So I would like to know just if and when  
You'll be in town again  
So that I could meet with you  
And brag at my friends at school  
Have you been all around the world  
Have you seen every kinda of girl  
Or are you from the other side  
  
Cause you  
You can't believe everything that you read  
With the hypocrisy and the greed  
The papers all the things that they say  
They don't tell me anything anyway  
That's why I've gotta get it straight from you  
Without an obligation  
  
My Fan Mail (oohs and ahhs)  
  
What's this I find to my surprise  
Those fans that I idolized  
No longer seem to exist  
Now tell me what can be the cause of this  
Perhaps it could be their egos  
I tell you heaven only knows  
I didn't even get a newsletter  
  
Fan Mail send it out to me
