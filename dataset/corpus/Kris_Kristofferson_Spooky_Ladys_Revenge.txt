Looky here, who's in focus now  
Hard and clear to the bone  
No more fears that you'd notice now  
Like a tear cast in stone  
And she comes from a spring to a fountain  
On the wings of her song  
She's the king of the mountain  
She's so good, Lord, and she's gone  
Cause she's a star-see her shining  
She'll go far, for a price  
But she's hard in the heart like a diamond  
Flashin' fire--cold as ice  
Chorus:  
Cause she's a star-see her shining  
She'll go far, for a price  
But she's hard in the heart like a diamond  
Flashin' fire--cold as ice
