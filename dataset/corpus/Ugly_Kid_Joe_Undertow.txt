The pain is gone  
The rain and storm they stumble down  
The sun disguised again today  
The wagon rolls, its axis bound  
  
Another bottle cracked today  
The game moves on  
The people push and move so hard  
Where now don't those flavors go  
  
Answer now  
Your questions move like undertow  
Off to find your island now  
We got pulled out by the undertow  
  
That's the way the wind blows  
Everybody's laughing  
We got pulled out by the undertow  
That's the way the wind blows  
  
Too long today  
We got pulled out by the undertow  
That's the way the wind blows
