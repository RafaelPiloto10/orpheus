Standing in the rain, with his head hung low  
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show  
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene  
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream  
He heard one guitar, just blew him away  
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day  
  
Bought a beat up six string, in a secondhand store  
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure  
That one guitar, felt good in his hands, didn't take long, to understand  
Just one guitar, slung way down low  
Was a one way ticket, only one way to go  
So he started rockin', ain't never gonna stop  
Gotta keep on rockin', someday gonna make it to the top  
  
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes, he's a juke box hero  
He took one guitar, juke box hero, stars in his eyes  
Juke box hero, (stars in his eyes) he'll come alive tonight  
  
In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour  
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door  
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain  
And that one guitar, made his whole life change  
Now he needs to keep on rockin', he just can't stop  
Gotta keep on rockin', that boy has got to stay on top  
  
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes  
He's a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes  
Yeah, juke box hero, stars in his eyes  
With that one guitar, (stars in his eyes)  
He'll come alive, come alive tonight, woah  
  
Yeah, he's gotta keep on rockin', just can't stop  
Gotta keep on rockin', that boy has got to stay on top  
  
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes  
He's a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes  
(Just one guitar) juke box hero, (aah aah aah) got stars in his eyes  
He's just a juke box hero, aah aah aah  
Juke box (stars) hero, (stars, stars) juke box hero, (stars, stars)  
He's got stars in his eyes, stars in his eyes
