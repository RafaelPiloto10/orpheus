I've heard a lot of stories  
So tell me if they're true  
Oh I would die for you  
Knowing that you're mine  
You tell me that you're sorry  
You say your heart is new  
Oh I will cry for you  
Call me and we'll dine  
  
[Chorus]  
It's almost over Lorraine  
Can you still feel the pain  
Do you still want me to love you  
It's such a funny day  
Whoah oh oh  
It's such a funny day  
  
Tonight we sail for Paris  
Where the streets are paved with gold  
Your eyes have blessed my soul  
Your lips, they've blessed the wine  
  
We'll tame the Gulf of Lyons  
I'll wed thee in Marseilles  
We'll turn the moon to blood  
If only there were time  
  
[Chorus]
