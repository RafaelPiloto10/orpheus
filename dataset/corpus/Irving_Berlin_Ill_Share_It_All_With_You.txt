TOMMY:]  
What is mine, dear, will be yours  
When the sun shines and when it pours  
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall  
Fifty-fifty in ev'rything  
Haven't got much, even that much to my name  
Fortune's door shut, can't get in, but just the same  
  
My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing  
I'll share it all with you  
  
My sense of humor, my disposition, my rosy future  
I'll share it all with you  
  
Someday, honey, I'll have money  
You know what that brings  
Furs and diamond rings  
And besides those things  
There'll be  
  
My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing  
I'll share it all with you  
  
[WINNIE:]  
My head for thinking, my face for smiling, my hands for cooking  
I'll share it all with you  
  
My understanding, my loving nature, my good intentions  
I'll share it all with you  
  
I'm not twenty but there's plenty  
Underneath my hat  
I know where I'm at  
And on top of that  
There'll be  
  
My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing  
I'll share it all with you
