They couldn't see what I thought would be so obvious  
They hide behind the laws they made for all of us  
The ministry of truth that deals with pretense  
The ministry of peace that sits on defense  
I'm washing my hands of what they're trying to do  
It's for me, it's for me, it's for you, it's for you  
  
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  
I'll tell you no lies  
They say I worship the devil  
They must be stupid or blind  
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  
  
They live a life of fear and insecurity  
And all you do is pay for their prosperity  
The ministry of fear that won't let you live  
The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive  
Do what you will to try and make me conform  
I'll make you wish that you had never been born  
  
Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel  
I'll do what I please  
Yes I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel  
And I'm as free as the breeze  
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  
  
They'll try playin' win your heart  
They know it rules your head  
If they could read between the lines  
You know they'd see the real day  
  
God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious  
Is it because they manifest the incubus  
The ministry of war that got caught in the draft  
The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed  
When it's all boiled down and the day's at an end  
I'll give you no bullshit and I'll never pretend  
  
Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel  
I'll tell you no lies  
They say I worship the devil  
Why don't they open their eyes  
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  
A rock 'n' roll rebel  
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel
