I'm all busted up  
Broken bones and nasty cuts  
Accidents will happen  
But this time I can't get up  
She comes to check on me  
Making sure I'm on my knees  
After all she's the one  
Who put me in this state  
  
Is she ultra violent?  
Is she disturbed?  
I better tell her that I love her  
Before she does it all over again  
Oh God, she's killing me!!!  
  
For now I lie around  
Hell that's all I can really do  
She takes good care of me  
Just keep saying my love is true  
  
Is she ultra violent?  
Is she disturbed?  
I better tell her that I love her  
Before she does it all over again  
Oh God, she's killing me!!!  
  
Looking out my window for someone that's passing by  
No one knows I'm locked in here  
All I do is cry  
  
For now I lie around  
Hell that's all I can really do  
She takes good care of me  
Just keep saying my love is true
