It's been ten long years since I've been home  
I've been waiting here with nowhere to go  
It's an occupation I don't like  
But it pays the rent and turns on the light (alright)  
  
I told you so  
It has to be  
Cut loose and runaway with me  
We'll go out every night  
I'll be there by your side  
And we'll all get high down the old west side  
  
If it ain't the job and it ain't the place  
But I must stay for your pretty face  
It's a bad reaction I can't fix  
You conned me with those feline tricks  
  
And I told you so  
It's a crazy world  
For a mixed-up guy  
And a no-good girl  
  
And I told you so  
It's a crazy world  
For a mixed-up guy  
With a no-good girl  
  
(Take her, take the world)  
  
I told you so  
It has to be  
Cut loose and run away (run away) with me  
We'll go out every night  
I'll be there by your side  
And we'll all get high down the old west side  
  
Down the old west side  
Down the old west side  
Down the old west side  
(Take the world, yeah)
