Gonna hop in the hack, then turn on the key  
Pop in the clutch, let the wheels roll free  
Not a cloud in the sky, such a sunny day  
Push in the button, let the top ten play  
Come on honey, let me sing 'em away  
Come on honey, let me sing 'em away  
Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away  
Give me a little of that old time love  
'Cause I ain't never had near enough  
Honey, walk that walk with style and grace  
This ain't no knock-down, drag-out race  
It don't matter much, pick any gear  
Bring you a pound and drop the rear  
Baby, baby, what can I say  
I'm here to drive those blues away  
I sent a letter to a man I know  
Said, "One for the money and two for the show"  
I wait all summer for his reply  
Said, "Three to get ready and four to fly"  
Only two things in the world I love  
That's rock 'n' roll and my turtle dove  
When I was a young man I needed good luck  
But I'm a little bit older now and I know my stuff  
Come on honey, let me sing 'em away  
Come on honey, let me sing 'em away  
Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away
