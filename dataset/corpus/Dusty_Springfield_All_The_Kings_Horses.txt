Mmm, my friends keep telling me to pull myself together  
They try to cheer my up but it's not gettin' better  
They say that time will pass and I'll love again some day  
But time is standing still ever since you went away  
  
Now, all the king's horses and all the king's men  
You'll never get me back together again  
'Cause I just fall apart each time I look at you  
No, all the king's and all the king's men  
Are never gonna make me smile again  
How can I smile just knowin' you're with somebody new?, ooh  
  
You had my hopes so high I guess they had to tumble  
And when you left my dream my world began to crumble  
No woman ever found the only missing part  
When you left me behind don't you know you took my heart?  
  
Now, all the king's horses and all the king's men  
You'll never get me back together again  
'Cause I just fall apart each time I look at you, yes I do, now  
All the king's and all the king's men  
You're never gonna make me smile again  
How can I smile just knowin' you're with somebody new?, ooh, yeah, ooh, ahh,
ha  
  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
You'll never get me back together again  
'Cause I just fall apart each time I look at you, yes I do  
I said, all the king's and all the king's men  
Are never gonna make me smile again  
How can I smile just knowing you're with somebody new?, yeah  
  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
You'll never get me back together again  
And I just fall apart each time
