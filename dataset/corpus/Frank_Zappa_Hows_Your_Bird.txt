Hey Baby,  
What's the word?  
Hey Baby,  
Have you heard?  
What's the latest?  
How's your bird?  
  
How's your brother?  
An' how's your mother?  
How's Aunt Funny?  
And how's your granny?  
This is absurd.  
How's your bird?  
  
(Excuse me...)  
  
How's your bunion?  
An' how's your grunion?  
Now I'm stuck.  
Lots o' luck.  
This is absurd.  
How's your bird?  
  
How's your fern?  
(I don't love you...)  
An' how's your ear lobe?  
How's your nose?  
  
(You dirty fink!)  
And your elbow?  
An' how's your foot?  
  
(...natural fink! Find out...)  
Don't forget your sister.  
An' you know, like I said...
