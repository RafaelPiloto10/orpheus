I remember a summer's day  
I remember walking up to you  
I remember my face turned red  
And I remember staring at my feet  
I remember before we met  
I remember sitting next to you  
And I remember pretending I wasn't looking  
So we'll try and try  
Even if it lasts an hour  
With all our might  
We'll try and make it ours  
Cause we're on our way  
We're on our way to fall in love  
I remember your old guitar  
I remember I Can't Explain  
I remember the way it looked around your neck  
And I remember the day it broke  
I remember song you sang  
I remember the way you looked tonight  
And I remember the way it made me feel  
So we try and try  
Even if it lasts an hour  
With all our might  
We'll try and make it ours  
Because we're on our way  
We're on our way to fall in love
