It's a beggars life, said the Queen of Spain  
But don't tell it to a poor man  
Cause he's got to kill for every thrill  
The best he can  
Everywhere around me  
I see jealousy and mayhem  
Because no men have all their peace of mind  
To carry them  
Well I don't really care  
If it's wrong or if it's right  
But until my ship comes in  
I'll live night by night  
  
When the joker tried to tell me  
I could cut it in this rube town  
When he tried to hang that sign on me  
I said take it down  
When the dawn patrol got to tell you twice  
They're gonna do it with a shotgun  
Yes, I'm cashing in this ten-cent life  
For another one  
  
Well I ain't got the heart  
To lose another fight  
So until my ship comes in  
I'll live night by night  
  
Well I don't really care  
If it's wrong or if it's right  
But until my ship comes in  
I'll live night by night
