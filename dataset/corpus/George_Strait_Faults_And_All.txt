Not so very long from now  
She'll be known all over town  
Cause she waits by her phone from in the car  
She says the limit is the sky  
And tonight she's flyin' high  
But I'll hang around and take her faults and all  
  
O' Yes she once was mine  
Now she's changed and she's that kind  
With a crowd she has her self a ball  
But she's not that kind of girl  
She's just hidin' from the world  
But I'll hang around and take her faults and all  
  
She's about as low as a girl can go  
She ain't got far to fall  
But when she hits the ground  
I'm gonna be around  
'Cause I want her most of all  
And when all's been said and done  
I'm gonna be the one  
Who'll hang around and take her faults and all  
  
Yeah I'll hang around and take her faults and all
