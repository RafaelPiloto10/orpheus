I want to live life  
Never be cruel  
I want to live life  
Be good to you  
  
I want to fly  
And never come down  
And live my life  
And have friends around  
  
We never change do we  
We never learn do we  
  
So I want to live in a wooden house  
I want to live life always be true  
I want to live life and be good to you  
  
I want to fly and never come down  
And live my life  
And have friends around  
  
We never change do we  
No no  
We never learn do we  
  
So I want to live in a wooden house  
Making more friends would be easy  
  
Oh and I don't have a soul to save  
Yes and I sin every single day  
  
We never change do we  
We never learn do we  
  
So I want to live in a wooden house  
Making more friends would be easy  
I want to live where the sun comes out
