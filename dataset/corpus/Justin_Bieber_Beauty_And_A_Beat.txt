Young Money, Nicki Minaj, Justin  
  
Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off  
What you got, a billion could've never bought  
We gonna party like it's thirty twelve tonight  
I wanna show you all the finer things in life  
So just forget about the world, be young tonight  
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya  
  
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat  
Who can make my life complete  
It's all by you, when the music makes you move  
Baby do it like you do  
'Cause  
  
Body rock, girl, I can feel your body rock  
Take a bow, you on the hottest ticket now  
We gonna party like it's thirty twelve tonight  
I wanna show you all the finer things in life  
So just forget about the world, be young tonight  
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya  
  
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat  
Who can make my life complete  
It's all by you, when the music makes you move  
Baby do it like you do  
  
In time, ink lines, bitches couldn't get on my incline  
World tour, it's mine, ten little letters, in a big sign  
Justin Bieber, you know I'ma hit 'em with the ether  
Buns out, wiener, but I gotta keep my eye out for Selena  
Beauty, beauty and the beast  
Beauty from the east, beautiful confessions of the priest  
Beast, beauty from the streets, we don't get deceased  
Every time a beauty on the beats (Yeah, yeah, yeah, Let's go, Let's go)  
  
Body rock, girl, I wanna feel your body rock  
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat  
Who can make my life complete  
It's all by you, when the music makes you move  
Baby do it like you do  
'Cause
