I can only give you country walks in spring time  
The hand to hold when leaves begin to fall  
And the lover's burning lights were born on the winter nights  
That's all that's all  
  
There are those I know who have told you  
They could give you the whole round world for a toy  
All I have are my arms to enfold you  
And a love time can never destroy destroy  
  
So if you're wondering what I'm asking in return dear  
You'll be so surprised to know my demands are very small  
Just say it's me that you adore for now nad evermore  
That's all that's all
