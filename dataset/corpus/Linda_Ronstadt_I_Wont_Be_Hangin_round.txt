I've been alone too long  
Sitting by myself  
I'm getting to old  
To help myself  
But I won't be hangin round your door  
Begging  
No I won't be hangin round  
To feel the pain  
And if you take my life in hand  
And finally make me understand  
It won't do no good  
You'll just hurt my plan  
And I won't be hangin round your door  
Begging  
No I won't be hangin rond  
To feel the pain  
Sometimes I think I can't go on  
And every day I live  
Well it seems like my life's unreal  
Sometimes I think I won't live too long  
But I hope I'm wrong  
That's the way I feel  
And I won't be hangin round your door  
Begging  
No I won't be hangin round  
To steal a kiss  
I won't be hanging round your door  
Begging  
No I won't be hangin round  
To feel the pain  
No I won't be hangin round your door  
Begging  
Oh I won't be hangin round  
To feel the pain
