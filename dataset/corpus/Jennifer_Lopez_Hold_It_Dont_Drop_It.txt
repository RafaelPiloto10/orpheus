[Chorus]  
You don't know what your doin'  
What you're doin' to me  
Try to stop it, cant stop it  
Cause you got what I need  
You got me all open  
And now you're tryin' to leave  
Hold it don't drop it, don't drop it  
Stop it, cant stop it, wont stop it  
  
Every time I try to run  
Somethin' keeps stoppin' me  
I try my best to turn around  
But your touch wont let me leave  
I cant control it  
You put somethin' inside of me  
Cause you're a problem  
Boy you must have poisoned me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Boy I must be buggin'  
Let you play those games I don't understand  
Ill be that yo-yo on a string  
  
Roll it down Ill come right back to your hand  
I make excuses  
But we keep on rockin' anyway  
But it ain't workin'  
When I let you go you make me stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wont let, me leave  
Control, of me  
You got, what I need  
Hold it don't drop it, don't drop it  
Stop it, cant stop it, wont stop it  
Wont let you go  
Cant let you leave  
I need your love  
Inside of me  
You got control  
Control of me  
Hold it don't drop it, don't drop it  
Stop it, cant stop it, wont stop it  
  
[Chorus]
