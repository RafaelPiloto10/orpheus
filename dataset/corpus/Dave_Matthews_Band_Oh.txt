Oh Lyrics  
Dave Matthews  
  
The world is blowing up  
The world is caving in  
The world has lost her way again  
But you are here with me  
But you are here with me  
Makes it ok  
  
I hear you still talk to me  
As if you're sitting in that dusty chair  
Makes the hours easier to bear  
I know despite the years alone  
I'll always listen to you sing your sweet song  
And if it's all the same to you  
  
I love you oh so well  
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  
I love you oh so well  
Enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell  
Love you oh so well  
  
And it's cold and darkness falls  
It's as if you're in the next room so alive  
I could swear I hear you singing to me  
  
I love you oh so well  
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  
I love you oh so well  
Enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell  
  
The world is blowing up  
The world is caving in  
The world has lost her way again  
But you are here with me  
But you are here with me  
Makes it ok  
  
Oh girl you're singing to me still  
I love you oh so well  
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  
I love you oh so well  
Enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell  
Love you oh so well
