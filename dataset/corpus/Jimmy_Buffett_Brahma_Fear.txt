I'd like to ride the rodeo  
But I've got Brahma fear  
So I'll just stick to airplanes  
Gently pop my ears  
  
Drink a lot of whiskey  
It gives me such a glow  
It makes me quite immobile  
Ah but it let's my feeling show  
  
And I'm somewhere below the spotlight  
Somewhere below the ground  
You dig deep enough you might find me  
Find me, and you've found my sound  
  
Yes, I own a whaler boat  
It slides across the sea  
Some folks say I'm part of it  
And I know it's part of me  
  
And when I'm feelin' solitaire  
It let's me be alone  
And when I want to have a taste  
It carries me back home  
  
And I'm somewhere below the sunlight  
Somewhere upon the sea  
You dig deep enough you might find me  
Find me, cause that's where I'll be  
  
Yes, I drink a lot of whiskey  
It gives me such a glow  
It makes me quite immobile  
But it let's my feelin's show  
Yes, it makes me quite immobile  
Ah, but it let's my feelin's show
