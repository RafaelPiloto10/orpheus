Sometime after midnight, the heat begins to rise  
Girl you'd shame the devil with the look that's in your eyes  
I know what's on your mind and I can't run away  
If I don't give you what you want there's gonna be some hell to pay  
  
Creeping up behind me, knocking at my door  
I'd never be too blind to see just what you're looking for  
You roll me over, make me moan  
Ooh, such a velvet touch, you'd melt a heart of stone  
  
[Chorus]  
Anytime, anyplace, I'm just the fool who puts a smile on your face  
A slave to love and keep you young  
All it takes and no mistakes is just a slip of the tongue  
  
And if I want a little love I gotta take a little pain  
Make me think a thousand times before I kiss again  
I'm waiting on your, every day and every night  
If I don't try to satisfy there's gonna be a fist fight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The sun is slowly rising and I'm sinking to my knees  
I'm dying just to close my eyes, I'm begging, darlin' please  
I hear you calling and I'm crawling cross the floor  
I give you everything I got and still you ask for more  
  
[Chorus]
