You were the quiet one  
Afraid to sleep alone  
Heaven knows, I was lonely too  
Some things in life a man  
Can't learn to live without  
One of those things was you  
  
Who the good guys are  
Who the bad guys are  
Isn't always clear  
In this world of separate houses  
Someone's always missing someone  
Day after day  
And year after year  
  
Though you and I are distant  
Don't ever think I didn't want you  
Or miss you every day  
No matter where life takes you  
Know that I'll still be waiting patiently  
For the day that you've forgiven me  
My son  
The One That Got Away  
  
It's all of the little things  
That add up to a life  
'N it's been so hard  
Being outside looking in  
You had hundreds of first times  
I didn't get to see  
That will never come again  
  
How do we catch up  
Is there just too much  
Stolen history  
In this world of separate houses  
I want you to remember  
That you'll always be  
Inside of me  
  
Though you and I are distant  
Don't ever think I didn't want you  
Or miss you every day  
No matter where life takes you  
Know that I'll still be waiting patiently  
For the day that you've forgiven me  
My son  
The One That Got Away  
  
You're carryin' an anger  
That does not belong to you  
'N I'm sick and tired of doin' time  
For a crime I didn't do  
  
I miss you every day  
No matter where life takes you  
Know that I'll still be waiting patiently  
'Cause I do believe in you and me  
And I trust that someday  
You'll no longer be  
The One That Got Away
