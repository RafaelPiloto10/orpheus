Oh, where have you been,  
Billy Boy, Billy Boy?  
Oh, where have you been,  
Charming Billy?  
I have been to seek a wife,  
She's the joy of my life,  
She's a young thing  
And cannot leave her mother.  
  
Did she ask you to come in,  
Billy Boy, Billy Boy?  
Did she ask you to come in,  
Charming Billy?  
Yes, she asked me to come in,  
There's a dimple in her chin.  
She's a young thing  
And cannot leave her mother.  
  
Can she make a cherry pie,  
Billy Boy, Billy Boy?  
Can she make a cherry pie,  
Charming Billy?  
She can make a cherry pie,  
Quick as a cat can wink an eye,  
She's a young thing  
And cannot leave her mother.  
  
How old is she,  
Billy Boy, Billy Boy?  
How old is she,  
Charming Billy?  
Three times six and four times seven,  
Twenty-eight and eleven,  
She's a young thing  
And cannot leave her mother.
