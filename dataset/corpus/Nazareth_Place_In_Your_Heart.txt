Is there a place in your heart left for me?  
Is there some space where the parkin' sign says free?  
Maybe there's just one little spot  
Maybe some corner that you forgot  
Is there a place in your left for me?  
  
Well I know you got so many you can choose from  
There's always flowers lyin' by your door  
I betcha your phone it never stops  
Bet you're the queen at the local hops  
I bet you get valentines but never keep the score.
