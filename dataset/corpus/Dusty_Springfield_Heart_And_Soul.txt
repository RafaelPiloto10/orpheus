Ooh, hoo  
It was back in 'sixty-three  
We were young and we were free  
Thought the world was really ours for the taking  
We had heart and we had soul  
Ooh, we lived for rock and roll  
And didn't we, didn't we, didn't we do it?  
Fashions come and fashions go  
We were there so we should know  
I sometimes smile when I think of how I looked then  
Burning candles at both ends  
Hoping time would make amends  
And didn't we, didn't we, didn't we do it?  
With heart and soul  
The world is yours, the stars are too  
If you bring out the best in you  
With heart and soul  
Whatever you've been wantin' to do  
Heart and soul will see it through, oh, ho  
Now we're older nothing's changed  
Just some things are rearranged  
But the message is the same as when we started  
We're gettin' stronger everyday  
Looking back now we can say  
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we do it?, ahh  
With heart and soul  
The world is yours, the stars are too  
If you bring out the best in you  
With heart and soul  
Whatever you've been wantin' to do  
Heart and soul will see it through, ahh  
See it through, see it through, ooh, hoo  
Ooh, hoo, sing it, sing it, sing it, oh, yeah  
With heart and soul  
The world is yours, the stars are too  
If you bring out the best in you  
With heart and soul  
Whatever you've been wantin' to do  
Heart and soul will see it through  
Oh, ho, it will see, will see, will see it through, ooh, hoo  
You can see it, you can see it, see it, see it through  
You can see it, you can see it
