Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, oh  
  
Silly you, silly me  
To let you in and put a move on me  
(Put a move on me)  
Never once asked for love  
Always took it for what it's worth... A memory  
  
1 But I don't wanna meet on a lonely street  
Where the talk is cheap  
And the price is sweet  
I'm not that girl  
I'm not that girl  
And you don't wanna see the other side of me  
So I'mma hit ya off and I'mma set you free  
Before you fall too deep  
Don't fall too deep  
  
2 - He don't know  
I'm gonna be the one who's gonna let him go  
Even if he wants to stay  
I'll let him go  
Cause all he wants from me is a private show, whoa  
  
He's all talk  
He thinks he knows  
How this game is supposed to go... For everyone  
Still it seems he can't see  
Thinks he's just using me, using me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Repeat 2  
  
He don't know  
Maybe if he wasn't such a gigolo, a nasty ho  
I would let him stay  
Instead I let him go, I let you go  
All he wants from me is a private show, whoa  
  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh yeah, he don't know  
  
Repeat 2  
  
He don't know  
Maybe if he wasn't such a gigolo, I'll let him go  
I would let him stay  
Instead I let him go, a nasty ho  
All he wants from me is a private show, whoa  
  
(He don't know)  
He don't know  
Let him go  
(Even if he wants to stay)  
I'll let him go  
Cause all he wants from me is a private show, oh  
  
Oh, he don't know, oh, oh  
He don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah
