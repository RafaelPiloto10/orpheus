People fly people flee  
People clam and say "it wasn't me"  
People fish people beef  
People arm to teeth  
  
Yes, you've got people on the tube  
Walking on the moon  
People at the bottom of the sea  
People in tombs  
  
People in igloos  
Even a tribe of pygmies  
  
People are the main spring  
Turning the world around  
People, they're the main spring  
Spinning this world upside down  
  
People sun people toast  
People tire shile other people smoke  
People bowl people rock  
People pay to see two people box  
  
Watch me face me  
Dress me baby me  
Phone me wire me  
House me bug me fire me  
  
People are the main spring  
Spinning the world around  
People, they're the main spring  
Turning this world inside out
