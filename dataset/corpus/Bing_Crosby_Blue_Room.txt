We'll have a blue room  
A new room for two room  
Where every day's a holiday  
Because you're married to me  
  
Not like a ballroom  
A small room a hall room  
Where I can smoke my pipe away  
With your wee head upon my knee  
  
We will thrive on keep alive on  
Just nothing but kisses  
With 'Mr' and 'Mrs'  
On little blue chairs  
  
You'll sew your trousseau  
Robinson Crusoe  
Is not so far from worldly cares  
As our blue room far away upstairs  
  
Yes we'll thrive on keep alive on  
Just nothing but kisses  
With 'Mr' and 'Mrs'  
Sitting on little blue chair  
  
You'll sew your trousseau  
And Mr. Robinson Crusoe  
Is not so far from worldly cares  
As our blue room far away upstairs  
  
It's a new room  
And it's a blue room  
Just for you and I
