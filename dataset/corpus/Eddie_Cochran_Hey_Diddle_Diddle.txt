Hey diddle diddle, the cow and the fiddle  
I'll jump over the moon  
Look overthere, what a sight  
He's run away with the spoon  
Hey diddle diddle, ask me a riddle  
Who could love you more than I  
Hoot that horn, he's real gone  
Hey diddle diddle he's eatin' his Christmas pie  
He's ballin' fast, he's ballin' slow  
Hey diddle diddle, watch that man and go  
Like Jack and Jill, goin' up the hill  
Humpty dumpty sittin' on the wall  
I'm gonna fall, off that wall  
Hey diddle diddle, will you love me best of all  
Hey diddle diddle, will you love me best of all
