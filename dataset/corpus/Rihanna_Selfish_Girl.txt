Baby boy what you done to me  
I saw you smiling suddenly  
I can't get you out my mind  
I got it bad boy I can't lie  
I want your time and your full attention  
I wanna to talk to you  
And not to mention good love that you give to me  
I think about it constantly  
No I won't apologize for feeling like I do  
It's just the simple facts of life  
I'm crazy over you  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you  
Every minute of the day I'm addicted to what your giving me boy  
It's killing me when it comes to love  
I'm not trying share you  
Might think I'm greedy but I just don't care  
I need you in my world cause I'm a selfish girl  
  
I understand that you got your crew  
But I've got something in mind for you  
Make you lose all track of time  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
I don't care what anybody got to say  
Maybe they never had it quite this way  
Let them talk and criticize  
They all need to recognize  
They might see I'm a bit extreme  
To need you night and day  
But what I feel can't be concealed  
There ain't no other way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Boy you got me tripping  
I didn't know what I was missing  
This is crazy (crazy)  
So amazing (so amazing)  
I didn't mean to be demanding but I hope your understanding  
I'm not playing boy (I'm not playing boy)  
I'm just saying boy  
They might see I'm a bit extreme  
To need you night and day  
But what I feel can't be concealed  
There ain't no other way  
  
Boy you got me tripping  
I didn't know what I was missing  
This is crazy (crazy)  
So amazing (so amazing)  
I didn't mean to be demanding but I hope your understanding  
I'm not playing boy (I'm not playing boy)  
I'm just saying boy  
They might see I'm a bit extreme  
To need you night and day  
But what I feel can't be concealed  
There ain't no other way
